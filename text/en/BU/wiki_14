<text>The French Broad River is a river in the U.S. states of North Carolina and Tennessee. It flows from near the town of Rosman in Transylvania County, North Carolina, into Tennessee, where its confluence with the Holston River at Knoxville forms the beginning of the Tennessee River. The river flows through the counties of Transylvania, Henderson, Buncombe, and Madison in North Carolina, and Cocke, Jefferson, Sevier, and Knox in Tennessee. It drains large portions of the Pisgah National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest.

==Course==
The headwaters of the French Broad River are near the town of Rosman in Transylvania County, North Carolina, just northwest of the Eastern Continental Divide near the northwest border of South Carolina. They spill from a waterfall called Courthouse Falls at the terminus of Courthouse Creek near Balsam Grove. The waterfall feeds into a creek that becomes the North Fork, which joins the West Fork west of Rosman. South of Rosman, the stream is joined by the Middle and East forks to form the French Broad River.

From there it flows northeast through the Appalachian Mountains into Henderson, and Buncombe counties. In Buncombe County, the river flows through Asheville where it receives the water of the Swannanoa River. Downstream of Asheville, the river passes north through Marshall and Madison County. After passing through Hot Springs in the Bald Mountains, the river enters Cocke County, Tennessee.

In Cocke County, the river passes through Del Rio and receives the waters of both the Pigeon and the Nolichucky rivers northwest of Newport. The river enters the slack waters of Douglas Lake, which was created by the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Douglas Dam in Sevier County, approximately upstream from the river&#x27;s mouth. Near Sevierville, at Kodak, the French Broad River receives the flow of the Little Pigeon River, which drains much of the Tennessee section of the Great Smoky Mountains. After flowing through a wide gap in Bays Mountain, it enters Knox County. Its confluence with the Holston River forms the Tennessee River at a place known as &quot;Forks of the River&quot;, at the eastern edge of Knoxville.

==History==
The French Broad River is believed to be one of the oldest in the world, cutting over eons through ancient rocks in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. The French Broad predates the Alleghanian orogeny, through the resulting mountains it cuts; however, the current topographic relief of the Southern Appalachians is relatively new, making it virtually impossible to estimate the age of the river.

The Cherokee people, the historic Indigenous Americans who occupied the area at the time of European invasion and conquest, referred to the river by different names: &quot;Poelico&quot; and &quot;Agiqua&quot; (&quot;broad&quot;) in the mountains of the headwaters; &quot;Zillicoah&quot; upriver of the confluence at present-day Asheville; and &quot;Tahkeeosteh&quot; (racing waters) from Asheville downriver. The river is considered to roughly mark the eastern boundary of the Cherokee homelands in this region, which included areas of present-day northwestern South Carolina, northeastern Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee. The French called the river the &quot;Agiqua&quot;, borrowing one of the Cherokee names.

Initiated as a project during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Douglas Dam was completed in the 1940s on the lower French Broad by the TVA to provide electricity and flood control. It is one of the larger TVA developments on a tributary of the Tennessee River. (The two other very large ones are Norris Lake on the Clinch River and Cherokee Lake on the Holston River.)

In 1987, the North Carolina General Assembly established the French Broad River State Trail as a blueway which follows the river for . The paddle trail is a part of the North Carolina State Trails System, which is a section of the NC Division of Parks and Recreation. A system of launch point sites was created along the river to support the trail.

The portion of the French Broad River in Tennessee was designated as a state scenic river by the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Approximately of the river in Cocke County, starting at the North Carolina border and extending downstream to the place where it flows into Douglas Lake, are designated as a ClassÂ III, Partially Developed River.

<doc id="589471" wikidata="Q1109026" url="?curid=589471" title="A Different World">
<text>A Different World is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. It aired for six seasons on NBC from September 24, 1987, to July 9, 1993. The series originally centered on Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) and the life of students at Hillman College, a fictional historically black college in Virginia. It was inspired by student life at historically black colleges and universities.

After Bonet&#x27;s departure in the first season, the remainder of the series primarily focused more on Southern belle Whitley Gilbert-Wayne, played by Jasmine Guy, and math whiz Dwayne Cleophus Wayne, played by Kadeem Hardison.

==Concept==
While it was a spin-off from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot; typically addressed issues that were avoided by &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; writers (race and class relations, sexual assault, or the Equal Rights Amendment). One episode that aired in 1990 was one of the first American network television episodes to address the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.

The original premise was to focus on a white student at a historically black university and feature Lena Horne as an acting teacher, but in production, the premise changed from being a story about a white student in a black college to a black student (Denise Huxtable) in a black college with a white friend. It was ultimately decided that Denise, who was of college age, would be spun off and have a white roommate in order to show the dynamic of a white girl in predominantly black surroundings. Meg Ryan was originally cast for this role, but she decided to pursue a film career, so Marisa Tomei was cast. 

===Season two changes===
After the first season, it came to Cosby&#x27;s and the producers&#x27; attention that the series was not accurately portraying a historically black college and life on campus, so Debbie Allen, an alumna of Howard University, was hired as the chief creative force to revamp the show. During the summer of 1988, Lisa Bonet announced that she and husband Lenny Kravitz were having a baby. Allen was in favor of having a young pregnant student in the show, but Cosby said that Lisa Bonet could be pregnant but not Denise Huxtable.

It was felt that viewers would not accept Denise as an unwed mother, having grown to know her as a &quot;good girl&quot; after four seasons of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Thus it was decided that Denise would drop out of Hillman, return home to her family, and eventually travel to Africa throughout the fifth season of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, ensuring that viewers would not see a pregnant Denise. Allen was also in favor of keeping Tomei, as she herself recalled a white student at Howard and wanted to relate that in the show and even had possible premises for her character, such as meeting Dwayne&#x27;s parents and seeing the other side of racism.

However, the network rejected this storyline and the producers released Tomei from the show, and she and Marie-Alise Recasner were replaced by Cree Summer and Charnele Brown, respectively. Darryl M. Bell and Sinbad were promoted to the principal cast, and Glynn Turman and Lou Myers were added as supporting cast members. These changes led to the placement of Whitley and Dwayne at the center of a wider ensemble.

==Episodes==

==Connections to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;==
As a show developed by Bill Cosby for a character from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot; had many connections to its parent program, even before the latter program was created. The third season finale of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, entitled &quot;Hillman&quot;, was essentially a pilot episode for the new show.

The theme song was co-written by Stu Gardner, Bill Cosby, and Dawnn Lewis â who was also a cast member. In the online interviews related to the 2006 &quot;Hillman College Reunion&quot;, Lewis revealed that her being approached to write the song and to audition were two separate events that occurred within a short time of each other, such that she thought it was a practical joke by her friends.

The spin-off program featured many appearances by characters from the parent program, especially in the initial season, in which Denise&#x27;s father Cliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby), mother Clair Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad), younger sisters Vanessa Huxtable (Tempestt Bledsoe) and Rudy Huxtable (Keshia Knight-Pulliam), brother Theodore Huxtable (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), and grandfather Russell (Earle Hyman) all appeared on the show, either at Hillman or at the other end of a phone call. Denise&#x27;s departure from Hillman after Season 1 did not stop her mother from reappearing on the show.

Three of Phylicia Rashad&#x27;s four appearances as Hillman alumna Clair Huxtable took place after season one, and in one of these, she brought her younger daughter Vanessa to tour the college. Sondra (played by Sabrina Le Beauf in the parent series) was the only Huxtable child not to appear on the show. Martin (Joseph C. Phillips) and Olivia (Raven-SymonÃ©) appear in season 3 episode &quot;Forever Hold Your Peace&quot;, along with Phylicia Rashad and Lisa Bonet. Elvin (Geoffrey Owens) and Pam (Erika Alexander) also never appeared on the show.

Producer/director Debbie Allen is the real-life sister of Phylicia Rashad. Allen made one guest appearance on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, playing an aggressive aerobics instructor who helps Clair slim down for a special occasion. Allen appeared in later seasons in a recurring role as Whitley&#x27;s psychiatrist. Dwayne and Whitley also visited the Huxtable home in an episode featuring the revelation that Denise had married and would not return to Hillman.

A young Kadeem Hardison appeared on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as one of Theo Huxtable&#x27;s friends in the first-season episode &quot;A Shirt Story&quot;, though not playing Dwayne.

Sinbad also appeared on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as a car salesman in third-season episode &quot;Say Hello to a Good Buy&quot;.

A Hillman alumna by the name of &quot;Louise Sujay&quot; was mentioned on both &quot;Cosby&quot; and &quot;A Different World&quot; by Clair Huxtable, Whitley Gilbert and her mother Marion.

Like Lisa Bonet, Karen Malina White brought her &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; character to Hillman. Charmaine was the best friend of Claire Huxtable&#x27;s cousin Pam Tucker. White&#x27;s &quot;Cosby Show&quot; costar Allen Payne turned down an offer to bring his role as Charmaine&#x27;s boyfriend Lance Rodman to &quot;A Different World&quot; as a regular during Season 6, preferring instead to pursue a movie career; he and Jada Pinkett Smith starred in the 1994 film &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;, which is considered to be a milestone in both their careers.

Payne appeared in one episode during season five in which Charmaine visits Hillman as a prospective student, bringing Lance along to see if he can gain admission as well. When Charmaine arrives at Hillman, she and Lance are maintaining a long-distance relationship and he is mentioned in multiple episodes. Lance and Charmaine later break up over the phone.

Years later, Tempestt Bledsoe (who played Vanessa on &quot;Cosby&quot;) and Darryl M. Bell (who played Ron on &quot;A Different World&quot;) became a real-life couple and co-starred on the 2009 Fox Reality Channel series &quot;Househusbands of Hollywood&quot;.

=== Hillman College ===
Hillman College is a fictional historically black college, founded in 1881 and located in the commonwealth of Virginia. The exact locality of the school is never revealed, but several geographic references are made which allude to the campus either being located somewhere in the Hampton Roads area or in the Roanoke Metropolitan Area. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Deus Nondum Te Confecit&quot;, which literally translates from Latin to: &quot;God has not yet finished you&quot;. The school colors are maroon and white. Visual shots of the Hillman campus that were used in the series were actually filmed at two real-life Black colleges, Clark Atlanta University and Spelman College, both in Atlanta, Georgia.

The first references to Hillman on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; were made during season one, when it is mentioned as the place where Cliff Huxtable and Clair Hanks went to school while they were engaged. Cliff&#x27;s father Russell is also a Hillman alumnus. The school made its first on-screen appearance in the third-season finale of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, titled &quot;Hillman&quot;, when Cliff and Clair and their family attend a Hillman commencement ceremony which also honored a retiring professor.

Monica Calhoun, who appeared as a guest star on season six episode &quot;Homey Don&#x27;t You Know Me&quot; co-starred with Patrick Y. Malone (Terrell) on Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit and with Bumper Robinson (Dorian) in the miniseries The Jacksons An American Dream.

Other notable connections:

Glynn Turman (Colonel Bradford Taylor) was once married to Aretha Franklin (who sang the theme from seasons 2-5) from 1978 to 1984.

==Home media==
Urban Works released Season 1 of &quot;A Different World&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on November 8, 2005. Several release dates for a Season 2 DVD were announced (May 2006, July 2006, and September 2006), but the DVD was never released. Urban Works was acquired by First Look Studios in early 2006. The distribution rights for the series have since reverted to the production company, Carsey-Werner Productions. FilmRise has currently made the series available on streaming services, especially Amazon Prime and Netflix.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Despite strong viewership due to its timeslot, &quot;A Different World&quot; initially received negative reviews from television critics, who found it juvenile, unrealistic, humorless, boring, and overly reliant on its parent show. The first season holds an approval rating of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews; its critical consensus reads: &quot;Relying too heavily on the success of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot; lacks the charisma of its predecessor, while managing to make the collegiate setting predictable and monotonous&quot;. Journalist Mark Harris reported that the show &quot;drew one of the most concentrated doses of critical vituperation ever to greet an instant ratings hit&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;&#x27;s Ron Weiskind said the show is &quot;at best, an average, mediocre situation comedy&quot;. Several reviewers blamed Denise&#x27;s characterization and Bonet&#x27;s performance for making the series&#x27; early episodes uninteresting. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote &quot;it doesn&#x27;t seem that Bonet is a compelling enough actress to carry a show by herself, but &quot;A Different World&quot; probably will do well because of its fortuitous time slot, and whoever said that life on television was fair?&quot;. Other reviews compared it unfavorably to &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, including the &quot;South Florida Sun Sentinel&quot;&#x27;s Bill Kelley who dismissed the show as &quot;a greed-motivated sitcom that doesn&#x27;t serve any function beyond milking a few million extra dollars from TV&#x27;s most popular comedy franchise&quot;. On the contrary, television critic Marvin Kitman admitted to having been secretly enjoying the season, praising its simplicity and the performances of Bonet and Tomei in particular. Additionally, radio personalities Howard Stern and Robin Quivers lambasted the show on their talk radio program.

Critics and journalists agree that Allen&#x27;s involvement and extensive revisions strengthened the quality of the show, and reviews improved from season two onward. Her direction was praised for incorporating elements such as dance and fashion, as well as raising awareness about topics particularly significant to the Black community. Dino-Ray Ramos of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; said the sitcom evolved into &quot;a fresh balance of comedy and drama that spoke true to the experiences of young black adults in the early-&#x27;90s&quot;. The series also drew acclaim for broaching topics rarely discussed on similar programs at the time, such as HIV, racism, and sexual and physical abuse. The sixth and final season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

===Ratings===
Critics say that &quot;A Different World&quot; benefited from airing between &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; on Thursday night. The show consistently ranked first or second among African American viewers during most of its run.

===Media reaction===
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; is quoted as stating that when Debbie Allen became the producer (and usually director) of &quot;A Different World&quot; after the first season, she transformed it &quot;from a bland &quot;Cosby&quot; spin-off into a lively, socially responsible, ensemble situation comedy.&quot;

The Museum of Broadcast Communications states that Debbie Allen:

a graduate of historically black Howard University â drew from her college experiences in an effort to accurately reflect in the show the social and political life on black campuses. Moreover, Allen instituted a yearly spring trip to Atlanta where series writers visited three of the nation&#x27;s leading black colleges, Clark Atlanta, Morehouse and Spelman. During these visits, ideas for several of the episodes emerged from meetings with students and faculty.

===Impact on African-American culture===
Because of Debbie Allen&#x27;s influence as the producer (and usually director) of &quot;A Different World&quot; after the first season, African-American youth who watched the show often cite it as a defining reason why many of them decided to attend a historically Black college or university.

==Hillman College Reunion==
In August 2006, Nick at Nite aired a week-long marathon showing episodes of &quot;A Different World&quot;. Lisa Bonet, Dawnn Lewis, Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Darryl M. Bell, Cree Summer, and Sinbad reunited for short vignettes that provided a glimpse of the current state of their characters. Nick at Nite&#x27;s &quot;Hillman College Reunion&quot; website added details beyond those shown on television.

==Sequel==
On August 23 and 24, 2012, Debbie Allen, the former chief creative force of &quot;A Different World&quot; from 1988 to 1993, wrote on Twitter that she wanted to reboot the series. Over a million people on Facebook, Twitter and blogs reacted to the tweet and approved of the potential reboot.

The original cast reunited early 2024 on &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The View&quot; to celebrate &quot;A Different World&quot;â³s ongoing impact and legacy. In February, they kicked off a 10-city tour stopping at many HBCUs to encourage student enrollment. 

On August 7, 2024, it was announced that a sequel to the series was in the works at Netflix. It would focus on characters Whitley &amp; Dwayne&#x27;s daughter that attends Hillman College. It will be a single-cam, half-hour comedy series from writer/executive producer Felicia Pride, who has worked on &quot;Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and executive producers Debbie Allen, Mandy Summers, Tom Werner, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Bythewood.

<doc id="589484" wikidata="Q7621845" url="?curid=589484" title="Strategic nomination">
<text>Strategic nomination refers to the entry of a candidate into an election with the intention of changing the ranking of other candidates. The name is an echo of âtactical votingâ and is intended to imply that it is the candidates rather than the voters who are seeking to manipulate the result in a manner unfaithful to votersâ true preferences. 

The same effect may occur even if candidates are not nominated with this thought in mind. Depending on the voting system being used, the addition of extra candidates with similar constituencies may either split away votes and hurt their combined prospects (in plurality voting systems), or it may concentrate votes in favor of the overrepresented constituencies (in positional voting systems). 

== Independence of irrelevant alternatives ==

Strategic nomination consists of manipulating a feature of voting systems which lies in their lacking the property of âindependence of irrelevant alternativesâ. Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem shows that this property is inconsistent with others with more compelling claims to acceptance, and in consequence all seriously proposed voting systems are vulnerable in principle to strategic nomination.

In the limited case in which votes are cast according to positions on a political spectrum, voting systems which satisfy the Condorcet criterion also satisfy the median voter theorem which protects them against strategic manipulation. Other voting systems remain vulnerable. An example in the Borda count article shows how that system can be subverted by nominating candidates on one side of a political spectrum.

== Independence of clones ==

In order to simplify the issue, academic attention sometimes focuses on a specific kind of strategic nomination: the kind that involves clones. Clones in this context are candidates between whom every voter is indifferent. They will be tied in every ballot if the voting system allows ties, and will otherwise be consecutive.

It is desirable for the outcome of an election to be essentially unaffected by the addition or removal of clones. Adding or removing a clone candidate should only change the winner if the old winner, the new winner, and the candidate added or removed are all clones of each other. A voting system that satisfies this criterion is considered &quot;independent of clones&quot;. Independence of clones was first formulated by Nicolaus Tideman.

== Types of strategic nomination ==
#Vote-splitting happens when adding similar or clone candidates decreases the chance of any of them winning, also known as a spoiler effect. Methods that are vulnerable to this include the plurality voting system and two-round runoff voting.
#Teaming happens when adding more candidates actually helps the chances of any of them winning, as can occur in Borda counts.
#Crowding happens when adding candidates affects the outcome of an election without either helping or harming the chances of their factional group, but instead affecting another group. This can occur in Copeland&#x27;s method.

<doc id="589488" wikidata="Q3180043" url="?curid=589488" title="Perxenate">
<text>In chemistry, perxenates are salts of the yellow xenon-containing anion . This anion has octahedral molecular geometry, as determined by Raman spectroscopy, having OâXeâO bond angles varying between 87Â° and 93Â°. The XeâO bond length was determined by X-ray crystallography to be 1.875Â Ã.

== Synthesis ==

Perxenates are synthesized by the disproportionation of xenon trioxide when dissolved in strong alkali:
:2 XeO3 () + 4 OHâ () â Xe () + () + O2 () + 2 H2O ()

When Ba(OH)2 is used as the alkali, barium perxenate can be crystallized from the resulting solution.

==Perxenic acid==

Perxenic acid is the unstable conjugate acid of the perxenate anion, formed by the solution of xenon tetroxide in water. It has not been isolated as a free acid, because under acidic conditions it rapidly decomposes into xenon trioxide and oxygen gas:

Its extrapolated formula, H4XeO6, is inferred from the octahedral geometry of the perxenate ion () in its alkali metal salts.

The p&quot;K&quot;a of aqueous perxenic acid has been indirectly calculated to be below 0, making it an extremely strong acid. Its first ionization yields the anion , which has a p&quot;K&quot;a value of 4.29, still relatively acidic. The twice deprotonated species has a p&quot;K&quot;a value of 10.81. Due to its rapid decomposition under acidic conditions as described above, however, it is most commonly known as perxenate salts, bearing the anion .

==Properties==

Perxenic acid and the anion are both strong oxidizing agents, capable of oxidising silver(I), copper (II) and manganese(II) to (respectively) silver(III), copper(III), and permanganate. The perxenate anion is unstable in acidic solutions, being almost instantaneously reduced to .

The sodium, potassium, and barium salts are soluble. Barium perxenate solution is used as the starting material for the synthesis of xenon tetroxide (XeO4) by mixing it with concentrated sulfuric acid:
: Ba2XeO6 (s) + 2 H2SO4 (l) â XeO4 (g) + 2 BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

Most metal perxenates are stable, except silver perxenate, which decomposes violently.

==Applications==
Sodium perxenate, Na4XeO6, can be used for the analytic separation of trace amounts of americium from curium. The separation involves the oxidation of Am3+ to Am4+ by sodium perxenate in acidic solution in the presence of La3+, followed by treatment with calcium fluoride, which forms insoluble fluorides with Cm3+ and La3+, but retains Am4+ and Pu4+ in solution as soluble fluorides.

<doc id="589491" wikidata="Q7877786" url="?curid=589491" title="Ugly American (pejorative)">
<text>&quot;Ugly American&quot; is a stereotype depicting American citizens as exhibiting loud, arrogant, self-absorbed, demeaning, thoughtless, ignorant, and ethnocentric behavior mainly abroad, but also at home. Although the term is usually associated with or applied to travelers and tourists, it also applies to U.S. corporate businesses in the international arena.

The Collins English Dictionary defines an Ugly American as &quot;a stereotypical representation of an American tourist as a brash and insensitive philistine.&quot; The Merriam-Webster dictionaryâs definition is: &quot;an American in a foreign country whose behavior is offensive to the people of that country.&quot;

== Origin ==
The term made its appearance through the title of the 1958 book, &quot;The Ugly American&quot;. The book was a thinly fictionalized chronicle of American diplomatic insensitivity, ineptness, and bungling in Southeast Asia. The message of the book was that Americans officials abroad were ignorant of local customs, social norms, and culture, and thereby losing influence to communism in the region, during the period of the Cold War. 

Since then, &quot;ugly American&quot; became a term for the stereotype of loud, boorish American behavior abroad. Although the 1958 novel made was about diplomacy and made no reference to American tourists, the alteration of the termâs meaning to refer to ill-mannered Americans took place rapidly. In December 1959, Newsweek referred to &quot;poorly oriented&quot; American study-abroad students in Europe as &quot;the &#x27;ugly&#x27; ones,&quot; and in June 1960, the mass-circulation Parade magazine ran an article about tourism titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Be an Ugly American,&quot; written by Frances Knight, director of the U.S. Passport Office.

==Usage==

===Sports===
The term has also been widely used in the international sporting arena. The term was invoked 
after Justin Leonard holed a 45-foot putt on the 17th green at the 33rd Ryder Cup held in September 1999, resulting in extensive and adverse media coverage.

Later, at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the term was widely used after members of the US 4 Ã 100 relay team pranced around the stadium, flexing their muscles and making poses with the American flag, after winning a gold medal. One foreign journalist called the incident &quot;one of the most cringe-making exhibitions that the Olympics has seen&quot;. This event was heavily criticized even by the American press and public. The members of the relay team were contrite and apologized for the incident the same day. Then, at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, the term was regularly used after the skiing superstar Bode Miller, who bragged about skiing drunk before the Olympics, was adversely compared to the term &quot;Miller time&quot;, and went home with no medals. A lesser-known teammate was sent home for fighting in a bar.

In tennis, the term was used in regard to players at the 1987 Davis Cup for unsportsmanlike conduct. John McEnroe was regularly cited in the media as being an &quot;Ugly American&quot; for his on-court tantrums and off-court negative comments about London and Paris. In contrast, Andre Agassi who early in his tennis career was labeled a &quot;potential ugly American&quot;, managed to transform himself into a crowd favourite. In women&#x27;s tennis, Serena Williams&#x27;s outburst at the 2009 US Open semifinal against Kim Clijsters, and again at the 2018 tournament reiterated the &quot;Ugly American&quot; label.

After the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team lost to Sweden in the quarterfinals of women&#x27;s football of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil, Hope Solo called the Swedish team cowards unleashing multiple Twitter references associating her with this term. At the same Olympics, Gold medalist Ryan Lochte was named the ugly American by media outlets after falsely reporting a robbery at gunpoint during the tournament. Local police investigation showed that he and fellow swimmers in fact caused damage to a petrol station in Rio and were required to pay for the damage.

===Politics===

In May 2008, the US House sub-committee passed a bill (House Resolution 4080) that would allow more foreign fashion models to work in the United States, and was subsequently dubbed the &quot;ugly American bill&quot;. George W. Bush was often referred to as &quot;The Ugly American&quot; in part because of his stance on foreign policies. In 2007, Presidential hopeful John McCain outlined a series of measures to roll back Bush policies and counter the &quot;ugly American&quot; image. Numerous opinion pieces have accused President Donald Trump of behaving in a way that fits the âUgly Americanâ stereotype, including in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

===Popular culture===
The &quot;ugly American&quot; tourist stereotype has been heavily depicted in films, with characters such as Sheriff J.W. Pepper in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, the Griswald family in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, and Ralph Jones in &quot;King Ralph&quot;. The 2004 film &quot;EuroTrip&quot; was originally slated to be named &quot;The Ugly Americans&quot; due to its depiction of stereotypical American tourists in Europe. The producers changed the title shortly before its release. A study carried out in 2002 revealed that Hollywood also contributes to the &quot;Ugly American&quot; image. The study found that the more access other countries had to American programs, the higher their negative attitudes toward Americans tended to be.

The 2008 black comedy film &quot;In Bruges&quot; has the two protagonists, Irish hitmen hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges, encounter obese American tourists who fit the &quot;ugly American&quot; stereotype, being crude, ignorant, loud and boorish. The movie &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; has been cited as a typical portrayal of the &quot;ugly American&quot; image, where Samantha makes fun of Middle Eastern culture and women in traditional dress during a visit to the United Arab Emirates.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Regina Monologues&quot; had the Simpson family getting into all sorts of trouble in England due to their boorish behavior, which results from ignorance of and unconcern for the local culture.

<text>Andrew George Blair (March 7, 1844 â January 25, 1907) was a Canadian politician in New Brunswick, Canada. He served as the seventh 
premier of New Brunswick for 13 years and 136 days, the second-longest tenure in the province&#x27;s history, behind Richard Hatfield&#x27;s tenure of 16 years and 310 days.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1878 after unsuccessful attempts in the previous two elections. Though Blair was a supporter of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s federal Liberal-Conservatives, he joined the parliamentary opposition in the legislature and, in 1879, became leader of the opposition to the Conservative government of Premier John James Fraser. He molded the disparate opposition into the modern Liberal Party of New Brunswick, instituting party platforms or manifestos. He launched the first province-wide political campaign in an era when campaign had been run largely on a constituency basis. He took the party to power in 1883, winning enough support in the newly elected legislature to form a government. Blair became premier and Attorney-General.

Blair&#x27;s government built a three-quarters of a mile long bridge across the Saint John River, linking Fredericton with villages and factories, notably that of Boss Gibson, on the other side of the river, in spite of opposition by the federal government, which maintained that it was beyond provincial power to do so. His government also went to court to win the right to grant liquor licenses. He also extended the franchise, which had been exclusively male, to widows and unmarried women who owned property. He was opposed, however, to universal female suffrage. His government also abolished the Legislative Council (the legislature&#x27;s Upper House).

The Liberal government almost lost the 1889 election but was able to stay in power with the support of independent Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Blair lost his own seat in the 1892 election, due to Protestant opposition to his policy of accommodating Acadians and other Catholics. Blair had appointed several Acadians and other Catholics to his cabinet and other government positions. Blair was able to re-enter the house through a by-election.

After leading his party to a major electoral victory in 1895, Blair left provincial politics in 1896 when he was appointed Minister of Railways and Canals in the federal Cabinet of Liberal Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier. He was sworn in as Minister of Railways and Canals on 13 July 1896, entered the House of Commons of Canada in an August 1896 by-election for Sunbury and Queens riding, and was re-elected in the 1900 election.

In December 1901, Blair&#x27;s daughter Bessie drowned while skating on the ill-frozen Ottawa River at a party put on by the Governor-General; Henry Harper dove in to try to rescue her, but drowned as well. His actions are remembered by the statue on Parliament Hill to Sir Galahad.

Blair notified the government of his resignation on 13 July 1903; in his speech on 16 July he outlined his reasons for his opposition to Laurier&#x27;s plan to build the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The official New Brunswick biography has the date of his resignation 20 July. He spoke about the reason for his resignation for five hours in the House of Commons on 11 August. He did not see why the government &quot;should build and own the lean section . . . and provide a company with government credit to enable them to build and operate the fat section,&quot; and referred to discussions about the railway that Wilfrid Laurier had had with other ministers behind his back, although he was the Minister charged with the portfolio. He further stated that other Ministers had been allowed to discuss with Grand Trunk officers plans for the transcontinental without informing him.

In order to prevent him from becoming a major opposition figure, Laurier appointed Blair to head the Board of Railway Commissioners in December 1903, taking Blair out of active politics and out of the House of Commons. However, Blair resigned from the Board sixteen days before the 1904 election in order to campaign against Laurier. He withdrew from the campaign, however, after discussions with Laurier.

== Personal life and death ==
Blair died on January 25, 1907, of a heart attack during a dinner party in Fredericton, New Brunswick. He was buried in the Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa, Ontario.

One of Blair&#x27;s grandsons, Andrew Brewin, served as a member of Parliament for the New Democratic Party.

<doc id="589503" wikidata="Q411822" url="?curid=589503" title="Xenon tetroxide">
<text>Xenon tetroxide is a chemical compound of xenon and oxygen with molecular formula XeO4, remarkable for being a relatively stable compound of a noble gas. It is a yellow crystalline solid that is stable below â35.9Â Â°C; above that temperature it is very prone to exploding and decomposing into elemental xenon and oxygen (O2).

All eight valence electrons of xenon are involved in the bonds with the oxygen, and the oxidation state of the xenon atom is +8. Oxygen is the only element that can bring xenon up to its highest oxidation state; even fluorine can only give XeF6 (+6).

Two other short-lived xenon compounds with an oxidation state of +8, XeO3F2 and XeO2F4, are accessible by the reaction of xenon tetroxide with xenon hexafluoride. XeO3F2 and XeO2F4 can be detected with mass spectrometry. The perxenates are also compounds where xenon has the +8 oxidation state.

==Reactions==
At temperatures above â35.9Â Â°C, xenon tetroxide is very prone to explosion, decomposing into xenon and oxygen gases with Î&quot;H&quot; = â643Â kJ/mol:

:XeO4 â Xe + 2 O2

Xenon tetroxide dissolves in water to form perxenic acid and in alkalis to form perxenate salts:

:XeO4 + 2 H2O â H4XeO6
:XeO4 + 4 NaOH â Na4XeO6 + 2 H2O

Xenon tetroxide can also react with xenon hexafluoride to give xenon oxyfluorides:

:XeO4 + XeF6 â XeOF4 + XeO3F2
:XeO4 + 2XeF6 â XeO2F4 + 2 XeOF4

==Synthesis==
All syntheses start from the perxenates, which are accessible from the xenates through two methods. One is the disproportionation of xenates to perxenates and xenon:
: 2 + 2 OHâ â + Xe + O2 + 2 H2O

The other is oxidation of the xenates with ozone in basic solution:

: + O3 + 3 OHâ â + O2 + 2 H2O

Barium perxenate is reacted with sulfuric acid and the unstable perxenic acid is dehydrated to give xenon tetroxide:

: + 2 â 2 + 
: â 2 + 

Any excess perxenic acid slowly undergoes a decomposition reaction to xenic acid and oxygen:

: 2 â + 2 + 2

<doc id="589513" wikidata="Q3382075" url="?curid=589513" title="Phytophthora ramorum">
<text>Phytophthora ramorum is the oomycete known to cause the disease sudden oak death (SOD). The disease kills oak and other species of trees and has had devastating effects on the oak populations in California and Oregon, as well as being present in Europe. Symptoms include bleeding cankers on the tree&#x27;s trunk and dieback of the foliage, in many cases leading to the death of the tree.

&quot;P. ramorum&quot; also infects a great number of other plant species, significantly woody ornamentals such as &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;Viburnum&quot;, and &quot;Pieris&quot;, causing foliar symptoms known as ramorum dieback or ramorum blight. Such plants can act as a source of inoculum for new infections, with the pathogen producing spores that can be transmitted by rainsplash and rainwater.

&quot;P. ramorum&quot; was first reported in 1995, and the origins of the pathogen are still unclear, but most evidence suggests it was introduced as an exotic species to Europe and North America in separate events. Very few control mechanisms exist for the disease, and they rely upon early detection and proper disposal of infected plant material.

==Presence==
The disease is known to exist in California&#x27;s coastal region between Big Sur (in Monterey County) and southern Humboldt County. It is confirmed to exist in all coastal counties in this range, as well as in all immediately inland counties from Santa Clara County north to Lake County. It has not been found east of the California Coast Ranges, however. It was reported in Curry County, Oregon, just north of the California stateline, in 2001. Sonoma County has been hit hardest, having more than twice the area of new mortality of any other county in California.

About the same time, a similar disease in continental Europe and the UK was also identified as &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;.

==Hosts and symptoms==
===In North America===

It was first discovered in California in 1995 when large numbers of tanoaks (&quot;Notholithocarpus densiflorus&quot;) died mysteriously, and was described as a new species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; in 2000. It has subsequently been found in many other areas, including some other U.S. states, Britain, and Germany, either accidentally introduced in nursery stock, or already present undetected.

In tanoaks, the disease is recognized by wilting new shoots, older leaves becoming pale green, and after a period of two to three weeks, foliage turning brown while clinging to the branches. Dark brown sap stains the lower trunk&#x27;s bark. Bark often splits and exudes gum, with visible discoloration. After the tree dies back, suckers try to sprout the next year, but their tips soon bend and die. Ambrosia beetles (&quot;Monarthrum scutellare&quot;) will most likely infest a dying tree during midsummer, producing piles of fine white dust near tiny holes. Later, bark beetles (&quot;Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis&quot;) produce fine, red boring dust. Small black domes, the fruiting bodies of the &quot;Hypoxylon&quot; fungus, often are present on the bark. Leaf death occurs more than a year after the initial infection and months after the tree has been girdled by beetles. 

In coast live oaks and Californian black oaks, the first symptom is a burgundy-red to tar-black thick sap bleeding from the bark surface. These are often referred to as bleeding cankers.

In addition to oaks, many other forest species may be hosts for the disease; in fact, it was observed in the United States that nearly all woody plants in some Californian forests were susceptible to &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. including rhododendron, madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;), evergreen huckleberry (&quot;Vaccinium ovatum&quot;), California bay laurel (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;), buckeye (&quot;Aesculus californica&quot;), bigleaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;), toyon (&quot;Heteromeles arbutifolia&quot;), manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos spp.&quot;), coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), coffeeberry (&quot;Rhamnus californica&quot;), honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera hispidula&quot;), and Shreve oak (&quot;Quercus parvula&quot;). &quot;P. ramorum&quot; more commonly causes a less severe disease known as ramorum dieback/leaf blight on these hosts. Characteristic symptoms are dark spots on foliage and in some hosts the dieback of the stems and twigs. The disease is capable of killing some hosts, such as rhododendron, but most survive. Disease progression on these species is not well documented. Redwoods symptoms show purple lesions on sprouts and needle discoloration and cankers on small branches, which can lead to sprout mortality.

The primary symptom of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; on &quot;Rhododendron&quot; are leaf spots that expand into lesions. The lesions pierce through the plant tissue so that the spots are the same on both the top and bottom of the leaf. The lesions are usually triangular in shape and extend along the midvein. They can appear anywhere water collects on the surface of the leaf. Leaf spots have diffused margins and can appear water soaked. In severe cases, the entire host plant can die.

===In Europe===

In Europe, ramorum blight was first observed on &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and &quot;Viburnum&quot; in the early 1990s, where it was initially found mainly on container-grown plants in nurseries. The principal symptoms were leaf and twig blight. By 2007, it had spread throughout nurseries and retail centers in 16 European countries, and had been detected in gardens, parks, and woodlands in at least eight countries. It has not caused significant harm to European oak species.

In 2009, the pathogen was found to be infecting and killing large numbers of Japanese larch trees (&quot;Larix kaempferi&quot;) in the United Kingdom at sites in the English counties of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. It was the first time in the world that &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot; had been found infecting this species. Since then, it has also been found extensively in larch plantations in Wales and in southwest Scotland, which led to harvesting of larch on hundreds of acres/hectares. The UK Forestry Commission noted that eradication of the disease would not be possible, and instead adopted a strategy of containing the disease to reduce its spread. Symptoms of the disease on larch trees include dieback of the tree&#x27;s crown and branches, and a distinctive yellowing or ginger colour beneath the bark. In August 2010, the disease was found in Japanese larch trees in counties Waterford and Tipperary in Ireland. It had spread to Japanese larch plantations across the south of the country by February 2014. Coillte, who owned twenty forests where the disease was present, felled 16,000 trees in one of its forests, having already felled 150 hectares to contain the disease. In 2023 the disease was found to be infecting larch trees at Wyming Brook, Sheffield, with plans to fell over 1,000 trees to contain the spread of the infection.

The closely related &quot;Phytophthora kernoviae&quot; causes similar symptoms to &quot;P. ramorum&quot;, but infects the European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;).

=== Disease cycle ===
The primary inoculum (sporangia) of &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. develop on the leaves of the primary host, which include tree species like the California bay laurel, a large hardwood tree that grows on the pacific west coast. These spores are then carried by rain and air currents to the leaves of the new bole canker host, which include broadleaf trees like tanoaks, where they begin to develop. The secondary inoculum infects the inner bark and sapwood, resulting in bleeding cankers on the bark of the new host, which are exacerbated by infected fallen leaves and rain splashing the understory of the canker host which can both serve as sources of inoculum. After the plant matter it infects dies and decomposes, &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is transferred to the soil by rainwater, where the final part of its cycle (soil phase) is poorly understood by scientists. However, it is suspected that chlamydospores play a role in the long-term survival of the pathogen, yet the triggers for germination are not known. Additionally, the spores of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; only seem to propagate successfully in a temperature range between , which is useful to know for protecting nurseries and identifying potential transfer windows for the disease.

==Transmission==
&quot;P. ramorum&quot; produces both resting spores (chlamydospores) and zoospores, which have flagella enabling swimming. &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is spread by air; one of the major mechanisms of dispersal is rainwater splashing spores onto other susceptible plants, and into watercourses to be carried for greater distances. Chlamydospores can withstand harsh conditions and are able to overwinter. The pathogen will take advantage of wounding, but it is not necessary for infection to occur.

As mentioned above, &quot;P. ramorum&quot; does not kill every plant that can be used as a host, and these plants are most important in the epidemiology of the disease as they act as sources of . In California, California bay laurel (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;) seems to be the main source of inoculum. Green waste, such as leaf litter and tree stumps, are also capable of supporting &quot;P. ramorum&quot; as a saprotroph and acting as a source of inoculum. Because &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is able to infect many ornamental plants, it can be transmitted by ornamental plant movement.

In nursery settings, &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is dispersed mostly between adjacent, touching plants and exposure to infested surface water.Â  Long-distance dispersal is enabled by shipments of infected nursery plants, which is likely the cause for introduction into Europe and North America.

Hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders, and other people engaged in various outdoor activities may also unwittingly move the pathogen into areas where it was not previously present. Those travelling in an area known to be infested with SOD can help prevent the spread of the disease by cleaning their (and their animals&#x27;) feet, tires, tools, camping equipment, etc. before returning home or entering another uninfected area, especially if they have been in muddy soil. Additionally, the movement of firewood could introduce sudden oak death to otherwise uninfected areas. Both homeowners and travelers are advised to buy and burn local firewood.

Transmission of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; may also occur through movement of propagules on the exterior of some animals, such as migratory birds, snails, and slugs.

==The two mating types==
&quot;P. ramorum&quot; is heterothallic and has two mating types, A1 and A2, required for sexual reproduction. The European population is predominantly A1 while both mating types A1 and A2 are found in North America. Genetics of the two isolates indicate that they are reproductively isolated. On average, the A1 mating type is more virulent than the A2 mating type, but more variation occurs in the pathogenicity of A2 isolates. It is currently not clear whether this pathogen can reproduce sexually in nature and genetic work has suggested that the lineages of the two mating types might be isolated reproductively or geographically given the evolutionary divergence observed. One study conducted in 2010 investigated the sexual reproduction capacity of this pathogen by pairing between the EU1 A1 type and both European and American A2 types. Plugs of tomato juice agarose containing actively growing &quot;P. ramorum&quot; cultures of different types on carrot agar and incubated in the dark at 20 Celsius. Resultant oospores were isolated, cleaned, and stained with tetrazolium dye in the MTT assay. Purple oospores were counted as dormant whereas clear, blue, or black were considered non-viable. Some of the purple spores had abnormal morphologies, however. Normal morphology includes a nucleus, a double wall, and an ooplast. After a 60-day maturation period, no germination of the dormant oospores was observed. After a 110-day incubation period, &gt;0.5% of oospores germinated. Longer germination times only marginally increased germination rate. Progeny obtained from the oospores were diverse, with some being homothallic and others being of either A1 or A2 types. Pathogenicity of progeny was likewise variable. Since the discovery of the origin of this pathogen in East Asian laurel forests near Yunnan province and in southwestern Japan, more types of this pathogen have been characterized, such as Indochinese (IC) and Japanese (NP) phenotypes based on colony morphology on agar. However, it appears that there are still only two viable mating types, A1 and A2, with one isolate from the Indochinese group failing to respond to any attempts at inducing mating, leading it to be characterized as &quot;A0&quot;, a non-responder. A1 and A2 types were isolated from both Japan and the Yunnan/Vietnam border. Resultant gametangia were sparse. Mean oospore diameter was 26.1 micrometers. Of those oospores that were created, 81.5% of IC1 and IC2 offspring had normal morphology. 18.5% were obviously aborted. For NP1xNP2 gametangia were too sparse to determine abortion rates, but it was very high. Overall, it seems that &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is capable of sexual reproduction but it is very inefficient, even among the source population.

==Possible origins==
&quot;P. ramorum&quot; is a relatively new disease, and several debates have occurred about where it may have originated or how it evolved. One of the major reasons that identifying the natural range of this organism is difficult is that it typically will not cause symptomatic or infectious disease in hosts that are adapted to live in concert with it naturally. It is only when this organism leaks into vulnerable habitat with less resistant host species that a notable amount of destruction occurs.

In 2021, research came out revealing that the origins of this pathogen are subtropical laurisilva forests in East Asia, specifically the area near the border of Vietnam and Yunnan, China, as well as southwestern Japan. 505 &quot;Phytophthora&quot; cultures were obtained from leaves in Fansipan and Sau Chua mountain streams; of these, 64 samples from 7 streams (6 from Fansipan and 1 from Sau Chua) were identified as &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. On the Japanese islands of Shikoku and Kyushu, 17 stream catchments were sampled, giving 597 &quot;Phytophthora&quot; cultures; of these, 3 from Shikoku and 4 from Kyushu were identified as &quot;P. ramorum.&quot; In addition to the EU and NA types, researchers identified by colony morphology on carrot agar two new phenotype groups: Indochinese and Japanese. In a high temperature/low water stress test, NA2 and EU2 were highly tolerant, and NA1 and EU1 had no growth. Indochinese (IC) and Japanese (NP) phenotype colonies had highly variable responses, indicating multiple genotypes within each phenotypic grouping. In a mating test, it was discovered that 89% of isolates were of the A1 mating type; only 11% were of type A2. A pairing of two Indochinese types IC1 and IC2 resulted in formation of oospores similar to that observed between known lineages of different type. Lineage IC1 is thought to have given rise to the EU1 group. NP1 is ancestral to NP2 and sister to EU2. NA2 is ancestral to NA1. The level of diversity in the East Asian samples compared to the diversity in the four lineages known previously supports the hypothesis that this is the geographic center of origin of &quot;Phytophthora ramorum.&quot; Furthermore, no symptomatic vegetation was observed. The presence of other &quot;Phytophthora spp.&quot; including &quot;P. foliorum&quot; and &quot;P. lateralis&quot; in southwestern Japan suggests that this might be the origin of a clade of related species labelled as clade 8c.

===Introduction as an exotic species===
&quot;P. ramorum&quot; is an introduced species, and these introductions occurred separately for the European and North American populations, hence why only one mating type exists on each continentÂ â this is called a founder effect. The differences between the two populations are thus caused by adaptation to separate climates. Evidence includes little genetic variability, as &quot;P. ramorum&quot; has not had time to diversify since being introduced. Existing variability may be explained by multiple introductions with a few individuals adapting best to their respective environments. The behavior of the pathogen in California is also indicative of being introduced; it is assumed that such a high mortality rate of trees would have been noticed sooner if &quot;P. ramorum&quot; were native.

===Hybridization events===
Species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; have been shown to have evolved by the interspecific hybridization of two different species from the genus. When a species is introduced into a new environment, it causes episodic selection. The invading species is exposed to other resident taxa, and hybridization may occur to produce a new species. If these hybrids are successful, they may outcompete their parent species. Thus, &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is possibly a hybrid between two species. Nevertheless, the draft genome of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; did not show any evidence of recent hybridization.

==Ecological impacts==
In relation to human ecology, the loss of tanoak as the pathogen spreads to culturally sensitive Native American lands represents a loss of tanoak acorns as one of the most important traditional and ceremonial foods still used in Northern California such as among Yurok people, Hupa, Miwok, and Karuk peoples. Similar impact applies to the decline of other native plant species that are traditional food sources in tanoak and oak regimens infected by the pathogen.

In forest ecology, the pathogen contributes to loss of environmental services provided by diversity of plant species and interdependent wildlife.

The mortality caused by this emerging disease is expected to cause many indirect effects. Several predictions of long-term impacts have been discussed in the scientific literature. While such predictions are necessarily speculative, indirect impacts occurring on shorter time scales have been documented in a few cases. For instance, one study demonstrated that redwood trees (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) grew faster after neighboring tanoaks were killed by sudden oak death. Other studies have combined current observations and reconstruction/projection techniques to document short-term impacts while also inferring future conditions. One study used this approach to investigate the effects of SOD on the structural characteristics of redwood forests.

Additional long-term impacts of SOD may be inferred from regeneration patterns in areas that have experienced severe mortality. These patterns may indicate which tree species will replace tanoak in diseased areas. Such transitions will be of particular importance in forest types that were relatively poor in tree species diversity before the introduction of SOD, e.g., redwood forest. , the only study to comprehensively examine regeneration in SOD-impacted redwood forests found no evidence that other broadleaf tree species are seeding in. Instead, redwood was colonizing most mortality gaps. However, they also found inadequate regeneration in some areas and concluded that regeneration is continuing. Since this study only considered one site in Marin County, California, these results may not apply to other forests. Other impacts to the local ecology include, among others, the residual effects of spraying heavy pesticides (Agrifos) to treat SOD symptoms, and the heavy mortality of the native pollinator community that occurs as a result. Bee hives situated in areas of heavy Agrifos spraying have incurred significant losses of population in direct correlation to the application of these chemicals. Counties such as Napa and Sonoma may be doing significant damage to their native pollinator populations by virtue of adopting broad-based prophylactic pesticide policies. Such damage to the pollinator populations may have tertiary negative effects on the entire local plant community, compounding the loss of biodiversity, and thus environmental value, attributable to SOD.

=== Environmental and economic impact ===
Besides the quick and significant loss of symbiotic host species, since sudden oak death is classified as a stem-girdling disease, which is proven to cause a massive reduction in mycorrhizae soil biomass, the amount of phosphorus and micronutrients that mycorrhizae are able to absorb is greatly reduced in soils occupied by trees with SOD. Another significant environmental impact of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is its tendency to result in large deposits of dry, woody debris in areas prone to forest fires, making them even more difficult to contain. Indeed, hotspots of SOD are &quot;unmanageable&quot; for fire crews, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that SOD plays a large role in a forest&#x27;s susceptibility to fire. On the other side of the spectrum are the significant economic impacts of &quot;P. ramorum&quot;, which are difficult to assess, but the most obvious of which is the reduction to property values of real estate containing oak trees, as oaks in particular tend to raise the property value of the plots they inhabit. Additionally, several U.S. industries have suffered due to the spread of SOD, including the ornamental plant, spice, and composting industries, especially in the state of California.

==Control==

===Early detection===
Early detection of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; is essential for its control. On an individual-tree basis, preventive treatments, which are more effective than therapeutic treatments, depend on knowledge of the pathogen&#x27;s movement through the landscape to know when it is nearing prized trees. On the landscape level, &quot;P. ramorum&#x27;s&quot; fast and often undetectable movement means that any treatment hoping to slow its spread must happen very early in the development of an infestation. Since &quot;P. ramorum&#x27;s&quot; discovery, researchers have been working on the development of early detection methods on scales ranging from diagnosis in individual infected plants to landscape-level detection efforts involving large numbers of people.

Detecting the presence of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species requires laboratory confirmation. The traditional method of culturing is on a growth medium selective against fungi (and, in some cases, against other oomycetes such as &quot;Pythium&quot; species). Host material is removed from the leading edge of a plant tissue canker caused by the pathogen; resulting growth is examined under a microscope to confirm the unique morphology of &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. Successful isolation of the pathogen often depends on the type of host tissue and the time of year that detection is attempted.

Because of these difficulties, researchers have developed some other approaches for identifying &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test can be the first step in nonculture methods of identifying &quot;P. ramorum&quot;, but it can only be a first step, because it detects the presence of proteins that are produced by all &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species. In other words, it can identify to the genus level, but not to the species level. ELISA tests can process large numbers of samples at once, so researchers often use it to screen out likely positive samples from those that are not when the total number of samples is very large. Some manufacturers produce small-scale ELISA &quot;field kits&quot; that the homeowner can use to determine if plant tissue is infected by &quot;Phytophthora&quot;.

Researchers have also developed numerous molecular techniques for &quot;P. ramorum&quot; identification. These include amplifying DNA sequences in the internal transcribed spacer region of the &quot;P. ramorum&quot; genome (ITS polymerase chain reaction, or ITS PCR); real-time PCR, in which DNA abundance is measured in real time during the PCR reaction, using dyes or probes such as SBYR-Green or TaqMan; multiplex PCR, which amplifies more than one region of DNA at the same time; and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), which uses the ITS DNA sequence amplified by the PCR reaction to differentiate &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species according to their differential movement through a gel.

Additionally, researchers have begun using features of the DNA sequence of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; to pinpoint the minuscule differences of separate &quot;P. ramorum&quot; isolates from each other. Two techniques for doing this are amplified fragment length polymorphism, which through comparing differences between various fragments in the sequence has enabled researchers to differentiate correctly between EU and U.S. isolates, and the examination of microsatellites, which are areas on the sequence featuring repeating base pairs. When &quot;P. ramorum&quot; propagules arrive in a new geographic location and establish colonies, these microsatellites begin to display mutation in a relatively short time, and they mutate in a stepwise fashion. Based on this, researchers in California have been able to construct trees, based on microsatellite analyses of isolates collected from around the state, that trace the movement of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; from two likely initial points of establishment in Marin and Santa Cruz Counties and out to subsequent points.

Early detection of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; on a landscape scale begins with the observation of symptoms on individual plants (and/or detecting &quot;P. ramorum&quot; propagules in watercourses; see below). Systematic ground-based monitoring has been difficult within the range of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; because most infected trees stand on a complex mosaic of lands with various ownerships. In some areas, targeted ground-based surveys have been conducted in areas of heavy recreation or visitor use such as parks, trailheads, and boat ramps. In California, when conducting ground-based detection, looking for symptoms on bay laurel is the most effective strategy, since &quot;P. ramorum&quot; infection of true oaks and tanoaks is almost always highly associated with bay laurel, the main epidemiological springboard for the pathogen. Moreover, on many sites in California (though not all), &quot;P. ramorum&quot; can typically be detected from infected bay laurel tissues via culturing techniques year-round; this is not the case for most other hosts, nor is it the case in Oregon, where tanoak is the most reliable host.

As part of a nationwide USDA program, a ground-based detection survey was implemented from 2003 to 2006 in 39 U.S. states to determine whether the pathogen was established outside the West Coast areas already known to be infested. Sampling areas were stratified by environmental variables likely to be conducive to pathogen growth and by proximity to possible points of introduction such as nurseries. Samples were collected along transects established in potentially susceptible forests or outside the perimeters of nurseries. The only positive samples were collected in California, confirming that &quot;P. ramorum&quot; was not yet established in the environment outside the West Coast.

Aerial surveying has proven useful for detection of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; infestations across large landscapes, although it is not as &quot;early&quot; a technique as some others because it depends on spotting dead tanoak crowns from fixed-wing aircraft. Sophisticated GPS and sketch-mapping technology enable spotters to mark the locations of dead trees so that ground crews can return to the area to sample from nearby vegetation.

Detection of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in watercourses has emerged as the earliest of early detection methods. This technique employs pear or rhododendron baits suspended in the watercourse using ropes, buckets, mesh bags, or other similar devices. If plants in the watershed are infected with &quot;P. ramorum&quot;, zoospores of the pathogen (as well as other &quot;Phytophthora&quot; spp.) are likely present in adjacent waterways. Under conducive weather conditions, the zoospores are attracted to the baits and infect them, causing lesions that can be isolated to culture the pathogen or analyzed via PCR assay. This method has detected &quot;P. ramorum&quot; at scales ranging from small, intermittent seasonal drainages to the Garcia, Chetco, and South Fork Eel Rivers in California and Oregon (144, 352, and 689Â mi2 drainage areas, respectively). It can detect the existence of infected plants in watersheds before any mortality from the infections becomes evident. Of course, it cannot detect the exact locations of those infected plants: at the first sign of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; propagules in the stream, crews must scour the watershed using all available means to find symptomatic vegetation.

A less technical means of detecting &quot;P. ramorum&quot; at the landscape level involves engaging local landowners across the landscape in the search. Many local county agriculture departments and University of California Cooperative Extension offices in California have been able to keep track of the distribution of the pathogen in their regions through reports and samples brought to them by the public. In 2008, the Garbelotto Laboratory at University of California, Berkeley, along with local collaborators, hosted a series of educational events, called &quot;SOD Blitzes&quot;, designed to give local landowners basic information about &quot;P. ramorum&quot; and how to identify its symptoms; each participant was provided with a sampling kit, sampled a certain number of trees on his or her property, and returned the samples to the lab for analysis. This kind of citizen science hopefully can help generate an improved map of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; distribution in the areas where the workshops are held.

=== Management in agriculture ===
Since U.S. regulators in 2004 discovered that &quot;P. ramorum&quot; had spread nationwide to a number of hosts, proactive inspections of agricultural shipments have been shown to help reduce the risk of infestations of sudden oak death. Moreover, the USDA&#x27;s APHIS specifically plans to stop the spread of SOD by continuing their public outreach program and by passing regulations on the transfer of agricultural products that might be a disease vector for &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. Indeed, in Oregon and California, the USDA has successfully regulated the stock of potential host plants at nurseries to &quot;starve&quot; the disease of potential plant hosts. Furthermore, when managing it in nurseries, it is important to consider that nursery personnel are often required to visit sites in the field such as greenhouses, fields, and other nurseries. Therefore, a number of biosecurity measures must be taken to ensure that SOD is not unintentionally transferred to one&#x27;s nursery, including driving vehicles only on paved, concrete, or gravel areas at inspection sites in order avoid contact with soil organic matter that could pose as a potential disease vector.

===Wildland management===
The course that &quot;P. ramorum&quot; management should take depends on a number of factors, including the scale of the landscape upon which one hopes to manage it. Management of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; has been undertaken at the landscape/ regional level in Oregon in the form of a campaign to completely eradicate the pathogen from the forests in which it has been found (mostly private, but also USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management ownership). The eradication campaign involves vigorous early detection by airplane and watercourse monitoring, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) and Oregon Department of Agriculture-led quarantine to prevent movement of host materials out of the area where infected trees are found, and immediate removal of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; host vegetation, symptomatic or not, within a buffer around each infected tree.

The Oregon eradication effort, which began near the town of Brookings in southwest Oregon in 2001, has adapted its management efforts over the years in response to new information about &quot;P. ramorum&quot;. For example, after inoculation trials of various tree species more clearly delineated which hosts are susceptible, the Oregon cooperators began leaving nonhost species such as Douglas fir and red alder on site. In another example, after finding that a small percentage of tanoak stumps that were resprouting on the host removal sites were infected with the pathogenâwhether these infections were systemic or reached the sprouts from the surrounding environment is unknownâthe cooperators began pretreating trees with very small, targeted amounts of herbicide to kill the root systems of infected tanoaks before cutting them down. The effort has been successful in that while it has not yet completely eradicated the pathogen from Oregon forests, the epidemic in Oregon has not taken the explosive course that it has in California forests.

California, though, faces significant obstacles that preclude it from mounting the same kind of eradication effort. For one thing, the organism was too well established in forests in the Santa Cruz and San Francisco Bay areas by the time the cause of sudden oak death was discovered to enable any eradication effort to succeed. Even in still relatively uninfested areas of the north coast and southern Big Sur, regionally coordinated efforts to manage the pathogen face huge challenges of leadership, coordination, and funding. Nevertheless, land managers are still working to coordinate efforts between states, counties, and agencies to provide &quot;P. ramorum&quot; management in a more comprehensive manner.

Several options exist for landowners who want to limit the impacts of SOD death on their properties. None of these options is foolproof, guaranteed to eradicate &quot;P. ramorum&quot;, or guaranteed to prevent a tree from becoming infected. Some are still in the initial stage of testing. Nevertheless, when used thoughtfully and thoroughly, some of the treatments do improve the likelihood of either slowing the spread of the pathogen or of limiting its impacts on trees or stands of trees. Assuming that the landowner has correctly identified the host tree(s) and symptom(s), has submitted a sample to a local authority to send to an approved laboratory for testing, and has received confirmation that the tree(s) are indeed infected with &quot;P. ramorum&quot;âor, alternatively, assuming that the landowner knows that &quot;P. ramorum&quot;-infected trees are nearby and wants to protect the resources on his or her propertyâhe or she can attempt control by cultural (individual-tree), chemical, or silvicultural (stand-level) means.

The best evidence that cultural techniques might help protect trees against &quot;P. ramorum&quot; comes from research that has established a correlation between disease risk in coast live oak trees and the trees&#x27; proximity to bay laurel. In particular, this research found that bay laurel trees growing within 5 m of the trunk of an oak tree were the best predictors of disease risk. This implies that strategic removal of bay laurel trees near coast live oaks might decrease the risk of oak infection. Wholesale removal of bay laurel trees would not be warranted, since the bay laurels close to the oak trees appear to provide the greatest risk factor. Whether the same pattern is true for other oaks or tanoaks has yet to be established. Research on this subject has been started for tanoak, but any eventual cultural recommendations will be more complicated, because tanoak twigs also serve as sources of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; inoculum.

An initially promising treatment for preventing infection of individual oak and tanoak treesânot for curing an already established infectionâis a phosphonate fungicide marketed under the trade name Agri-fos. Phosphonate is a neutralized form of phosphorous acid that works not by direct antagonism of &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, but by stimulating various kinds of immune responses on the part of the tree. It is mostly environmentally benign if not applied to nontarget plants and can be applied either as an injection into the tree stem or as a spray to the bole. When applying Agri-fos as a spray, it must be combined with an organosilicate surfactant, Pentra-bark, to enable the product to adhere to the tree trunk long enough to be absorbed by the tree. Agri-fos has been very effective in preventing tree infections, but it must be applied when visible symptoms of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; on other trees in the immediate neighborhood are still relatively distant; otherwise, the tree to be treated likely is already infected, but visible symptoms have not yet developed (especially true for tanoak). However, later extensive field trials showed that phosphonate (also called phosphite) had little if any beneficial effect.

Trials of silvicultural methods for treating &quot;P. ramorum&quot; began in Humboldt County in northwest coastal California in 2006. The trials have taken place on a variety of infested properties both private and public and have generally focused on varying levels and kinds of host removal. The largest () and most replicated trials have involved removal of tanoak and bay laurel by chainsaw throughout the infested stand, both with and without subsequent underburning designed to eliminate small seedlings and infested leaf litter. Other treatments included host removal in a modified &quot;shaded fuelbreak&quot; design in which all bay laurel is removed, but not all tanoaks; bay and tanoak removal using herbicides; and removal of bay laurel alone. The results of these treatments are still being monitored, but repeated sampling has so far detected only very small amounts of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in the soil or on vegetation in the treated sites.

===Nursery management===
Research and development in managing &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in nursery settings extends from &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in the individual plant, to &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in the nursery environment, to the pathogen&#x27;s movement across state and national borders in infected plants.

An array of studies have tested the curative and protective effects of various chemical compounds against &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in plants valued as ornamentals or Christmas trees. Many studies have focused on the four main ornamental hosts of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; (&quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;Camellia&quot;, &quot;Viburnum&quot;, and &quot;Pieris&quot;). Several effective compounds have been found; some of the most effective include mefenoxam, metalaxyl, dimethomorph, and fenamidone. Many of these studies have converged upon the following conclusions: chemical compounds are, in general, more effective as preventives than as curatives; when used preventively, chemical compounds must be reapplied at various intervals; and chemical compounds can mask the symptoms of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; infection in the host plant, potentially interfering with inspections for quarantine efforts. In general, these compounds suppress but do not eradicate the pathogen, and some researchers are concerned that with repeated use the pathogen may become resistant to them. These studies and conclusions are summarized by Kliejunas.

Another area of research and evolving practice deals with eliminating &quot;P. ramorum&quot; from nursery environments in which it is established to prevent human-mediated pathogen movement within the ornamental plant trade. One way of approaching this is through a robust quarantine and inspection program, which the various federal and state regulatory agencies have implemented. Under the federal &quot;P. ramorum&quot; quarantine program implemented by USDA APHIS, nurseries in California, Oregon, and Washington are regulated and must participate in an annual inspection regimen; nurseries in the 14 infested counties in coastal California, plus the limited infested area in Curry County, Oregon, must participate in a more stringent inspection schedule when shipping out of this area.

Much of the research into disinfesting nurseries has focused on the voluntary best management practices (BMPs) that nurseries can implement to prevent &quot;P. ramorum&#x27;s&quot; introduction into the nursery and movement from plant to plant. In 2008, a group of nursery industry organizations issued a list of BMPs that includes subsections on pest prevention/management, training, internal/external monitoring/audits, records/traceability, and documentation. The document includes such specific recommendations as &quot;Avoid overhead irrigation of high-risk plants&quot;; &quot;After every crop rotation, disinfect propagation mist beds, sorting area, cutting benches, machines and tools to minimize the spread or introduction of pathogens&quot;; and &quot;Nursery personnel should attend one or more &quot;P. ramorum &quot;trainings conducted by qualified personnel or document self-training&quot;.

Research on control of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; in nurseries has also focused on disinfesting irrigation water containing &quot;P. ramorum&quot; inoculum. Irrigation water can become infested from bay trees in the forest (if the irrigation source is a stream), from bay trees overhanging irrigation ponds, from runoff from infested forests, or from recirculated irrigation water. Experiments in Germany with three types of filtersâslow sand filters, lava filters, and constructed wetlandsâshowed that the first two removed &quot;P. ramorum&quot; from the irrigation water completely, while 37% of the post-treatment water samples from the constructed wetland still contained &quot;P. ramorum&quot;.

Along with proper irrigation practices, ground cover can be an effective management practice for ornamental plants in nursery settings. Covering the ground with a 5 to 7Â cm layer of gravel can prevent splash dispersal of propagules onto ornamental plants that are grown in containers. This practice can also significantly suppress the disease.

Since &quot;P. ramorum&quot; can persist for an undetermined period of time within the soil profile, management programs in nurseries should also deal with delineating the pathogen&#x27;s distribution in nursery soil and eliminating it from infested areas. A variety of chemical options has been tested for soil disinfestation, including such chemicals as chloropicrin, metham sodium, iodomethane, and dazomet. Lab tests indicated that all of these chemicals were effective when applied to infested soil in glass jars. Additionally, tests on volunteer nurseries with infested soil demonstrated that dazomet (trade name Basamid) fumigation followed by a 14-day tarping period successfully removed &quot;P. ramorum&quot; from the soil profile. Other soil disinfestation practices under investigation, or in which interest has been expressed, include steam sterilization, solarization, and paving of infested areas.

===General sanitation in infested areas===
One of the most important aspects of &quot;P. ramorum&quot; control involves interrupting the human-mediated movement of the pathogen by ensuring that infested materials do not move from location to location. While enforceable quarantines perform part of this function, basic cleanliness when working or recreating in infested areas is also important. In most cases, cleanliness practices involve ridding potentially infested surfacesâsuch as shoes, vehicles, and petsâof foliage and mud before leaving the infested area. The demands of implementing these practices become more complex when large numbers of people are working in infested areas, as in construction, timber harvesting, or wildfire suppression. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and USDA Forest Service have implemented guidelines and mitigation requirements for the latter two situations; basic information about cleanliness in &quot;P. ramorum&quot;-infested areas can be found at the California Oak Mortality Task Force web site (www.suddenoakdeath.org) under the &quot;Treatment and Management&quot; section (subsection &quot;Sanitation and Reducing Spread&quot;).

==Government agency involvement==
In England in 2009, the Forestry Commission, DEFRA, the Food and Environment Research Agency, Cornwall County Council, and Natural England are working together to record the locations and deal with this disease. Natural England is offering grant funding through its Environmental Stewardship, Countryside Stewardship, and Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes to clear rhododendron. In 2011, the Forestry Commission started felling of larch forest in the south-west of England, as an attempt to halt the spread of the disease. In 2023 the Forestry Commission issued a Statutory Plant Health Notice to Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust ordering it to remove over 1,000 trees at their nature reserve at Wyming Brook. In Northern Ireland at the end of 2011, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development&#x27;s Forest Service began felling 14 hectares of affected Larch woodland at Moneyscalp, on the edge of Tollymore Forest Park in County Down.

<text>Sexual maturity is the capability of an organism to reproduce. In humans, it is related to both puberty and adulthood. &quot;Puberty&quot; is the biological process of sexual maturation, while &quot;adulthood&quot;, the condition of being socially recognized as an independent person capable of giving consent and taking responsibility, generally implies sexual maturity (certain disorders of sexual development notwithstanding), but depends on other criteria, defined by specific cultural expectations.

Most multicellular organisms are unable to sexually reproduce at birth (animals) or germination (e.g. plants): depending on the species, it may be days, weeks, or years until they have developed enough to be able to do so; in addition, certain cues may trigger an organism to become sexually mature. These may be external, such as drought, or fire, that triggers sexual maturation of certain plants, or internal, such as percentage of body fat (certain animals). Internal cues are not to be confused with hormones, the chemical signals that initiate cellular processes leading to sexual maturity, but the production and secretion of hormones is triggered by such cues. In some species, immature males may delay sexual maturation in the presence of another sexually mature male, as in the male chicken (rooster), due to the intense, often lethal, combat engaged in by mature males. The female honeybee only becomes sexually mature if it is fed a special substance (&quot;royal jelly&quot;) during the larval stage.

== Role of reproductive organs ==
Sexual maturity is brought about by a maturing of the reproductive organs and the production of gametes. It may also be accompanied by a growth spurt or other physical changes which distinguish the immature organism from its adult form. In animals these are termed secondary sex characteristics, and often represent an increase in sexual dimorphism.

After sexual maturity is achieved, some organisms become infertile, or even change their sex. Some organisms are hermaphrodites and may or may not be able to &quot;completely&quot; mature and/or to produce viable offspring. Also, while in many organisms sexual maturity is strongly linked to age, many other factors are involved, and it is possible for some to display most or all of the characteristics of the adult form without being sexually mature. Conversely it is also possible for the &quot;immature&quot; form of an organism to reproduce. This is called &quot;progenesis&quot;, in which sexual development occurs faster than other physiological development (in contrast, the term &quot;neoteny&quot; refers to when non-sexual development is slowed â but the result is the same - the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood).

== Puberty vs. sexual maturity ==
In some species, there is a difference between puberty and sexual maturity. For example, in bulls, puberty is characterized by the accelerated growth of the genital system, an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, and the onset of spermatogenesis. Sexual maturity, however, signifies the attainment of full reproductive capacity, which may take up to 6â9 months after puberty.

<doc id="589548" wikidata="Q1144385" url="?curid=589548" title="Prothrombin time">
<text>The prothrombin time (PT) â along with its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and international normalized ratio (INR) â is an assay for evaluating the extrinsic pathway and common pathway of coagulation. This blood test is also called &quot;protime INR&quot; and &quot;PT/INR&quot;. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in conditions such as the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage (cirrhosis), and vitamin K status. PT measures the following coagulation factors: I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V (proaccelerin), VII (proconvertin), and X (StuartâPrower factor).

PT is often used in conjunction with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) which measures the &quot;intrinsic&quot; pathway and common pathway of coagulation.

==Laboratory measurement==

The reference range for prothrombin time depends on the analytical method used, but is usually around 12â13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8â1.2. The target range for INR in anticoagulant use (e.g. warfarin) is 2 to 3. In some cases, if more intense anticoagulation is thought to be required, the target range may be as high as 2.5â3.5 depending on the indication for anticoagulation.

===Methodology===

Prothrombin time is typically analyzed by a laboratory technologist on an automated instrument at 37Â Â°C (as a nominal approximation of normal human body temperature).
* Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as prothrombin time is most commonly measured using blood plasma). In newborns, a capillary whole blood specimen is used.
* A sample of the plasma is extracted from the test tube and placed into a measuring test tube (Note: for an accurate measurement, the ratio of blood to citrate needs to be fixed and should be labeled on the side of the measuring test tube by the manufacturing company; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrateâthe standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid).
* Next an excess of calcium (in a phospholipid suspension) is added to the test tube, thereby reversing the effects of citrate and enabling the blood to clot again.
* Finally, in order to activate the extrinsic / tissue factor clotting cascade pathway, tissue factor (also known as factor III) is added and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples.

===Prothrombin time ratio===
The prothrombin time ratio is the ratio of a subject&#x27;s measured prothrombin time (in seconds) to the normal laboratory reference PT. The PT ratio varies depending on the specific reagents used, and has been replaced by the INR. Elevated INR may be useful as a rapid and inexpensive diagnostic of infection in people with COVID-19.

===International normalized ratio===
The result (in seconds) for a prothrombin time performed on a normal individual will vary according to the type of analytical system employed. This is due to the variations between different types and batches of manufacturer&#x27;s tissue factor used in the reagent to perform the test. The INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer assigns an ISI value (International Sensitivity Index) for any tissue factor they manufacture. The ISI value indicates how a particular batch of tissue factor compares to an international reference tissue factor. The ISI is usually between 0.94 and 1.4 for more sensitive and 2.0â3.0 for less sensitive thromboplastins.

The INR is the ratio of a patient&#x27;s prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical system being used.

:formula_1

PTnormal is established as the geometric mean of the prothrombin times (PT) of a reference sample group.

===Interpretation===
The prothrombin time is the time it takes plasma to clot after addition of tissue factor (obtained from animals such as rabbits, or recombinant tissue factor, or from brains of autopsy patients). This measures the quality of the &quot;extrinsic pathway&quot; (as well as the &quot;common pathway&quot;) of coagulation. The speed of the &quot;extrinsic pathway&quot; is greatly affected by levels of functional factor VII in the body. Factor VII has a short half-life and the carboxylation of its glutamate residues requires vitamin K. The prothrombin time can be prolonged as a result of deficiencies in vitamin K, warfarin therapy, malabsorption, or lack of intestinal colonization by bacteria (such as in newborns). In addition, poor factor VII synthesis (due to liver disease) or increased consumption (in disseminated intravascular coagulation) may prolong the PT.

The INR is typically used to monitor patients on warfarin or related oral anticoagulant therapy. The normal range for a healthy person not using warfarin is 0.8â1.2, and for people on warfarin therapy an INR of 2.0â3.0 is usually targeted, although the target INR may be higher in particular situations, such as for those with a mechanical heart valve. If the INR is outside the target range, a high INR indicates a higher risk of bleeding, while a low INR suggests a higher risk of developing a clot. In patients on a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin with supratherapeutic INR but INR less than 10 and no bleeding, it is enough to lower the dose or omit a dose, monitor the INR and resume the vitamin K antagonist at an adjusted lower dose when the target INR is reached. For people who need rapid reversal of the vitamin K antagonist â such as due to serious bleeding â or who need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
===Factors determining accuracy===
Lupus anticoagulant, a circulating inhibitor predisposing for thrombosis, may skew PT results, depending on the assay used. Variations between various thromboplastin preparations have in the past led to decreased accuracy of INR readings, and a 2005 study suggested that despite international calibration efforts (by INR) there were still statistically significant differences between various kits, casting doubt on the long-term tenability of PT/INR as a measure for anticoagulant therapy. Indeed, a new prothrombin time variant, the Fiix prothrombin time, intended solely for monitoring warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists has been invented and recently become available as a manufactured test. The Fiix prothrombin time is only affected by reductions in factor II and/or factor X and this stabilizes the anticoagulant effect and appears to improve clinical outcome according to an investigator initiated randomized blinded clinical trial, The Fiix-trial. In this trial thromboembolism was reduced by 50% during long-term treatment and despite that bleeding was not increased.

==Statistics==
An estimated 800 million PT/INR assays are performed annually worldwide.

==Near-patient testing==
In addition to the laboratory method outlined above, near-patient testing (NPT) or home INR monitoring is becoming increasingly common in some countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, near-patient testing is used both by patients at home and by some anticoagulation clinics (often hospital-based) as a fast and convenient alternative to the lab method. After a period of doubt about the accuracy of NPT results, a new generation of machines and reagents seems to be gaining acceptance for its ability to deliver results close in accuracy to those of the lab.


In a typical NPT set up, a small table-top device is used. A drop of capillary blood is obtained with an automated finger-prick, which is almost painless. This drop is placed on a disposable test strip with which the machine has been prepared. The resulting INR comes up on the display a few seconds later. A similar form of testing is used by people with diabetes for monitoring blood sugar levels, which is easily taught and routinely practiced.

Local policy determines whether the patient or a coagulation specialist (pharmacist, nurse, general practitioner or hospital doctor) interprets the result and determines the dose of medication. In Germany and Austria, patients may adjust the medication dose themselves, while in the UK and the US this remains in the hands of a health care professional.

A significant advantage of home testing is the evidence that patient self-testing with medical support and patient self-management (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control. A meta analysis which reviewed 14 trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and improved the time in the therapeutic range, which is an indirect measure of anticoagulant control. In 2022, a smartphone system was introduced by researchers to perform PT/INR testing in an inexpensive and accessible manner. It uses the vibration motor and camera ubiquitous on smartphones to track micro-mechanical movements of a copper particle and compute PT/INR values.

Other advantages of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and that the cost of the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the US, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor&#x27;s prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare-approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).

There is some evidence to suggest that NPT may be less accurate for certain patients, for example those who have the lupus anticoagulant.

===Guidelines===
International guidelines were published in 2005 to govern home monitoring of oral anticoagulation by the International Self-Monitoring Association for Oral Anticoagulation. The international guidelines study stated, &quot;The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient self-management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently, available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results which are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing.&quot;

Medicare coverage for home testing of INR has been expanded in order to allow more people access to home testing of INR in the US. The release on 19 March 2008 said, &quot;[t]he Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded Medicare coverage for home blood testing of prothrombin time (PT) International Normalized Ratio (INR) to include beneficiaries who are using the drug warfarin, an anticoagulant (blood thinner) medication, for chronic atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism.&quot; In addition, &quot;those Medicare beneficiaries and their physicians managing conditions related to chronic atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism will benefit greatly through the use of the home test.&quot;

==History==
The prothrombin time was developed by Armand J. Quick and colleagues in 1935, and a second method was published by , also called the &quot;p and p&quot; or &quot;prothrombin and proconvertin&quot; method. It aided in the identification of the anticoagulants dicumarol and warfarin, and was used subsequently as a measure of activity for warfarin when used therapeutically.

The INR was invented in the early 1980s by Tom Kirkwood working at the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (and subsequently at the UK National Institute for Medical Research) to provide a consistent way of expressing the prothrombin time ratio, which had previously suffered from a large degree of variation between centres using different reagents. The INR was coupled to Dr Kirkwood&#x27;s simultaneous invention of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which provided the means to calibrate different batches of thromboplastins to an international standard. The INR became widely accepted worldwide, especially after endorsement by the World Health Organization.

<text>Aaron Abeyta (born August 8, 1965), better known as El Hefe or simply Hefe, from &quot;el Jefe&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the boss&quot;), is an American musician, best known as the lead guitarist and trumpet player for the American punk rock band NOFX. He started playing guitar at the age of 13, but he states that he started taking it seriously at the age of 15, joining his first band. He joined NOFX in 1991 and his first recording with the band was his contribution to their EP &quot;The Longest Line&quot;.

Abeyta was given his nickname by NOFX founder Fat Mike because at the time when Abeyta joined the band, Fat Mike was dating a girl named Erin and he didn&#x27;t want there to be any confusion. According to Fat Mike, &quot;I suggested a Mexican-sounding name, like &#x27;El Jefe.&#x27; I donât speak Spanish, so I didnât realize the &#x27;h&#x27; sound is usually spelled with a &#x27;j.&#x27;&quot; 

El Hefe once owned a nightclub called &quot;Hefe&#x27;s&quot; in Eureka, California, and now lives in Stevenson Ranch, California. He has two children and is divorced from Jennifer Abeyta.

<doc id="589578" wikidata="Q1151175" url="?curid=589578" title="Indian nightjar">
<text>The Indian nightjar (Caprimulgus asiaticus) is a small nightjar which is a resident breeder in open lands across South Asia and Southeast Asia. Like most nightjars it is crepuscular and is best detected from its characteristic calls at dawn and dusk that have been likened to a stone skipping on a frozen lake - a series of clicks that become shorter and more rapid. They are sometimes spotted on roads when their eyes gleam red in the spotlight of a vehicle. There is considerable plumage variation across its range and can be hard to differentiate from other nightjars in the region especially in the field.

==Description==
This nightjar is small and short-tailed with white corners to the tail, a golden nape and collar, dark cheeks and white patches on the sides of the throat. The crown is grey and the breast is finely barred in brown. The males have more white on the tail while the female is more heavily streaked on the crown. It is differentiated from Sykes&#x27;s nightjar by the dark undertail and from Jerdon&#x27;s nightjar by the shorter tail and white patches on the sides of the throat.

The call is distinctive and has been likened to a stone skipped on a frozen lake (due to which it was also called the &quot;ice-bird&quot; in colonial India) or a ping-pong ball bouncing rapidly and coming to rest.

It flies after sundown with an easy, silent moth-like flight. During the day, Indian nightjar lies still on the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is then difficult to detect, blending in with the soil.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The populations show clinal variation with paler plumage in the dry zone of northwestern India. The population of Sri Lanka is named &quot;eidos&quot; and is darker and greyer overall. In northwestern India, subspecies &quot;gurgaoni&quot; is very pale sandy buff with nominate populations of peninsular India showing considerable variation.

==Habitat and distribution==
The species is found in open woodland, scrub, and cultivation. It usually sits on the ground or low trees and is not found on high perches.

The species is found from northwestern India and adjoining parts of Pakistan but not found in the arid desert region. It is found south of the Himalayas in the low elevations east to Bangladesh, Myanmar and Vietnam. It is also found in Sri Lanka.

No nest is made; the two beautifully marbled creamy pink eggs are placed upon the bare ground during February to September; the brooding bird, sitting closely, is well camouflaged. Eggs may be moved short distances. The newly hatched chick is covered in down with brown above and light rufous below. The eye is open on hatching and the chick can sit upright and make a weak sound.


==Feeding==

Nightjars are most active, and mostly feed, near dawn and dusk (crepuscular - active during the twilight). At dusk, they often fly around livestock to feed on insects swarming around the animals. At night, they like to take advantage of insects swarming around street lamps or other artificial light sources. They are keeping their bills wide open as they fly through clouds of small insects.
Nightjars may also forage under the canopy by flying from favored perches catching insects at foliage heights of 5 â 15 feet (~1.5 â 5 m). Larger insects are usually taken back to their favored feeding perches. While holding the insects in their bills, nightjars keep the head upright, shake and swallow the prey whole, or they may break the insects apart before eating. Insects may also be taken from the ground or foliage. Juvenile nightjars typically sit on the ground before making short jumps or flights to capture insects.
The bulk of their diet consists of flying / swarming insects, such as mosquitoes, flies, beetles, locusts, winged ants, moths and grasshoppers, as well as plant lice and crickets. To a lesser extent, they will also eat larvae, nymphs and eggs.

This common species frequently rests on roads during the night, sometimes capturing insects under street lights. Their bright reflective eye-shine makes them easy to spot in the beams of vehicle headlights. They may however be stunned by bright lights and many are killed by vehicular traffic.

<text>George Luther Hathaway (August 4, 1813 â July 5, 1872) was a politician in New Brunswick, Canada. His surname also appears as Hatheway.

He was born in Musquash, New Brunswick, the son of Calvin Luther Hatheway and Sarah Harrison.

He entered politics as a reformer and advocate of responsible government. Hathaway was a noted drinker, and often sipped brandy while campaigning. He was elected to the colony&#x27;s legislative assembly in 1850, and re-elected in 1854 and 1856, but lost his seat in 1857. He returned to the house in 1861, and became chief commissioner of public works.

In 1865, Hathaway objected to the terms of Canadian confederation and resigned from his government position when the terms were accepted by the government of Samuel Leonard Tilley. Hathaway&#x27;s resignation helped defeat the government, and he was re-elected as an Anti-Confederate candidate later that year. He rejected Lieutenant Governor Arthur H. Gordon&#x27;s invitation to form a new government. Hathaway instead became chief commissioner of public works in the government of Albert James Smith.

He did not run in the 1866 election won by the Confederation Party, but ran in 1870, three years after New Brunswick became a Canadian province. He was elected to the provincial legislature as a Conservative candidate. Party loyalties were weak during this period, however, and in February 1871, he helped depose the government of Conservative Premier George E. King, who was considered to be too close to the federal Conservative Party. Hathaway became the leader of a new Conservative government.

Hathaway&#x27;s government passed the Common Schools Act which had been drawn up by his predecessor. The legislation implemented a single, tax supported public school system based on the principle of Separation of church and state that would have enacted direct taxation for education. He had run on this issue in the 1871 election and won. The school act called for &quot;free, tax supported, non-sectarian schools&quot; and was opposed both by opponents of direct taxation and by the Roman Catholic clergy who saw the bill as a threat to Catholic schools.

On June 25, 1872, Hathaway&#x27;s hand was seriously injured when he jumped from a moving train. He died in Fredericton as a result of blood poisoning from this incident.

<text>Signal de Botrange is the highest point in Wallonia and in Belgium, located in the &quot;High Fens&quot; (&quot;Hautes Fagnes&quot; in French, &quot;Hohes Venn&quot; in German, &quot;Hoge Venen&quot; in Dutch), at . It is the top of a broad plateau and a road crosses the summit, passing an adjacent cafÃ©. It is also the highest point in the Ardennes and in the European part of the Benelux.

For several decades a meteorological station was installed at signal de Botrange. Since 1999, it was replaced by an automatic station of the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium installed on Mount Rigi (scientific station of the High Fens - University of LiÃ¨ge), which is between the Signal and Baraque Michel which was formerly the highest point in Belgium prior to the annexation of the Eastern Cantons in 1919.

Signal de Botrange experiences stronger winds than the centre of Belgium. Average and extreme temperatures are usually lower than at any other place in Belgium: the minimum temperature recorded () does not, however, exceed the absolute record (), observed in the valley of the Lomme, at Rochefort during a temperature inversion. In winter, for three months, on average, the average temperature remains below .

Rainfall is much greater than most of the rest of the country, at an annual average of compared with in Uccle: there are over 200 days of precipitation per year (against just over 170 in Uccle). Maximum temperatures in summer rarely exceed . The number of days of frost is over 130 days per year and the number of days of snowfall exceeds 35 days. The maximum thickness of snow was measured on 9 February 1953, at of snow. Frost and early snowfall can occur in late September, but that is exceptional. Late snow may sometimes occur until mid-May.

At the height of winter the site is used as the start of a number of cross-country skiing routes.

== Towers and Transmitters Botrange ==
In 1923, the Baltia tower was built on the summit to allow visitors to reach an altitude of . A stone tower built in 1933/34 by FranÃ§ois Fagnoul from Ovifat on the Botrange crowned a steel weather vane with the relieved name &quot; SICCO CAMPO &quot; until World War II. Meanwhile, the spire serves as transmitter of Radio Contact and reaches a de facto height of .

In November 2013, at the Signal de Botrange, a tower with parabolic antennas was agreed to provide data interchange by Microwave transmission between London Stock Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, because the data transmission via Communications satellite or fibre optic involves a small delay, which interferes the stock exchange trading. The data transfer takes place in real time via the intermediate station Botrange, which was set up directly next to the existing tower.

== Hydrography ==

The summit of Belgium is home on its flanks to several sources of Ardennes rivers, all belonging to the Mosan basin, including the Helle, Roer and Schwarzbach to the north (but flowing here to the east), Bayehon to the south, and the TrÃ´s Marets to the west.

As in the names of these rivers, although the Signal de Botrange is not a state border, it marks a language border in the area between the Romance languages (south and west) and Germanic languages (north and east)

<doc id="589586" wikidata="Q2533493" url="?curid=589586" title="Maidu">
<text>The Maidu are a Native American people of northern California. They reside in the central Sierra Nevada, in the watershed area of the Feather and American Rivers and in Humbug Valley. In Maiduan languages, &quot;maidu&quot; means &quot;person&quot;.
==Local division==
The Maidu people are geographically dispersed into many subgroups or bands who live among and identify with separate valleys, foothills, and mountains in northeastern Central California. The three subcategories of Maidu are:
* The Nisenan or Southern Maidu occupied the whole of the American, Bear, and Yuba River drainages. They live in lands that were previously home to the Martis.
* The Northeastern or Mountain Maidu, also known as Yamani Maidu, lived on the upper north and middle forks of the Feather River.
* The Konkow (Koyom&#x27;kawi/Concow) occupied a valley between present-day Cherokee, and Pulga, along the north fork of the Feather River and its tributaries. The Mechupda live in the area of Chico, California.

==Population==
Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the 1770 population of the Maidu (including the Konkow and Nisenan) as 9,000. Sherburne F. Cook raised this figure slightly, to 9,500.

Kroeber reported the population of the Maidu in 1910 as 1,100. The 1930 census counted 93, following decimation by infectious diseases and social disruption. As of 1995, the Maidu population had recovered to an estimated 3,500.

==Culture==
=== Baskets and basket making ===
The Maidu women were exemplary basketweavers, weaving highly detailed and useful baskets in sizes ranging from thimbles to huge ones 10 or more feet in diameter. The weaving on some of these baskets is so fine that a magnifying glass is needed to see the strands. In addition to making closely woven, watertight baskets for cooking, they made large storage baskets, bowls, shallow trays, traps, cradles, hats, and seed beaters. They used dozens of different kinds of wild plant stems, barks, roots and leaves. Some of the more common were fern roots, red bark of the redbud, white willow twigs and tule roots, hazel twigs, yucca leaves, brown marsh grassroots, and sedge roots. By combining these different kinds of plants, the women made geometric designs on their baskets in red, black, white, brown or tan.

Maidu elder Marie Potts explains, &quot;The coiled and twining systems were both used, and the products were sometimes handsomely decorated according to the inventiveness and skill of the weaver and the materials available, such as feathers of brightly plumaged birds, shells, quills, seeds or beads- almost anything that could be attached.&quot;

===Subsistence===

Like many other California tribes, the Maidu were primarily hunters and gatherers and did not farm. They practiced grooming of their gathering grounds, with fire as a primary tool for this purpose. They tended local groves of oak trees to maximize production of acorns, which were their principal dietary staple after being processed and prepared.

According to Maidu elder Marie Potts:

Preparing acorns as the food was a long and tedious process that was undertaken by the women and children. The acorns had to be shelled, cleaned, and then ground into meal. This was done by pounding them with a pestle on a hard surface, generally a hollowed-out stone. The tannic acid in the acorns was leached out by spreading the meal smoothly on a bed of pine needles laid over sand. Cedar or fir boughs were placed across the meal and warm water was poured all over, a process that took several hours, with the boughs distributing the water evenly and flavoring the meal.

The Maidu used the abundance of acorns to store large quantities for harder times. Above-ground acorn granaries were created by the weavers.

Besides acorns, which provided dietary starch and fat, the Maidu supplemented their acorn diet with edible roots or tubers (for which they were nicknamed &quot;Digger Indians&quot; by European immigrants), and other plants and tubers. The women and children also collected seeds from the many flowering plants, and corms from wildflowers also were gathered and processed as part of their diet. The men hunted deer, elk, antelope, and smaller game, within a spiritual system that respected the animals. The men captured fish from the many streams and rivers, as they were a prime source of protein. Salmon were collected when they came upstream to spawn; other fish were available year-round.

===Housing===
Especially higher in the hills and the mountains, the Maidu built their dwellings partially underground, to gain protection from the cold. These houses were sizable, circular structures 12 to 18 feet in diameter, with floors, dug as much as 3 feet below ground level. Once the floor of the house was dug, a pole framework was built. It was covered by pinebark slabs. A sturdy layer of earth was placed along the base of the structure. A central fire was prepared in the house at ground level. It had a stone-lined pit and bedrock mortar to hold heat for food preparation.

For summer dwelling, a different structure was built from cut branches tied together and fastened to sapling posts, then covered with brush and soil. The summer shelters were built with the principal opening facing east to catch the rising sun, and to avoid the heat of afternoon sun.

===Social organization===
Maidu lived in small villages or bands with no centralized political organization. Leaders were typically selected from the pool of men who headed the local Kuksu cult. They did not exercise day-to-day authority, but were primarily responsible for settling internal disputes and negotiating over matters arising between villages.

===Religion===
The primary religious tradition was known as the Kuksu cult. This central California religious system was based on a male secret society. It was characterized by the Kuksu or &quot;big head&quot; dances. Maidu elder Marie Mason Potts says that the Maidu are traditionally a monotheistic people: &quot;they greeted the sunrise with a prayer of thankfulness; at noon they stopped for meditation, and at sunset, they communed with &quot;Kadyapam&quot; and gave thanks for blessings throughout the day.&quot; A traditional spring celebration for the Maidu was the Bear Dance when the Maidu honored the bear coming out of hibernation. The bear&#x27;s hibernation and survival through the winter symbolized perseverance to the Maidu, who identified with the animal spiritually.

The Kuksu cult system was also followed by the Pomo and the Patwin among the Wintun. Missionaries later forced the peoples to adopt Christianity, but they often retained elements of their traditional practices.

=== Traditional narratives ===
Stories of K&#x27;odojapem/World-maker and Wepam/Trickster Coyote are particularly prominent in Maidu traditional narratives.

===Languages===

The Maidu spoke a language that some linguists believe was related to the Penutian family. While all Maidu spoke a form of this language, the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary differed sufficiently that Maidu separated by large distances or by geographic features that discouraged travel might speak dialects that were nearly mutually unintelligible.

The four principal divisions of the language were Northeastern Maidu or Yamonee Maidu (known simply as Maidu); Southern Maidu or Nisenan; Northwestern Maidu or Konkow; and Valley Maidu or Chico.

===Rock art===
The Maidu inhabited areas in the northeastern Sierra Nevada. Many examples of indigenous rock art and petroglyphs have been found here. Scholars are uncertain about whether these date from previous indigenous populations of peoples or were created by the Maidu people. The Maidu incorporated these works into their cultural system, and believe that such artifacts are real, living energies that are an integral part of their world.

<text>Daniel Lionel Hanington (June 27, 1835 â May 5, 1909) was a New Brunswick, Canada politician and jurist.

He was born at Shediac, New Brunswick, the son of Daniel Hanington, and was educated there and at Mount Allison Academy in Sackville. He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870.

Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington&#x27;s Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair&#x27;s Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1892 and, in 1896, he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province&#x27;s Supreme Court.

He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.

<text>Putnam Investments is an investment management firm founded in 1937 by George Putnam, who established one of the first balanced mutual funds, The George Putnam Fund of Boston.

Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, it has offices in London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Sydney, and Singapore. Putnam is currently a subsidiary of Franklin Templeton Investments.

==History==
The firm was founded in 1937 by George Putnam, who established one of the first balanced mutual funds: The George Putnam Fund of Boston. Lawrence Lasser joined the company in 1969, and it became &quot;one of the largest managers of mutual funds.&quot;

In 1997, Putnam Investments established a connection with Nippon Life Insurance in Osaka, Japan, and its subsidiary Nissay Asset Management Company.

===2000 to 2006===
The year 2000 marked the beginning of a gradual asset value decline that took Putnam&#x27;s asset value from $400Â billion to $192Â billion.

In October 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Massachusetts Secretary of State each filed separate civil complaints against Putnam, alleging that the company&#x27;s portfolio managers, along with some preferred clients, had engaged in the rapid trading of some of Putnam&#x27;s mutual funds. A few days later, Lasser resigned, and Charles &quot;Ed&quot; Haldeman, director of one of the company&#x27;s investment divisions, was promoted to chief executive.

Between 2003 and 2007, Haldeman initiated broad changes within the company. He created a new set of guiding principles for the company and reduced the company&#x27;s staff by 11 percent, including eliminating 25 of the highest-paid executive positions. He reduced senior management compensation to half of what it was in 2000 and adjusted portfolio managers&#x27; compensation to encourage more long-term thinking and planning.

In early 2004, the company admitted allowing its portfolio managers and some investors to market time its funds. Under agreements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Putnam paid $110Â million in fines and restitution to settle charges with the state and federal regulators. After allegations of improper trading became public, Putnam&#x27;s investors withdrew at least $28Â billion from its stock and bond funds over six months. By May, 70 civil actions had been filed against Putnam for allegedly engaging in improper trading.

In 2005, Putnam paid $40Â million to settle charges made in 2003 that it &quot;did not tell fund investors or directors about paying&quot; brokerage firms for recommending its mutual funds to clients. Afterward, some investors withdrew their funds. This settlement was the final resolution in an investigation of Putnam&#x27;s payments to 80 brokers conducted over three years.

In 2006, 48 percent of Putnam&#x27;s mutual funds scored in the top 50 percent compared with funds in their peer group, an increase of 8 percent from two years prior. However, that same year, an SEC lawsuit accused several former employees, including their transfer agency chief, of &quot;defrauding several mutual funds and a corporate retirement plan of $4 million&quot; so they could &quot;cover up an investment-processing error.&quot; The lawsuit was about an asset transfer to the Cardinal Health plan that was intentionally delayed by one day in January 2001. After failing to take advantage of a $4Â million windfall, Putnam executives covered up the incident and attributed the loss to other mutual funds.

===2007 to Present===
In February 2007, Great-West Lifeco, which is controlled by Power Corporation of Canada, announced it would acquire Putnam Investments, a &quot;troubled mutual fund manager,&quot; from the Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies for the approximate price of $3.9Â billion. The acquisition of Putnam was motivated by Great-West Lifeco&#x27;s 2005 decision to expand into the United States. The following month, Putnam received the 2007 Optimas Award for Ethical Practice in recognition of its then-recent efforts to create a more ethical company culture.

In June 2007, two of Putnam&#x27;s former managing directors agreed to each pay a $400,000 civil penalty to settle charges of improper trading of mutual fund shares, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two directors also agreed to a one-year suspension from any role as an investment advisor. They settled their charges without any admission or denial of guilt. That same month, Lasser, Putnam&#x27;s former chief executive, agreed to pay $75,000 as a settlement against accusations by the Security and Exchanges Commission that he &quot;failed to disclose that the investment company used fund assets to pay brokerage firms for preferred marketing agreements.&quot;

In 2008, Haldeman was replaced by Robert L. Reynolds who was named president and chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. In November, Reynolds told the Financial Times that he would restructure the company by merging several equity funds, basing compensation on performance, and laying off 47 workers including managers.

On September 18, 2008, Putnam directors voted to liquidate its $12.3Â billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and return capital to its approximately 155 professional investors. According to a statement issued by the company, the decision came as a result of &quot;significant redemption pressure.&quot; The fund&#x27;s board of trustees decided that &quot;selling assets to meet redemption [obligations] would risk losses for the remaining investors.&quot;

In 2009, according to a Putnam press release, Reynolds designed a 10-point plan and launched an effort calling for public and private collaboration to strengthen the nation&#x27;s retirement system. That year, Putnam launched the industry&#x27;s first suite of absolute return funds available to U.S. retail investors and re-entered the institutional defined contribution business with a 401(k) product offering.

In 2011, Putnam received the DALBAR Service Award for the 21st consecutive year for &quot;industry leading service to shareholders and financial professionals.&quot;

On May 31, 2023, Great-West Lifeco announced that Franklin Templeton Investments would acquire Putnam for $925Â million. PanAgora Asset Management which was a Putnam subsidiary at the time, would not be included in the acquisition. The deal was completed in January 2024.

<doc id="589604" wikidata="Q1151433" url="?curid=589604" title="Jerdon's nightjar">
<text>Jerdon&#x27;s nightjar (Caprimulgus atripennis) is a medium-sized nightjar species native to southern India and Sri Lanka. Formerly considered as a subspecies of the long-tailed nightjar, it is best recognized by its distinctive call which sounds like a wooden plank being beaten periodically with each note ending in a quaver. The common name commemorates Thomas C. Jerdon who described the species.

==Taxonomy==

Thomas C. Jerdon first described this species in an annotation to his 1845 treatment of the jungle nightjar (&quot;C. indicus&quot;) in the &quot;Illustrations of Indian ornithology&quot;. Subsequently, it was sometimes lumped again with &quot;C. macrurus&quot;, but the co-occurrence of this form and large-tailed nightjar &quot;C. macrurus&quot; without interbreeding in the northeast of the Indian peninsula was noted in 1987 suggesting their distinctness. It has since been reaffirmed as a full species based on studies of their vocalizations. The subspecies in Sri Lanka is &quot;C. a. aequabilis&quot;. Jerdon&#x27;s type locality mentioned as &quot;Ghauts&quot; has been considered to be the Eastern Ghats west of Nellore.

==Description==
Like other nightjars, it has a wide gape, long wings, soft downy plumage and nocturnal habits. At 26Â cm in overall length, it is almost a head&#x27;s length larger than the Indian nightjar (&quot;C. asiaticus&quot;), and differs from that species in its barred tail, rufous rear neck, and wing bars. The vermiculations on the crown are fine giving it a nearly uniform shade. The collar is blackish. The male has a white patch on each wing. Otherwise, their cryptic plumage is mainly variegated buff and brown, as typical for the dark tropical woodland nightjars. This has an unbroken white gorget like the long-tailed nightjar but the tail is shorter. The Sri Lankan &quot;aequabilis&quot; is slightly smaller and darker.

Its typical call is a fast repetitive &quot;ch-woo-woo&quot;. Another call is said to be a frog-like croak.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Open woodland, scrub, and cultivation is the habitat of this nocturnal bird. It flies after sundown with an easy, silent fluttering flight, appearing a bit like an outsized moth at a casual glance. During the day, Jerdon&#x27;s nightjar lies silent upon the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is then difficult to detect, blending in with the soil.

Nocturnal insects, such as moths, are its food. Unlike the Indian nightjar (&quot;C. asiaticus&quot;), this species rarely rests on roads during the night, preferring to alight on bushes. This makes it harder to spot, since it is not so readily seen in vehicle headlights. It however roosts on the ground although calling from the trees.

The breeding season is March to July in India and February to May in Sri Lanka. No nest is made; the two marbled eggs are placed upon the bare ground. The brooding bird, covering them closely with its camouflage plumage, is their best protection. The chicks can crawl away from the nest soon after hatching and hide among leaves when alarmed.

== Conservation ==
Jerdon&#x27;s nightjar has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2004, as it has a large range, and the population trend is considered stable.

<doc id="589605" wikidata="Q56490" url="?curid=589605" title="Tsimshian">
<text>The Tsimshian (; or &quot;Tsm&#x27;syen&quot; also once known as the &quot;Chemmesyans&quot;) are an Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. Their communities are mostly in coastal British Columbia in Terrace and Prince Rupert, and Metlakatla, Alaska on Annette Island, the only reservation in Alaska.

The Tsimshian estimate there are 45,000 Tsimshian people and approximately 10,000 members are federally registered in eight First Nations communities: Kitselas&quot;,&quot; Kitsumkalum&quot;,&quot; Gitxaala&quot;,&quot; Gitga&#x27;at,Kitasoo, Lax Kw&#x27;Alaams&quot;,&quot; and Metlakatla. The latter two communities resulted in the colonial intersections of early settlers and consist of Tsimshian people belonging to the &#x27;nine tribes.&#x27; The Tsimshian are one of the largest First Nations peoples in northwest British Columbia. Some Tsimshian migrated to the Annette Islands in Alaska, and today approximately 1,450 Alaska Tsimshian people are enrolled in the federally recognized Metlakatla Indian Community, sometimes also called the Annette Island Reserve. The Tsimshian honor the traditional Tlingit name of &quot;Taquan&quot; for this recent location.

Tsimshian society is matrilineal kinship-based, which means identity, clans and property pass through the maternal line. Their moiety-based societal structure is further divided into sub clans for certain lineages. The Tsimshian language has some 27 different terms for &#x27;chief&#x27; likely because it is a stratified and ranked society.

Early Euro-Canadian anthropologists and linguists had classified the Gitxsan and Nisga&#x27;a as Tsimshian, because of apparent linguistic affinities. The three were all referred to as &quot;Coast Tsimshian&quot;, even though some communities were not coastal. These three groups, however, are separate nations.

==History==
&quot;Tsimshian&quot; translates to &quot;Inside the Skeena River&quot; At one time the Tsimshian lived on the upper reaches of the Skeena River near present-day Hazelton, British Columbia.

According to southern Tsimshian oral history, after a series of disasters befell the people, a chief led a migration away from the cursed land to the coast, where they founded Kitkatla Village, the first of three Southern Tsimshian villages. Kitkatla is still considered to be the most conservative of the Tsimshian villages. The Nisga&#x27;a and Gitxsan remained in the upper Skeena region (above the canyon) near the Nass River and forks of the Skeena respectively, but other Tsimshian chiefs moved down the river and occupied all the lands of the lower Skeena valley. Over time, these groups developed a new dialect of their ancestral language and came to regard themselves as a distinct population, the Tsimshian-proper. They continued to share the rights and customs of those who are known as the Gitxsan, their kin on the upper Skeena.

The Tsimshian maintained winter villages in and around the islands of Prince Rupert Harbour and Venn Pass (Metlakatla). They returned to their summer villages along the lower Skeena River when the salmon returned. Archaeological evidence shows 5,000 years of continuous habitation in the Prince Rupert region.

Gitxaala might have been the first Tsimshian village contacted by Europeans when Captain Charles Duncan and James Colnett arrived in 1787 although Russian fur traders may have visited northern groups earlier. The confluence of the Skeena and Bulkley Rivers was formerly the site of the Tsimshian village of Kitanmaks and became a new European settlement of Skeena Forks (today known as Hazelton). When the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company moved their fort to modern-day Lax KwÊ¼alaams in 1834, nine Tsimshian tribal chiefs moved to the surrounding area for trade advantage. Many of the Tsimshian peoples in Canada still live in these regions.

Throughout the second half of the 19th century, epidemics of infectious disease contracted from Europeans ravaged their communities, as the First Nations had no acquired immunity to these diseases. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed many of the Tsimshian people. Altogether, one in four Tsimshian died in a series of at least three large-scale outbreaks.

In 1835, the total population of the Tsimshian peoples was estimated at 8,500. By 1885, the population had dropped to 4,500, 817 of whom moved to Alaska two years later following missionary William Duncan.

In the 1880s the Anglican missionary William Duncan, along with a group of the Tsimshian, left Metlakatla, British Columbia and requested settlement on Annette Island from the U.S. government. After gaining approval, the group founded New Metlakatla on Annette Island in southern Alaska. Duncan appealed to Congress to grant the community reservation status, which it did in the late 19th century.

In 1895, the BC Tsimshian population stood at 3,550, while the Alaska Tsimshian population had dropped to 465 by 1900. Some of the Tsimshian had returned south to their homelands on the Skeena. After this low-water point, the Tsimshian population began to grow again, eventually to reach modern numbers comparable to the 1835 population estimate. However, the numbers of the inland Tsimshian peoples are now higher than they were historically, while those of the Southern and Coastal Tsimshian are much lower.

In the 1970s, the Metlakatla Indian Community voted to retain their rights to land and water, and opted out of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA); they have the only Native reservation in Alaska. The Metlakatla Tsimshian maintained their reservation status and holdings exclusive of the ANSCA. They do not have an associated Native Corporation, although Tsimshian in Alaska may be shareholders of the Sealaska Corporation. The Annette Islands Reserve was the only location in Alaska allowed to maintain fish traps according to traditional rights. The use of these were otherwise banned when Alaska became a state in 1959. The traps were used to gather fish for food for people living on the reservation. Legally the community was required to use the traps at least once every three years or lose the right permanently. They stopped the practice early in the 2000s and lost their right to this traditional way of fishing.

The majority of Tsimshian still live in the lower Skeena River watershed near Prince Rupert, as well as northern coastal BC. Some Tsimshian moved south into the Columbia River Basin mid-nineteenth century for picking hops and other agricultural crops. Many Tsimshian have moved into Seattle region from both AK and BC. Long distance canoe travel for a variety of activities was not uncommon prior to contact, and for some duration after contact into the 1920s. A battle ensued at Dungeness Spit near Port Townsend, Washington where some Tsimshian were camped along the shore. One woman survived and was rescued by a lighthouse operator who later married her.

==Culture==
The Tsimshian have a matrilineal kinship system, with a societal structure based on a tribe, house group and clan system. Descent and property are transmitted through the maternal line. Hereditary chiefs obtain their rights through their maternal line through their mother&#x27;s brother. Although it is inherited the protege must be trained for proper behavior and groomed well for specific obligations. No lineage should be sullied by inappropriate behaviors of high-ranking members.

The marriage ceremony was an extremely formal affair, several prolonged and sequential ceremonies. Arranged marriages and births were common to protect rights of access to territories and resources. Some cultural taboos have related to prohibiting women and men from eating improper foods during and after childbirth. Several taboos still exist and are actively practiced.

Like all Northwest Coastal peoples, the Tsimshian harvested the abundant sea life, especially salmon. The Tsimshian became seafaring people, like the Haida. Salmon continues to be at the center of their nutrition, despite large-scale commercial fishing in the area. Due to this abundant food source, the Tsimshian developed permanent towns. They lived in large longhouses, made from cedar house posts and panels to withstand the wet climate. These were very large and usually housed an entire extended family.
Tsimshian religion centered on the &quot;Lord of Heaven&quot;, who aided people in times of need by sending supernatural servants to earth to aid them. The Tsimshian believed that charity and purification of the body (either by cleanliness or fasting) was the route to the afterlife.

The Tsimshian engage in the feast system or potlatch, which they refer to as the &quot;yaawk&quot; (feast) for one specific event. Today in Tsimshian culture, the potlatch is held to honour deaths, burials, and succession to name-titles. The Tsimshian have four different types of feasts. The feast system is the agency for social reproduction, expression of law, the transmission of knowledge, and demonstration of the obligations for chiefs to provide stewardship for resources and attending to needs of communities. The planning and delivery of feast events requires very specific protocols, including those required for the guests. It is untoward to hold out one&#x27;s hand while payments (also known as &#x27;gifts&#x27; by external observers) are being distributed.

The Tsimshian have maintained their fishing and hunting lifestyle (although constrained by colonialism and declining fish and animal population abundances), art and culture, and are working to revitalize the common use of their language. Artists have excelled in traditional mediums and contemporary forms with pieces spread around the world. These artisans practice the tradition of story telling with their chosen mediums.

===Ethnobotany===
Like other coastal peoples, the Tsimshian fashioned most of their goods out of western red cedar, especially its bark. It could be fashioned into tools, clothing, roofing, armour, building materials, and canoe skins. They used cedar in their Chilkat weaving, which they are credited with inventing. They use the berries of Vaccinium Vitis-idaea ssp. minus as food.

==Tribes==
The Tsimshian people of British Columbia encompass fifteen tribes:
* Kitasoo â () together with the Xai&#x27;xais, a Heiltsuk group from Kynoch Inlet, they are part of the Kitasoo/Xaixais First Nation at Klemtu (Klemdulxk / XÅmduulxk), British Columbia.
* Gitga&#x27;at â (), as Gitga&#x27;at First Nation at Hartley Bay (TxaÅgiu / TxaÅgiiw), British Columbia.
* Gitxaala â ( or ), as Gitxaala Nation they live in the village of Kitkatla (LaÌ±x Klan), British Columbia.
* Kitsumkalum â () as Kitsumkalum First Nation, in Terrace, British Columbia.
* Kitselas â () as Kitselas First Nation near Terrace, British Columbia.

Some of the Chiefs of these nine tribes happened to be located at Fort Simpson (later Lax Kw&#x27;alaams, British Columbia) when the Indian Agent assigned reserve communities 
*Giluts&#x27;aaw
*Ginadoiks
*Ginaxangiik
*Gispaxlo&#x27;ots
*Gitando
*Gitlaan
*Gits&#x27;iis
*Gitwilgyoots
*GitzaxÅaaÅ
Other Chiefs were located at the mission created community of Metlakatla, with some subsequently migrating to Metlakatla, Alaska, newest tribe, with lineages from all Tsimshian tribes.

==Clans==
The Tsimshian clans are the
* Gispwudwada (Killer Whale Clan)
* Ganhada (Raven Clan)
* Laxgibuu (Wolf Clan)
* Laxsgiik (Eagle Clan)

===Treaty process===
The Tsimshian wanted to preserve their villages and fishing sites on the Skeena and Nass Rivers as early as 1879. They were not able to begin negotiating a treaty with the Canadian government until July 1983. A decade later, fourteen tribes united to negotiate under the collective name of the Tsimshian Tribal Council. A framework agreement was signed in 1997. Due to litigation by one community for commercial fisheries rights, the federal government forced a confidentiality clause against other communities and caused dissolution of the main treaty group and subsequently the TTC. A subset of the Tsimshian First Nations continues to negotiate with the BC Treaty Commission to reach an Agreement-in-Principle that has alienated most members.

==Language==
The Tsimshian speak a language, called &quot;Sm&#x27;algyax,&quot; which translates as &quot;real or true tongue&quot;. The Tsimshian also speak a language variety similar to Gitxsan and Nisgaâa (two inland Tsimshianic languages), but differentiated from the regional Tsimshian variations. In 2016, only 160 people in Canada were Tsimshian speakers.

Some linguists classify Tsimshian languages as a member of the theoretical Penutian language group.

<text>The NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship is a men&#x27;s professional wrestling world heavyweight championship owned and promoted by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), an American professional wrestling promotion. 

Although formally established in 1948, its lineage has been traditionally traced back to the first World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship, which traces its lineage to the title first awarded to George Hackenschmidt in 1905. This effectively makes it the oldest surviving wrestling championship in the world.

The title began as a governing body&#x27;s world championship and has been competed for in multiple major promotions around the world, including the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (which seceded from the NWA and became World Wide Wrestling Federation, now WWE), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Ring of Honor (ROH), Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and the now-defunct American Wrestling Association (AWA), Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP, later called World Championship Wrestling, WCW), Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW, which seceded from the NWA and later became Extreme Championship Wrestling), World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), and many other defunct wrestling promotions.

In October 2017, the NWA governing body was purchased by Billy Corgan and gradually evolved into a stand alone wrestling promotion with the NWA Worldâs Heavyweight Championship as its premier title.

== History ==

=== Territory era (1948â1985) ===
With many territorial promotions appearing across the United States, the NWA was formed in 1948 as a professional wrestling governing body. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was created that same year. Like franchises, these territories had the option of NWA membership. Member promotions had to recognize the NWA World Heavyweight Champion as world champion while retaining the ability to promote their own top championships. Every year, the NWA World Heavyweight Champion would travel to each territory and defend the title against the territories&#x27; top contender or champion. The purpose of the NWA world champion was to make the top wrestlers of each territory look good, while still upholding the credibility of the world title. The NWA&#x27;s board of directors, composed mostly of territory owners, decided when the title changed hands via a vote.
By the late 1950s, however, the system began to break down. As Lou Thesz continued to hold the title, other popular wrestlers such as Verne Gagne became frustrated over the lack of change. There were also disputes over the number of appearances the champion would make in different regions.

On June 14, 1957, in Chicago, Thesz defended the world title against Canadian wrestler Ãdouard Carpentier in a two out of three falls match. Thesz and Carpentier split the first two falls. In the third fall, Thesz was disqualified by referee Ed Whalen who raised Carpentier&#x27;s hand in victory. The NWA later voided the title change based on the disqualification. Thesz defeated Carpentier by disqualification in a Montreal rematch on July 24. It had been planned that the NWA would present Thesz and Carpentier as rival champions in different cities following a similar pattern to the successful title dispute matches between Thesz and Leo Nomellini in 1955. Carpentier would also be able to make appearances in the U.S. as champion while Thesz was on an overseas tour. However, as a result of various disputes within the NWA, Carpentier&#x27;s manager, wrestling promoter Eddie Quinn, left the organization in August making Carpentier unavailable to the NWA. The organization dealt with the situation by announcing 71 days after Carpentier&#x27;s win in Chicago that it did not recognize Carpentier&#x27;s win and had never recognized it. Quinn started promoting Carpentier as the true NWA world champion based on the match with Thesz. In 1958, Quinn started shopping Carpentier around to promoters interested in leaving the NWA. A victory over Carpentier could give a local champion a credible claim to the world championship of wrestling.

Verne Gagne, who had been trying to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion for some time, defeated Carpentier in Omaha, Nebraska, on August 9, 1958. This was recognized as a title change by NWA affiliate promotions in the state â these promotions would later evolve into the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1960. This disputed Nebraska version of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was later known simply as the Omaha version of the World Heavyweight Championship. The title was unified with the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on September 7, 1963.

The Boston NWA affiliate known as the Atlantic Athletic Commission (AAC) arranged a match between Killer Kowalski and Carpentier in 1958. Kowalski&#x27;s victory created what was after known as the ACC World Heavyweight Championship and later Boston&#x27;s Big Time Wrestling (BTW) Heavyweight Championship.
The &quot;Crown&quot; version of the championship belt debuted in 1959.

The North American Wrestling Alliance (NAWA, later the Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA)) in Los Angeles recognized Carpentier as NWA champion in July 1959 as part of gradually splitting from the NWA. On June 12, 1961, Carpentier lost a match to Freddie Blassie which created the basis for the Los Angeles version of the WWA World Heavyweight Championship. The title ceased to exist when the WWA returned to the NWA on October 1, 1968.

The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), which later evolved into today&#x27;s WWE, was the major wrestling promotion in the northeast United States in the early 1960s. Vincent J. McMahon&#x27;s Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC), the precursor to the WWWF, seceded from the NWA for a variety of reasons including the selection of the NWA World Heavyweight Champion and the number of dates wrestled by the champion in the promotion. Ostensibly, the dispute was over Buddy Rogers losing the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Lou Thesz in one fall instead of a best-of-three; the format in which NWA World Heavyweight Championship matches were traditionally decided at the time. This one fall match was sanctioned by NWA promoters, despite objections from CWC executives, who held majority control over the NWA board of directors at the time. Following Lou Thesz&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship win, CWC seceded from the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Rogers was then recognized as the first WWWF World Heavyweight Champion.

The &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot; (also known as the &quot;Domed Globe Belt&quot;) version of the championship belt debuted on July 20, 1973, having been first presented to Harley Race by then-NWA President Sam Muchnick.

When Jim Crockett Promotions wrestler Ric Flair won the NWA World title in 1981, he traveled to other NWA territories and defended the belt. He would drop the belt and regain it, as the NWA board of directors decided. On more than one occasion, however, Flair lost and regained the belt without the official sanctioning of the NWA. In most cases (such as the case of Jack Veneno&#x27;s championship victory), these switches continue to be ignored by the NWA. However, since 2015, the NWA has occasionally recognized the unauthorized Flair-Race switches that had occurred in March 1984 in New Zealand and Singapore.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1985â1988) ===

By early 1985, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) controlled many NWA territories and limited championship matches to performers under contract with JCP thus making the title exclusive to the promotion.

The &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot; version of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt debuted on February 14, 1986, at Battle of the Belts II, an event co-promoted by Championship Wrestling from Florida and JCP. At the event, NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair successfully defended the title against Barry Windham.

It was during this time that JCP made a failed bid to go national and almost filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to compete with the WWF. Turner Broadcasting purchased the company, because it had a high rated program airing on the WTBS cable station. Completing the deal in November 1988, Turner began changing the company to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which maintained a partnership with the NWA and continued promoting the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1988â1993) ===
WCW stayed in the NWA, but Turner slowly phased out the NWA name. The NWA organization existed only on paper at this point; on television, it was portrayed that, by early 1991, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship had become the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.
Due to a falling out with WCW Executive Vice-President Jim Herd, WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair was fired from WCW on July 1, 1991, while still being recognized as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Flair took the NWA belt with him because WCW and Herd had not returned the $25,000 bond Flair had paid on the belt. After Flair&#x27;s departure from WCW, the company had made a new, separate WCW World title belt. A match was held for the vacated WCW World Heavyweight Championship within two weeks of the departure, but no mention was made of the NWA title. Flair was stripped of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by NWA&#x27;s board of directors shortly after he signed with the WWF in September 1991; an NWA board had to be reconstituted, as most members had gone out of business or been bought out by JCP/WCW. Flair displayed the Big Gold Belt on WWF television, calling himself the &quot;Real World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion&quot;. After winning the WWF Championship, Flair&#x27;s &quot;Real World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion&quot; belt was dropped. WCW, which had subsequently filed a lawsuit against the WWF to prevent them from using the Big Gold Belt on television, eventually dropped the action because the belt was returned to WCW in July 1992.

In August 1992, the NWA board authorized WCW and New Japan Pro-Wrestling to hold a tournament to decide a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion using the Big Gold Belt, now returned to WCW by the WWF. Turner&#x27;s company still maintained its WCW World Championship, thus having two World Heavyweight titles present in the same promotion. The tournament was won by Japanese wrestler Masahiro Chono. From 1992 to 1993, the NWA belt was defended in Japan and on WCW television. Flair returned to WCW and regained the NWA belt from Barry Windham in July 1993; that same year, WCW recognized the Ric Flair-Tatsumi Fujinami NWA title changes from 1991. Disputes between WCW management and the NWA board began emerging in the summer of 1993 over a variety of issues, primarily a storyline by WCW that would have had the NWA title switch to Rick Rude.

On September 1, 1993, WCW withdrew their membership from the NWA but kept the NWA title belt which they owned. A court battle decided that WCW could not continue to use the letters &quot;NWA&quot; to describe or promote the belt, but ruled that WCW did possess a right to the physical Big Gold Belt and its historical lineage per a signed agreement between the previous NWA President Seiji Sakaguchi and WCW. Per this court ruling, the title belt dropped the recognition as being the NWA World Heavyweight title but continued to be billed as the World Heavyweight Championship by WCW. Soon after, the Big Gold Belt was defended without any company affiliation, even being referred to simply as the Big Gold Belt for a short time, until it became known as the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship. This title was recognized as the championship of a fictitious entity known as &quot;WCW International&quot;, which served as a replacement for the NWA Board, until the title was unified with the main WCW title on June 23, 1994.

=== ECW, WWF, and the independent circuit (1993â2002) ===
Despite losing WCW as its flagship promotion, the NWA picked up new members and remained in existence as a governing body. After nearly a year, the organization planned to scheduled a tournament to crown a new champion and brought back the &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot; to represent this new champion.
By 1994, the Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) territory became the NWA&#x27;s most televised affiliated wrestling promotion. The NWA decided to hold an NWA World Title Tournament through ECW at the ECW Arena in August 1994, which was won by Shane Douglas. Due to a dispute between NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo and ECW owner Tod Gordon, after the match, Douglas threw the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt down and picked up the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt, proclaiming himself ECW World champion. Almost immediately thereafter ECW withdrew from the NWA and became Extreme Championship Wrestling, with Coralluzzo stripping Douglas of the NWA title.

Despite this blow to the organization, the NWA held another tournament three months later in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, hosted by Coralluzzo and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) owner Jim Cornette. Chris Candido won this tournament and the title was recognized and defended in promotions such as SMW and the United States Wrestling Association. Candido held the belt for a few months before dropping it to Dan Severn of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in February 1995. Severn held the belt continuously for four years, appearing on both wrestling and UFC events with the NWA World championship belt. Although Severn had attempted to go the &quot;traveling champion&quot; route done by former champions Thesz, Dory Funk, Jr., Harley Race, and Terry Funk, the competition level was relatively minor due to the lack of strong NWA territories.

It was during this time, Severn had a customized NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt made exclusively for him.

Trying to get back in the national spotlight, the NWA made a deal in 1997 with Vincent K. McMahon to appear on World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television. In 1998, NWA World champion Dan Severn became part of Jim Cornette&#x27;s NWA faction. Also part of Cornette&#x27;s NWA faction was NWA North American Champion Jeff Jarrett, who won the vacant title by defeating Barry Windham on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. The NWA&#x27;s deal with the WWF never accomplished its intended purpose of reestablishing the NWA as a major force in wrestling and McMahon ended it in less than a year. The NWA belt went back to being defended on the independent circuit and in the remaining NWA territories.

In 1999, Severn lost the title to former Olympic judoka Naoya Ogawa, and the title picture became slightly more competitive. The champions nonetheless remained wrestlers from independent promotions, regardless of whether they were from North America (Severn, Mike Rapada, Sabu), Asia (Ogawa, Shinya Hashimoto), or Europe (Gary Steele).

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002â2007) ===

In June 2002, Jeff and Jerry Jarrett formed NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA; was known as Impact Wrestling 2017-2024). The Jarretts worked out a licensing deal with the NWA and its affiliated promotions, with NWA-TNA receiving control over the NWA World Heavyweight and NWA World Tag Team titles. While working out a cable deal, the Jarretts put NWA-TNA on weekly pay-per-view during the company&#x27;s first two years of existence. The NWA World Heavyweight Champion at the time, Dan Severn, was unable to appear on the inaugural NWA-TNA PPV card, and he was stripped of the NWA title. Ken Shamrock was then declared the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after winning a Gauntlet for the Gold battle royal. In 2004, NWA-TNA withdrew from the NWA, dropping the NWA from their promotion name and becoming known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). However, TNA retained the rights to use the NWA World Heavyweight and Tag Team titles until May 13, 2007, when the agreement ended, with TNA creating its own World and Tag Team championships. 

During this agreement, TNA co-founder Jeff Jarrett would hold the title the most often with six reigns, followed by A.J. Styles with three, and lastly Ron Killings and Christian Cage with two reigns each. During the TNA years, a title change unauthorized by the NWA took place on an International Wrestling Association event in Puerto Rico, where Ray GonzÃ¡lez pinned Jarrett to win the championship before being stripped of the title later on the same event. While the GonzÃ¡lez title change was initially ignored by both the NWA and TNA, beginning in 2015, the NWA has occasionally recognized GonzÃ¡lez as a former NWA champion. This makes GonzÃ¡lez the first Caribbean wrestler to be recognized as NWA World champion (the reigns of Caribbean wrestlers Jack Veneno and Carlos ColÃ³n remain unrecognized).

=== Return to the independent circuit (2007â2017) ===

On May 22, 2007, the NWA announced a tournament, titled Reclaiming the Glory, to fill the title vacancy left after the end of the NWA&#x27;s relationship with TNA. Sixteen men competed for the championship, with Adam Pearce, filling in for an injured Bryan Danielson, winning the belt by defeating Brent Albright on September 1, 2007, in BayamÃ³n, Puerto Rico. Pearce was active in defending the championship but suffered from the same problems that had plagued other champions in the post-1980s NWA: a lack of stable promotions within the NWA made it difficult to have a &quot;traveling champion&quot;, so most of Pearce&#x27;s defenses took place in the NWA Pro promotion owned by David Marquez and John Rivera.

On June 7, 2008, at the Ring of Honor (ROH) event, Respect is Earned II, Pearce revealed the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt at the conclusion of his match, with the championship receiving official recognition from ROH shortly after.

On October 25, 2008, Blue Demon Jr. became the first Mexican professional wrestler, as well as first masked &quot;luchador&quot;, to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when he defeated champion Adam Pearce in Mexico City.

In early-to-mid-2012, NWA champion Colt Cabana and Adam Pearce began facing each other in a series of matches dubbed the &quot;Seven Levels of Hate&quot; â a best of seven series between the two wrestlers. The fourth match of the series was a two out of three falls contest held on July 21, 2012, in Kansas City, Missouri. The NWA sanctioned the match as a world championship match and Pearce emerged victorious to become a five-time world champion. Both wrestlers were tied at three matches apiece when the NWA underwent another major change.

In August 2012, International Wrestling Corp, LLC, a holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe, sued the NWA, two of its recent Executive Directors (Robert Trobich and David Baucom) and its then-parent company, Pro Wrestling Organization LLC, claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA&#x27;s liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA from Pro Wrestling Organization LLC to International Wrestling Corp, LLC. After 64 years, the new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model, licensing the NWA brand name to wrestling promotions which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including some of the largest remaining NWA affiliated promotions.

With both Cabana and Pearce even at three victories in their âSeven Levels of Hateâ series, the final match was scheduled for October 27, 2012, in Melbourne, Australia, at an NWA Warzone Wrestling event. Pearce wanted the NWA to sanction the match as a world title match, as they had done earlier. The NWA, however, refused to do this and did not want Pearce and Cabana to go forward with the match. They did anyway, with Cabana winning the match. Pearce and Cabana both broke kayfabe after the match, with Pearce saying that Cabana was the rightful champion and Cabana saying that he did not want the title as it was about the past and he was about the future. Pearce declared he did not want the title either and left it in the ring as the two exited the arena.

=== Lightning One (2017âpresent) ===
On May 1, 2017, Billy Corgan&#x27;s company, Lightning One, Inc., purchased the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), including its name, rights, trademarks, and championships. Corgan&#x27;s ownership took effect on October 1, 2017. At that point, all existing NWA affiliation agreements were ended and all NWA championships, except the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (renamed the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship) and the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship, would be vacated in the months following the acquisition. 
On October 20, 2017, the NWA debuted the YouTube series, &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot;, focused primarily around the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion at the time Tim Storm, chronicling his travels across the United States, and defenses of the championship. Continuing to operate as a governing body, Billy Corgan&#x27;s NWA worked collaboratively with various promotions to sanction Storm&#x27;s championship matches.

On December 9, 2017, Nick Aldis won the championship from Storm on a Combat Zone Wrestling show. Since the championship change, &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot; focused on &quot;The Aldis Crusade&quot;, a series of 20 title defenses over the course of 60 days in the spring of 2018 and concluding with a title defense against Colt Cabana in Wenzhou, China.

&quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot;, together with the &quot;Being The Elite&quot; web series produced by The Young Bucks, then focused on the build towards a championship match between Aldis and Cody as part of the All In supercard event on September 1, 2018, where Cody would win the match and the championship. &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot; continued to cover subsequent defenses at the NWA 70th Anniversary Show, the New Year&#x27;s Clash pop-up event, and the 2019 Crockett Cup.

By July 2019, the NWA would begin to transition into a singular wrestling promotion, with the NWA announcing television tapings in Atlanta for a new standalone weekly series. The series was later revealed as &quot;NWA Powerrr&quot;, which has since hosted occasional NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship matches.

During the October 15, 2019 episode of &quot;Powerrr&quot;, it was announced that the NWA would be holding a pay-per-view (PPV) called Into the Fire on December 14, 2019. This would be the first PPV event produced exclusively by the NWA without another promotion or production companyâs involvement. At the event, NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion Nick Aldis defeated James Storm to remain the champion.

==Belt designs==
There have been six belt designs used to represent the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship.

===1948â1949=== 

The first design was only held by the very first NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion, Orville Brown. This belt consisted of one metal plate with a picture frame at the center. It had gemstones of various sizes around the edges of the belt, with the center featuring larger stones. The belt was retired after Orville&#x27;s accident, and it remains with the Brown family.

===1949â1959===

The second design is often referred to as the &quot;Lou Thesz Belt&quot;. The championship belt, which was a holdover from Thesz&#x27;s reign as the National Wrestling Association&#x27;s champion, consisted of seven plates and a leather strap. The main plate had a royal crown, a wrestling ring, and a five-pointed star in a vertical alignment, top to bottom down the center. A belt with a similar design was given to RikidÅzan when he defeated Thesz in 1958 to claim the NWA International Heavyweight Championship, which RikidÅzan in turn held until his death in 1963. RikidÅzan&#x27;s NWA International Heavyweight Championship design subsequently inspired the designs of All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s PWF World Heavyweight Championship and the main plate of the later Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship belt. In 1992, Thesz lent the original &quot;Lou Thesz Belt&quot; to the Union of Professional Wrestling Forces International (UWFi) to represent their Pro-Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. Nobuhiko Takada and Super Vader were the only wrestlers to hold the belt in UWFi, as Thesz withdrew from UWFi in 1995 due to his disagreement over the company co-promoting with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, taking the belt with him.

===1959â1973===
The third design is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Crown Belt&quot;. It had a prominent royal crown at its top, a globe underneath it, and the letters &quot;NWA&quot; horizontally across the center behind two wrestlers. The design was later used to represent the NWA United National Championship (which later became part of the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship), the Japanese version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship, the championships of Blue Demon Jr.&#x27;s NWA Mexico territory, the Tenryu Project&#x27;s United National Tag Team Championship, and the current version of the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship.

===1973â1986, 1994âpresent=== 
The fourth design is commonly referred to as the &quot;Ten Pounds of Gold&quot; or the âDomed Globe Beltâ. It is the design most commonly identified with the title. It has also been referred to on &quot;Championship Wrestling from Hollywood&quot;, &quot;NWA Powerrr&quot;, and in other NWA-related media as &quot;Sweet Charlotte&quot;, a nickname coined by Adam Pearce in 2008 as a nod to the hometown of Ric Flair, one of the belt&#x27;s most famous holders. The original Ten Pounds of Gold belt was made in 1973 by an unidentified jeweler in Mexico â similar belts were made for the NWA&#x27;s Mexican-based World Light Heavyweight, Middleweight and Welterweight titles. The Domed Globe NWA World Heavyweight title featured the flag of the United States on its main plate, as well as those of Mexico, Canada, Australia, and Japan on its side plates. The second side plate on the left side of the belt featured a modified version of the older Canadian Red Ensign rather than the official Canadian flag, the Maple Leaf, which had been adopted in 1965. The belt originally had a red suede/velvet strap along with a nameplate. The nameplate was only used once, by Jack Brisco, before it was removed from the design. The red leather strap was replaced with a black laced leather strap soon into Brisco&#x27;s reign due to the material lacking durability. The original Domed Globe Belt was retired in 1986; Ric Flair retained possession of the original belt. It is currently located at WWE&#x27;s Connecticut headquarters. This design was revived in 1994 with a new belt that continues to represent the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship presently. In 2021, the NWA replaced the Australian flag side plate with a United Kingdom flag side plate, at the request of then-champion Nick Aldis. The Mexican-based lower weight classes Domed Globe championship belts featured the flag of Mexico on their main plates instead of the U.S. flag. From 1995 to 1997, the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship also had a Domed Globe design, as part of the J-Crown, with the U.S. flag in front; briefly during the 2010s, the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship once again had a Domed Globe design. During the mid-1990s, the NWA World Tag Team Championship was represented by Domed Globe belts, which were used during the NWA&#x27;s partnership with IWA Japan. Numerous other championship belts have used the Domed Globe design, with some being NWA-sanctioned championships (such as the NWA Women&#x27;s Pacific Championship) and others being unauthorized by the NWA (such as the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship).

===1986â1993===

The fifth design is commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot;. In 1985, Jim Crockett Jr. of Jim Crockett Promotions commissioned Charles Crumrine, a silversmith in Reno, Nevada specializing in rodeo-style belt buckles, to produce the new design. The belt made its debut in February 1986. When WCW left the NWA in 1993, the Big Gold Belt continued serving as the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, then the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (which it is most commonly known for), and eventually as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE. Also in WWE, the Big Gold Belt was used in tandem to represent the then-Undisputed WWF Championship after the former WCW Championship was unified with the then-WWF World Championship in 2001, and then again in tandem to represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship after the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship in 2013. The Big Gold Belt was eventually retired in August 2014.

===1998===
The sixth design was a customized belt commissioned for Dan Severn during his first reign as NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion, to celebrate the NWA&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Severn would wear this version of the belt during his brief apparence on WWF television during a brief inter-promotional angle between the NWA and WWF.

== Reigns ==

The NWA currently recognizes 102 individual World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship reigns.

The inaugural champion was Orville Brown. The longest reigning champion is Lou Thesz, who held the title from November 27, 1949 to March 15, 1956, for a total of 2,300 days (6 years, 3 months, and 16 days); Thesz also holds the record for longest combined reign at 3,749 days. Shane Douglas and Ray GonzÃ¡lez share the record for the shortest reign as champion, with both men holding the title for less than 1 day. Ric Flair holds the record for most reigns with 9, The youngest champion is Chris Candido who won the title at the age of 22, while the oldest champion is Tim Storm, who won it at the age of 51.

Thom Latimer is the current champion, in his first reign. He won the title by defeating EC3 at NWA 76th Anniversary Show on August 31, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>The Beloved are a British electronic music group best known for the singles &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot;, &quot;The Sun Rising&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Your Love Takes Me Higher&quot;, and &quot;Satellite&quot;.

Originally a post-punk/new wave band formed in 1983, they underwent a change of direction in the late 1980s to a house/alternative dance sound and experienced chart success in the UK and elsewhere.

==History==
===Formation===
According to a commonly known account of the group&#x27;s formation, Jon Marsh placed an advertisement in the music press in 1983, which read as follows:

&quot;I am Jon Marsh, founder member of The Beloved. Should you too wish to do something gorgeous, meet me in exactly three years&#x27; time at exactly 11 a.m. in Diana&#x27;s Diner, or site thereof, Covent Garden, London, WC2&quot;.
However, Marsh confirmed in 2017 that this was a story made up for a press release.

Marsh first met Steve Waddington when he joined the band Twelfth of August as an additional guitarist. Within a few months, Marsh suggested they leave and start their own band. Calling themselves The Journey Through in 1983, they recruited bass player Timothy Havard and began writing and rehearsing; occasionally playing live, with keyboard player Bill Anderson. Waddington was singer and principal songwriter. By early 1984 they were The Beloved; Waddington still the frontman, but Marsh singing on several songs and Havard and Marsh beginning to take over most of the songwriting. By the autumn Marsh was the lead singer, still drumming on demos and in rehearsal. He waited outside the BBC, Portland Place one night and gave a demo tape to John Peel. Within a fortnight they had been booked for a session. Marsh&#x27;s school friend, Guy Gausden, had played drums with them at a couple of gigs and they persuaded him to join as a permanent member. Having barely rehearsed, and with two brand new songs out of four, they debuted as a four-piece on BBC Radio 1 on 8 January 1985.

===Initial indie success===
A second Peel session followed in October 1985 and soon afterwards their first single, &quot;A Hundred Words&quot;, was released in April 1986. A summation of this stage of their career can be found on a compilation album, &quot;Where It Is&quot;, which is a compilation of previously released material, consisting of singles and related B-sides, pressed onto one individual long playing work. The record includes all the early singles, &quot;A Hundred Words&quot;, &quot;This Means War&quot;, the double A-side &quot;Surprise Me&quot; / &quot;Forever Dancing&quot; and the EP &quot;Happy Now&quot;, all released throughout 1986 and 1987, all making the top 30 in the UK Indie Chart, and all failing in the UK Singles Chart.

===Change in direction and &quot;Happiness&quot;===
Havard left the band in July 1987. The remaining three members began work on a new album. However, due to a lack of money to produce the album, it was shelved and Gausden departed in late 1987. Back down to a duo of Marsh and Waddington only, The Beloved began to embrace a dance sound more wholeheartedly after taking influence from freestyle and hip-hop music in &quot;Forever Dancing&quot;. Now signed to WEA (now Warner Music Group), the single &quot;Loving Feeling&quot; was released in October 1988. It did not fare very well in the charts but its B-side &quot;Acid Love&quot; garnered moderate success in clubs. The single &quot;Your Love Takes Me Higher&quot; was released in January 1989 and did not chart but was more successful than &quot;Loving Feeling&quot;, peaking at number 91 on the UK Singles Chart. In October of the same year the single &quot;The Sun Rising&quot; was released and became a club favourite, crossing over to the UK top 40, peaking at number 26 in November 1989.

This was followed in February 1990 by their first studio album, &quot;Happiness&quot;, the first and only album Marsh and Waddington released as a duo, and the first consisting wholly of previously unreleased new songs, from which the hit single &quot;Hello&quot; was also released. &quot;Hello&quot; became The Beloved&#x27;s first international hit, and reached number 19 in the UK. This song&#x27;s lyrics mostly consist of names of real or fictional people, groups and institutions, representing the band&#x27;s wide-ranging selection of heroes, villains, and a few of their friends. Saint Peter and Saint Paul, house music with Kym Mazelle and Paris Grey; literature with Jean Paul Sartre rhymed with the writer and disgraced former politician Jeffrey Archer; talk radio with Brian Hayes and Marsh&#x27;s childhood hero, Crystal Palace FC football player Vince Hilaire. The LP included two more singles, a re-release of &quot;Your Love Takes Me Higher,&quot; which this time made the UK top 40, and the final cut, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, which was only a minor hit in the UK, reaching number 48.

A brand new song, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Now&quot;, which also failed to make the top 40, stopping at number 48 in the UK, was released to promote a remix album, titled &quot;Blissed Out&quot;, released in November 1990. Almost all of the songs from the &quot;Happiness&quot; album were featured on &quot;Blissed Out&quot; in one or more remixed versions, along with another mix of &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Now,&quot; and some previously exclusively non-album tracks. The work was released in three different editions, varying in length and track listing, depending upon the format. The vinyl LP, the shortest, includes 8 tracks; the CD version features 11 tracks; and the MC edition contains 16 tracks.

===Further success: &quot;Conscience&quot; and &quot;X&quot;===
&quot;It&#x27;s Alright Now&quot; and &quot;Blissed Out&quot; were the last works made by Marsh with Waddington at the time. By 1991, Waddington had left the group, and they re-emerged in 1993 with Jon&#x27;s wife Helena involved as co-writer and co-producer for a second studio album, &quot;Conscience&quot;. The band received airplay with the video of the first single, &quot;Sweet Harmony,&quot; despite the entire cast being naked (shot and edited showing nothing that might cause it to be censored). One of the models in this video is television presenter Tess Daly. &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot;, which was originally used to promote the second season of the popular American soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in several European countries, has since been used in advertising for British home improvement chain Homebase as well.

While &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot; went on to become their biggest hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in 1993, the other two tracks taken from the &quot;Conscience&quot; album, did not achieve the former&#x27;s success. The double A-side single &quot;Celebrate Your Life&quot; / &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Me Thinking&quot; peaked at number 23, and &quot;Outerspace Girl&quot; peaked at number 38. &quot;Rock to the Rhythm of Love&quot; was also released as a single, however, only in the US. The album itself reached no. 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

After &quot;Conscience&quot;, a third studio album entitled &quot;X&quot; was released in 1996. Though the record peaked at number 25 in the UK Albums Chart, and three singles were released from it, only the first, &quot;Satellite&quot;, made the top 20, peaking at number 19; while the second, &quot;Deliver Me&quot;, failed to chart and was withdrawn shortly after release in the UK because of a lack of radio play â and the third, &quot;Ease the Pressure&quot;, did not enter the UK top 40, stalling at number 43. To date, &quot;X&quot; is the last original album from the group. This album includes soundscapes by Robert Fripp.

===Later activity===
After &quot;X&quot;, the compilation &quot;Single File&quot; followed in 1997, promoted by a re-release of &quot;The Sun Rising&quot; (which reached number 31, only five positions lower than the original 1989 release) which included some new remixes.

Jon and Helena released several underground 12&quot; singles in the following years under different names, including: &quot;It&#x27;s a Universal Thing&quot; / &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, &quot;Stella Does Tricks&quot; and &quot;Density&quot; (1998, 2000, 2001, as Adam &amp; Eve); &quot;Ride with Me&quot; (1998, as Lucky Hole); &quot;Baby Sheik&quot; (1998, as The London Authority); and &quot;King of Deep&quot; / &quot;Peking Dub&quot; (2003, as Deepo King). Jon also released two further Beloved singles in 2000: &quot;With You&quot;, a cover version of Sparks&#x27; 1981 song &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot;, which was originally recorded for a tribute album, and &quot;Timeslip&quot;.

Starting in the late 1990s, Marsh became a well-respected club DJ, holding monthly residencies at Ministry of Sound between 1994 and 1998, and Fabric between 1999 and 2004. He played all over the UK and Europe and regularly featured in techno compilations by Fabric until he stopped in the late 2000s to focus more on his family. He has also collaborated with original band member Steve Waddington and others on new material, most of which remains unreleased.

== Digital releases and special editions ==
Marsh has been uploading the band&#x27;s discography on streaming services such as Spotify throughout the late 2010s, including rare remixes that were previously only available on limited edition 12&quot; records. In April 2019, the first single released under the Beloved name since 2000 was released for Record Store Day, &quot;Your Love Takes Me Higher (Evil Mix)&quot; / &quot;Awoke&quot;, released by the band&#x27;s new label New State Music. The first track was a previously unreleased remix of &quot;Your Love Takes Me Higher&quot; from 1988 and the second, &quot;Awoke&quot;, was a previously unreleased and unnamed song from late 1990, intended for use on a direct follow-up to &quot;Happiness&quot; which was shelved. The single was only physically released on 12&quot; vinyl and only had 1,500 copies pressed.

On 31 January 2020, a remastered re-release of &quot;Where It Is&quot; was released both on streaming platforms and as a 2-CD physical set. It contains 31 total tracks, with bonus demos and alternate versions of tracks, along with an extensive booklet containing previously unseen photos of and in-depth information on that incarnation of the band, written by Tim Havard. This re-release peaked at number 88 on the UK Physical Albums Chart. A similar re-release of &quot;Happiness&quot; was also released on 7 August 2020, with booklet notes written by Jon Marsh. This peaked at number 77 on the UK Albums Chart, number 8 on the UK Physical Albums Chart and reached number 1 on the UK Dance Chart.

==Collaborations with other artists or bands==
Both Marsh and Waddington have collaborated with other artists or bands. Waddington co-wrote, co-produced, and contributed guitar to the System 7 track &quot;Habibi&quot;. Marsh has contributed vocals to tracks from Laid and Luke Solomon, as well as remixing other artists including Depeche Mode. He also worked with Bent on &quot;Beautiful Otherness&quot; from their 2003 album The Everlasting Blink and &quot;We Watch the Stars&quot;, which was released in 2013.
In 2020 Marsh gave vocals to &quot;Sky&#x27;s The Limit&quot;, a track released on Westbam&#x27;s album Famous Last Songs Vol. 1 (2021).

<text>Sir George Howard Darwin (9 July 1845 â 7 December 1912) was an English barrister and astronomer, the second son and fifth child of Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin.

==Biography==

George H. Darwin was born 9 July 1845 at Down House, Kent, the fifth child of biologist Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin.

From the age of 11 he studied under Charles Pritchard at Clapham Grammar School, and entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1863, though he soon moved to Trinity College, where his tutor was Edward John Routh. He graduated BA in mathematics in 1868 (as second wrangler), when he was also placed second for the Smith&#x27;s Prize and was appointed to a college fellowship. He became M.A. in 1871. He was admitted to the bar in 1872, but returned to science. 
George Darwin conducted studies into the prevalence and health outcomes of contemporary first-cousin marriages (such as his parentsâ) in Great Britain. His father Charles had become concerned after the death of three of his children, including his favourite daughter, Annie, from tuberculosis in 1851, that his and Emma&#x27;s union may have been a mistake from a biological perspective. He was reassured by George&#x27;s results.

==Darwinian mechanics==

Although George Darwin was the son of the famous geologist turned biologist, Charles Darwin, rather than moving predominantly into the field of biology, George kept his focus on geology. Subsequently, his efforts within geology caused him to stumble onto many seemingly radical ideas, some of which were related to the notion that preserved within the physical structure of the planet was the mechanical energy (or the collective inertial motion), which may have allowed an ancient rapidly spinning Earth to somehow expel a piece of its mass, and it was this expelled mass which later congealed to create the natural satellite that was now in orbit around the Earth. So, before the Apollo mission and the rise to prominence of the relativistic notion that the origin of the Moon was due in part to collisions within a very active protoplanetary disk, there was a radically different depiction of lunar and planetary evolution, which was proposed by George Darwin, in 1879, called the Fission Theory.

In 1879, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1884 and their Copley Medal in 1911. He delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1891 on the subject of &quot;tidal prediction&quot;.

In 1883 Darwin became Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. He studied tidal forces involving the Sun, Moon, and Earth, and formulated the fission theory of Moon formation.

Darwin was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) and won the Gold Medal of the RAS in 1892. He was elected to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1898. From 1899â1901 he served as President of the RAS. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1904. The RAS founded a prize lectureship in 1984 and named it the George Darwin Lectureship in Darwin&#x27;s honour.

He was an invited speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians 1908, Rome on the topic of &quot;&quot;Mechanics, Physical Mathematics, Astronomy&quot;.&quot; As President of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, he also gave the Introductory Address to the Congress in 1912 on the character of pure and applied mathematics.

He received the degree of &quot;Doctor mathematicae (honoris causa)&quot; from the Royal Frederick University in Oslo on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Darwin crater on Mars is named after him.

==Family==

Darwin married Martha (Maud) du Puy, the daughter of Charles du Puy of Philadelphia, in 1884; his wife was a member of the Ladies Dining Society in Cambridge, with 11 other members.

She died on 6 February 1947. They had three sons and two daughters:

* Gwen Raverat (1885â1957), artist.
* Sir Charles Galton Darwin (1887â1962), physicist and applied mathematician.
* Margaret Elizabeth Darwin (1890â1974), married Sir Geoffrey Keynes.
* William Robert Darwin (1894â1970)
* Leonard Darwin (1899â1899)

George and Maud Darwin bought Newnham Grange, Cambridge in 1885. The Darwins extensively remodelled the house. Since 1962 the Grange has been part of Darwin College, Cambridge.

He is buried in Trumpington Extension Cemetery in Cambridge with his son Leonard and his daughter Gwen (Raverat), whilst his wife Lady Maud Darwin was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium; his brothers Sir Francis Darwin and Sir Horace Darwin and their respective wives are interred in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground.

<text>Honolulu Hale (originally called the Honolulu Municipal Building), located on 530 South King Street in downtown Honolulu in the City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii, is the official seat of government of the city and county, site of the chambers of the Mayor of Honolulu and the Honolulu City Council.

In the Hawaiian language, &quot;hale&quot; (pronounced HAH-leh) means house or building. &quot;Honolulu Hale&quot; means &quot;Honolulu House&quot; (although the Hawaiian language word order would be &quot;Hale Honolulu&quot;). In 1978, it was listed as a contributing property to the Hawaii Capital Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Honolulu Hale was an idea started by Joseph J. Fern. Before becoming a mayor-council type of government, Honolulu was administered by the Board of Supervisors. After the creation of the now-defunct County of Oahu, the Board of Supervisors met in city halls located in various downtown Honolulu locations. Supervisor Fern had a vision of a permanent home for the fledgling municipal government, which had only been created in 1900 upon passage of the Hawaiian Organic Act. When the County of Oahu and the Board of Supervisors dissolved in 1907 and established the City &amp; County of Honolulu, Fern became its first mayor and began making preliminary plans for the construction of a city hall. Unfortunately, Fern died in 1920 of diabetes before he could persuade residents of the need for a permanent city hall. Mayor John H. Wilson, who was also the Honolulu Chapter President of the American Association of Engineers, carried on Fern&#x27;s dream.

Honolulu Hale was finally completed in 1928 with the help of every major architect in townâC.W. Dickey, Hart Wood, Robert Miller, and Rothwell Kangeter &amp; Lesterâbut did not open for business until the following year. It was built in an Italianate Spanish Colonial Revival style that was popular in the islands at the time. Its interior courtyard, staircase, and open ceiling were modeled after the Bargello in Florence. Einar Peterson was commissioned to paint frescoes in the interior while Mario Valdastri was commissioned to install intricate stonework. In 1951, two three-story wings were added to the original structure.

A new, high-rise Honolulu Municipal Building was later constructed at 650 South King Street. In 2006, it was renamed the Frank F. Fasi Municipal Building in honor of Frank Fasi, the city&#x27;s longest-serving mayor.

Surrounding Honolulu Hale are other prominent historic and artistic landmarks: AliiÅlani Hale, Hawaii State Capitol, Iolani Palace, Kawaiahao Church, &quot;Sky Gate&quot; (a high sculpture by Isamu Noguchi), and the Territorial Building.

<text>Andrew Rainsford Wetmore (August 16, 1820 â March 7, 1892) was a New Brunswick politician, jurist, and a member of a prominent United Empire Loyalist family.

Wetmore entered politics in 1865 with his election to the colonial legislature as an Anti-Confederate. His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn&#x27;t get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party&#x27;s government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the House of Commons of Canada, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867.

Wetmore&#x27;s government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands.

On May 25, 1870, he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.

<text>The reddish egret (Egretta rufescens) is a medium-sized heron that is a resident breeder in Central America, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, the Gulf Coast of the United States (primarily Texas), and Mexico. The egret is known for its unusual foraging behavior compared to other herons as well as its association with mud flats, its habitat of choice. 

In the past, this bird was a victim of the plume trade and is North Americaâs &quot;rarest and least studied ardeid.&quot;

==Taxonomy==
The reddish egret was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons, cranes and egrets in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea rufescens&quot;. Gmelin based his description on that of the English ornithologist John Latham who in 1785 had included the species in his multi-volume &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had in turn based his own description on the &quot;L&#x27;Aigrette rousse, de la Louisiane&quot; that the French polymath Comte de Buffon had described and illustrated in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The reddish egret is now placed with 12 other species in the genus &quot;Egretta&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster. The genus name comes from the ProvenÃ§al French word for the little egret, &quot;aigrette&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;aigron&quot;, &quot;heron&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;rufescens&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;reddish&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. r. rufescens&quot; (Gmelin 1789) â south USA, West Indies and Mexico
* &quot;E. r. dickeyi&quot; (Van Rossem, 1926) â Baja California (Mexico)

==Description==

This species reaches in length, with a wingspan. Body mass in this species can range from . Among standard linear measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It is a medium-sized, long-legged, long-necked heron with a long pointed pinkish bill with a black tip. It is distinctly larger than other co-existing members of the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;, but smaller than the great blue heron and great egret. The legs and feet are bluish-black. While the sexes are similar, there are two distinct color morphs. The adult dark morph has a slate blue body and reddish head and neck with shaggy plumes. The adult white morph has entirely white body plumage. Young birds have a brown body, head, and neck. During mating, the male&#x27;s plumage stands out in a ruff on its head, neck and back. The bird&#x27;s usual cry is a low, guttural croak.

==Behavior==
The reddish egret is considered one of the most active herons, and is often seen on the move. It stalks its prey (fish, frogs, crustaceans, and insects) in shallow water, typically near mud flats, while frequently running energetically and using the shadow of its wings to reduce glare on the water once it is in position to spear its prey. Due to its bold, rapacious yet graceful feeding behavior and its typical proximity to mud flats, author Pete Dunne nicknamed the reddish egret &quot;the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; of the Flats&quot;.

===Breeding===
The reddish egret is a resident breeder in Central America, The Bahamas, the Caribbean, the Gulf Coast of the United States, and Mexico. Its breeding habitat is tropical swamps. It nests in colonies, often with other herons, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. These colonies are usually located on coastal islands. In Texas, however, these nests are often built on the ground, sometimes on oyster shell beaches. These birds have raucous courtship displays. They generally involve shaking of the head during the greeting ceremony, followed by chases and circle flights. They also involve raising of the neck, back and crest feathers, accompanied by bill clacking, similar to the tricolored heron (&quot;Egretta tricolor&quot;).

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, there are only 1,500 to 2,000 nesting pairs of reddish egrets in the United States â and most of these are in Texas. They are classified as &quot;threatened&quot; in Texas and receive special protection.

<text>John Nommensen Duchac (born February 25, 1953), known professionally as John Doe, is an American singer, songwriter, actor, poet, guitarist and bass player. Doe co-founded LA punk band X, of which he is still an active member. His musical performances and compositions span rock, punk, country and folk music genres. As an actor, he has dozens of television appearances and several movies to his credit, including the role of Jeff Parker in the television series &quot;Roswell&quot;.

In addition to X, Doe performs with the country-folk-punk band the Knitters and has released records as a solo artist. In the early 1980s, he performed on two albums by the Flesh Eaters.

==Career==

=== Music ===
Doe moved to Los Angeles, California, and in 1976 met guitar player Billy Zoom through an ad in the local free weekly paper, &quot;The Recycler.&quot;
As a musician with X, Doe has two feature-length concert films, several music videos, and an extended performance-and-interview sequence in &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, Penelope Spheeris&#x27;s seminal documentary about the early-1980s L.A. punk scene.

Along with co-writer Exene Cervenka, Doe composed most of the songs recorded by X. &quot;Wild Gift&quot;, an album from that band&#x27;s heyday, was named &quot;Record of the Year&quot; by Rolling Stone, The Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times. With Dave Alvin, he co-wrote two of the songs on the Blasters&#x27; 1984 album &quot;Hard Line&quot;, &quot;Just Another Sunday&quot; and &quot;Little Honey&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Cyrano de Berger&#x27;s Back&quot; for the Flesh Eaters LP &quot;A Minute to Pray, a Second To Die&quot;.

Since 1990, Doe has recorded nearly a dozen albums as a soloist or in collaboration with other artists, and has contributed tracks to motion pictures. In the 1992 movie &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston), it is Doe&#x27;s version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; that plays on the jukebox when Costner&#x27;s and Houston&#x27;s characters are dancing. It was released on audio cassette by Warner Bros. in September 1992, but no version is believed to exist on CD. He co-wrote and played on the song &quot;Lobotomy&quot; with Tyler Willman for the eponymous 1998 debut studio album of the band Calm Down Juanita.

Doe took part in Todd Haynes&#x27;s 2007 movie &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, recording two Bob Dylan covers, &quot;Pressing On&quot; and &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot;. Both recordings were included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, and the former was prominently featured in the film, with Christian Bale (as Pastor John Rollins) lip-synching Doe&#x27;s vocals. Doe recorded the song &quot;Unforgiven&quot; in 2007 with Aimee Mann on &quot;A Year in the Wilderness&quot;, an album which also featured Kathleen Edwards, Jill Sobule, Dan Auerbach. He then joined with Eddie Vedder on a mix of the song &quot;Golden State&quot; in 2008. &quot;The Meanest Man in the World&quot; by Doe was featured in Season 4 of the television series &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; and included on the second soundtrack album. &quot;Country Club&quot; (2009), featuring Canadian indie rock band The Sadies, covered country classics along with original songs.

Doe contributed a cover of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; to the 2011 tribute album &quot;Rave on Buddy Holly&quot;.

His latest solo record, &quot;The Westerner&quot;, was released in 2016. Doe said that it was made in the desert, in Arizona, and that the genre is psychedelic soul.

In November 2022, John Doe released a 3 song acoustic EP with East Nashville based indie label, 3Sirens, called &quot;3Sirens Session: John Doe&quot;. The label was founded by The Grahams, who originally met with John Doe to record the session in Austin, TX at the ChurchHouse, produced by David Garza. 

=== Acting ===
In the 1989 biographical film &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, Doe played Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s cousin-turned-father-in-law J. W. Brown. He starred in the 1992 films &quot;Roadside Prophets&quot; and &quot;Pure Country&quot;, and in the 1998 short &quot;Lone Greasers&quot;. Other movie acting credits include &quot;Road House&quot;, &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, &quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;The Specials&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Gypsy 83&quot;, &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Border Radio&quot;, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, and &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;. Doe has appeared on the television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Roswell&quot;, &quot;Carnivale&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; (alongside his bandmates in X) and &quot;The Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;.

===Author===
With co-author Tom DeSavia, Doe wrote and compiled stories for a book about the LA punk rock scene from 1977 to 1983. The book, &quot;Under the Big Black Sun&quot;, incorporated the punk ethos of contributions from other musicians that were part of the scene, people like Exene Cervenka, Jack Grisham, Henry Rollins, Mike Watt, Jane Wiedlin and others who wrote chapters. Doe wanted it to be a collective recollection, not just one person&#x27;s perspective of the time.

A sequel of sorts was released in 2019 entitled &quot;More Fun in the New World: The Unmaking and Legacy of L.A. Punk&quot;. Doe and DeSavia again invited contributors to narrate the space of time from 1982 to 1987.

==Personal life==
Doe was born in Decatur, Illinois. He was married to fellow X member Exene Cervenka between 1980 and 1985. He remarried in 1987. He revealed to Adam Carolla in a podcast in September 2011 that he resided (at the time) in Fairfax, California. He has three daughters. In early 2017, he announced that he would be moving to Austin, Texas.

<text>USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; refers to a series of starships in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is the main setting of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (1966â69), nine &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022âpresent). The vessels carry their crew on a mission &quot;to explore strange, new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before.&quot;

Matt Jefferies designed the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for television, and its core components â a flying saucer-shaped primary hull, two offset engine nacelles, and a cylindrical secondary hull â persisted across several television and film redesigns. The vessel influenced the design of subsequent franchise spacecraft, including other vessels named &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the model filmed for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series has been on display for decades at the National Air and Space Museum.

Initially a vision of the potential for human spaceflight, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; became a popular culture icon. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; has repeatedly been identified as one of the best-designed and most influential science fiction spacecraft.

==Development and production==
=== Concept and initial design ===
Series creator Gene Roddenberry reviewed hundreds of science fiction magazines, dating back to 1931, to gather ideas about what he wanted &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s main vessel to look like. Despite the research, he was more confident in what he did not want than what he did want. He set several parameters:


Roddenberry further specified that the ship would have a crew of 100â150 and be incredibly fast. Art director Pato Guzman&#x27;s assistant, Matt Jefferies, was responsible for designing the ship and several of its sets. Jefferies and Roddenberry did not want the vessel to look like any of the rocket ships already used by the aerospace industry or in popular culture; many designs were rejected for being &quot;too conventional&quot;. To meet Roddenberry&#x27;s requirement that the ship look believable, Jefferies tried &quot;to visualize what the fourth, fifth or tenth generation of present-day equipment would be like&quot;. Jefferies&#x27; experience with aviation let him imbue his designs with what he called &quot;aircraft logic&quot;. He imagined the ship&#x27;s engines would be too powerful to be near the crew, requiring them to be set apart from the hull. Jefferies initially rejected a disk-shaped component, worried about the similarities to flying saucers; however, a spherical module eventually flattened into a disk. Because the ship would be expected to flash by quickly on television screens, Jefferies wanted the design to be &quot;very simple, but immediately identifiable â a shape that you could instantly pick out.&quot;

During a visit with Jefferies, Roddenberry and NBC staff were drawn to a sketch of the ship resembling its final configuration. Jefferies had created a small model of this design that, when held from a string, hung upside-down â an appearance he had to &quot;unsell&quot;. He kept the hull smooth, with a sense that the ship&#x27;s components were serviced from inside. He designed the Klingon starship seen in the third season by rearranging and changing the shape of &quot;Enterprise&quot;â³s basic modules: a main body, two engine pods, and a neck with a head on it. Some of Jefferies&#x27; rejected design concepts â such as spherical hull sections and warp engines that encircle a ship â inspired future &quot;Star Trek&quot; vessel designs.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was originally named &quot;Yorktown&quot;, but Roddenberry was fascinated by the aircraft carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot; and had &quot;always been proud of that ship and wanted to use the name.&quot; The &quot;NCC-1701&quot; registry stems from &quot;NC&quot; being one of the international aircraft registration codes assigned to the United States. The second &quot;C&quot; was added because Soviet aircraft used &quot;C&quot;s, and Jefferies believed a venture into space would be a joint operation by the United States and Russia. Jefferies rejected &quot;3&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, and &quot;9&quot; as &quot;too easily confused&quot; on screen; he eventually reasoned the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the first vessel of Starfleet&#x27;s 17th starship design, hence &quot;1701&quot;. &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; explains that &quot;USS&quot; means &quot;United Space Ship&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Enterprise&quot; is a member of the Starship Class&quot;. Licensed texts, on-screen graphics, and dialogue later describe the ship as a &quot;Constitution&quot;-class vessel.

=== Filming models ===

The first miniature built from Jefferies&#x27; drawings was a scale model. Desilu Studios, which produced &quot;Star Trek&quot;, hired Richard C. Datin to make a pre-production model. Datin used a subcontractor with a large lathe for major subcomponents and otherwise worked on the model for approximately 110 hours during November 1964. The model was made mostly of pine, with Plexiglass and brass details. Datin made minor changes after Roddenberry&#x27;s review, and he submitted the completed model â which cost about $600 () â to Desilu in December 1964.
Desilu then ordered a larger filming model, which Datin contracted to Volmer Jensen and Production Model Shop in Burbank. Datin supervised the work and did detailing on the model, which was constructed from plaster, sheet metal, and wood. When completed, it was long, weighed , and cost $6,000 (). The model was delivered too late to be used much for the initial pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot;. When Roddenberry was approved to film the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966), various details of this 11-foot model were altered, and the starboard windows and running lights were internally illuminated. When the series went into production, the model was altered again, and it was regularly modified throughout its active filming. Most of the fine details on the large model were not visible to television viewers. Wiring for the interior lighting ran into the model on its left side, so it could only be filmed from the right; for shots requiring the other side of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the footage was either flipped or filmed using the 33-inch model. Because of this, some of the fine details added to the model were added only to its right side. The model was filmed with an 18mm lens &quot;to accentuate the speed of travel as well as retain an adequate depth of field.&quot;

The 11-foot model was initially filmed by Howard Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s team struggled to film the model in a way that suggested it was moving at tremendous speeds, as the producers wanted to avoid the cliched look of a spacecraft drifting through space. Additionally, the model was so large there was little room in the filming space for the camera to move around it. Anderson could not keep up with the filming and special effects needs for regular production, so producers hired several other studios to contribute effects and additional footage. Motion control equipment was too expensive, so the ship was filmed with stop motion. Filming was often delayed by the heat generated by the studio and model&#x27;s lights. Most third-season footage of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was reused first- or second-season footage. Special effects were produced as cheaply as possible. Animators for &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; (1973â75) rotoscoped &quot;Enterprise&quot; footage to recreate the ship&#x27;s movements, contributing to the impression of the animated series being a fourth season of the original. The animated show&#x27;s limited color palette could not accommodate all of the ship&#x27;s various colors, so the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was depicted as a consistent gray.

=== Sets, sounds, and fixtures ===

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was meant to serve as a familiar, recurring setting, similar to Dodge City in &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and Blair General Hospital in &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. The bridge was monochromatic for &quot;The Cage&quot;, but it was redecorated for &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; because of the increasing popularity of color televisions. The first pilot episode&#x27;s bridge set was rigid, making it difficult for cameras to move in. For series production, the bridge set was rebuilt modularly, allowing large sections to be removed to make camera movement easier. The complicated electronics that provided bridge set readouts and lights required expensive air conditioning to avoid overheating. The chairs used on the bridge and other sets were manufactured by Burke of Dallas and were similar to the tulip chair designed by Eero Saarinen. When production ended after the third season, major elements of the bridge set were donated to the UCLA Theater Arts Department; the remaining components were discarded.

Reusing sets helped address Desilu&#x27;s budget concerns. The engine room, whose sense of scale was enhanced by the use of forced perspective, was redressed as the shuttlebay. Other sets that were redressed to save costs included the briefing room, which also served as the recreation room and cargo deck; and Kirk&#x27;s cabin, which was also Spock&#x27;s. Going into the show&#x27;s second season, NBC executives pressed the production to have fewer episodes based on the ship, and more that occur on alien worlds. In April 1968, Roddenberry pushed back, comparing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the home and ranch on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, the location of some of that show&#x27;s best episodes. He also said they would create new &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets to &quot;help counteract any &#x27;sameness&#x27; about the ship&quot;. Roddenberry described the ship&#x27;s hallways as &quot;Des Moines Holiday Inn Style&quot;. To keep the ship from looking too sterile, Mike Minor created paintings that hung in Kirk&#x27;s quarters, the recreation area, and the upper rim of the bridge.

As production continued, standing sets like the engine room and bridge became increasingly detailed. Jefferies and associate producer Bob Justman walked through the production lots looking for &quot;serendipitous items&quot; that could be modified into set details to enhance the interiors. Jefferies added new details to a portable maintenance tunnel set each time it was used. The production staff called the set the &quot;Jefferies tube&quot; as an inside joke, and the term is used in dialogue to describe similar crawl spaces in spinoffs.

Sound effects designer Doug Grindstaff created sounds for different parts of the vessel: console sound effects were often created with a Hammond electric organ or other musical instrument, and engine sounds were created in part with a noisy air conditioner. Although there is no sound in space, producers thought that dramatic license required the ship to make noise during exterior shots. The sound of the ship &quot;whoosh&quot;ing past in the main title sequence was recorded by composer Alexander Courage.

Although the interior in &quot;The Animated Series&quot; was largely recreated from the live action series, a second turbolift was added to the bridge in response to Roddenberry being asked, &quot;What do they do if the [one turbolift&#x27;s] doors get stuck?&quot; Franz Joseph designed full &quot;Enterprise&quot; interior deck plans in 1974 with approval from Roddenberry.

===1970s redesigns for television and film===
Soon after the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; went off the air, pre-production began on &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot;. Ken Adam and Ralph McQuarrie designed a new &quot;Enterprise&quot; with a triangular hull that later inspired the appearance of the eponymous ship in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery.&quot; &quot;Planet of the Titans&quot; was dropped in favor of a return to television with &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, for which Jefferies designed a new &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot;&quot; He began with the original design and identified components, such as the engines, that would have been upgraded. Some elements, like the sensor dish, would move inside the ship to be more easily serviced. Abandoning &quot;Phase II&quot; in favor of producing &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979) necessitated additional &quot;Enterprise&quot; redesigns because the film medium would resolve more detail than television, and one of the most difficult challenges facing the producers was recreating the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Roddenberry told &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; that the changes to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; would be explained within the story as the outcome of a major refit.

When Jefferies left the project, art director Richard Taylor wanted to start over with designing the &quot;Enterprise&quot;; however, Roddenberry convinced him to continue working with Jefferies&#x27; design. Taylor brought on Andrew Probert to help refine the ship&#x27;s details. Probert added items such as phaser banks, control thrusters, and hatches for saucer section landing gear; Taylor redesigned the edge of the saucer and elements of the warp nacelles. Art director Joe Jennings and conceptual illustrator Mike Minor added additional details. David Kimble created diagrams and deck plans for the updated &quot;Enterprise&quot; that were provided to model makers, toy companies, and other licensed product manufacturers.
Jim Dow was in charge of building the model. Paramount Pictures subsidiary Magicam spent 14 months and $150,000 building the , model. An arc-welded aluminum skeleton ensured parts of the ship would not sag, bend, or shake. While the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; model was seen in only 17 poses, the new model had five articulation points and could be shot from any angle. Paul Olsen painted the &quot;Aztec&quot; hull pattern to provide an additional level of detail and to suggest the presence of interlocking panels providing strength. The effect was made possible by small particles of mica in the paint, which altered its apparent color. However, the paint created light flare that made it hard to discern the edge of the ship against a dark background, and bluescreen light reflected by the pearlescent paint also complicated filming. Effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull relit the ship as if it were an ocean liner, &quot;a grand lady of the seas at night&quot;, because there would be no external light source in deep space. A model was used for long shots.

Production designer Harold Michelson was responsible for the ship&#x27;s interior design. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; interiors were designed to be distinct from the film&#x27;s Klingon ship, and certain support structure designs were used throughout the &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets to convey a shared motif. A new bridge had been designed and partially built for &quot;Phase II&quot;, and Michelson largely retained the design and its consoles. The weapons console was rotated 90 degrees to break the monotony of stations facing the wall. Designer Lee Cole brought logic and function to the console designs, though Michelson wanted to remain focused on &quot;drama, spectacle and beauty&quot; over accuracy and logic. Rear projection films for bridge displays came initially from Stowmar Enterprises. When production exhausted the films faster than Stowmar could supply them, production designers manufactured their own from oscilloscopes, medical imagery, and an experimental computer lab.

Set designer Lewis Splittgerber described the engine room set as the most difficult to realize. Through forced perspective and small actors, the set was depicted as a engineering space. Corridors were initially a straight-wall design similar to the television series, and Michelson changed them to an angular design with light radiating upward. Director Robert Wise wanted the corridors to be narrower than on the television series, and mirrors gave the impression that they were longer than they actually were. Wise was also responsible for the ship&#x27;s drab interior color scheme: the muted colors were meant to be comfortable across a five-year journey. The 2001 director&#x27;s cut replaced several bridge computer voices with human voices to &quot;warm up&quot; the film.

=== Sequel film adjustments, destruction, and return ===
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; model was slightly refurbished for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982), with its exterior shine dulled and extra detail added to the frame. Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) staff found the &quot;Enterprise&quot; difficult to work with: it took eight people to mount the model and a forklift to move it. Illustrator Mike Minor described the ship as a &quot;sculpture&quot; with an &quot;aerodynamic shape,&quot; requiring careful filming so that its movements did not appear &quot;silly&quot;.&quot;&quot; ILM developed several techniques to depict battle damage to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; without actually harming the model.

The smaller &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; budget required the reuse of existing sets, but they presented challenges in realizing director Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s desire for a &quot;livelier&quot; tone. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was given a ship&#x27;s bell, boatswain&#x27;s call, and more blinking lights and signage to match the nautical atmosphere Meyer wanted to convey. Rear-projection systems for bridge displays were replaced with monitors looping taped material created by graphic designer Lee Cole at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The bridge set was &quot;unbuttoned&quot; so segments could be removed to better accommodate filming more dynamic action, though filming on the 360-degree set was still challenging. Further complicating the set was that it served three roles in the film: the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge, the &quot;Reliant&quot; bridge, and the Starfleet Academy bridge simulator. The production crew made several &quot;plugs&quot; to cover consoles and alcoves, and pyrotechnics could destroy the plugs during combat sequences without damaging the underlying set. Kirk&#x27;s quarters were redressed with more personal items and a more naval appearance, and the same set depicted Spock&#x27;s more &quot;monastic&quot; quarters.&quot;&quot; The torpedo bay set is a redress of the Klingon bridge from &quot;The Motion Picture,&quot; and David Kimble&#x27;s deck plans from &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; influenced how previously unseen interior arrangements like the torpedo bay were depicted in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;.

Recognizing the plot of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) was otherwise predictable, producer and screenwriter Harve Bennett decided to have the &quot;Enterprise&quot; destroyed. News of the ship&#x27;s demise leaked despite Bennett&#x27;s instance that it kept secret. Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston hated the &quot;Enterprise&quot; model and reveled in its destruction. Rather than damage the large and expensive model, several less expensive miniatures and modules were created and destroyed. One of the destroyed models had been created by Brick Price Movie Miniatures for &quot;Star Trek Phase II&quot;.

Ralston hoped the ship&#x27;s destruction would lead to a redesigned ship for future sequels, but the producers of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986) decided to have the crew assigned to a new &quot;Enterprise&quot; that is virtually identical to the previous ship. It took ILM more than six weeks to restore and repaint the original model to appear as the new USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-A. After visiting ILM, Majel Barrett described the model as &quot;gorgeous,&quot; and she said some of its details â such as the windows into the arboretum â were not done justice by photographs. The existing bridge set was refurbished and repainted to serve as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A bridge at the end of &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;, and the set&#x27;s sleek &quot;Okudagrams&quot; designed by scenic artist Michael Okuda were adopted in subsequent productions. A new $250,000 bridge set was built for &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989). Director Nicholas Meyer wanted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to feel grittier and more realistic for &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), but realizing that vision was limited by the need to use existing sets. Cinematographer Hiro Narita changed the clean, bright look of the bridge from &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; by lighting it differently in &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

Several &quot;Enterprise&quot; film sets were redressed for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987â1994); likewise, some &quot;Next Generation&quot; sets were used to depict interiors of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A. For example, Kirk&#x27;s quarters in &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; were redressed as Data&#x27;s quarters in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and the set then served as Kirk&#x27;s and Spock&#x27;s quarters in &quot;The Undiscovered Country.&quot;

=== Spinoff appearances and computer-generated models ===
Producers working on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Relics&quot; (1992), in which Montgomery Scott visits a recreation of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, initially planned to use the film-era set. Ultimately, recreations of the original television series&#x27; captain&#x27;s chair, navigation console, and engineering console were rented from fans, and the rest was filled in with archival footage and greenscreen technology. The bridge was again partially recreated, with other parts added digitally, for the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; (1996), in which the crew visits the &quot;Enterprise&quot; during the events of &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; (1967). Okuda used a computer to recreate the graphics seen on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets, and others were drawn by artist Doug Drexler. Set designer Laura Richarz&#x27;s biggest challenge was finding Burke chairs to populate the ship: she found just one, and the production team make molds to create more.

&quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; also required exterior shots of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Greg Jein created an &quot;Enterprise&quot; model exactly half the size of the 11-foot original&quot;,&quot; and it was the first production model of the starship to be built in more than 30 years. Although the eight-foot film model&#x27;s original pearlescent paint had been covered and it was redressed as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A, it was used as a referent for the CGI &quot;Enterprise&quot; created for the 2001 director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;. A CGI &quot;Enterprise&quot; makes a cameo appearance at the end of the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series finale, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot; (2005). Artists creating a CGI &quot;Enterprise&quot; for the remastered original series had to ensure the model was not so detailed that it was incongruous with the overall 1960s production.

===2009 film franchise reboot===

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was redesigned for the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. Previsualization lead David Dozoretz credits the designers for overcoming the challenge of doing &quot;a 2009 version of the &#x27;60s&quot;. Director J. J. Abrams wanted &quot;Enterprise&quot; to have a &quot;hot rod&quot; look while retaining the traditional shape, and he otherwise gave designers leeway. The designers wanted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to appear as carefully crafted as a luxury car. Concept artist Ryan Church retained much of the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; design and focused on the functionality behind the familiar components. His initial designs were modeled and refined by set designer Joseph Hiura. This design was then given to ILM for further refinement and developed into photo-realistic models by Alex Jaeger&#x27;s team. ILM&#x27;s Roger Guyett, recalling the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; as being &quot;very static&quot;, added moving parts. ILM retained subtle geometric forms and patterns to allude to the original &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the model&#x27;s digital paint recreated the &quot;Aztec&quot; hull pattern from the first films. The large engine nacelles had a sleeker finish and shape compared to the original ship&#x27;s otherwise simple nacelles. Sean Hargreaves&#x27; redesign of the successor NCC-1701-A &quot;beef[ed] up&quot; the vessel&#x27;s support pylons, which are depicted as vulnerabilities in &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016).

According to Abrams, recreating the original bridge would have been ridiculous and too small. Abrams&#x27; enthusiasm for a new iPhone influenced Church&#x27;s bridge redesign. Sophisticated technology became a motif on the new set, with multiple displays and computer graphics. The viewscreen from the television series was kept, and giving different characters their own computer displays suggested the idea of a team working together. Because the original series transporter room seemed flat to Abrams, he used swirling light and camera movement to make the new set and effects more dynamic. The budget prevented the creation of a huge, functional engineering room set, and producers instead filmed at a Budweiser plant. Ben Burtt consulted with original series sound designer Douglas Grindstaff on sound design for the new &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

=== Redesign for streaming series ===

==== &quot;Discovery&quot; ====
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; appears briefly at the end of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;&#x27;s first-season finale (2018) and occasionally during the show&#x27;s second season (2019). John Eaves, Scott Schneider, and William Budge redesigned the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for &quot;Discovery&quot;, which occurs about a decade before the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The designers usually had only a few weeks to design a vessel, but they worked on &quot;Enterprise&quot; from April to October 2017. Other than a few small notes, they were given no explicit direction about the ship&#x27;s appearance; Schneider called the redesign project the trio&#x27;s &quot;golden hour&quot;.

They considered but quickly rejected a design significantly different from Jefferies&#x27; original. Eaves created 10 relatively similar sketches that streamlined the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; to appear more consistent with &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s sleek aesthetic, and the team selected one to refine. They developed the vessel with the assumption that components like the warp nacelles and impulse engines would be replaced over time; the modules for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;â³s appearance in &quot;Discovery&quot; are meant to appear more primitive than what is depicted in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The designers tried to incorporate elements from other ships that precede and succeed the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, such as the 21st-century &quot;Phoenix&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996), the 22nd-century &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001â2005), and the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994). They also included elements from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; refit for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;. One distinct challenge was the hull: Jefferies&#x27; design featured a smooth hull, but the lack of features would appear too simple on modern high-definition displays. The designers added details, such as phaser banks and control thrusters, that &quot;must have been there&quot; on the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; but were not depicted on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; models. The ship&#x27;s scale also fluctuated, which meant the designers had to adjust window sizes and patterns.

Budge kept the designers in check by ensuring details and features added to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were consistent with other &quot;Discovery&quot; ships, such as whether the bridge would have a window: most &quot;Discovery&quot; ship bridges have a front-facing window, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot; had never been depicted with one. The solution was to depict the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge as having a large piece of transparent aluminum at its front that can become either transparent or opaque. Eaves sent the design team&#x27;s model to the visual effects team, which made further design changes. &quot;Discovery&quot; producer Gretchen J. Berg said she hoped fans see the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Discovery&quot; as a blend of old and new &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Another &quot;Discovery&quot; producer, Aaron Harberts, wasn&#x27;t worried whether fans were satisfied with the ship&#x27;s redesign: while many of the staff who developed the new appearance were &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, Harberts said fans rarely agree on anything.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge appears in the second season&#x27;s finale. Production designer Tamara Deverell and her team wanted to honor the original bridge but needed to create the set using current techniques and to meet modern audience expectations. The production&#x27;s widescreen format, as opposed to the original series&#x27; 4:3 aspect ratio, required the set design to be more &quot;stretched out&quot; horizontally; designers referenced &quot;Star Trek&quot; film bridges â also recorded in widescreen â to assist with designing for the different ratio. The bridge was a fully constructed set, save for greenscreen for the main viewer. The set maintained the original&#x27;s layout and included references and details from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, such as Sulu&#x27;s and Spock&#x27;s console scanners, red bridge railings, and turbolift handles. They also created new elements, such as a corridor running behind the bridge. According to Deverell, the hardest part of designing the bridge was choosing the color palette. The bridge chairs were nearly identical to those used in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and the captain&#x27;s chair was heavily influenced by Captain Kirk&#x27;s original. A fan-created replica of the original bridge â later opened as museum â sent the production team hundreds of buttons for the set&#x27;s consoles.

==== &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; ====
&quot;Enterprise&quot; is the main setting of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022âpresent), which depicts the ship led by Captain Christopher Pike. Anson Mount, who plays Pike, said &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; has a &quot;big idea of the week&quot; like the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and as such the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is &quot;the star of the show&quot;. Rebecca Romijn, who plays first officer Una Chin-Riley, called the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;sexy, and groovy, and fun.&quot; According to producer Akiva Goldsman, the show&#x27;s designers &quot;tried to evoke the experience of watching [the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;], but with the grammar available to us today.&quot; Goldsman describes the ship as aspirational and meant to pull audiences into an imagined future.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; differs slightly from its &quot;Discovery&quot; appearance. The bridge set for &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; was more compact than the one built for &quot;Discovery&quot; to bring it closer to the size of the original series set. The sets were designed to function like a practical starship, with moving components and pre-programmed monitor graphics that reacted to the actors. While the viewscreen was a visual effect in &quot;Discovery&quot;, it was physically built into the &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; set. Sickbay was an entirely new design, meant to convey a large scale and capable of accommodating many camera movements. Designers relied on a massive augmented reality LED volume to depict the scale of main engineering. Due to COVID-19, some sets were not complete when filming began; Goldsman said they were &quot;building the &quot;Enterprise&quot; around shooting on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot; Production designers also changed the color scheme, &quot;warming&quot; it from its &quot;Discovery&quot; palette. A specific shade of red is used as a secondary color throughout the ship, complementing warm and cold off-whites.

==Depiction==
Starfleet commissioned the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2245. Robert April is the &quot;Enterprise&quot;â³s first captain, succeeded by Christopher Pike. Pike leads the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for approximately a decade, and he is the commanding officer in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;. Throughout the first live action and animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, Captain James T. Kirk commands the ship and its 430-person crew on an exploration mission from 2264 to 2269. &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; takes place in the 2270&#x27;s as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is completing an 18-month refit overseen by its new captain, Willard Decker. Decker describes the refit vessel as &quot;an almost totally new &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot; when Admiral Kirk takes command to address a threat to Earth. &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels and other media depict a second five-year mission under Kirk&#x27;s command between the events of the first and second films.

Captain Spock commands the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, serving as a training ship, at the beginning of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; in 2285. Kirk assumes command to investigate problems at space station Regula 1. The USS &quot;Reliant&quot;, hijacked by Khan Noonien Singh, seriously damages the &quot;Enterprise&quot;; Spock sacrifices his life to save the ship. Starfleet decides to decommission the damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, and Kirk and his senior officers steal the ship as part of their plan to restore Spock&#x27;s life. During their mission, a Klingon attack disables the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Kirk lures most of the Klingons onto the immobilized vessel, which he and his officers set to self-destruct before abandoning ship. 

When Kirk and his officers return to Earth in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, Kirk is demoted to captain and given command of a new USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with the registry NCC-1701-A. Various licensed materials describe the ship&#x27;s history before its commissioning as &quot;Enterprise&quot;, such as it being re-named from USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;, USS &quot;Ti-Ho&quot;, or USS &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Spock&#x27;s half-brother Sybok hijacks the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A and takes it to the center of the galaxy in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; thwarts the renegade Klingon General Chang&#x27;s attempt to disrupt a peace summit. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, &quot;Enterprise&quot; is ordered to report to spacedock to be decommissioned. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A is part of the Fleet Museum in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season (2023). 

=== Reboot film series ===
The 2009 reboot film &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its sequels occur in a different timeline than the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; first appears while under construction in Riverside, Iowa, in 2255. Captain Christopher Pike commands &quot;Enterprise&quot; on its 2258 maiden voyage to respond to a Vulcan distress call. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, James Kirk is promoted to captain and receives command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The vessel is destroyed in &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; and a new &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-A, is commissioned under Kirk&#x27;s command.

==Critical reaction==

=== Original appearance ===
Like other &quot;Star Trek&quot; ships with the same name, the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; is &quot;a character in its own right,&quot; and the ship &quot;was just as important... as Kirk, Spock, and McCoy&quot;. According to film critic Scott Jordan Harris, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the franchise&#x27;s most important character, pointing out: Writing in the &quot;Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television&quot;, National Air and Space Museum curator Margaret Weitekamp identifies two distinct celebrity &quot;Enterprise&quot;s: the fictional starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a character or popular culture icon, and the actual physical objects (for example, the filming models) as an iconic design. According to Weitekamp, &quot;The two &quot;Enterprise&quot;s overlap, and are clearly related, but they do not map completely onto each other,&quot; and unpacking distinctions between them contributes to scholarly analysis of popular and material culture and of &quot;this significant television artifact&quot;.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s design, which influenced future starships in the franchise, is iconic. The design came at the end of a trend for science-fiction spaceships to resemble rockets, and just as real spacecraft began to influence sci-fi designs. When it first appeared on television, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was called an &quot;elegant and weird looking behemoth&quot;. Design expert Jonathan Glancey described the &quot;convincing and exciting&quot; &quot;Enterprise&quot; as having the same aesthetic appeal as the Concorde jet, B-17 bomber, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; ocean liner. The interiors are also exemplars of 1960s design. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; said the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; has the best design of the franchise&#x27;s various ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;io9&quot; ranked the original design as the best version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, characterizing the original as superior to ten later versions of its namesake.

=== Film redesign and destruction ===
Harris included the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as one of the 50 most significant objects to appear in film, alongside the ruby slippers in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Maschinenmensch in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, and the Batmobile in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; called the ship&#x27;s redesign for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;handsome&quot;. Conversely, Harlan Ellison called the &quot;Enterprise&quot; a &quot;jalopy&quot; in &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the &quot;Enterprise&quot; looked &quot;like a toy boat in a lava lamp&quot; in &quot;The Wrath of Khan.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that, after being depicted as a complicated vessel requiring detailed care in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, it seemed &quot;a bit loony&quot; for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to be operable by just a handful of officers in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. Jill Sherwin suggested that the aging &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;The Search for Spock&quot; served as a metaphor for the aging &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. &quot;io9&quot; ranked the film appearance as the second-best design of an &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

The destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; has been described as &quot;truly iconic&quot; and &quot;a good way to go&quot;, though David Gerrold wrote that it &quot;casts a pall&quot; over &quot;The Search for Spock&quot; that even Spock&#x27;s resurrection does not displace. In her biography of DeForest Kelley, Terry Lee Rioux calls the &quot;Enterprise&quot; a &quot;mother goddess&quot; who, consistent with &quot;one of the oldest and highest myths&quot; in humanity, sacrifices herself so her children, the crew, can live on. David C. Fein, who produced the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, described the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as Kirk&#x27;s lover, and said destroying the ship meant Kirk &quot;killed the woman that he loves more than any existing being in the world.&quot; &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; ranked the ship&#x27;s destruction the 32nd greatest scene in science fiction.

=== Spin-off television appearances ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a joy&quot; to see the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; as redesigned for &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s second-season premiere. &quot;Engadget&quot; called the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; &quot;gorgeous inside and out.&quot; Writing for Tor.com, Keith DeCandido praised &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;&#x27; producers for balancing the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s original 1960s look with what audiences expect from modern productions. &quot;TrekCore&quot; said &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;&#x27; set dressing and use show the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;as both a character unto herself and as a mirror reflecting the people who inhabit her.&quot;

== Impact ==

=== Within the franchise ===
The original &quot;Enterprise&quot; and 1979 film designs have affected subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; productions. The USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; in &quot;Star Trek III&quot; is meant to make the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;look old and out of date&quot;. Model maker Bill George tried to imagine what the &quot;Enterprise&quot; would look like if it were designed by the Japanese, and he used that impression as the basis for his refinement of the &quot;Excelsior&quot; model. Andrew Probert returned to &quot;Star Trek&quot; to design a new USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-D, for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987â1994), which takes place 100 years after the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D retains the hallmarks of Matt Jefferies&#x27; &quot;Enterprise&quot; design: a saucer section, engineering section, and a pair of engine nacelles. Probert did this in part to assuage skeptical fans who were concerned about the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; being &quot;replaced&quot;. Much of Probert&#x27;s design is based on a &quot;what if?&quot; painting he made after finalizing the 1979 film &quot;Enterprise&quot; design. The USS &quot;Titan&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season draws inspiration from the film redesign, which producer Terry Matalas called &quot;the best starship design ever made.

=== Broader culture ===
The starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; has had considerable cultural impact, and the original ship&#x27;s model is &quot;a living cultural object&quot;. Bjo Trimble said the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; received more fan letters about the &quot;Enterprise&quot; than any of the actors. According to film critic Scott Jordan Harris, although the contemporaneous Apollo program prompted intellectual awareness of the possibilities of space travel, it was the &quot;Enterprise&quot; of the 1960s that sparked space travel fantasies. A 1976 write-in campaign led to the first Space Shuttle being named &quot;Enterprise&quot; rather than &quot;Constitution&quot;. In 2009, Virgin Galactic named its first commercial spaceship to honor the &quot;Star Trek&quot; vessel. The United States Navy evaluated the efficiency of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge&#x27;s style and layout, and the USS &quot;Independence&quot;&#x27;s bridge and USS &quot;Zumwalt&quot;&#x27;s Ship&#x27;s Mission Center have been compared to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge. An &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge replica created for a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan series was later opened as a public exhibit. The distinct beeps emitted by R2-D2 in &quot;Star Wars&quot; are &quot;an offspring&quot; of the melodic sounds created for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;â³s bridge console. Vulcan, Alberta, created a model starship inspired by the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.The &quot;Enterprise&quot; design has been licensed for use in variety of games, models, and toys. AMT&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Enterprise&quot; model is one of the company&#x27;s highest-selling kits: one million kits sold during the show&#x27;s first year of production; the previous bestseller, a car from &quot;The Munsters&quot;, took two years to reach one million sales. Ballantine Books released a set of &quot;Enterprise&quot; blueprints in April 1975, and by December 1976 they were in their seventh printing. The first run of a cutaway drawing of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; sold over one million prints. In 2010, Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Gallery Books published a Haynes Manual for &quot;owners&quot; of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The United States Postal Service has released several USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; stamps. Pulitzer Prizeâwinning editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich has used the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as the setting for two of his illustrations for &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;.

=== Production models and props ===
The three-foot model was loaned out during the production of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; and lost until 2024. Paramount Pictures donated the 11-foot model to the Smithsonian Institution in 1974, disassembled across three crates and dirty. In shipping the model, Paramount estimated the value of the model at $5,000. Starting in 1976, it hung at an exhibit gallery entrance at the National Air and Space Museum before being moved to the gift shop, where it stayed for 14 years. In the first of its initial restorations, the model was altered to look more like the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; and less like a studio filming model. The model underwent restorations in 1974, 1984, 1992, and 2016. For much of its time on display, fans have been surprised at the differences between the model and their expectations about how the &quot;real&quot; spacecraft should appear. A substantial, multi-year restoration culminated in 2016 with the unveiling of a new display in the Milestones of Flight Hall. This restoration highlighted the duality of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as both a filming model and inspirational starship.

The original captain&#x27;s chair prop sold at auction for $304,750. In 2006, Paul Allen bought the &quot;Enterprise&quot; model created for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; films for $240,000; it is on display at the Museum of Pop Culture. Another model of the film version is on display at aerospace company Blue Origin.

<doc id="589661" wikidata="Q499218" url="?curid=589661" title="Raymond Smith Dugan">
<text>Raymond Smith Dugan (May 30, 1878 â August 31, 1940) was an American astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. His parents were Jeremiah Welby and Mary Evelyn Smith and he was born in Montague in the U.S. state of Massachusetts.

His undergraduate and Masters was from Amherst College in Massachusetts in 1899 and 1902. Dugan then received his Ph.D. dissertation in 1905 at the &quot;Landessternwarte Heidelberg-KÃ¶nigstuhl&quot; (KÃ¶nigstuhl Observatory, near Heidelberg) at the University of Heidelberg.

At the time, the observatory at Heidelberg was a center of asteroid discovery under Max Wolf. During Dugan&#x27;s stay there, he discovered 16 asteroids between 1902 and 1904, notably including 511 Davida.

He was employed by Princeton University as an instructor (1905â1908), assistant professor (1908â1920), and professor (1920â). He married Annette Rumford in 1909.

Dugan co-wrote an influential two-volume textbook in 1927 with Henry Norris Russell and John Quincy Stewart called &quot;Astronomy: A Revision of Youngâs Manual of Astronomy&quot; (Ginn &amp; Co., Boston, 1926â27, 1938, 1945). This became the standard astronomy textbook for about two decades. There are two volumes: the first is &quot;The Solar System&quot; and the second is &quot;Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy&quot;.

Dugan was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1931. The lunar crater &quot;Dugan&quot; and the main-belt asteroid 2772 Dugan are named in his honour.

<text>The Minnesota Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The court hears cases in the Supreme Court chamber in the Minnesota State Capitol or in the nearby Minnesota Judicial Center.

==History==
The court was first assembled as a three-judge panel in 1849 when Minnesota was still a territory. The first members were lawyers from outside the region, appointed by President Zachary Taylor. The court system was rearranged when Minnesota became a state in 1858.

Appeals from Minnesota District Courts went directly to the Minnesota Supreme Court until the Minnesota Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court, was created in 1983 to handle most of those cases. The court now considers about 900 appeals per year and accepts review in about one in eight cases. Before the Court of Appeals was created, the Minnesota Supreme Court handled about 1,800 cases a year. Certain appeals can go directly to the Supreme Court, such as those involving taxes, first degree murder, and workers&#x27; compensation.

==Composition==

The seven justices of the Minnesota Supreme Court are elected to renewable six-year terms. When a midterm vacancy occurs, the governor of Minnesota appoints a replacement to a term that ends after the general election occurring more than one year after the appointment. Most vacancies occur during a term. The most recent election to an open seat on the court was in 1992, when former Minnesota Vikings player Alan Page was elected. Judges in Minnesota have a mandatory retirement age of 70.

In 1977, Rosalie E. Wahl became the first woman to serve on the Court. In 1993, Alan Page became the first African American to serve on the Court.

Anne McKeig, a descendant of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, became the first Native American justice in 2016. Her appointment also marked the second time the court had a majority of women since 1991.

In May 2020, Governor Tim Walz announced the appointment of Nobles County District Judge Gordon Moore, who replaced retiring Justice David Lillehaug.

== Salary ==
The salary for the Supreme Court Chief Justice is $205,362 and $186,692 for associate justices.

==Members==


==Notable cases==
* &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot;, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971), in which the Court held that denial of the statutory entitlement demanded by gay citizens to marry the adult of one&#x27;s choice does not offend the United States Constitution; overturned by &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, .
* &quot;Doe v. Gomez&quot;, 27 Minn. 542 N.W.2d 17 (1995), in which the Court held that the right of privacy under the Minnesota Constitution includes the right to an abortion and that the Minnesota government may not deny funding for abortion while funding other pregnancy-related medical services.

<doc id="589664" wikidata="Q6623673" url="?curid=589664" title="List of hospitals in Rhode Island">
<text>This is a list of current and former hospitals in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. By default, the list is sorted alphabetically by name. This table also provides the hospital network of each hospital (if applicable), the city and county where it is located, whether or not it has an emergency department, when it was opened and closed, its current status, type, and former names.

* Name: The most recent name of the hospital. Former names will be listed in the last column.
* City, Town, or Neighborhood: The lowest level census designation of the hospital&#x27;s most recent location.
* Network: The parent organization or government agency in charge of the hospital. For closed hospitals, the network will retain its name at the time of closure and will not be updated if the network changes its name. Text will be italicized if the hospital is independent or if it is owned or operated by a public entity.
* Emergency Department: Indicates the presence of an emergency department, along with trauma designation if applicable. &quot;Former&quot; if the hospital used to have one.
* Opened-Closed: The years of operation.
** Opened, when possible, specifically refers to the date on which the facility admitted its first patient.
* Status / Type / Notes:
** Status is in italics and is generally in reference to a hospital&#x27;s inpatient operations: Active, Succeeded, or Closed. Marked &quot;Fate Unknown&quot; if the hospital is no longer in operation but it cannot be determined if it was closed or acquired.
** Hospital type, when available, comes after Status. When applicable, the type will always reference data from the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis. As CHIA was formed in 2012, any hospitals which either closed before data was collected or which do not fall under its purview (such as federal facilities) will be given the most appropriate typing.
** Notes will encompass all other appropriate information, including former names.

Note: Closures and opening dates, in the case where a hospital is acquired or merges with another, will be designated depending on how substantial the change is. For example, single hospitals purchased by a new entity will generally not be considered to have closed, however simultaneous mergers of multiple hospitals may be considered as a closure of the old hospitals and opening of a new facility. Additionally, a facility which is still in business is considered &quot;closed&quot; if a change in operation leads to the facility no longer meeting an arguable definition of &quot;hospital.&quot;

<doc id="589671" wikidata="Q392139" url="?curid=589671" title="Tricolored heron">
<text>The tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), formerly known as the Louisiana heron, is a small species of heron native to coastal parts of the Americas. The species is more solitary than other species of heron in the Americas and eats a diet consisting mostly of small fish.

==Habitat, breeding, and distribution==
Tricolored herons breed in swamps and other coastal habitats and nests in colonies, often with other herons, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. In each clutch, three to seven eggs are typically laid. The tricolored heron is the second most coastal heron in the United States.

The species&#x27; range follows the northeastern United States, south along the coast, through the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, to northern South America as far south as Brazil. In the Pacific region, it ranges from Peru to California, but it is only a nonbreeding visitor to the far north. 

It was likely the most numerous heron in North America until the cattle egret arrived to the continent in the 1950s. While the species&#x27; population appears to be on the decline, it remains quite common. The bird is listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

==Description==
This species measures from long and has a typical wingspan of . The slightly larger male heron weighs on average, while the female averages . It is a medium-large, long-legged, long-necked heron with a long, pointed, yellowish or greyish bill with a black tip. Its legs and feet turn from dark yellow in nonbreeding birds to pink in breeding adults. The plumage of the triclolored heron changes dramatically from its juvenile form to its adult form.

Adults have a blue-grey head, neck, back, and upper wings, with a white line along the neck. The belly is white. In breeding plumage, they have long, blue, filamentous plumes on their heads and necks, and buff ones on their backs.

==Behavior and diet==
The tricolored heron is more solitary when foraging than other North American herons. When it forages for its prey, it is typically belly-deep in water, alone or at the edge of a mixed flock. Kent (1986) found that the diets of tricolored herons in Florida consisted of 99.7% fish and prawns. While other members of &quot;Egretta&quot; may also eat crabs and opportunistically forage for terrestrial arthropods, the tricolored heron has been consistently observed to be almost exclusively piscivorous, primarily feeding on members of Cyprinodontidae, Fundulidae and Poeciliidae, as well as Centropomidae and Cichlidae.

<text>Profiles in Courage is a 1956 volume of short biographies describing acts of bravery and integrity by eight United States senators. The book, authored by John F. Kennedy with Ted Sorensen as a ghostwriter, profiles senators who defied the opinions of their party and constituents to do what they felt was right and suffered severe criticism and losses in popularity as a result. It begins with a quotation from Edmund Burke on the courage of the English statesman Charles James Fox, in his 1783 &quot;attack upon the tyranny of the East India Company&quot; in the House of Commons, and focuses on mid-19th-century antebellum America and the efforts of senators to delay the American Civil War. &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; was widely celebrated and became a bestseller. It includes a foreword by Allan Nevins.

John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator, won the Pulitzer Prize for the work. However, in his 2008 autobiography, Kennedy&#x27;s speechwriter Ted Sorensen, who was presumed as early as 1957 to be the book&#x27;s ghostwriter, acknowledged that he &quot;did a first draft of most chapters&quot; and &quot;helped choose the words of many of its sentences&quot;. Jules Davids, who was a history professor for Kennedy&#x27;s wife Jacqueline when she was a student at Georgetown University, is also acknowledged to have made key contributions to the historical research and organizational planning for the book.

In 1990, Kennedy&#x27;s family created the Profile in Courage Award to honor individuals who have acted with courage in the same vein as those profiled in the book.
The book also served as the basis for an American historical anthology series of the same name that was telecast weekly on NBC from November 8, 1964, to May 9, 1965.

==Background and history==
Kennedy was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946, 1948, and 1950 from the state of Massachusetts. In 1952 and 1958, he was elected a senator from Massachusetts and served in the Senate until resigning after he was elected president in 1960. It was a passage from Herbert Agar&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;The Price of Union&quot; about an act of courage by an earlier senator from Massachusetts, John Quincy Adams, that gave Kennedy the idea of writing about senatorial courage. He showed the passage to Ted Sorensen and asked him to see if he could find some more examples. This Sorensen did, and eventually they had enough not just for an article, as Kennedy had originally envisaged, but a book. With help from research assistants and the Library of Congress, Sorenson wrote a first draft of the book while Kennedy was bedridden with Addison&#x27;s disease and recovering from back surgery during 1954 and 1955.

Historian Timothy Naftali remarked that another motivation for Kennedy to write the book was his desire to improve his reputation after failing to vote to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. Naftali said it was Kennedy&#x27;s ambition to become Vice President of the United States, and that he included Edmund Ross to appeal to Southern Democrats.

== Summary of senators profiled ==
* John Quincy Adams, from Massachusetts, for breaking away from the Federalist Party.
* Daniel Webster, who like Kennedy represented Massachusetts in Congress, for speaking in favor of the Compromise of 1850.
* Thomas Hart Benton, from Missouri, for staying in the Democratic Party despite his opposition to the extension of slavery in the territories.
* Sam Houston, from Texas, for speaking against the KansasâNebraska Act of 1854, which would have allowed those two states to decide on the slavery question.
* Edmund G. Ross, from Kansas, for voting for acquittal in the Andrew Johnson impeachment trial. As a result of Ross&#x27;s vote, along with those of six other Republicans, Democrat Johnson&#x27;s presidency was saved, and the stature of the office was preserved.
* Lucius Lamar, from Mississippi, for eulogizing Charles Sumner on the Senate floor and other efforts to mend ties between the North and South during Reconstruction, and for his principled opposition to the BlandâAllison Act to permit free coinage of silver.
* George W. Norris, from Nebraska, for opposing Joseph Gurney Cannon&#x27;s autocratic power as Speaker of the House, for speaking out against arming U.S. merchant ships during the United States&#x27; neutral period in World War I, and for supporting the presidential campaign of Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be a major party nominee.
* Robert A. Taft, from Ohio, for criticizing the Nuremberg Trials for trying Nazi war criminals under &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws. Counter-criticism against Taft&#x27;s statements was vital to his failure to secure the Republican nomination for president in 1948.

==Reception==
After its release on January 1, 1956, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; became a bestseller. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957, even though it was not one of the finalists forwarded to the prize board from the selection committee. Kennedy&#x27;s father Joseph asked columnist Arthur Krock, his political adviser and a longtime member of the prize board, to persuade others to vote for it.

The book returned to the bestseller lists in 1961 after Kennedy became president and again in 1963 after he was assassinated.

&quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; was the basis of a television series of the same name that aired on the NBC network during the 1964â1965 television season.

In 1956, Kennedy gave a copy of the book to Richard Nixon, who responded that he was looking forward to reading it. After being defeated by Kennedy in the 1960 United States presidential election, Nixon was advised by Mamie Eisenhower to write a book himself. Nixon visited the White House in April 1961 and got the same advice from Kennedy: writing a book would raise the public image of any public man. Nixon wrote his book &quot;Six Crises&quot; (1962) in response to &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;.

==Authorship==

On December 7, 1957, journalist Drew Pearson appeared as a guest on &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot; and made the claim that &quot;John F. Kennedy is the only man in history that I know who won a Pulitzer Prize for a book that was ghostwritten for him.&quot; Wallace replied: &quot;You know for a fact, Drew, that the book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; was written for Senator Kennedy ... by someone else?&quot; Pearson responded that he did and that Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen wrote the book. Wallace responded: &quot;And Kennedy accepted a Pulitzer Prize for it? And he never acknowledged the fact?&quot; Pearson replied: &quot;No, he has not. You know, there&#x27;s a little wisecrack around the Senate about Jack ... some of his colleagues say, &#x27;Jack, I wish you had a little less profile and more courage.&#x27;&quot;

Joseph P. Kennedy saw the broadcast, then called his lawyer, Clark Clifford, yelling: &quot;Sue the bastards for fifty million dollars!&quot; Soon Clifford and Robert F. Kennedy showed up at ABC and told executives that the Kennedys would sue unless the network issued a full retraction and apology. Wallace and Pearson insisted that the story was true and refused to comply. Nevertheless, ABC made the retraction and apology, which made Wallace furious.

According to &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, Herbert Parmet later analyzed the text of &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; and wrote in his book &quot;Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy&quot; (1980) that although Kennedy did oversee the production and provided for the direction and message of the book, it was Sorensen who provided most of the work that went into the end product. The thematic essays that comprise the first and last chapters &quot;may be viewed largely as [Kennedy&#x27;s] own work&quot;, however.

In addition to Kennedy&#x27;s speechwriter Sorensen, Jacqueline Kennedy recruited her history instructor from Georgetown University, Jules Davids, to work on the project. Davids told a Kennedy biographer that he and Sorensen had researched and written drafts of most of the book. Kennedy&#x27;s handwritten notes, which Kennedy showed to reporters to prove his authorship, are now in the Kennedy Library, but are mostly preliminary notes about John Quincy Adams, a particular interest of Kennedy&#x27;s, and are not a readable draft of the chapter on Adams. During the six-month period when the book was being written, Sorensen worked full-time on the project, sometimes twelve-hour days; Kennedy spent most of the same period traveling, campaigning, or hospitalized. Kennedy&#x27;s preserved notes show that he kept up with the book&#x27;s progress, but historian Garry Wills remarked that Kennedy&#x27;s notes contain no draft of any stage of the manuscript, or of any substantial part of it.

In Sorensen&#x27;s 2008 autobiography, &quot;Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History&quot;, he said he wrote &quot;a first draft of most of the chapters&quot; of &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; and &quot;helped choose the words of many of its sentences&quot;. Sorensen also wrote: &quot;While in Washington, I received from Florida almost daily instructions and requests by letter and telephone â books to send, memoranda to draft, sources to check, materials to assemble, and Dictaphone drafts or revisions of early chapters&quot; (Sorensen, p.Â 146). Sorensen wrote that Kennedy &quot;worked particularly hard and long on the first and last chapters, setting the tone and philosophy of the book&quot;. Kennedy &quot;publicly acknowledged in his introduction to the book my extensive role in its composition&quot; (p.Â 147). Sorensen claimed that in May 1957, Kennedy &quot;unexpectedly and generously offered, and I happily accepted, a sum to be spread over several years, that I regarded as more than fair&quot; for his work on the book. Indeed, this supported a long-standing recognition of the collaborative effort that Kennedy and Sorensen had developed since 1953.

Craig Fehrman, author of &quot;Author in Chief: The Untold Story of Our Presidents and the Books They Wrote&quot;, wrote in 2020 that &quot;The book&#x27;s structure, research, first draft and most of its second came from [Sorensen]&quot;. According to Fehrman, &quot;Even the book&#x27;s idea came from him (Sorensen)&quot;: after Kennedy suggested that Sorensen write a magazine article on Adams&#x27;s courage as senator for publication with Kennedy&#x27;s name, Sorensen suggested to Kennedy in a letter accompanying the draft article that he ask Harper &amp; Brothersâwhere Michael Temple Canfield, Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s brother-in-law, workedâif the publisher were interested in a book on the topic. They shared in profits from all work Sorensen ghostwrote for Kennedy, as agreed when the former joined the latter&#x27;s staff. Kennedy wrote the preface but did not mention Sorensen. After Sorensen returned an edited draft of the preface with a request for a mention, Kennedy added a line thanking him &quot;for his invaluable assistance&quot;. Sorensen received a $6,000 bonus, about one third of his annual salary.

After the WallaceâPearson television appearance, Kennedy and Sorensen agreed that the rumor could ruin Kennedy&#x27;s presidential plans. Sorensen swore an affidavit stating that his only role was &quot;to assist [Kennedy] in the assembly and preparation of research and other materials upon which much of the book is based&quot;. The document said that Sorensen&#x27;s work was &quot;very generously acknowledged by the Senator in the preface&quot;, despite the credit only appearing after Sorensen asked Kennedy for it. Kennedy claimed that he had kept all of the earnings from &quot;Profiles&quot; despite the two payments to Sorensen, and that the Pulitzer was proof of his authorship. &quot;The lies became cover for the lies&quot;, Fehrman concluded.

Fehrman further claimed Kennedy worked harder on promoting &quot;Profiles&quot;, signing autographs and making many public appearances for the book, than he did writing it. Kennedy tried to have it published before the end of 1955 to qualify for the Pulitzer Prizes in 1956; &quot;Profiles&quot; appeared on its original date of January 2, 1956, eligible for the 1957 prizes. Although friends and family said that the Pulitzer made Kennedy happier than his World War II Purple Heart or any other award, and Kennedy told Margaret Coit in 1953 &quot;I would rather win a Pulitzer Prize than be president&quot;, the award caused the press to investigate &quot;Profiles&quot;â³s authorship. In May 1957, two weeks after the award, Gilbert Seldes discussed the rumor that Kennedy had not written the book in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. That month the Kennedys agreed to pay Sorensen more than $100,000, an amount Fehrman said was &quot;frankly astonishing&quot;.

Though Kennedy&#x27;s legacy continues to take criticism for relying on Sorensen for improving Kennedy&#x27;s grammar and style, and for creating the final prose of much of the volume, contemporary Kennedy scholar and foreign policy expert Professor Fredrick Logevall wrote that in several ways Kennedy may have played the more essential role in the book, noting importantly that &quot;Kennedy made the final choices about which figures to feature in the book. And although Sorensen took the lead role in drafting the bulk of the chapters, with significant input on some of them from Professor Jules Davids and Jim Landis, the senator (Kennedy) was responsible for the book&#x27;s architecture, themes, and arguments.&quot; As noted earlier, Kennedy was especially critical to the first and the last chapters, as well as a large portion of Chapter 2 on John Quincy Adams. Logevall went on to claim that Sorensen, though a highly capable writer, as a political novice didn&#x27;t have Kennedy&#x27;s ability to reflect on the importance and place of compromise in political life, nor was he as knowledgeable about American history as Kennedy. According to Logevall, and attested to by both Jackie Kennedy, and many friends, Kennedy worked for many weeks on the book during his long and painful recovery from back surgery, noting, &quot;often he worked while prone in bed, on heavy white paper in his loose, widely spaced hand; on better days he was propped up on the patio or the porch.&quot; Further, Kennedy played a highly active role in locating research sources, for &quot;on an almost daily basis, Sorensen recalled, Kennedy sent him instructions about &#x27;books to ship down, memoranda to prepare, sources to check, materials to assemble.&#x27;&quot; Kennedy instructed Sorensen to scan more than two hundred books, journals, magazines, (and) Congressional records. Sorensen later noted, &quot;the way Jack worked was to take all the material, mine and his, pencil it, dictate the fresh copy in his own words, pencil it again, he never used a typewriter&quot;. However, a letter Jules Davids wrote in 1957, which was made public in 1997, backed claims that he and Sorensen were in fact the key contributors to the book&#x27;s history research.

In response to claims by other authors such as Fehrman and Seldes that Kennedy was deceptive in claiming the book&#x27;s authorship, Logevall alleged &quot;Kennedy had a bigger role in the writing, and certainly in the conception and framing of the book than many of these analysts suggested; the book&#x27;s broad themes and overarching structure were his.&quot; Logevall also added that it was standard for American politicians in the mid-twentieth century, as well as later, to get significant assistance on books that appeared under their name alone. Had Kennedy denied authorship or not accepted the Pulitzer, it may have been damaging to his political career, and though much of the work of the book was indeed Sorensen&#x27;s, by legal arrangement accepted by Sorensen, the authorship was indeed Kennedy&#x27;s according to Logevall. 

According to Logevall, the book&#x27;s most significant contribution was not as an in-depth history, nor was it exceptional in its literary style, of which Sorensen was likely the greatest contributor. Rather, he argues the book&#x27;s value lay in its &quot;broad interpretive claims&quot;, best told in the two chapters in which Kennedy&#x27;s contribution was greatest, the first and the last. Logevall wrote that for Kennedy, the book&#x27;s central theme, which he and not Sorenson selected, may have been &quot;We can compromise our political positions, but not ourselves&quot;. Kennedy further wrote, &quot;We can resolve the clash of interests without conceding our ideals.&quot; Logevall stated that the ability to compromise while staying faithful to ideals was central to Kennedy&#x27;s political aspirations.

==Accuracy==
Author David O. Stewart has questioned the accuracy of the book&#x27;s chapter on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. Of Johnson&#x27;s defenders in the Senate, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; stated that &quot;Not a single one of them escaped the terrible torture of vicious criticism engendered by their vote to acquit.&quot; However, Stewart described the supposed persecution as a &quot;myth&quot; and continued, &quot;None was a victim of postimpeachment retribution. Indeed, their careers were not wildly different from those of the thirty-five senators who voted to convict Andrew Johnson.&quot; However, Ross lost his bid for re-election two years after casting a vote acquitting Johnson. There is also evidence that Edmund Ross was bribed to vote for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal, which is not mentioned in &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;.

Kennedy also praised Lucius Lamar, who, while working in the public eye towards reconciliation, privately was an instigator, according to the claim of author Nicholas Lemann, of growing racial agitation. In the profile of Lamar, Kennedy had also included a single paragraph condemning Adelbert Ames, the Maine-born governor of Mississippi from 1873 to 1876, as an opportunistic carpetbagger whose administration was &quot;sustained and nourished by Federal bayonets&quot;. Ames&#x27;s daughter, Blanche Ames Ames, was outraged, and regularly wrote to Kennedy for years afterward in protest, demanding a retraction of the &quot;defamatory insinuations&quot; and accused him of pandering to Southern readers. The letter-writing continued even after Kennedy had been elected to the presidency. This prompted Kennedy to turn to George Plimpton, Ames&#x27;s grandson and a classmate of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s at Harvard, asking him if he could get his grandmother to cease, claiming her letters were interfering with government business. Blanche Ames Ames eventually would publish her own biography of her father in 1964.

<doc id="589693" wikidata="Q504671" url="?curid=589693" title="Dave Holland (bassist)">
<text>David Holland (born 1 October 1946) is an English double bassist, bass guitarist, cellist, composer and bandleader who has been performing and recording for five decades. He has lived in the United States since the early 1970s.

His extensive discography ranges from solo performances to pieces for big band. Holland runs his own independent record label, Dare2, which he launched in 2005.

==Biography==
Born in Wolverhampton, England, Holland taught himself how to play stringed instruments, beginning at four on the ukulele, then graduating to guitar and later bass guitar. He quit school at the age of 15 to pursue his profession in a pop band, but soon gravitated to jazz. After seeing an issue of &quot;Down Beat&quot; where Ray Brown had won the critics&#x27; poll for best bass player, Holland went to a record store, and bought a couple of LPs featuring Brown backing pianist Oscar Peterson. He also bought two Leroy Vinnegar albums (&quot;Leroy Walks!&quot; and &quot;Leroy Walks Again!!&quot;) because the bassist was posed with his instrument on the cover. Within a week, Holland traded in his bass guitar for a double bass and began practicing with the records. In addition to Brown and Vinnegar, Holland was drawn to the bassists Charles Mingus and Jimmy Garrison.

After moving to London in 1964, Holland played double bass in small venues and studied with James Edward Merrett, principal bassist of the Philharmonia Orchestra and, later, the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Merrett trained him to sight read and then recommended he apply to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Holland received a full-time scholarship for the three-year programme. At 20, Holland was keeping a busy schedule in school, studios and Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, London&#x27;s premier jazz club, where he often played in bands that supported such touring American jazz saxophonists as Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Joe Henderson. He also linked up with other British jazz musicians, including guitarist John McLaughlin, saxophonists Evan Parker and John Surman, South Africa-born London-based pianist Chris McGregor, and drummer John Stevens, and performed on the Spontaneous Music Ensemble&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Karyobin&quot;. He also began a working relationship with Canada-born, England-based trumpeter Kenny Wheeler that continued until Wheeler&#x27;s death in 2014.

===With Miles Davis===
In 1968, Miles Davis and Philly Joe Jones heard him at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, playing in a combo that opened for the Bill Evans Trio. Jones told Holland that Davis wanted him to join his band (replacing Ron Carter). Davis left the UK before Holland could contact him directly, and two weeks later Holland was given three days&#x27; notice to fly to New York for an engagement at Count Basie&#x27;s nightclub. He arrived the night before, staying with Jack DeJohnette, a previous acquaintance. The following day Herbie Hancock took him to the club, and his two years with Davis began. This was also Hancock&#x27;s last gig as Davis&#x27;s pianist, as he left afterwards for a honeymoon in Brazil and was replaced by Chick Corea when he could not return for an engagement due to illness. Holland&#x27;s first recordings with Davis were in September 1968, and he appears on half of the album &quot;Filles de Kilimanjaro&quot; (with Davis, Corea, Wayne Shorter and Tony Williams).

Holland was a member of Davis&#x27;s rhythm section through the summer of 1970; he appears on the albums &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches&#x27; Brew&quot;. In the first year of his tenure with Davis, Holland played primarily upright bass. By the end of 1969, he played electric bass guitar (often treated with wah-wah pedal and other electronic effects) with greater frequency as Davis moved away from acoustic jazz.

Holland was also a member of Davis&#x27;s working group during this time, unlike many of the musicians who appeared only on the trumpeter&#x27;s studio recordings. The so-called &quot;lost quintet&quot; of Davis, Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette was active in 1969 but never made any studio recordings as a quintet. A 1970 live recording of this group plus percussionist Airto Moreira, &quot;Live at the Fillmore East, March 7, 1970: It&#x27;s About That Time&quot;, was issued in 2001. Steve Grossman replaced Shorter in early 1970; Keith Jarrett joined the group as a second keyboardist thereafter, and Gary Bartz replaced Grossman during the summer of 1970. By the end of the summer, rhythm and blues bass guitarist Michael Henderson had replaced Holland.

===ECM and the 1970s===
After leaving Davis&#x27;s group, Holland briefly joined the avant-garde jazz group Circle, with Corea, saxophonist Anthony Braxton and percussionist Barry Altschul. This started a decades-long association with the ECM record label. After recording a few albums, Circle disbanded when Corea departed. 1972 saw the recording of &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot;, with Braxton, saxophonist/flautist Sam Rivers and Altschulâ Holland&#x27;s first recording as a leader, and the beginning of a long musical relationship with Rivers. The title of the album is taken from that of a 4,500-line epic poem by Persian Sufist writer, Farid al-Din Attar.

Holland worked as a leader and as a sideman with many other jazz artists in the 1970s. On 15 June 1972 he played with Thelonious Monk at the Village Vanguard which was one of Monk&#x27;s last concerts. Holland recorded several important albums with Anthony Braxton between 1972 and 1976 â including &quot;New York, Fall 1974&quot; (1974) and &quot;Five Pieces&quot; (1975) â that were released on Arista Records.
Holland also recorded duo sessions with saxophonist Sam Rivers and fellow bassist Barre Phillips, and the solo bass album &quot;Emerald Tears&quot;. Also in the 1970s he appeared with performers including Stan Getz and the Gateway Trio with John Abercrombie and DeJohnette. The Gateway trio released two influential modern jazz albums in 1975 and 1977, and reformed in 1994 for a recording session which yielded another two albums. As a sideman, Holland appeared on rock and pop recordings as well, working with singer Bonnie Raitt on her 1972 album &quot;Give It Up&quot;.

=== The 1980s ===

Holland formed his first working quintet in 1983, and over the next four years released &quot;Jumpin&#x27; In&quot;, &quot;Seeds of Time&quot;, and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, featuring alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, trumpeter Wheeler and trombonist Julian Priester (or Robin Eubanks). Subsequently, he formed the Dave Holland Trio (with Coleman and DeJohnette) for the 1988 album &quot;Triplicate&quot;, and teamed with Coleman, electric guitarist Kevin Eubanks and drummer Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith for &quot;Extensions&quot;. He also recorded &quot;Life Cycle&quot;, an album of compositions played on solo cello.

The bassist also continued to collaborate with his peers, often connecting with figures from the previous generation of jazz icons. In 1989, Holland teamed with drummer Billy Higgins and pianist Hank Jones to record &quot;The Oracle&quot;, and joined drummer Roy Haynes and guitarist Pat Metheny in 1989 to record &quot;Question and Answer&quot;.

=== The 1990s and 2000s ===
During the 1990s, Holland renewed an affiliation, begun in the 1970s, with Joe Henderson, joining the tenor saxophonist on &quot;So Near (So Far)&quot;, a tribute to Miles Davis, and &quot;Porgy &amp; Bess&quot;. Holland also reunited with vocalist Betty Carter, touring and recording the live album &quot;Feed the Fire&quot; (1993). Fellow Davis alumnus Herbie Hancock invited Holland to tour with him in 1992, subsequently recording &quot;The New Standard&quot;. Holland joined Hancock&#x27;s band again in 1996. He was also part of the sessions for &quot;&quot;, winner of the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

As a leader, Holland formed his third quartet and released &quot;Dream of the Elders&quot; (1995), which introduced the vibraphonist Steve Nelson to his ensembles. Holland formed a quintet that includes tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, trombonist Robin Eubanks and, a more recent addition, drummer Nate Smith. Their recordings include &quot;Points of View&quot;, &quot;Prime Directive&quot;, &quot;Not for Nothin&quot;, &quot;Extended Play: Live at Birdland&quot; and &quot;Critical Mass&quot;. In addition to releasing four quintet albums on ECM, Holland debuted his Big Band, which released &quot;What Goes Around&quot; in 2002. The album won Holland his first Grammy as a leader, in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category. The second Big Band recording, &quot;Overtime&quot; (2005), again won the Grammy in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category; it was released on Holland&#x27;s Dare2 label, which he formed that year.

In 2009, Holland was a co-founder of an all-star group called the Overtone Quartet. The group consisted of Holland on bass, Chris Potter on tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Eric Harland on drums. The group toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe.

==Awards and honors==
He won the Critics Poll in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine for Musician of the Year, Big Band of the Year, and Acoustic Bassist of the Year (he also garnered top bassist in the 2006 poll). The Jazz Journalists&#x27; Association honored him as Musician and Acoustic Bassist of the Year. He was the recipient of the Miles Davis Award at the Montreal Jazz Festival.

The National Endowment for the Arts named Holland as one of its five Jazz Masters Fellows in 2017; the award recognizes artists for their lifetime achievements and exceptional contributions toward the advancement of jazz.

Holland has received honorary doctorates from the New England Conservatory, Boston, where he held a full-time teaching position in 1987â88 and where he has been visiting artist in residence since 2005; Berklee College of Music, Boston; and the Birmingham Conservatoire, in England. He was also named Fellow of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (London). From 1982 to 1989, Holland served as the artistic director of the Banff Summer Jazz Workshop through the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta, Canada. In addition, he has taught workshops and master classes around the world at universities and music schools and is President of the UK-based National Youth Jazz Collective.

<text>ViewSonic Corporation is an American privately held multinational electronics company with headquarters in Brea, California, United States.

The company was founded in 1987 as Keypoint Technology Corporation by James Chu and was renamed to its present name in 1993, after a brand name of monitors launched in 1990. Today, ViewSonic specializes in visual display hardwareâincluding liquid-crystal displays, projectors, and interactive whiteboardsâas well as digital whiteboarding software. The company trades in three key markets: education, enterprise, and entertainment.

==Company history==
The company was initially founded as Keypoint Technology Corporation in 1987 by James Chu. In 1990 it launched the ViewSonic line of color computer monitors, and shortly afterward the company renamed itself after its monitor brand.

The ViewSonic logo features Gouldian finches, colorful birds native to Australia.

In the mid-1990s, ViewSonic rose to become one of the top-rated makers of computer CRT monitors, alongside Sony, NEC, MAG InnoVision, and Panasonic. ViewSonic soon displaced the rest of these companies to emerge as the largest display manufacturer from America/Japan at the turn of the millennium.

In 2000, ViewSonic acquired the Nokia Display Products&#x27; branded business.

In 2002 ViewSonic announced a 3840x2400 WQUXGA, 22.2-inch monitor, VP2290.

In 2005, ViewSonic and Tatung won a British patent lawsuit filed against them by LG Philips in a dispute over which company created technology for rear mounting of LCDs in a mobile PC (U.K. Patent GB2346464B, titled âportable computer&quot;).

On July 2, 2007, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $143.8M in an IPO on NASDAQ.

On March 5, 2008, the company filed a withdraw request with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying &quot;terms currently obtainable in the public marketplace are not sufficiently attractive to the Registrant to warrant proceeding with the initial public offering&quot;.

In 2017, ViewSonic entered the interactive whiteboard market with its ViewBoard flat panels and myViewBoard software. ViewSonic was named a best-selling collaboration display brand in 2018. By 2019, more than 5,500 elementary and junior high schools in the United States had installed ViewBoards, and ViewSonic ranked third in global interactive display market share, excluding China. ViewSonic became a Google for Education partner in 2019 and a Microsoft Education partner in 2020.

== Operations ==
ViewSonic has its headquarters in Brea, California, United States and a research &amp; development center in New Taipei City, Taiwan. , ViewSonic is selling globally with offices in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Italy, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Switzerland, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, India, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Japan, and the United States.

==Product history==

In 1998, ViewSonic announced that two of its Professional Series monitors achieved TCO &#x27;99 certification.

In 2000, ViewSonic partnered with AT&amp;T Corporation to offer Internet appliances integrated with the AT&amp;T WorldNet Service, initially targeting the corporate market. The Internet appliances ranged from standalone i-boxes, integrated LCD and CRT devices, to web phones and wireless web pads. The units were deemed capable of operating on nearly any operating system, including Windows CE, Linux, QNX and VxWorks.

In 2002, ViewSonic announced a 3840x2400 WQUXGA, 22.2-inch monitor, VP2290.

At the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show, ViewSonic introduced display products, namely a projector, monitors and an HDTV set, capable of being connected directly to a video iPod.

On May 31, 2011, the ViewPad 7x debuted at the Computex computer show in Taipei, Taiwan, Pocket-Lint reported, being a follow-up rather than a replacement to ViewSonic&#x27;s existing ViewPad 7 tablet, which runs Android 2.2, a.k.a. Froyo.

In 2017, ViewSonic rolled out its ViewBoard smart interactive whiteboards. By 2019, more than 5,500 elementary and junior high schools in the United States had installed ViewBoards, and ViewSonic ranked third in global interactive display market share (excluding China).

<text>Pakruojis (; ) is a city in Lithuania. It is situated on the Kruoja River, which has a dam above the city. Forty three buildings of the manor, mentioned in 1531 still survive.

==History==
Pakruojis and it neighbourhood are within the boundaries of the inhabited area of the Semigallian tribe. For a long time it was thought that the town was founded in 1585, when the town and Pakruojis manor were mentioned in land ownership records. This date has entered several encyclopedias. However, historian Algimantas MiÅ¡kinis discovered that Pakruojis was first mentioned in 1531. On July 10, 1613 the first church of Pakruojis had inaugural service in it new building. Sigismund III Vasa granted rights for two annual fairs.

Landowners von Ropp, who owned Pakruojis Manor from the beginning of 19th century, had a great influence on the development of the city.

In 1801 the oldest wooden synagogue of Pakruojis in Lithuania was built.

In July and August, 1941, German soldiers with the help of local white armbanders massacred a total of 400 Jews from Pakruojis district in the nearby Morkakalnis forest.

Pakruojis wooden synagogue survived World War II. It is the largest and the oldest of the wooden synagogues that survives in Lithuania, but had been in deteriorating condition for a long time. On May 3, 2009 the synagogue suffered severe damage in a possible arson fire,; it underwent restoration 2014â2016 and was reopened in May 2017.

In 1950 Pakruojis was granted city rights.

In 1982 a railway from RadviliÅ¡kis was upgraded and narrow railway replaced with wide railway.

In 1993 the coat of arms of Pakruojis was approved.

<doc id="589702" wikidata="Q188420" url="?curid=589702" title="Sambar (dish)">
<text>Sambar (, romanized: SÄmbÄr) is a lentil-based vegetable stew, cooked with pigeon pea and tamarind broth. It originates in South Indian cuisine and is popular in other parts of India. 

== History ==
The recorded history of Sambar is vague. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, the earliest extant reference to sambar, as &quot;huli&quot;, can be dated to the 17th century in present-day Karnataka. &quot;Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya&quot;, a 1648 text by the Kannada scholar Govinda Vaidya, mentions &quot;huli&quot; &quot;saaru&quot; (literally &quot;sourness&quot;), a curry similar to the modern sambar, made with vegetables and toor dal.

According to a legend, Sambar was first made in the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom during the reign of Shahuji I (r. 1684â1712). The legend states that during a visit by Sambhaji, a king or his royal chef substituted kokum with tamarind in the traditional &quot;amti&quot; (lentil soup), and added some vegetables to it: the resulting curry was named &quot;sambar&quot; or &quot;sambhar&quot; after Sambhaji. Sourish Bhattacharyya, in &quot;The Bloomsbury Handbook of Indian Cuisine&quot; (2023), notes that the fathers of Shahuji I and Sambhaji were half-brothers and not on good terms, which reduces the credibility of this legend. However, Bhattacharyya adds that it is possible that Shahuji named the dish after Sambhaji as part of his attempts to establish cordial relations between the two families.

Sambar was introduced to Sri Lankan cuisine in the 20th century, along with many other South Indian dishes.

== Regional variations ==

In southern states of India namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Sambar is made using different vegetables and fruits along with lentils or coconut. Each region has its own version of making sambar; even though the same vegetables are used, the condiments and ingredients, and the method differ regionwise. In Tulu speaking areas of coastal Karnataka coconut is predominantly used to prepare &quot;Koddel&quot; (Sambar), The grated coconut is ground with spices to form a paste which is added to vegetables boiled. In Kannada speaking regions sambar is referred to as &quot;Saaru&quot;. 

==British Indian restaurant version==
The &#x27;Samber&#x27; is a staple of British curry houses, where it is served in the form of a thicker sauce than the original, with meat added to the dish. Typically it is hot, sour, and, like the original dish, contains lentils.

<text>The Farm is an intentional community in Lewis County, Tennessee, near the community of Summertown, Tennessee, based on principles of nonviolence and respect for the Earth. It was founded in 1971 by Stephen Gaskin and 300 spiritual seekers from Haight-Ashbury and San Francisco. The Farm was the setting for &quot;the rebirth of midwifery in the United States&quot; and the creation of &quot;the modern home-birth
movement.&quot; Its members have founded a number of nonprofit organizations, including Plenty International, a relief and development organization, and Swan Conservation Trust, who established the Big Swan Headwaters Preserve. The Farm has approximately 200 members and residents.

==Origins==
The Farm was established after Stephen Gaskin and friends led a caravan of 60 buses, vans, and trucks from San Francisco on a four-month speaking tour across the US. Along the way, they became a community, lacking only land to put down roots. After returning to California, the decision was made to buy land together. Combining all their resources would finance purchase of only about fifty acres in California. Another month on the road brought the group back to Tennessee, where they checked out various places that might be suitable to settle. They decided on property in Lewis County, about seventy miles south of Nashville. After buying 1,064 acres (4.1Â km2) for $70 per acre, the group began building its community in the woods alongside the network of crude logging roads that followed its ridgelines. Shortly thereafter, an adjoining 750 acres (3.0Â km2) were purchased for $100 per acre.

From its founding in the 1970s, Farm members took vows of poverty and owned no personal possessions other than clothing and tools, though this restriction loosened as time passed. During that time, Farm members did not use artificial birth control, alcohol, tobacco, or animal products. Many of the early buildings on the Farm were unconventional, ranging from converted school buses to modified 16 x 32 army tents. Over time, larger homes were constructed, each providing shelter for multiple families and single people, often with up to 40 people under one roof. Visitors were also housed in a two-story tent made by sewing two army tents together.

In the early days, Gaskin was considered to be the &quot;abbot of the monastery&quot; and made many of the governmental decisions for the group. His role was eventually taken over by a &quot;council of elders&quot; and then a &quot;board of directors&quot; consisting of some of the most respected and influential members of the Farm community. The Farm formed a non-profit corporation called The Foundation to provide a common financial structure for the community and members contributed their incomes to it. A security crew constantly maintained a welcome center at the entrance gate where all traffic passed through and was logged in.

In the original manifestation of The Farm, all members were believers in the holiness of life, and believed in the reality of a spiritual dimension and in living out universal brotherhood.

The Farm community ate what might today be called a vegan diet. In the introduction of 1978 edition of &quot;The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook&quot; it states, &quot;We are completely vegetarian. We eat no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or any kind of animal dairy products. Our diet is based on the soybean, which we eat in many different forms, along with other legumes, grains, fruits and vegetables. We grow our own food and recommend it whenever possible.&quot; The book is described as the &quot;family cookbook&quot; of the 1,100 residents living on 1,750 acres in southern Middle Tennessee. The rationale for the diet is stated thus: &quot;We are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night. If everyone was vegetarian, there would be enough food to go around, and no one would be hungry.&quot;

Gaskin, who had served in the United States Marine Corps, got his start as a religious leader in San Francisco in the 1960s, coming to teach a blend of Eastern religions and Christianity. Due to his devotion to marijuana, he and three followers spent time in 1974 in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville following convictions for growing marijuana on Farm land.

==Community evolution==

===Early growth pains===
The Farm&#x27;s outreach, combined with notoriety through popular media articles, led to a population boom that eventually peaked at around 1600 members living on the main property. Additionally, some &quot;satellite farm&quot; affinity communities which were located in the U.S. and other countries consolidated by moving to the Tennessee community. Signs started to appear between 1975 and 1979 that the Tennessee community&#x27;s weak infrastructure and low income was insufficiently developed to support such a continuously large influx of new members, most of whom did not contribute substantially. The Foundation went increasingly into debt. Members chose to turn over all money to the collective. Some donated inherited wealth or investment income, but most of it went for the group&#x27;s Third World projects, or for immediate needs such as food and clothing, rather than planned improvements to the property. Occasionally Gaskin would request a large sum to fund his traveling expenses, which included touring around the world. Cottage industries including sorghum molasses, a publishing company and natural food did not generate sufficient income.

Furthering the Farm&#x27;s growing pains was a baby boom resulting from the large number of young adults of childbearing age combined with an enthusiastic family philosophy being put into practice. Ina May Gaskin and other resident midwives advertised their services in the national underground press, which led to numerous couples and their infants moving in without contributing. A small number of infants were adopted by Farm members after the midwives offered to accept, deliver, and keep a woman&#x27;s baby as an alternative to abortion. Most mothers kept their babies after the children were born or came back for them not long after.

Gaskin insisted that anyone who wished to partake of Farm life should be allowed to try, even those who were seriously mentally ill, believing the experience would be therapeutic. These proved to be a huge drain on the patience and energy of the residents. Lack of electricity and insufficient capacity of sewage infrastructure resources led to some giardia outbreaks and malcontent. Gaskin discouraged expressions of discontent and doubt, so that it was impossible to question the established order or propose improvements. As the Farm&#x27;s population peaked, a disproportionately higher number of children or less-skilled residents could not significantly contribute to the community&#x27;s economic needs. Gaskin, who was often traveling, may not have been aware of the seriousness of these deprivations, or believed they would improve if members persevered.

===The Changeover===
In 1983, due to financial difficulties and also a challenge to Stephen Gaskin&#x27;s leadership and direction, The Farm changed its residential community agreement and began requiring members to support themselves with their own income rather than to donate all income to The Foundation central corporation. This decollectivization was called &quot;the Changeover&quot;. Many people left disillusioned. The surrounding local rural area provided few possibilities for outside employment. The nearest large city, Nashville, was a 1.5-hour drive away. Those who could not adapt to the new dynamics of The Changeover found it difficult to remain. Those who had forged independent business opportunities or had reduced overhead could afford to stay.

===Recovery===
Eventually the population settled back down to fewer than 200 adults and children. Those who continued living in the community were buoyed by its freedom and peaceful atmosphere, and the safety and security it provided for their children. The $400,000 plus debt was paid off after several years and the community became debt-free. An entrepreneurial spirit took hold, and numerous small businesses were established to provide support for the residents. Many members went back to school to get degrees in the medical field, and many now work at clinics and hospitals throughout Middle Tennessee.

In the 1990s, with the community back on solid ground, The Farm returned to its original purpose of initiating social change through outreach and example. The Ecovillage Training Center was established as an educational facility in new technologies such as solar energy, bio fuels, and construction techniques based on locally available, eco-friendly materials.

===Recent status===
The Farm&#x27;s population is approximately 200; residents are mostly baby boomers (about 70%), many of whom have lived on The Farm for most of its existence. Those interested in becoming residents are encouraged to visit during the bi-annual Farm Experience Weekend, which provides a glimpse into how the community operates and functions.

In 2004, the Wholeo Dome (a geodesic dome fourteen feet in diameter and seven feet tall, covered with curved stained glass panels) was installed at The Farm. It was created in 1974 by artist Caroling Geary. In May 2010 repairs were completed on the Wholeo Dome, but is currently in storage due to issues with the lead in stained glass artwork.

The Farm maintains contact with some of its 4000-plus former members through email lists, social media forums, an annual reunion each summer, and through the work of its nonprofit organizations. Former members have gone on to become leaders in many different fields and endeavors, maintaining a sense of right livelihood and a commitment to the betterment of the world.

==Social and family issues==
Stephen Gaskin believed that marriage was a sacred act and that, &quot;For a community to exist in harmony and balance, both kinds of energy had to be nurtured, and most importantly shared.&quot; Seriousness and commitment were required in marriage. With the exception of the Rhythm Method, in the early years birth control was frowned upon, and abortions were prohibited in the community. As an alternative to abortion, the Farm publicly offered to deliver any baby for free and then to find a loving family to raise the child. If the birth mother ever wanted the child she could have it back, and ultimately most kept their babies. Childbearing was natural, and births were attended by midwives. Premarital sex was greatly discouraged, and most couples on the Farm were married.

==Projects==
The Farm has its own electrical crew, composting crew, farming crew, communications, construction &amp; demolition crew, clinic, firewood crew, alternative energy crew, motor pool, laundromat, tofu plant, bakery, school and ambulance service. It established The Book Publishing Company, which has published the works of the Gaskins and other Farm members. The Farm&#x27;s midwifery school and Ina May Gaskin&#x27;s germinal book &quot;Spiritual Midwifery&quot; emphasize maternal and newborn compassion, safety and natural home birth.

They also run a &quot;soy dairy&quot;, which developed and later marketed a soymilk ice &quot;cream&quot; called &quot;Ice-Bean&quot;, and a vegetable store in the town of Summertown.

===Tennessee Farm Band===
They maintained The Farm Band, a rock group in the early &#x27;jam band&#x27; style, which toured the country performing for free at parks, schools, churches, and other accessible venues.
Albums from the 1970s include &quot;The Farm Band&quot; on Mantra Records, and &quot;Up in Your Thing&quot;, &quot;High On the Rim of the Nashville Basin&quot; and &quot;Communion&quot; on Farm Tapes &amp; Records. There were also a number of 45 releases. All Farm Band recordings were self-produced and distributed. During the 2000s (decade), Akarma Records in Italy distributed bootleg copies of these albums. In addition to the rock music recordings, Stephen Gaskin released a spoken word album titled the &quot;Great Western Tour&quot; in 1974, which was produced and distributed in the same way as their other LPs.

===The Nuclear Regulatory Commission===
Another music project of The Farm was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (also known as &quot;NRC&quot;), a New wave music band. They released a 7-inch EP, &quot;We Are the NRC&quot;, and an album, &quot;Reactor&quot;, in 1980, and a second 7-inch EP, &quot;Sally&#x27;s All Alone (After the End)&quot;, in 1982.

===Plenty===

In 1974, after helping local neighbors after a tornado, the Farm formed Plenty (later, Plenty International), its charitable works arm. It began by gathering and supplying food for local disaster victims and holding weekly &quot;quilting bees&quot; to make blankets for them.

Plenty&#x27;s most notable early project was its four-year presence in the Guatemalan highlands after the earthquake of 1976, helping to rebuild 1,200 houses and lay 27 kilometers (17 miles) of waterpipe. There, it established a micro-commune of volunteers and their families, living simply among Mayan populations and working under the approval of the military government.

In 1980, Plenty was the recipient of the first Right Livelihood Award, an alternative to the Nobel prize, also based in Sweden.

Plenty donated an ambulance in the early 1980s to the Akwesasne Mohawk Reservation in upstate New York. Two Farmies â one a paramedic and one an EMT â taught a licensed Emergency Medical Technician course to 22 reservation residents, helping them set up their first Mohawk-run EMT service, the &quot;Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Ambulance Unit&quot;. Plenty has set up medical clinics in Lesotho and Mexico and created the Jefferson Award-winning South Bronx Ambulance Project in New York City.

Plenty maintains an office in Belize, Central America, which initiated a school lunch program based on organic gardens planted next to each school to help provide more fresh vegetables for the children&#x27;s diets. A midwifery program helped train over 60 Mayan women from villages throughout the region in prenatal care and safe delivery techniques.

Plenty was one of the first relief organizations to enter New Orleans, getting past federal roadblocks to bring supplies to survivors just three days after Hurricane Katrina. Plenty helped establish a base camp for volunteers and channeled funding to Common Ground Collective, a local group assisting in cleanup, legal defense services, and the operation of free clinics. Plenty volunteers purchased and restored a home in the area to serve as a headquarters for housing relief volunteers and construction crews helping to rebuild homes.

Melvyn Stiriss, a Plenty volunteer carpenter describes a year of earthquake reconstruction, working with Mayans, in &quot;Hippie Peace Corps Goes to Guatemala&quot;, part 4 of &quot;Voluntary Peasants&quot; published by New Beat Books, Warwick, NY 2015

===Book Publishing Company===
Some of the early titles produced by the Book Publishing Company illustrated the early interests of the Farm community; volumes included &quot;The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook&quot; (ed. Louise Hagler, 1975), &quot;Volume One: Sunday Morning Services on the Farm&quot; by Stephen Gaskin, &quot;...this season&#x27;s people&quot; by Stephen Gaskin, &quot;Spiritual Midwifery&quot; by Ina May Gaskin, &quot;A Cooperative Method of Natural Birth&quot; by Margaret Nofziger, &quot;The Big Dummy&#x27;s Guide to C.B. Radio&quot; by Albert Houston and the Radio Crew, and &quot;Shutdown: Nuclear Power on Trial&quot;, by John Gofman and Ernest Sternglass. Book Publishing Company publishes under the imprints Healthy Living, GroundSwell Books, Native Voices, 7th Generation, and Books Alive. For over 31 years Joanne Stepaniak has been Supervising Editor at Book Publishing Company.

==Technology==

===Infrastructure===
There was no infrastructure grid on The Farm&#x27;s land when it was first settled by the nascent community. Originally relying on antique kerosene lanterns and manual message runners, The Farm grew rapidly to adopt appropriate technology for electricity, communications, medical, mass media, education, and entertainment. Some of the early residents of The Farm brought their skills as engineers and technicians with them; they took on a multi-year development to build The Farm&#x27;s novel network of communications and electrical supply.

Initially, a single landline or party line shared with several of their Tennessee neighbors was available for outside telephone calls, with a waiting list for any calls. Spurred mainly by the need for prompt childbirth assistance and emergency medical response, a field-phone style party line system was installed by The Farm&#x27;s telephone crew in 1971. Telephone lines were expanded to widely cover even the most remote areas over the following year. Instead of common telephone bell ringers, the first telephones used Morse Code beeps to signal a call. The party line, affectionately known as &quot;Beatnik Bell&quot;, was eventually enabled in 1974 to route calls via a manual operator interconnect link patch to the outside line. Later, a 500 line Kellogg-ITT Relaymatic rotary dial phone system was installed in PBX configuration, with multiple outside trunk lines gated through a plug-style manual switchboard operator. Basic community CATV cables were later run to some areas along the telephone line paths.

The Farm installed its own water system and water towers. Some individuals initially resisted running electricity and power lines beyond the administration office and publishing center, with the hope of establishing off-grid decentralized utilities instead. The electrical supply 120/240 VAC mains system evolved from supplying only a few industrial buildings near the main Farm Road in 1971 to the point by the 1980s where most areas were covered by 12 Volt automotive battery trickle charge systems. Most homes phased out the use of kerosene lamps by 1975, as they converted to 12 Volt lighting and RV appliances or re-purposed automotive lighting fixtures. Off-grid low voltage 12 Volt DC systems were also sometimes powered by swapping vehicle batteries. After the economic change in 1983, all homes were connected to the standard electrical grid.

===Wireless communications===
The first use of wireless communications on The Farm was in 1971, when a ham radio HF SSB system was set up. Ham radio was used for health and welfare regional communications between mobile ham operators who were on the road with The Farm Band. The Farm Net, as the ham radio network was known, evolved into a worldwide daily operations schedule on 21332Â kHz and 21442Â kHz Upper Sideband and CW Morse Code in the 15-meter band, and a regional daily morning schedule on 7245Â kHz Lower Sideband in the 40-meter ham band. At the network&#x27;s peak in 1978, The Farm Net included over 40 ham radio operators on associated and affinity communities, as well as many HF SSB mobile and battery-operated portable HF radio stations. From its main base station, The Farm Net expanded to cover HF SSB communication links to stations in North America, Africa, and Europe using a field of tall radio towers on The Farm&#x27;s ridgetop. Ham radio operators from The Farm volunteered with the Plenty International disaster relief operations for the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, with the Greenpeace anti-whaling campaigns, and many humanitarian response efforts worldwide. Ham radio was invaluable for voice communications consultations between doctors and field medical teams, and it included the use of HF slow scan TV for the relatively new concept of telemedicine. The ham radio was also used for technical discussions about alternative sources of energy, a popular topic among the back-to-the-land-movement, especially during the time of the 1970s energy crisis. The Farm&#x27;s ham radio operators also used CB radios, as the cost of CB transceivers had dropped impressively during the mid-1970s. CB radios were widely adopted by The Farm for mobile general purpose local communications during this time, while CB radio was starting to become a nationwide craze. This eventually led to the writing of the book &quot;The Big Dummy&#x27;s Guide to CB Radio&quot;, which became a non-fiction bestseller. The popularity and sales of &quot;The Big Dummy&#x27;s Guide To CB Radio&quot; fueled the launch of the Book Publishing Company&#x27;s new printing presses, and provided much-needed income for The Farm at a crucial time in its growth. Later, The Farm&#x27;s medical and security communications utilized VHF FM handheld two-way radios.

==Organizations==

The Farm is home to many organizations, including:

* The Midwifery Center, led by Ina May Gaskin, who is often referred to as &quot;the mother of authentic midwifery.&quot;
* The Ecovillage Training Center, which offers conferences and seminars on organic gardening, permaculture, strawbale construction, and sustainable technologies.
* Plenty International, an international aid and development NGO that helps indigenous populations, at-risk children, and the environment.
* More Than Warmth, a project in which children create quilts to be sent abroad in countries dealing with conflict.

===The Farm School===

The Farm School Solar and Satellite Campuses are K-12 programs that offer alternative education options for home-based learners (over 1200 students) and at a schoolhouse (approximately 25 students) on The Farm.

==In the media==
The Farm was featured in Peter Jenkins&#x27; travel book &quot;A Walk Across America&quot;.

The Farm is the subject of the documentary &quot;American Commune&quot; directed by Rena Mundo Croshere and her sister Nadine Mundo, both of whom were children at The Farm from the mid-1970s until The Changeover in the early 1980s.

<text>Martin H[e]inrich Carl Lichtenstein (10 January 1780 â 2 September 1857) was a German physician, explorer, botanist and zoologist. He explored parts of southern Africa and collected natural history specimens extensively and many new species were described from his collections by European scientists.

==Biography==

Born in Hamburg, Lichtenstein was the son of Anton August Heinrich Lichtenstein, head of the Johanneum. His father had an interest in eastern languages and built up an extensive library. He took an interest in natural history and geography from an early age, and came into contact with Count Johann Centurius von Hoffmannsegg in 1797 and began to help examine the Count&#x27;s extensive collections of insects and birds. He then went to study medicine at Jena and Helmstedt and qualified as a doctor on 26 April 1802. He then chose to travel and found work when the Dutch governor of the Cape, General Jan Willem Janssens sought a German tutor for his son. Lichtenstein prepared himself by reading the accounts of travellers like Peter Kolbe, Anders Sparrman, Carl Peter Thunberg, FranÃ§ois Le Vaillant and John Barrow. He also met the collectors Johann Hellwig (1743â1831) and Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger (1775â1813) who gave him an overview of the gaps in the knowledge of the flora and fauna of the African region and on methods for collecting specimens. He reached Cape Town on 23 December 1802 and from that point he travelled widely around southern Africa, becoming the personal physician of the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope. In 1811 he published &quot;Reisen im sÃ¼dlichen Afrika : in den Jahren 1803, 1804, 1805, und 1806&quot;; as a result, he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Berlin in 1811, and appointed director of the Berlin Zoological Museum in 1813. His collections of plants from Africa was examined in Germany by Carl Willdenow. He travelled to London in 1819 to purchase specimens for the Berlin Museum at auctions.

Lichtenstein was a close friend of Carl Maria von Weber. After his death, in 1826, together with the banker Wilhelm Beer, he arranged for the sale of the score of Oberon to the Berlin music publisher Adolf Martin Schlesinger on behalf of Weber&#x27;s widow Caroline. As guardian together with Carl Theodor Winkler, he participated in the education of Weber&#x27;s orphaned sons Max Maria and Alexander.

Together with Alexander von Humboldt, Lichtenstein organized the annual meeting of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Berlin in 1828. In 1829, Lichtenstein was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was also appointed Privy Councillor in Berlin. 

He died from a stroke at sea while aboard a steamer from KorsÃ¸r to Kiel.

==Legacy==

Lichtenstein was responsible for the creation of Berlin&#x27;s Zoological Gardens in 1841, when he persuaded King Frederick William IV of Prussia to donate the grounds of his pheasantry. He also published Johann Reinhold Forster&#x27;s manuscripts for &quot;Descriptiones animalium&quot; in 1844.

In the field of herpetology he described many new species of amphibians and reptiles.

Among species named by Lichtenstein are the Australian king parrot (&quot;Alisterus scapularis&quot;), the crowned sandgrouse (&quot;Pterocles coronatus&quot;), and the Cape night adder (&quot;Causus rhombeatus&quot;).

In 1826, botanists Cham. &amp; Schltdl. published a genus of flowering plants from South Africa, belonging to the family Apiaceae as &quot;Lichtensteinia&quot; in his honour. A genus &quot;Lichtensteinia&quot; was also erected by Carl Willdenow but this is a rejected name.

In 1856 Johann Jakob Kaup named the seahorse &quot;Hippocampus lichtensteinii&quot; after him.

Then in 1859 Italian herpetologist, Giorgio Jan, named the forest night adder (&quot;Causus lichtensteinii&quot;) in his honor of Hinrich Lichtenstein, as did the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck with Lichtenstein&#x27;s sandgrouse (&quot;Pterocles lichtensteinii&quot; ).

==Writings==
Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;Reisen im sÃ¼dlichen Afrika in den Jahren 1803, 1804, 1805 und 1806&quot; was translated into English by Anne Plumptre, and published in 1812 as &quot;Travels in Southern Africa in the years 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1806&quot;.

<text>Glengarry Glen Ross is a play by David Mamet that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984. The play shows parts of two days in the lives of four desperate Chicago real estate agents who are prepared to engage in any number of unethical, illegal actsâfrom lies and flattery to bribery, threats, intimidation and burglaryâto sell real estate to unwitting prospective buyers. It is based on Mamet&#x27;s experience having previously worked in a similar office.

The title comes from two real estate developments mentioned in the play. Glengarry Highlands is the prime real estate everyone is attempting to sell now; Glen Ross Farms is mentioned by several characters as having been very lucrative for those selling it several years ago.

The world premiere was at the National Theatre in London on 21 September 1983, where Bill Bryden&#x27;s production in the Cottesloe Theatre was acclaimed as a triumph of ensemble acting.

The play opened on Broadway on 25 March 1984, at the John Golden Theatre, and closed on 17 February 1985 after 378 performances. The production was directed by Gregory Mosher, and starred Joe Mantegna, Mike Nussbaum, Robert Prosky, Lane Smith, James Tolkan, Jack Wallace and J. T. Walsh. It was nominated for four Tony awards including Best Play, Best Director, and two Best Featured Actor nominations for Robert Prosky and Joe Mantegna, who won the production&#x27;s one Tony.

A film adaptation was released in 1992, with James Foley directing and Mamet providing the screenplay. The cast featured Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce.

==Characters==
* Richard &quot;Ricky&quot; Roma: The most successful salesman in the office. Although Roma seems to think of himself as a latter-day cowboy and regards his ability to make a sale as a sign of his virility, he admits only to himself that it is all luck. He is ruthless, dishonest and immoral, and succeeds because he has a talent for figuring out a client&#x27;s weaknesses and crafting a pitch that will exploit those weaknesses. He is a smooth talker and tends to maneuver clients towards a sale by means of grand but vaguely incoherent soliloquies.
* Shelley &quot;The Machine&quot; Levene: An older, once-successful salesman, who has fallen on hard times and has not closed a big deal in a long time. In Mamet&#x27;s original 1983 stage version, Levene reveals his daughter&#x27;s plight as a final ploy to gain Williamson&#x27;s sympathy to get better leads, although this fails. However, in the 1992 film version, Levene&#x27;s discussion of his daughter also includes comments and a phone call to her doctor about her poor health, making Levene more sympathetic.
* James Lingk: A timid, middle-aged man who becomes Roma&#x27;s latest client. Lingk is easily manipulated and finds Roma highly charismatic. After consulting his wife, he becomes desperate to regain the money that Roma has convinced him to commit to a land deal.
* John Williamson: The office manager. The salesmen need him because he hands out the sales leads but Williamson does not like how they treat him, especially Levene, who berates him for the unpromising leads Levene always seems to get.
* George Aaronow: An aging salesman with low self-esteem who, lacking hope and confidence, is not without conscience. His frustration begins to boil up when the office is robbed, and he worries about being convicted based upon Detective Baylen&#x27;s interrogation. Ironically, he and Roma end up the remaining two salesmen for the firm after Levene is found out and gives up Moss as his co-conspirator.
* Dave Moss: A big-mouthed salesman with big dreams and schemes. Moss resents Williamson and agency owners Mitch and Murray for putting such pressure on him and plans to strike back at them by stealing all their best sales leads and selling them to a competitor. Moss sees Aaronow as a potential accomplice, but eventually convinces Levene to work with him in selling the leads to Jerry Graff, a local competitor. During his final rant against Roma, his indignation reveals that his jealousy extends towards even his fellow salesmen, and he decides to go to Wisconsin to avoid further questioning.
* Baylen: A police detective. He appears in the final act to investigate the office break-in and harshly interrogate each cast member behind closed doors.
* Mitch and Murray: The unsavory unseen characters who are the owners of the real estate agency. Their &quot;sales contest&quot; puts enormous pressure on the salesmen to produce or lose their jobs; only the top two men will receive prizes, while the rest will be fired.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Setting: a Chinese restaurant

Scene 1: Shelly Levene tries to convince office manager John Williamson to give him some of &quot;the Glengarry leads&quot; (names and phone numbers of promising potential clients for expensive properties). Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. Levene cannot come up with the cash and must leave without any good leads to work with.

Scene 2: Dave Moss and George Aaronow hate the pressure management has put on them to succeed. Moss tells Aaronow that they need to strike back by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to another real estate agency. Moss&#x27;s plan would require Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary, and steal all the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss intimidates him, claiming that he is already an accomplice simply by listening to Moss&#x27;s pitch.

Scene 3: Ricky Roma delivers a monologue to James Lingk. Roma does not bring up the real estate he wants to sell to Lingk until the very end. Instead, Roma preys upon Lingk&#x27;s insecurities, and his sense that he has never done anything adventurous with his life.

===Act II===
Setting: a real estate sales office

The burglary is discovered. Williamson has summoned a police detective. Shelley Levene is happy, because he has finally sold a large plot of land to a couple named Nyborg. James Lingk enters the office, looking for Ricky Roma. Lingk&#x27;s wife has ordered him to cancel the sales
contract he signed with Roma. Roma attempts to smooth-talk Lingk into not canceling the contract, informing Lingk that his check has not yet been brought to the bank; this begins to have its intended calming effect on Lingk, who is clearly agitated. Levene supports the ruse, but Williamson, thinking Lingk is worried about the safety of his check, accidentally ruins Roma&#x27;s ploy when he tells Lingk that his check has just been deposited. Lingk abruptly leaves, telling Roma he&#x27;s sorry for letting him down.

Roma is furious at Williamson, who has blown a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins insulting Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson made up the claim about the check being cashed, information he could not have known unless he had been in Williamson&#x27;s office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they&#x27;re so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he wouldn&#x27;t give him the leads in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn&#x27;t like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man&#x27;s flippant nature. Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.

Roma, unaware of Levene&#x27;s fate, reveals his true intentions behind the partnership. Roma orders Williamson to not only continue to hand him the best leads, but to add half of Levene&#x27;s commissions. Williamson tells Roma not to worry about it but Roma won&#x27;t listen. (This exchange, which suggests that Williamson may let Levene off the hook so that he and Roma can take his future earnings, is omitted in both the published play script and film adaptation.) Aaronow enters the office, desperate to know if they found the perpetrators. Roma says no and heads out to the restaurant.

==Controversy==
There was controversy over lines in the play, and in the film adaptation of it, in which it was claimed prejudice was shown against Indian Americans. As a result, Mamet removed the language from a 2004 San Francisco revival. The controversial dialogue is included in the film version about a potential lead from the &quot;Patels&quot;, an Indian family name.

==Productions==
The world premiere of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; was at the Cottesloe Theatre of the Royal National Theatre in London on 21 September 1983, directed by Bill Bryden.

* John Tams â Baylen

&quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; had its U.S. premiere on 6 February 1984, at the Goodman Theatre of the Art Institute of Chicago before moving to Broadway on 25 March 1984 at the John Golden Theatre and running for 378 shows.

* Mike Nussbaum â George Aaronow
* Joe Mantegna â Richard Roma
* William L. Petersen â James Lingk (Chicago)
* Lane Smith â James Lingk (Broadway)

On 18 February 2000, the first major regional revival opened at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey, starring Charles Durning as Levene and Ruben Santiago-Hudson as Roma.

On 1 May 2005, a Broadway revival directed by Joe Mantello opened at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The revival starred Liev Schreiber as Roma, Alan Alda as Levene, Frederick Weller as Williamson, Gordon Clapp as Moss, Jeffrey Tambor as Aaronow, Tom Wopat as Lingk and Jordan Lage as Baylen. The revival received numerous Tony Award nominations, including Best Featured Actor nominations for Schreiber, Clapp and Alda, with Schreiber taking home the prize. The production also won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.

On 27 September 2007, the play was revived at the Apollo Theatre, London, starring Jonathan Pryce (who played client James Lingk in the 1992 film adaptation) as Levene, alongside Aidan Gillen (Roma), Paul Freeman (Aaronow), Matthew Marsh (Moss) and Peter McDonald (Williamson). The production was directed by James Macdonald.

&quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; has also been produced as a radio play for BBC Radio 3, featuring HÃ©ctor Elizondo, Stacy Keach, Bruce Davison, and Alfred Molina as Roma, first airing 20 March 2005.

A second Broadway revival, directed by Daniel Sullivan, opened on 8 December 2012 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. The production starred Al Pacino (who had played Roma in the 1992 film) as Levene, Bobby Cannavale as Roma, David Harbour as Williamson, John C. McGinley as Moss, Jeremy Shamos as Lingk, Richard Schiff as Aaronow and Murphy Guyer as Baylen. This version received mixed reviews, with Pacino&#x27;s portrayal of Levene being criticized.

Pretty Villain Productions performed at Rialto Theatre as part of Brighton Fringe in May 2016, winning an award and favourable reviews.

On 26 October 2017, a revival in London&#x27;s West End directed by Sam Yates opened at the Playhouse Theatre, running for 14 weeks. The production starred Christian Slater as Roma, Robert Glenister as Moss, Kris Marshall as Blake, Stanley Townsend as Levene, Don Warrington as Aaronow, Oliver Ryan as Baylen and Daniel Ryan as Lingk. From February 2019 the production will tour the UK starring Mark Benton as Levene and Nigel Harman as Roma, with further casting to be announced.

The character played in the film version by Alec Baldwin was written specifically for the movie and does not appear in the playscript. At least some amateur revivals of the play have added the scene back in; one placed it at the start with Blake directly addressing the audience. (Baldwin&#x27;s character simply gives his name as &quot;Fuck You&quot; in the film, although credits refer to him as &quot;Blake&quot;.)

On 8 August 2024, a third Broadway revival of the play was announced for spring 2025, directed by Patrick Marber and starring Kieran Culkin as Richard Roma, Bob Odenkirk as Shelley Levene, and Bill Burr as Dave Moss, the latter two making their Broadway debuts. The production will run at the Palace Theatre. In September, Michael McKean joined the cast in the role of George Aaronow, with Donald Webber Jr., Howard W. Overshown and John Pirruccello cast in November as John Williamson, Detective Baylen and James Lingk respectively.

* Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene
* Kevin Spacey as John Williamson
* Ed Harris as Dave Moss
* Alan Arkin as George Aaronow
* Al Pacino as Richard Roma

<text>Fr. Juan Ignacio Molina (; (June 24, 1740 â September 12, 1829) was a Chilean-Spanish Jesuit priest, naturalist, historian, translator, geographer, botanist, ornithologist, and linguist. He is usually referred to as Abate Molina (Abbot Molina), and is also sometimes known by the Italian form of his name, Giovanni Ignazio Molina.

He was one of the precursors of the theory of the gradual evolution of species, 44 years before Darwin, who repeatedly quoted him in &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Molina was born at GuaraculÃ©n, a big farm located near Villa Alegre (General Captaincy of Chile), where he lived until he was 5 years old. In the current province of Linares, in the Maule Region of Chile. His parents were AgustÃ­n Molina and Francisca GonzÃ¡lez Bruna. From an early age he was attracted to the nature of his environment, and in addition to his school work, he enjoyed observing nature on the family farm, which he visited periodically, alternating with his studies. This is how Molina described his interest in nature:

&quot;My character led me from my most tender years to observe nature and particularly animals, so while I lived in my country, Chile, I did all possible research. A set of known circumstances from around the world forced me to interrupt my observations (Suppression of the Society of Jesus).&quot;

The family moved to Talca when Juan Ignacio was only five years old. At the same time, the Jesuits settled in the block called &quot;las Arboledas&quot;, in the newly created Villa de Talca, where they built their residence house. In the north corner they built in their early years a humble house with a &quot;thatch and straw roof&quot;, the place was used to install a &quot;School of first Letters&quot;, an obligation imposed on them by the decree of installation of June 10, 1748.
The reputation for intellectual excellence in the Order led the leading families of the city to enroll their children there. In that humble place, Molina took his first steps into the knowledge of human letters. With his shrewd intelligence he became known as a talented child, learning fast with a good memory. Thus, at a young age, with the consent of his superiors, he began his work as a teacher in the school of first letters.

As a result of his academic excellence â especially in Literature and Latin â he was accepted as a Jesuit at the age of fifteen. He had a novitiate in various locations of the Order, in Talca, ConcepciÃ³n and Santiago. He lived on the estate of Bucalemu in the area known today as El Convento in the El Yali wet land. In those calm and quiet conditions he revived the intellectual work that would later make him well known, Molina delved into the study of the classics and the natural sciences. His progress was very fast and within five years (he was 20 years old at the time) he already had a solid knowledge of Latin, Greek, French and Italian. That merit led him to be transferred in 1760 to the Jesuit residence in Santiago, where he worked as a librarian. In 1761, in a room at the Universidad Pontificia Colegio MÃ¡ximo de San Miguel, Molina renounced his assets, setting aside 100 pesos from these that were reserved for the purchase of books.
=== Exile ===

In 1768 he was forced to leave Chile due to the Suppression of the Society of Jesus. He settled in Italy where, thanks to his linguistic skills, he obtained the chair of Greek language at the University of Bologna. He soon achieved a good reputation as a historian and geographer, due to his Saggio sulla Storia Naturale del Chili (1778) and Saggio sulla Storia Civile del Chili (1787). Finally he became a professor of Natural Sciences (1803), given his studies in that area. For example, he published (1782) the Saggio sulla Storia Naturale del Cile, in which he described the natural history of Chile for the first time and introduced numerous species native to that country to science. Furthermore, in that work he is also the first to mention the Paramillos de Uspallata mines, of lead, silver and zinc. All of these works were translated, attracting considerable attention, into German, Spanish, French, and English. In botany, it is regulatory and permissible to simply write &quot;Molina&quot; when a reference is made to any of his descriptions. He also reached the rank of member of the Royal Italian Institute of Sciences, Letters and Arts and the high dignity of the first American academic of the learned Academy of the Institute of Sciences. He became so renowned, that even Alexander von Humboldt visited him.

===Published work===
His admirable style, clear, elegant and simple, together with his philosophical and positive spirit, gave his works the character of brilliance. In his preparatory work he was very meticulous and hardworking, visiting libraries and taking notes on everything that might interest him. The  preserves numerous strips of paper written in his own hand, the living testimony of his industriousness. He also became very loved by his students, who esteemed him very much for considering him mild in his dealings and for his kind character. Molina taught them Latin, rhetoric, geography, and history. In response, his students gave him snuff and coffee, two of the simple passions of the now elderly priest, who lived in a modest house on the outskirts of Bologna.

There was a considerable interest in &quot;Less Observed Analogies of the Three Kingdoms of Nature&quot; (1815) and On the &quot;Propagation of Mankind in the Various Parts of the Earth&quot; (1818). In the first he proposed â 44 years before Charles Darwin â a theory of gradual evolution. According to his proposition, the Creator organized nature not into three totally different kingdoms (animal, mineral, vegetable), but as a continuous chain of organization, without sudden steps or breaks, into Â«three species of life, that is, the formative, vegetative and sensitive life; so that the first, destined to minerals, participates to some degree in the second, typical of plants, and this, in the third, assigned to animals. Thus, for example, crystalline minerals precede the simplest plant forms. And complex plant organizations give way to animals. In the second mentioned work, Molina proposed the thesis that the observable physical differences in the human race are due to climatic and geographical factors.
The impact that such ideas caused confusing episode were an ex-student of Molina, the illustrious Ronzoni, censor of the University of Bologna, accused him of heresy and the Bishop of Bologna ordered a council of theologians to examine his work. Logically, that committee found nothing against the faith in his writings and authorized their publication. Despite this, his AnalogÃ­as could not be published for a long time because of the lateness of the bishop&#x27;s decision, and only its original in Spanish was preserved in Italy. It can be argued that this deprived Darwin â who quotes Molina numerous times â and his supporters from powerful backgrounds and arguments, and cost Molina himself the chance to be known as one of the forerunners of the theory of evolution.

=== Last years ===

Molina did not stop from being interested for the fate of his family. He corresponded with them until 1795. He knew of the death of his mother, his brother, and his nephew AgustÃ­n Molina, the only male in the family and heir to his grandparents&#x27; fortune. The ungrateful nephew, who never had a deference for his uncle who lived in exile beyond the seas, married DoÃ±a Manuela Vergara, with whom he was neither happy nor succeeded. Upon his death, which occurred suddenly in the houses of the HuaraculÃ©n hacienda in February 1815, his property was passed on to his uncle, who was the sole heir.

His other nephew, Don Ignacio Opazo Castro, owner of PanimÃ¡vida and neighbor of the deceased don AgustÃ­n, took charge of his family&#x27;s assets, which consisted of an Hacienda and the house of his parents, in Talca. A count was made of the homes, and yielded a total of $12,670 pesos. Ignacio Opazo exchanged correspondence with Molina, to give him an account of the diligence.

Juan Ignacio, with deep pain and sadness, replied by letter dated in Bologna on December 11, 1815, which reads as follows:

In this letter, he shows his ardent desire that his kind soul harbored to be among his loved ones again, to see the land of his parents and to rest forever in his land where he was born.
Molina was already 75 years old, when he thought about returning to Chile. The news of independence, along with the news that the Spanish Crown had reestablished the Jesuit Company in America. With such good news, he thought to move onto CÃ¡diz in 1816, with his relative Manuel Bachiller to the home of his friend NicolÃ¡s de la Cruz Bahamonde, Conde del maule. Unfortunately it could not be carried out, since Don Ignacio Opazo, did not reach him to remit three thousand pesos that he asked for from his inheritance to make his trip. Because Ignacio died in Santiago in 1815.
With the death of his last relative, his inheritance ended up in the hands of various administrators, until they were completely abandoned. Faced with this dilemma, the authorities of the nascent Republic of Chile, confusing the money with that of a deceased Spaniard, allocated the money to the construction of the Primera escuadra nacional. Molina, in imposing himself on this decision, instead of feeling angry, he exclaimed:

Oh, what a beautiful determination the authorities of the Republic have made! In no other way could they have interpreted my will better than how they have, provided that everything has to be for the benefit of the country!
By agreement of the Senate of Chile, dated May 27, 1820, the money was returned to him.

Molina continued in Bologna. He lived wrapped in affection by all those who knew him. Of his fellow exiles, only AgustÃ­n Zambrano, a nonagenarian, remained.

In 1823 he received a visit from JosÃ© Ignacio Cienfuegos. This visit filled the old abbe with hope. Cienfuegos updated him on what was happening in Chile and the monarchist counterrevolution. Despite his age, Molina once again felt the desire to undertake the journey to his homeland.

&quot;&quot;He wanted to come back with me&quot; says Cienfuegos, &quot;to have the pleasure of seeing his beloved land, whose freedom had been so placid, and he eagerly wanted to come and give hugs to his compatriots, which he could not achieve due to his advanced age&quot;.&quot;

During his conversation with Cienfuegos, he expressed his desire to dedicate his fortune to the construction of a house of education in Talca. Cienfuegos did the diligences, and the project was carried out successfully. Creating a Literary Institute Talca, in which Spanish grammar, Latin, Philosophy and Theology would be taught.
The abbe thus had the satisfaction of seeing his work begun. Since 1814 he had felt his health decline, but he remained in good condition until 1825; he could read with ease, teach poor children for free, and go on his daily walk. Since then the flame of his existence has been slowly extinguished. Confined to his home, the idea of death came naturally to him. His true evil was the old age, in his last days a slow and painful agony made him suffer great bitterness and a constant and devouring thirst. &quot;&quot;Agua fresca de la Cordillera&quot;!&quot; which means: &quot;Fresh water from the Cordillera!&quot;. He asked in his delusions, remembering that river of pure water, from the Andes Mountains in Chile. On September 12, 1829, at eight o&#x27;clock at night, he died.
=== Scientific work ===
As a scientist native to the Americas Molina was very critical of the work of Cornelius de Pauw, who was in Europe regarded as an expert on the Americas, and accused him of &quot;always attempting to degrade and discredit the Americas&quot;. Some of De Pauw&#x27;s statements on the supposedly poor aspects of the mineral wealth of the Americas were countered by Molina as well as De Pauw&#x27;s claims on the shorter lives of people that inhabited the Americas.

Molina expressed support for a sedimentary origin of basalt in &quot;Ensayo sobre la historia natural de Chile&quot; where he pointed out the fact that basalt occurred both in the Andes and in coast of ChiloÃ© where there were no sign of eruption and believed basalt to be a sort of compacted slate with vesicles.

As early as 1787 Molina mentioned the possibility of South America being populated from south Asia through the &quot;infinite island chains&quot; of the Pacific while North America could have been populated from Siberia.

==Botanical taxonomy==
Ruiz and PavÃ³n dedicated to him the plant genus &quot;Molina&quot;, later considered a subgenus of &quot;Baccharis&quot; by Wilhelm Heering (Reiche 1902), and recently recreated as &quot;Neomolina&quot; by F.H. Hellwig and ranked as genus. Other authors dedicated &quot;Moliniopsis&quot;, a genus of Poaceae. Molina has also been linked to the naming of the genus &quot;Maytenus&quot;.

==Zoological taxonomy==
A species of Chilean lizard, &quot;Liolaemus molinai&quot;, is named in his honor.
A species of South American parakeet, &quot;Pyrrhura molinae&quot;, was named in his honor (Massena and Souance, 1854). Rev.et Mag. Zool. (2), 6, 1854, p.73.

At one point early in the first mission, he identifies himself as &quot;[Sergeant] Reynolds&quot; over the radio, referring to his character&#x27;s name from the TV series &quot;Firefly&quot;. All three actors are given personalities in the game that match those of their characters from &quot;Firefly&quot;. He provides the voice, portrayed likeness, and motion capture performance for Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck in &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;, &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, and a brief appearance in &quot;&quot;.

=== 2009â2018 ===
In March 2009, the first episode of the ABC television series &quot;Castle&quot; aired, in which Fillion starred as the titular character Richard Castle, a mystery novelist who helps the NYPD solve (frequently bizarre) murders. In 2009, Fillion was nominated for Satellite Award for Best Actor â Television Series Drama for his performance in &quot;Castle&quot;. The show was cancelled by ABC in 2016, with the final episode airing on May 16 of that year.

BuddyTV ranked him No. 10 on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Men of 2009&quot;, No. 19 in 2010, No. 20 in 2011 and No. 39 in 2012; No. 7 on its list of &quot;The 15 Best Drama Lead Actors of the 2011â2012 TV Season&quot;; named his character&#x27;s relationship with the other main character as No. 18 (and the Best Flirting Relationship) on its list &quot;Love Is All Around: Best TV Relationships of 2010&quot;, No. 13 (and the Best Delayed Relationship) on its list of &quot;The Best Relationships of 2011&quot;, No. 15 on its list of &quot;The Special Relationships: TV&#x27;s Top 50 Love Stories of the Past Decade&quot;, No. 1 on its list &quot;Love... Or Not: The Top 12 Will-They-or-Won&#x27;t-They Couples of 2012&quot; and No. 2 on its list &quot;Lip Smacking Good: The Best Kisses of 2012&quot;; named &quot;Castle&quot; as No. 6 on its list of &quot;The 11 Best Returning TV Shows of 2011&quot;, No. 11 on &quot;The 15 Best Dramas of the 2011â2012 TV Season&quot; and No. 12 on &quot;The 12 Best Dramas of 2012&quot;.

Fillion was featured in a spoof porn web video on Spike called &quot;Nailing Your Wife&quot;, part of James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;PG Porn&quot; series. Fillion made a brief cameo appearance in the season 5 episode &quot;Revolving Doors&quot; of the web series &quot;The Guild&quot;. In late September 2011, Fillion guest starred as the Action Sports 1 anchor in the web series &quot;Husbands&quot;. He played Dogberry in the independent film &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (2012), based on the Shakespeare play of the same name, written, directed and produced by Joss Whedon.

Since 2011, Fillion has appeared as the recurring Space Western character Cactoid Jim in performances of the podcasted live show &quot;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&quot;, a stage show premised on the idea that actors are performing as characters in a radio show. The character of Cactoid Jim first appeared as part of the recurring segment &quot;Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars&quot;, but was soon given his own segment, called &quot;Cactoid Jim: King of the Martian Frontier&quot;. Fillion has advertised his participation as a guest star on &quot;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&quot; by means of including filmed elements of the live show on the DVD set for season 4 of Castle.

In 2012, he appeared in the episode &quot;The Daly Superheroes&quot; of the web series &quot;The Daly Show&quot;. On February 17, 2013, Fillion hosted the 2013 WGA West Coast Awards.

In 2014 he appeared in the video game &quot;Destiny&quot; as the character Cayde-6. Over the next few years, his role became larger with expansions to the game. Fillion returned to the role in the 2017 sequel &quot;Destiny 2&quot;, and featured prominently in the game until the release of &quot;Forsaken&quot;, where the character was instead voiced by Nolan North until the character&#x27;s death. On May 24, 2023, it was revealed that he would be returning to voice Cayde-6 for &quot;The Final Shape&quot;.

In 2015 and 2016, Fillion worked with Alan Tudyk on a web series called &quot;Con Man&quot;, loosely based on their experiences on the convention circuit after &quot;Firefly&quot;.

In 2017, Fillion was cast in the recurring role of Gary West on the Netflix horror-comedy series &quot;Santa Clarita Diet&quot;. In the same year, Fillion was cast in the recurring role of Jacques Snicket on the second season of the Netflix comedy drama series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;.

In February 2018, Fillion was cast to star as John Nolan in the new ABC TV series &quot;The Rookie&quot;, which was created by former &quot;Castle&quot; executive producer Alexi Hawley.

On July 16, 2018, Fillion and director Allan Ungar released a live action short film based on the Naughty Dog franchise &quot;Uncharted&quot;. The short immediately went viral and was praised for its witty humour, action, and ability to stay true to the source material. Fans and critics took to social media and began campaigning for Netflix to turn it into a series while referring to it as one of the best adaptations of a video game.

=== 2018âpresent ===
In the late 2010s and early 2020s, Fillion made appearances in numerous films by director James Gunn, playing supporting roles such as T.D.K. in &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; and Master Karja in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. 

In 2023 he was cast as DC Comics superhero Guy Gardner/Green Lantern in Gunnâs 2025 film &quot;Superman&quot; (then titled &quot;Superman: Legacy&quot;). Fillion had previously portrayed a different Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, in multiple animated projects. In a later post on his Threads account, Gunn confirmed that Fillion would continue to play the role of Gardner beyond &quot;Superman&quot; in the larger DCU, a larger interconnected universe that &quot;Superman&quot; is a part of created by Gunn and Peter Safran. In 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Fillion is expected to reprise his role as Gardner in a supporting role in the upcoming DCU series &quot;Lanterns&quot;, a series that will feature other human Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and John Stewart as the main characters. 
He is also set to star alongside Elizabeth Banks in the upcoming film &quot;Skincare&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
Fillion has been associated with the public artist Martin Firrell since 2009. He is the subject of two works of contemporary public art by Firrell: &quot;Complete Hero&quot; (digital projections of text and video portraiture to the West and North elevations of the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, 2009) and Metascifi (a digital app investigating American television science fiction series for ideas and strategies for living well).

Fillion was the &#x27;face&#x27; of &quot;Complete Hero&quot;. The artist explained the choice of Fillion as follows: &quot;I wanted to make a piece of work that looked at all kinds of heroism, not just the usual derring-do of white square-jawed men. But I thought it would be interesting to start with a white, square-jawed man and Nathan Fillion agreed to take part.&quot;

In Metascifi, Fillion discusses the deeper significance of his &quot;Firefly&quot; character Captain Mal Reynolds, reflecting on some of the universal preoccupations of any human life: death, love, evil, intimacy, power, vulnerability, violence and freedom.

For August 7 and 8, 2021, Edmonton City Hall was renamed the &quot;Nathan Fillion Civilian Pavilion&quot; after a petition from fans with over 27,000 signatures and support from Fillion&#x27;s costars in &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2007, Fillion and author PJ Haarsma co-founded the non-profit organisation Kids Need to Read, to help inspire children&#x27;s imaginations by getting more books into underfunded libraries.

Fillion&#x27;s association with garnered over $60,000 worth of donations in 2019.

<text>In mathematics, a strong topology is a topology which is stronger than some other &quot;default&quot; topology. This term is used to describe different topologies depending on context, and it may refer to:

* the final topology on the disjoint union
* the topology arising from a norm
* the strong operator topology
* the strong topology (polar topology), which subsumes all topologies above.

A topology Ï is stronger than a topology Ï (is a finer topology) if Ï contains all the open sets of Ï.

In algebraic geometry, it usually means the topology of an algebraic variety as complex manifold or subspace of complex projective space, as opposed to the Zariski topology (which is rarely even a Hausdorff space).

<doc id="589731" wikidata="Q1466089" url="?curid=589731" title="Niddah">
<text>A niddah (alternative forms: nidda, nida, or nidah; &quot;nidÃ¡&quot;), in traditional Judaism, is a woman who has experienced a uterine discharge of blood (most commonly during menstruation), or a woman who has menstruated and not yet completed the associated requirement of immersion in a &quot;mikveh&quot; (ritual bath).

In the Book of Leviticus, the Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a &quot;niddah&quot;. The prohibition has been maintained in traditional Jewish law and by the Samaritans. It has largely been rejected by adherents of Reform Judaism and other liberal branches.

In rabbinic Judaism, additional stringencies and prohibitions have accumulated over time, increasing the scope of various aspects of niddah, including: duration (12-day minimum for Ashkenazim, and 11 days for Sephardim); expanding the prohibition against sex to include: sleeping in adjoining beds, any physical contact, and even passing objects to spouse; and requiring a detailed ritual purification process.

Since the late 19th century, with the influence of German Modern Orthodoxy, the laws concerning &quot;niddah&quot; are also referred to as &quot;Taharat haMishpacha&quot; (, Hebrew for &quot;family purity&quot;), an apologetic euphemism coined to de-emphasize the &quot;impurity&quot; of the woman (a concept criticized by the Reform movement) and to exhort the masses by warning that niddah can have consequences on the purity of offspring.

== Etymology and usage ==
&quot;Niddah&quot; has the general meaning of &quot;expulsion&quot; and &quot;elimination&quot;, coming from the root &quot;ndd&quot;, &quot;to make distant&quot; (the Aramaic Bible translations use the root rhq, &quot;to be distant&quot;), reflecting the physical separation of women during their menstrual periods, who were &quot;discharged&quot; and &quot;excluded&quot; from society by being banished to and quarantined in separate quarters. Later in the biblical corpus, this meaning was extended to include concepts of sin and impurity, which may be related to ancient attitudes towards menstruation.

Literally, the feminine noun &quot;niddah&quot; means &quot;moved&quot; (i.e., &quot;separated&quot;), and generally refers to separation due to ritual impurity. Medieval Biblical commentator Abraham ibn Ezra writes that the word &quot;niddah&quot; is related to the term &quot;menadechem&quot; (), meaning &quot;those that cast you out&quot;.

=== Hebrew Bible ===
The noun &quot;niddah&quot; occurs 25 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. The majority of these uses refer to forms of uncleanliness in Leviticus. For example, in Leviticus, if a man takes his brother&#x27;s wife, then that is &quot;uncleanness&quot;, &quot;niddah.&quot; The five uses in Numbers all concern the red heifer ceremony () and use the phrase &quot;mei niddah&quot;, &quot;waters of separation&quot;. includes a single exhortation of Hezekiah to the Levites, to carry forth the &quot;niddah&quot; (translated: &quot;filthiness&quot;), possibly idols of his father Ahaz, out of the temple in Jerusalem. Usage in Ezekiel follows that of Leviticus. Finally, the Book of Zechariah concludes with an eschatological reference to washing Jerusalem: &quot;In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin (&quot;á¸¥aá¹­&#x27;at&quot;) and for uncleanness (&quot;niddah&quot;)&quot; ().

=== Rabbinic injunctions ===
The copious laws of &quot;niddah&quot; contained in the Jewish rabbinic writings are almost entirely made-up of &quot;fences&quot; (), or safeguards, built around the Torah. The general rule which applies is that a woman is clean from the standpoint of the Torah until she feels uterine blood discharge from its source within her body. However, the rabbis have declared a woman to be unclean although she has not felt any discharge of blood, but has merely seen either a red or black blood stain on her body, or on her white garment or sheet, and which blood stain is larger in diameter than a fava bean (about 20Â mm), in which case she must separate herself from her husband until she can complete seven clean days and can be purified in a ritual bath (mikveh). A blood stain that is a dark brown color leaning towards the color of coffee and the color of chestnuts defiles a woman and renders her &quot;niddah&quot;, on the condition that she feels its discharge. However, if she saw the same color while checking herself with an inspection cloth, but had not felt any discharge of blood, she is clean. Conversely, a vaginal discharge that is white in color, or either light yellow, green or blueish in color, does not render the woman &quot;niddah&quot;. There are, yet, many other conditions that need to be met, by rabbinic ordinances, in order to render uncleanness to a blood stain.
The daughters of Israel have behaved stringently with themselves, insofar that even if they should see a drop of blood as a mustard grain, they would wait over it seven days of cleanness

Although the Written Law () explicitly enjoins women to count seven days of cleanness (see &quot;infra&quot;) when they have seen irregular blood sightings (the irregularity occurring only from the eighth day of the start of her regular period and ending with the conclusion of the eighteenth day), the Sages of Israel have required all women who have experienced even their regular and natural purgation to count seven days of cleanness before they can be purified.

== Application of the Torah ==
The Leviticus description of &quot;niddah&quot; is essentially composed of two parts: the ritual purity (&quot;tumah and taharah&quot;) aspect &quot;and&quot; the prohibition of sexual intercourse aspect.

=== Ritual purity aspect ===
The Biblical regulations of Leviticus specify that a menstruating woman must &quot;separate&quot; for seven days (). Any object she sits on or lies upon during this period is becomes a &quot;carrier of tumah&quot; (&quot;midras uncleanness&quot;). One who comes into contact with her &quot;midras,&quot; or her, during this period becomes ritually impure () In addition, a man who has sexual relations with her is rendered ritually impure for seven daysâas opposed to one day of impurity for coming into contact with her or her &quot;midras&quot; ().

During a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle, she is still permitted to cook and bake for her husband, and to separate the dough-portion (Challah), but is restricted from arranging her husband&#x27;s bed linen in his presence, from mingling his cup of wine with water, and from washing her husband&#x27;s face, feet and hands, since these actions are thought to arouse affection. It is also prohibited unto the man to touch his wife during these days.

While the purity laws still exist in theory, in modern times there is generally no practical consequence to becoming impure (as, e.g., the Temple in Jerusalem cannot be visited), so the laws have no practical expression.

Some later rabbinic authorities encouraged (but did not require) avoiding the &quot;midras&quot; of the &quot;niddah&quot;, as a remembrance for diasporic Jews so as to not forget the purity laws. This encouragement was only for the biblically prescribed seven-day period, not for the latter days that were added as part of certain rabbinical stringencies. The Lubavitcher rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson discouraged abstaining from the &quot;midras&quot; of a &quot;niddah&quot; in modern times.

=== Sexual relations ===
Leviticus further prohibits sexual intercourse with a woman who is in her &quot;niddah&quot; state. &quot;And to a woman in her (state of) &quot;niddah&quot; impurity you should not come close (with intent to) reveal her nudity&quot; ().

The Torah concludes by imposing the punishment of &quot;kareth&quot; on both individuals (man and woman) if the prohibition is violated () This &quot;issur&quot; (prohibition) component of physical relations with the &quot;niddah&quot; is considered in full effect and mandatory for all children of Israel.

== Practical laws ==
=== Terms and definitions ===
* &quot;Niddah&quot;, a woman who had become impure as a result of menstruation. 
* &quot;Zavah&quot;, a woman who had become impure by a bloody uterine emission, deemed abnormal, in the sense that the emission had occurred during the timeframe of the 8th - 18th day, counting from the start of her last menstruation 
* &quot;Mikveh&quot;, a ritual bath for immersion after the &quot;niddah&quot; period has ended.
* &quot;Vestot&quot;, days during which the woman is likely to see her menstrual flow
** &quot;Onah Benonit&quot;, the 30th day after the beginning of previous menstruation
** &quot;Veset HaChodesh&quot;, the same day of the Jewish month on which began the previous menstruation
** &quot;Veset HaFlagah&quot;, the days (or half-days, per Chabad minhag) between menstruation
* &quot;Bedikah&quot;, cloth with which to check whether menstrual blood has finished
* &quot;Ben niddah&quot; (male) or &quot;bat niddah&quot; (female), a person conceived when their mother was &quot;niddah&quot;

=== Start of menstruation ===
According to rabbinical law, a woman becomes a &quot;niddah&quot; when she is aware that blood has come from her womb, whether it is due to menstruation, childbirth, sexually transmitted disease, or other reasons. If menstruation began before she sees evidence of it, the rabbinic regulations regard her as not being &quot;niddah&quot; until she notices. Until this point, the regulations do not come into force.

It is not necessary for the woman to witness the flow of blood itself; it is sufficient for her to notice a stain that has indications of having originated in her womb; bloodstains alone are inadequate without such evidence, for example, if she finds a stain just after cutting her finger, she does not become a &quot;niddah&quot;, as the blood is not obviously uterine. If she notices a bloodstain of uncertain origin, for example on her underclothing, there are a series of complicated criteria used by rabbinical law to determine whether she is &quot;niddah&quot; or not; the woman herself is not expected to know these criteria, and must seek the assistance of a rabbi.

=== Duration of &quot;niddah&quot; status ===

According to the Torah, the &quot;niddah&quot; period is 7 days; however, in Ashkenazi communities, the Rabbis added a stringency increasing the minimum duration period to 12 days. (See section &quot;Seven days of cleanness&quot; for differences in custom).

The Biblical definition of &quot;niddah&quot; is any blood emission occurring within seven days from the beginning of the menstrual period. After this seven-day period, the woman may immerse in the mikveh immediately (if she has stopped menstruating). Any blood found after these seven days is considered abnormal (&quot;zavah&quot;) blood and is subject to more stringent requirements, depending on the duration of said abnormal blood flow.

In the days of the Amoraim, because of possible confusion in determining when menstruation began and ended and hence whether blood was normal menstrual (&quot;niddah&quot;) or abnormal (&quot;zavah&quot;) blood, it became the accepted practice and practical halacha, that all women treat any emission as a continued abnormal flow (&quot;zavah gedolah&quot;â××× ×××××), which requires counting seven abnormal-discharge-free days from the end of menstruation. This lengthening of the &quot;niddah&quot; period is known as Rabbi Zeira&#x27;s stringency. According to contemporary Halacha these &quot;seven clean days&quot; must be observed.

===Practices during &quot;niddah&quot;===
In the Orthodox Jewish community, women may test whether menstruation has ceased; this ritual is known as the &quot;hefsek taharah&quot;. The woman takes a bath or shower near sunset, wraps a special cloth around her finger, and swipes the vaginal circumference. If the cloth shows only discharges that are white, yellow, or clear, then menstruation is considered to have ceased. If the discharge is red or pink, it indicates that menstruation continues. If it is any other color, like brown, it is subject to further inquiry, often involving consultation with a rabbi. The ritual requires that the cloth used to perform this test is first checked carefully to ensure that it is clean of any marks, colored threads, or specks; the cloth itself can be any clean white cloth, although there are small cloths designed for this ritual known as bedikah cloths, meaning &quot;checking&quot;.

In the Orthodox Jewish community, further rituals are practiced toward assurance regarding the cessation of the menstrual flow. After the &quot;hefsek taharah&quot;, some women insert a cloth (or, in modern times, a tampon), consequently known as a &quot;moch dachuk&quot;, for between 18 minutes and an hour, to ensure that there is no blood; this must be done carefully, as it could otherwise irritate the mucous membrane, causing bleeding unrelated to menstruation. If there is any fear of irritation causing bleeding, a rabbi may waive this practice.

The &quot;bedikah&quot; is repeated each morning and evening of the seven days after the end of menstruation. Another tradition is the wearing of white underwear and use of white bedding during this period; conversely, the rest of the time, when not counting the &quot;seven clean days&quot;, some women who suffer from spotting deliberately use coloured underwear and colored toilet paper, since it is only when blood is seen on white material that it has any legal status in Jewish law. When not during their seven &quot;clean&quot; days, all women are advised to wear colored undergarments, for this reason. It is furthermore strongly recommended that women make an effort to refrain from looking at the toilet paper after wiping to avoid possible resultant questions.

=== Physical contact during &quot;niddah&quot; ===

As with most forbidden relationships in Judaism, all physical contact in an affectionate or lustful manner is rabbinically forbidden when a woman is in her &quot;niddah&quot; status. Such contact is forbidden whether or not the man and woman are husband and wife.

In the case of husband and wife, however, the sages added on extra restrictions, including touch that is not in an affectionate or lustful manner, passing of objects even without touching, and sleeping in the same bed; these restrictions are to avoid the risk of leading to sexual contact. These laws are termed &quot;harchakot&quot;, meaning &quot;the laws of separation,&quot; and imply the prohibitive rules regulating the passing of objects from hand to hand, as well as to taking distinctive measures used to remind them of their separation, such as placing some object at the dinner table which is not ordinarily placed there. The laws of separation (&quot;harchakot&quot;) are derived from a biblical command: &quot;You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness so long as she is separated for her [menstrual] uncleanness&quot; (). Some have suggested that by physically distancing oneself from his spouse there is an enhanced need for relationships to develop in non-physical ways, such as emotional and spiritual connections.

=== Seven days of cleanness ===
When blood from a menstruant (&quot;niddah&quot;) has ceased altogether, shortly before sunset she performs on herself a &quot;cessation of uncleanness&quot;, known by its Hebrew euphemism &quot;hefseq be-á¹­aharah&quot; ( = lit. &quot;cessation of purification&quot;), during which time she checks herself to verify that all uterine bleeding has indeed stopped. This is done by bathing, and, afterwards, inserting a clean piece of white cotton or linen cloth within her vagina and examining it after swiping the area inside, followed by leaving in that place a snugly fitting cotton wad for the duration of about 20 minutes (preferably during the evening twilight). When there are no signs of blood, the woman begins counting seven days of cleanness on the following day, during which seven days she is still prohibited to have any physical contact with her husband. During each of the seven days, the woman checks herself once in the morning and once in the evening, by using a soft and white, absorbent cotton cloth.

In Sephardic Jewish tradition, a woman who has had no physical contact with her husband within the 72 hr. period (3 days) prior to the start of her menstruation, she is permitted to immediately conduct the &quot;hefseq be-á¹­aharah&quot; (see &quot;supra&quot;) after all uterine bleeding has stopped, and, on the following day, she begins to count seven days of cleanness, which culminate in an immersion. Differences in custom, however, exist between the Ashkenazim and the Sephardic Jewish communities as to when to begin the counting of seven days of cleanness if she cohabited with her husband within those 72 hours (three days) prior to her seeing blood. 
*Ashkenazim: According to the halachic ruling of Moses Isserles, in all cases, whether a woman cohabited with her husband within the past 72 hours or did not cohabit with her husband, whether the woman saw blood for only 2 or 3 days, or merely a blood stain, she does not begin to count seven days of cleanness until 5 days have passed from the time that she ceased seeing blood, and only then does she proceed to count seven days of cleanness. For example, if she ceased to see blood on a Sunday, she can begin her &quot;hefseq be-á¹­aharah&quot; (see &quot;supra&quot;) on a Thursday, and then on a Friday to start her first day of seven days of cleanness. These days are not to be interrupted by any blood sighting in-between, and after concluding these seven clean days, she immerses herself in a ritual bath (&quot;mikveh&quot;) on that coming night. At this time she is no longer a menstruant, but is deemed clean, and she is permitted unto her husband.
*Sephardic Jews: For Jews that largely hail from North Africa, Spain, Turkey, and the Middle East (including Iran), they will usually follow the practice of the Shulhan Arukh, which is to wait 4 days from the time the couple last cohabited together (i.e. last time in which they engaged in sexual intercourse) before she begins to count seven days of cleanness. This will allow for the discharge of semen from her body that is suspected of having been mixed with the blood of her menstruation. For example, if the couple last cohabited on a Saturday, and she then saw blood on a Sunday, she can begin her &quot;hefseq be-á¹­aharah&quot; (see &quot;supra&quot;) on a Tuesday (on the condition that all blood has stopped), and then on a Wednesday to start her first day of seven days of cleanness. These days are not to be interrupted by any blood sighting in-between, and after concluding these seven clean days, she immerses herself in a ritual bath (&quot;mikveh&quot;) on that coming night. At this time she is no longer a menstruant, but is deemed clean, and she is permitted unto her husband.

For the Sephardic Jewish community, waiting four days before beginning to count seven days of cleanness only refers to when there were conjugal affairs between a man and his wife, leading up to her menstrual period. If, however, there was no sexual intercourse between the couple in the days leading up to her menstrual cycle, and, subsequently, there was no fear of her body discharging of her husband&#x27;s copulative seed that had been mixed with her menstrual blood, there is no need for her to wait four days, but she may presently begin her &quot;hefseq be-á¹­aharah&quot; (see &quot;supra&quot;), followed by counting seven days of cleanness. Another factor used to determine when to begin the counting of seven clean days (among Sephardic Jews) is that, had the woman merely found on her an unclean blood stain (where there was no sensation of any active blood flow), after concluding that all such sightings have stopped, she can begin to count seven days of cleanness after two days have passed since the last time she cohabited with her husband. However, among Ashkenazim, even if a woman merely saw an unclean blood stain, when the blood has ceased to appear, she waits 5 days before beginning to count her seven days of cleanness.

Maimonides mentions a former custom where the menstruants of some Jewish communities would wait a standard 7 days before beginning to count seven days of cleanness, even if the woman had seen blood for only one or two days. This custom, though widely practised in the 20th century among the Jews of Yemen, Djerba, parts of Morocco, as also with a few families in Baghdad, was later rejected and abandoned by many, as Maimonides calls it an errant practice.

=== Niddah and fertility ===

Because the night that the woman ritually traditionally immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman&#x27;s ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and in combination with the ban on sexual relations during the &quot;niddah&quot; state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive, a situation sometimes called &quot;halachic infertility&quot;. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of &quot;niddah&quot; is shorter for these women. Another suggestion is to take hormone tablets to lengthen the ovulation cycle.

=== Checking by bedikah ===
The &quot;bedikah&quot; cloth or &quot;checking cloth&quot;, called an &quot;eid&quot; [&quot;witness&quot;] in Hebrew, is a clean piece of white cloth used in the process of purifying a &quot;niddah&quot;. It is used by observant Jewish women to determine whether they have finished menstruation. The cloth is inserted into the vagina, and if no blood is found, the woman may start counting the seven blood-free days. On each of these days, she performs this examination in the morning and in the later afternoon before sunset. If no blood is found, she may go to the &quot;mikveh&quot; on the eighth evening after nightfall, and then engage in intercourse with her husband. Such cloths are about two by four inches, and are available at local Judaica stores, the local mikveh, stores in Orthodox neighborhoods in Israel, or may be cut from clean all-white soft cotton or linen fabric.

This practice is also occasionally used by Jewish men to check if he has gotten blood on himself from his wife after intercourse to determine whether she menstruated during intercourse.

=== Immersion in water ===

After a woman has counted seven days of cleanness (see &quot;supra&quot;), she is then required to immerse in a ritual bath (&quot;mikveh&quot;) that has been constructed in accordance with the Jewish laws of ritual purity. After concluding her seven days of cleanness, she is not allowed to immerse during the daytime, even on the eighth or ninth days, because of a rule introduced on account of her daughter&#x27;s immersion () and which was enacted for the sake of conformity, so that the daughter will not see her mother immerse during the daytime and wrongly presume that it was her mother&#x27;s seventh day of counting, and think that it was alright to immerse on the seventh day before nightfall, without realizing that her mother had already concluded her seven clean days. This enactment, therefore, was to prevent an occasion for miscalculation and stumbling. Even if a woman has no daughter, this rule of immersing only in the night still applies, as the Sages did not make any distinction, but have prohibited all women from immersing themselves during daylight hours of the eighth day, or of any day. Under extenuating circumstances, however, the rabbis have also permitted to immerse in the day, after fully completing seven days of cleanness.

There are differing customs about how many immersions are performed at each visit to a &quot;mikveh&quot;. It is the custom of many in the Orthodox community to immerse at least twice. Accordingly, they would immerse, recite the blessing, then immerse again. The other opinion states that like other commandments, here too the blessing should be recited before performing the commandment.

Immediate preparation for a &quot;mikveh&quot; includes a bath or shower wherein every part of the body (including the ears and underneath the nails) is thoroughly washed; plus other routine hygiene practices which include trimming fingernails and toenails, brushing and flossing the teeth, and combing the hair. Prior to every immersion, the woman is required to inspect herself to make sure that there is nothing clinging to her skin and hair that would obstruct the water from making contact with it during her actual immersion, or what is known as &quot;á¸¥aá¹£Ä«á¹£ah&quot; = &quot;interposing objects&quot; (e.g. clay, dough, paint, gum resin, etc.). At the &quot;mikveh&quot; itself, a female attendant is present to make certain that the woman immerses herself fully, including her hairs. Though that is the attendant&#x27;s foremost duty, she may also help by checking a woman&#x27;s back or answer questions regarding proper ritual protocol.

=== Refrainment from relations on days that menstruation is expected to begin ===
The classical regulations also forbid sexual relations on the day that a woman expects to start menstruating. Generally speaking, there are three days that fall under this regulation, known as the &quot;veset&quot;, namely the same day of the month, (according to the Hebrew calendar), as her previous menstruation began; the day exactly 30 days after the previous menstruation started; and the day that is of equal distance from the day of her previous menstruation as the menstruation before the last. For instance: If the interval between her last two periods was 28 days - the couple must refrain from sexual relations on the 28th day. According to most Orthodox authorities, this is measured from the beginning of the former period to the beginning of the latter. Yet some authorities, especially in Chabbad circles, rule that this is measured from the end of the preceding menstruation to the beginning of the following one.

If the woman is not actually menstruating during a &quot;veset&quot; day, then there are certain circumstances wherein sexual activity is permitted according to most authorities, for example, if a woman&#x27;s husband is about to travel, and will return only after menstruation has begun.

=== Newlyweds ===
According to all Orthodox authorities, the first time a virgin has intercourse, she also becomes &quot;niddah&quot; as a result of her hymenal blood flow (). However, a bride observes only four days of &quot;hefsek taharah&quot; (), instead of the usual five. The woman performs &quot;hefsek taharah&quot; by checking to make sure that all bleeding has stopped by inserting a piece of white cloth into her vagina and having it come out free of blood, in order to begin on the following day her seven days of cleanness. Traditionally, this pause is observed even if no blood is discovered, though some Conservative authorities have ruled that a woman is not a &quot;niddah&quot; in such a case unless bleeding is observed.

=== Privacy of the niddah process ===
Out of &quot;tzniut&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;modesty&quot;), many Orthodox Jews and some Conservative Jews follow a custom of keeping their times of &quot;niddah&quot; secret from the general public.

== Conservative Judaism ==
Conservative Judaism authorities teach that the laws of family purity are normative and still in force, including the requirement to refrain from sexual relations during &quot;niddah&quot;, yet there is a difference of opinions over how much other strictures need to be observed, such as whether there should be complete prohibition on any touching during &quot;niddah&quot; and whether women are required to count seven &quot;clean&quot; days before immersing in the &quot;mikveh&quot;.

The majority of orthodox rabbis contend that the seven days of cleanness still apply to all menstruant women today, even though it is only a rabbinic injunction. According to two lesser opinions representing the movement of Conservative Judaism, one by Grossman and the other by Reisner, whose views are not shared by orthodox Jewish circles, the &quot;seven clean days&quot; need not be observed today and women may immerse and resume sexual relations after seven days from the beginning of menstruation, or after its cessation, if it lasts longer than seven days. Grossman and Berkowitz ruled that women may rely on their own discretion about when menstruation has ended, and need not routinely engage in &quot;bedikah&quot; as described above.

Despite the official stance, the practices related to family purity have often not been widely followed by Conservative Jews. However, in an issue of the &quot;United Synagogue Review&quot; that focused on issues of &quot;mikvah&quot; and &quot;niddah&quot; (published in conjunction with the passing of the responsa mentioned above, in Fall/Winter 2006), Rabbi Myron S. Geller, a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, wrote about an upswing in the observance of the laws of family purity within the Conservative Jewish community:

Conservative Judaism has largely ignored this practice in the past, but recently has begun to reevaluate its silence in this area and to consider the spiritual implications of mikvah immersion for human sexuality and for women.

== Reform Judaism ==
Reform Judaism and other liberal denominations have largely rejected many of the rituals and prohibitions associated with menstruation, particularly the use of a &quot;mikveh&quot;.

<text>Jacek Marcin Kaczmarski (22 March 1957 â 10 April 2004) was a Polish singer, songwriter, poet and author.

==Life==
He was the son of painter Anna Trojanowska-Kaczmarska, a Pole of Jewish background, and the artist Janusz Kaczmarski.

Kaczmarski was a voice of the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980s Poland. His songs criticized the ruling communist regime and appealed to the tradition of patriotic resistance within Poles. He remains best known for his protest songs on social and political subjects (&quot;Mury&quot; (&quot;Walls&quot;) based on &quot;L&#x27;Estaca&quot; by LluÃ­s Llach, &quot;ObÅawa&quot; (&quot;Wolf hunt (lit. Raid)&quot;)). However, his commentary was not restricted to contemporary politics, and his texts&#x27; themes have retained their relevance in Polish culture beyond the collapse of the Soviet Union and its communist bloc.

He made his debut in 1977 at the Student Song Festival, where he was awarded first
prize for his work &quot;ObÅawa&quot; based on the song &quot;ÐÑÐ¾ÑÐ° Ð½Ð° Ð²Ð¾Ð»ÐºÐ¾Ð²&quot; by Vladimir Vysotsky. In 1980 he won second prize at the Opole Song Festival for &quot;Epitafium dla WÅodzimierza Wysockiego&quot; (&quot;Epitaph for&quot; Vladimir Vysotsky).

Kaczmarski was on tour in France when the martial law was declared in Poland in December 1981. He lived in exile until 1990. During these years he gave concerts in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and Israel. From 1982 on, he worked as an editor and journalist with Radio Free Europe and hosted his own radio program, &quot;Kwadrans Jacka Kaczmarskiego&quot; (&quot;Fifteen Minutes with Jacek Kaczmarski&quot;).

After his return to Poland (following the Round Table negotiations that brought an end to communist rule) he toured the country with his friend, artist Zbigniew ÅapiÅski. The tour was recorded and released as &quot;Live&quot;, and it achieved Gold album status in 2001. His other albums included &quot;Mury&quot; (&quot;Walls&quot;), &quot;Nasza klasa&quot; (&quot;Our Class&quot;), &quot;Raj&quot; (&quot;Paradise&quot;), &quot;Muzeum&quot; (&quot;Museum&quot;), &quot;PochwaÅa Åotrostwa&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Villainy&quot;), &quot;Wojna postu z karnawaÅem&quot; (&quot;The War between Carnival and Lent&quot;). However, Kaczmarski was soon disillusioned by the developments in Poland after 1989 and eventually emigrated to Australia.

Kaczmarski was known not only for his politically motivated lyrics but also for his characteristically dynamic â even aggressive â classical guitar playing, and expressive performance style. His deep knowledge of not only his nation&#x27;s history but also of classical literature gave his songs a particularly deep and multi-layered resonance (e.g. &quot;PowtÃ³rka z Odysei,&quot; recalled Homer&#x27;s Odyssey, while the ballad &quot;Lalka&quot; masterfully retells Boleslaw Prus&#x27;s second novel of the same name, &quot;The Doll&quot;.). He often performed before contrastingly different audiences: groups of friends in their homes, campus venues, and large concert halls in Poland, the rest of Europe, and America.

Kaczmarski was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 2002. He died in a hospital in GdaÅsk in 2004.

Jacek Kaczmarski suffered from severe alcoholism, which often led to domestic violence. His wife and daughter have revealed that Kaczmarski often vented his frustration by beating them.

<text>Retrocomputing is the current use of older computer hardware and software. Retrocomputing is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology; enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons.

Occasionally, however, an obsolete computer system has to be &quot;resurrected&quot; to run software specific to that system, to access data stored on obsolete media, or to use a peripheral that requires that system.
==Hardware retrocomputing==
===Historic systems===

Retrocomputing is part of the history of computer hardware. It can be seen as the analogue of experimental archaeology in computing. Some notable examples include the reconstruction of Babbage&#x27;s Difference engine (more than a century after its design) and the implementation of PlankalkÃ¼l in 2000 (more than half a century since its inception).

Some retrocomputing enthusiasts also consider the &quot;homebrewing&quot; (designing and building of retro- and retro-styled computers or kits), to be an important aspect of the hobby, giving new enthusiasts an opportunity to experience more fully what the early years of hobby computing were like. There are several different approaches to this end. Some are exact replicas of older systems, and some are newer designs based on the principles of retrocomputing, while others combine the two, with old and new features in the same package. Examples include:
* Device offered by IMSAI, a modern, updated, yet backward-compatible version and replica of the original IMSAI 8080, one of the most popular early personal systems;
* Several Apple 1 replicas and kits have been sold in limited quantities in recent years, by different builders, such as the &quot;Replica 1&quot;, from Briel Computers;
* A currently ongoing project that uses old technology in a new design is the Z80-based N8VEM;
* The Arduino Retro Computer kit is an open source, open hardware kit you can build and has a BASIC interpreter. There is also a version of the Arduino Retro Computer that can be hooked up to a TV;
* There is at least one remake of the Commodore 64 using an FPGA configured to emulate the 6502;
* MSX 2/2+ compatible do-it-yourself kit GR8BIT, designed for the hands-on education in electronics, deliberately employing old and new concepts and devices (high-capacity SRAMs, micro-controllers and FPGA);
* The MEGA65 is a Commodore 65 compatible computer;
* The Commander X16 is an ongoing project by David Murray that hopes to build a new 8-bit platform inspired by the Commodore 64, using off the shelf modern parts.
*The C256 Foenix and its different versions is a new retro computer family based on the WDC65C816. FPGAs are used to simulate CBM custom chips and has the power of an Amiga with its graphic and sound capabilities.
*Grant Searle collection of homebrew 8-bit projects.

==Software retrocomputing==
As old computer hardware becomes harder to maintain, there has been increasing interest in computer simulation. This is especially the case with old mainframe computers, which have largely been scrapped, and have space, power, and environmental requirements unaffordable by the average user. The memory size and speed of current systems enable simulation of many old systems to run faster than that system on original hardware.

One popular simulator, the history simulator SIMH, offers simulations for over 50 historic systems, from the 1950s through the present. The Hercules emulator simulates the IBM System/360 family from System/360 to 64-bit System/z. A simulator is available for the Honeywell Multics system.

Software for older systems was not copyrighted, and was open source, so there is a wide variety of available software to run on these simulators.

Some emulations are used by businesses, as running production software in a simulator is usually faster, cheaper, and more reliable than running it on original hardware.

==In popular culture==
In an interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien in May 2014, George R. R. Martin revealed that he writes his books using WordStar 4.0, an MS-DOS application dating back to 1987.

US-based streaming video provider Netflix released a multiple-choice movie branded to be part of their Black Mirror series, called &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;. The protagonist is a teenage programmer working on a contract to deliver a video-game adaptation of a fantasy novel for an 8-bit computer in 1984. The multiple storylines revolve around the emotions and mental health issues resulting from a reality-perception mismatch between a new generation of computer-savvy teenagers and twenty-somethings, and their care givers.

==Education==
Due to their low complexity together with other technical advantages, 8-bit computers are frequently re-discovered for education, especially for introductory programming classes in elementary schools. 8-bit computers turn on and directly present a programming environment; there are no distractions, and no need for other features or additional connectivity. The BASIC language is a simple-to-learn programming language that has access to the entire system without having to load libraries for sound, graphics, math, etc. The focus of the programming language is on efficiency; in particular, one command does one thing immediately (e.g. turns the screen green).

==Reception==
Retrocomputing (and retrogaming as aspect) has been described in one paper as preservation activity and as aspect of the remix culture.

<text>A bowling alley (also known as a bowling center, bowling lounge, bowling arena, or historically bowling club) is a facility where the sport of bowling is played. It can be a dedicated facility or part of another, such as a clubhouse or dwelling house.

==History==
By the late 1830s in New York City, the Knickerbocker Hotel&#x27;s bowling alley had opened, with three lanes. Instead of wood, this indoor alley used clay for the bowling lane. By 1850, there were more than 400 bowling alleys in New York City, which earned it the title &quot;bowling capital of North America&quot;. Because early versions of bowling were difficult and there were concerns about gambling, the sport faltered. Several cities in the United States regulated bowling due to its association with gambling.

In the late 19th century, bowling was revived in many U.S. cities. Alleys were often located in saloon basements and provided a place for working-class men to meet, socialize, and drink alcohol. Bars were and still are a principal feature of bowling alleys. The sport remained popular during the Great Depression and, by 1939, there were 4,600 bowling alleys across the United States. New technology was implemented in alleys, including the 1952 introduction of automatic pinsetters (or pinspotters), which replaced pin boys who manually placed bowling pins. Today, most bowling alley facilities are operated by Bowlero Corporation. 

In 2015, over 70 million people bowled in the United States.


==Modern day==
Bowling alleys contain long and narrow synthetic or wooden lanes. The number of lanes inside a bowling alley is variable. The Inazawa Grand Bowl in Japan is the largest bowling alley in the world, with 116 lanes. 

Human pinsetters were used at bowling alleys to set up the pins, but modern ten-pin bowling alleys have automatic mechanical pinsetters.

Each lane has an overhead monitor/television screen to display bowling scores and a seating area and tables for dining and socializing.

With a decades-long decline in league participation, modern bowling alleys usually offer other games (often billiard tables, darts and arcade games) and may serve food or beverages, usually via vending machines or an integrated bar or restaurant. Pro shops and party rooms are common.

<doc id="589769" wikidata="Q7810092" url="?curid=589769" title="Title 47 CFR Part 15">
<text>Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15 (47 CFR 15) is an oft-quoted part of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations regarding unlicensed transmissions. It is a part of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and regulates everything from spurious emissions to unlicensed low-power broadcasting. Nearly every electronics device sold inside the United States radiates unintentional emissions, and must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before it can be advertised or sold in the US market.

==Subparts==
=== A - General===
Subpart A includes 21 sections from 15.1 to 15.38.

 states that any radiator (that which emits radio energy), whether or not intentional, must be licensed unless it meets 47 CFR 15 or is otherwise exempted by the FCC.

 the definitions are defined by the definition given.

 contains a general provision that devices may not cause interference and must accept any interference received. 
You are cautioned that any changes or modifications to devices not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance may void your authority to operate devices.

 prohibits intentional damped wave transmissions such as spark-gap transmitters which were common before the 1920s but occupy a needlessly wide range of frequencies.

 prohibits operating a device under Part 15 for the purpose of eavesdropping, except when under lawful authority of law enforcement or when all parties in a conversation consent.
=== B - Unintentional radiators===
Subpart B deals with unintentional radiatorsâdevices for which the purpose is not to produce radio waves, but which do anyway, such as computers. There are 16 sections between 15.101 and 15.123.

=== C - Intentional radiators===
Subpart C deals with devices that are specifically designed to produce coherent radio waves, such as small transmitters. Specific to broadcasting, 15.221 (and 15.219) deal with the AM band; &amp; 15.239 deals with the FM band. 15.247 covers most Wi-Fi frequencies that aren&#x27;t U-NII.

=== D - Unlicensed PCS devices===
Sections 15.301 to 15.323 deal with unlicensed PCS devices from 1.91 to 1.93 GHz.

Cordless telephones using DECT 6.0 standards use this unlicensed PCS band.

=== E - Unlicensed NII devices===
15.401 to 15.407 deal with unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices

=== F - Ultra-wideband operation===
15.501 to 15.525 deal with ultra-wideband (UWB) devices, including ground-penetrating radar.

=== G - Access Broadband over Power Line===
15.601 to 15.615 deal with broadband over power lines (BPL) devices operating in the 1.705â80Â MHz band over medium- or low-voltage lines.

=== H - Television Band Devices===
15.701 to 15.717 deal with (TVBDs), TV-band devices that operate on an available television channel in the broadcast television band. An available channel is a 6 megahertz television channel that is not being used by an authorized service in a given geographical location, and thus may be used by unlicensed devices under the provisions of this rule part.

==Subjects==

===Unintentional radiators===
Unintentional radiators are designated in two major classes:

*Class A Device marketed for use in business/industrial/commercial environments.
*Class B Device marketed for use in a residential environment, notwithstanding use in industrial or commercial environments

The emission limits for Class B devices are about 10Â dB more restrictive than those for Class A devices since they are more likely to be located closer to radio and television receivers.

These devices include personal computers and peripheral devices, and electrical ballasts for fluorescent lights.

===Unlicensed broadcasting===
On the standard AM broadcast band, under 15.219, transmission power is limited by 100 milliwatts of DC input power to the final RF stage (with restrictions on size, height of, and type of antenna), or alternatively, under 15.221, if the AM transmission originates on the campus of an educational institution, the transmission can theoretically be any power so long as it does not exceed the field strength limits stated in 15.209 at the perimeter of the campus, 24,000/&quot;f&quot;kHz Î¼V/m.

Unlicensed broadcasts on the FM broadcast band (88 to 108Â MHz) are limited to a field strength of 250 microvolts per meter (~48 dBÎ¼) measured at a distance of 3 meters. This corresponds to a maximum effective radiated power of 0.01 microwatts. Emissions must be kept within the 88.0 to 108.0Â MHz band under 15.239 rules.

Unlicensed broadcasts on the TV broadcast bands are prohibited, except for certain medical telemetry devices, wireless microphones, and other low power auxiliary stations. 87.5 to 88.0 MHz is considered part of the VHF TV low band. For TV, 15.241 and 15.242 deal with high VHF (channels 7 to 13), 15.242 also deals with UHF (band IV and band V).

===Common uses of Part 15 transmitters===

Frequently encountered types of &quot;Part 15&quot; transmitters include:
* 802.11 wireless LANs: (e.g. WiFi): 2.4Â GHz, 5Â GHz (U-NII)
* 802.15 PANs (e.g. Bluetooth, Zigbee): 2.4Â GHz
* Cordless phones: 900Â MHz; 1.9 (U-PCS), 2.4, 5Â GHz (U-NII)
* Microbroadcasting, often by hobbyists, drive-in theaters, or on college or high school campuses.
* Small FM radio transmitters designed to hook to the audio output of an iPod or other portable audio device and broadcast the audio so that it can be heard through a car audio system that is not equipped with an audio input.
* Very low power transmitters, often referred to as &quot;talking roadsign&quot;, &quot;talking houses&quot; or &quot;&quot;talking billboards&quot;,&quot; which will air a repeating loop of highway construction, traffic, promotional or advertising information (see Travelers&#x27; information station). These transmitters typically operate on empty channels on the AM broadcast band. A sign placed near the transmitter is used to entice passersby (nearly always in automobiles) to tune in. The talking house gets its name from the fact that such transmitters are installed at houses that are on sale, thus enabling a passerby to learn features of the interior of the house without touring the building. 
* Some wireless microphones and headsets that broadcast to a receiver which amplifies the audio. Wireless microphones allow the user to move about freely, unlike a conventional microphone and are thus popular with musicians. Some professional wireless microphones and &#x27;low power auxiliary&#x27; stations (including those labeled as &quot;UHF&quot;) are licensed under Part 74, Subpart H of the FCC&#x27;s rules. However, as of January 2010, many professional wireless microphones, and other Part 74 certified &#x27;low power auxiliary&#x27; stations with a 50Â mW output or less, can be operated in the &quot;core TV band&quot; (TV channels VHF 2-13 and UHF 14-51, except 37) frequencies without a license under a waiver of Part 15 rules. This waiver is expected to become permanent. Units using the high UHF channels (700Â MHz band) revoked from the TV bandplan in June 2009 became illegal to operate in June 2010.
* Toys such as the popular late-1970s Mr. Microphone and its imitators, which would broadcast the user&#x27;s voice to a nearby radio receiver. Variations on this type of transmitter were advertised for sale in radio magazines as far back as the 1920s.
* Walkie talkies intended for children&#x27;s use, baby monitors, and some older cordless phones operate on frequencies in the 49Â MHz band or at the upper end of the AM broadcast band.
* Remote controls for various toys, garage door openers, etc. These transmitters usually operate in the 27, 72-76, or 315-433Â MHz ranges; data stream duty cycle has to be limited due to certain transmit power requirements. However, some remote control devices operate under Part 95 of the FCC rules, which permit higher transmit power on the 26/27Â MHz and 72Â MHz/75Â MHz bands. Lower cost devices on these bands (particularly in the 27Â MHz, 49Â MHz, 310Â MHz, 315Â MHz and 433Â MHz bands) are regulated under Part 15.

===Spurious emissions===

Electronic equipment from computers to intentional transmitters can produce unwanted radio signals and are subject to FCC regulation. For digital devices including computers and peripherals, FCC Class B is the more stringent standard, applying to equipment marketed for use in the home, even if it could be used elsewhere. Home users are likely to be annoyed by interference to TV and radio reception. Class A is a looser standard for equipment intended only for business, industrial and commercial settings.

Transmitters also must adhere to a spectral mask, to prevent adjacent-channel interference, intermediate frequency interference, and intermodulation.

<doc id="589773" wikidata="Q7347549" url="?curid=589773" title="Robert McKenzie (psephologist)">
<text>Robert Trelford McKenzie (11 September 1917 â 12 October 1981) was a Canadian professor of politics and sociology, and a psephologist (one who does statistical analysis of elections). He is perhaps best known in Britain as one of the main presenters of the BBC&#x27;s General Election programmes.

==Early life==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the son of William Meldrum McKenzie and Frances (nÃ©e) Chapman, he was educated at King Edward High School and the University of British Columbia from which he graduated with a BA. He was a lecturer at the same university from 1937 to 1942. In 1943, he joined the Canadian Army and a year later, with the rank of captain, was sent to London where he remained for the rest of his working life. Leaving the services three years later, McKenzie enrolled at the London School of Economics to study for a doctorate. In 1949, he was given a sociology lectureship, and was promoted to professor in 1964.

==Television==
He was widely known in the UK for his televised reports on general election results as they were announced on the BBC. He is popularly associated with the swingometer device used in such broadcasts. The swingometer was first introduced in 1955 by Peter Milne, and was later refined by McKenzie and David Butler and used nationally in the 1959 General election for the BBC. At first Butler used the meter, but in 1964 McKenzie enthusiastically took over. He appeared on all BBC election nights from 1955 to 1979, and was later replaced by Peter Snow in 1983 due to McKenzie&#x27;s death in 1981. In 1980, he introduced and moderated the discussions in each episode of Milton Friedman&#x27;s television series &quot;Free to Choose&quot;.

McKenzie famously interviewed Lord Hailsham on the BBC programme &quot;Gallery&quot; in 1963, asking questions on the then recent scandal involving Conservative cabinet minister John Profumo. Hailsham became increasingly fractious as the interview progressed regarding McKenzie&#x27;s line of questioning, even though Hailsham was strongly critical of Profumo&#x27;s conduct.

==Other work==

He wrote many academic books and papers during his career, including &quot;British Political Parties: The Distribution of Power within the Conservative and Labour Parties&quot; and &quot;Angels in Marble: Working Class Conservatives in Urban England&quot;, but it was through television and radio that his name became known. His broadcasting career began when he was requested by the BBC to give occasional talks on the Overseas Service; he was later invited to become involved in dramatic radio and TV, such as appearing as himself on an episode of the British series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

==Death==

McKenzie died from cancer in 1981.

==Publications==

*&quot;British Political Parties : The Distribution of Power Within the Conservative and Labour Parties&quot;, 1955; 2nd ed., 1963.

<doc id="589775" wikidata="Q4450532" url="?curid=589775" title="Tallulah River">
<text>The Tallulah River ( ) is a river in Georgia and North Carolina. It begins in Clay County, North Carolina, near Standing Indian Mountain in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and flows south into Georgia, crossing the state line into Towns County. The river travels through Rabun County and ends in Habersham County. It cuts through the Tallulah Dome rock formation to form the Tallulah Gorge and its several waterfalls (collectively known as Tallulah Falls). The Tallulah River intersects with the Chattooga River to form the Tugaloo River at Lake Tugalo in Habersham County. It joins South Carolina&#x27;s Seneca River at Lake Hartwell (also created by a dam upriver) to form the Savannah River, which flows southeastward into the Atlantic Ocean.

==Description==
From its headwaters to its confluence with the Tugaloo River, the Tallulah River is approximately long. The Tallulah River Basin drains approximately , as measured at the Tallulah Falls Hydroelectric Plant in Habersham County, Georgia, near the lower end of the Tallulah Gorge.

The lower part of the river includes a string of man-made lakes along the river created by hydroelectric dams operated by Georgia Power. The first (and northernmost) lake in the series is Lake Burton, which is followed by Lake Seed, Lake Rabun, and Lake Tallulah Falls. From Tallulah Falls Lake, the lower part of the river flows through the Tallulah Gorge and now ends as an arm of Lake Tugalo, the other arm of the lake being formed by the Chattooga River. Starting at a point about downstream from the dam for Tallulah Falls Lake, the boundary line between Habersham and Rabun counties follows the course of the Tallulah River to its end.
The upper Tallulah River Basin drains to the portion of the Tallulah River that is upstream from Lake Burton. This includes northwestern Rabun County, northeastern Towns County and part of Clay County, North Carolina. The United States Geological Survey collects data for the upper Tallulah River Basin from its gauging station at the point where the river crosses Plum Orchard Road. The upper Tallulah River Basin includes a section of the river that is about 14.3 miles (23Â km) long, draining a 56.5 square mile (146Â km2) area. Annually, the area receives at least 72Â inches of rainfall and is entirely within the boundaries of the Chattahoochee National Forest. About one-third of the land falls within the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and about one-fifth is privately owned. The primary tributaries of the Tallulah River in Rabun County are Coleman River and Persimmon Creek.
The upper Tallulah River Basin is as scenic as it is rugged. The highest elevations are found in North Carolina on Standing Indian Mountain, elevation 5,499 feet, where the Tallulah River headwaters are located. After coming into Georgia and passing through the old mining and logging town of Tate City, Georgia in eastern Towns County, the river enters into what is known as Tallulahâs upper gorge, or the Rock Mountain Gorge. This upper &quot;gorge&quot; is far less dramatic that the more famous Tallulah Gorge. It starts just upstream from the riverâs confluence with Coleman River and runs nearly past Rock Mountain on the western side of the river. The scenic &quot;gorge&quot; is accessible via a drive along the Tallulah River Road (Forest Service Road 70). The Tallulah River Road follows an old railroad bed before ending in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and provides the only access to Tate City, North Carolina. Heavily wooded today, the upper Tallulah River Basin was stripped nearly bare by clear-cut logging in the 1930s before the Chattahoochee National Forest was established.

==Etymology of name==
Although Georgians have long assumed that Tallulah was a Cherokee language word, given the prominence of Cherokee history in the state, scholars dispute the derivation of the river&#x27;s name. This area was long part of the extensive Cherokee homelands in the Southeast. Tourism promoters in the late 19th century said that &quot;tallulah&quot; meant &quot;thundering waters&quot; in Cherokee. Some scholars later theorized that &quot;tallulah&quot; meant âterribleâ in Cherokee, or was possibly derived from a number of other words. It is more likely that there is no translation for the word.

Based on archeological studies, the Cherokee appear to have settled some of their homeland by the mid to late-16th century; for instance, they had built a townhouse by the late sixteenth century at the Coweeta Creek site on the upper Little Tennessee River in present-day North Carolina.

The Overhill Cherokee also used the term, and were known to have a town called Tallulah, located on the portion of the Little Tennessee that flowed on the west side of the Appalachian Mountains. Muscogee Creek also occupied part of this area before being pushed out by the Cherokee.

<text>Pakkins&#x27; Land is an epic all-ages fantasy story created by husband and wife team, Gary and Rhoda Shipman. Originating as a critically hailed comic book series, the story was written by the pair with Gary Shipman illustrating the series.

&quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; tells the tale of Paul, a young boy who finds himself in a magical world filled with talking animals, mystery and excitement.

== Publication history ==

1995 saw the first appearance of &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; in the form of black &amp; white xeroxed copied issues called ashcans. Because of the nature of these first three issues being creator-produced, they were very low-edition, and as such have since become extremely rare.

In October 1996 the independent comic book company, Caliber Comics, began publishing the first of the six issue monthly series (including republishing the ashcan editions), &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Paul&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, as its flagship title in launching an all-ages imprint, Tapestry. The issues consist of black &amp; white interior pages with full-color covers that become the series published format for almost the entire next decade.

In June 1997 Tapestry published the stand-alone &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; #0, to serve as a prologue to the &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; series.

With the first six-issue story arc concluded, in August 1997 Caliber began publishing (under its own label after dissolving the Tapestry imprint) the second six-issue installment of the series, &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Quest For Kings&quot;, which continued the overall story. Issue #1 was published with two variant covers, one which featured the art of Jeff Smith of &quot;Bone&quot; fame.

Starting in September 1997 the &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; saga was further serialized in 17 short offshoot stories as a full-color weekly webcomic strip presented by online comics&#x27; retailer, mania.com.

In October 1997 Caliber repackaged the entire six issues of &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Paul&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and the &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; #0, publishing it as a trade paperback entitled: &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Paul&#x27;s Adventure&quot;.

In November 1997, with #3, &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Quest For Kings&quot; began a bi-monthly publishing schedule.

In April 1998 Caliber began publishing &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Forgotten Dreams&quot;. Caliber ultimately published only three issues of the four issue series.

In December 1998 Caliber published &quot;A Caliber Christmas&quot; which featured a seven-page &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; story, entitled: &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Christmas Remembered&quot;.

In March 2000 Image Comics published a larger-sized issue #4, which wrapped up the &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land: Forgotten Dreams&quot; story arc.
In 2000 &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land Volume One: Paul&#x27;s Adventure, Revised Edition&quot; was published as a trade paperback by the Shipman&#x27;s own self-publishing imprint, Pakkins Presents. The graphic novel features a revised look at the first six-issue series, including additional new art and writing.

In 2001 the trade paperbacks &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land Volume Two: Quest For Kings&quot; and &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land Volume Three: Forgotten Dreams&quot; were published by Pakkins Presents.

In April 2003 the trade paperback &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land Volume Four: Tavitah&quot; was published by Pakkins Presents.

In May 2005, &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; was realized for the first time in complete full-color as the independent comic book company, Alias Enterprises 1, began publishing a newly revised edition of the series as a monthly title.

From 2011 to 2013, &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land The Complete Series&quot;: Volume 1, 2, and 3 (of 5) presented in the original black-and-white, included a foreword by comic writers Jim Krueger, Gary Shipman, and James Pruett, respectively, an all-new original painted cover and special features inside. Volume One, Two and Three were released by the publishing company, Lamp Post Inc.

In July 2018, &quot;Pakkins Land&quot; creator Gary Shipman announced that he was working on new material to continue the series and by December, Shipman revealed that he was working on an Omnibus edition of the series which would feature over 400 pages of art, and began drawing new story art for it.

==Reception==
Receiving accolades from both fans and critics alike, the series has been compared to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, and garnered award recognition.

Cold Cut Distribution called &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; &quot;a charming fantasy full of childlike wonder&quot; and wrote: &quot;&#x27;There aren&#x27;t enough comics out there for younger readers&#x27;, say some shop owners. &#x27;Or for the child in all of us&#x27;, I agree. Luckily, here&#x27;s one more&quot;.

<doc id="589779" wikidata="Q7680183" url="?curid=589779" title="Tallulah Gorge">
<text>The Tallulah Gorge is a canyon in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the U.S. state of Georgia. Located near the town of Tallulah Falls in the northeastern part of the state, the gorge was formed by the Tallulah River as it cut through the Tallulah Dome rock formation. It measures approximately long and almost deep. Georgia&#x27;s Tallulah Gorge State Park protects much of the gorge and its waterfalls. The Tallulah Gorge has been dubbed one of the &quot;Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia&quot;.

Tallulah Falls Lake lies just above the gorge. It was created in 1913 by a hydroelectric dam built by Georgia Railway and Power (now Georgia Power) in order to run Atlanta&#x27;s city streetcars. The dam still collects most of the water from the falls via a tunnel sluice or penstock around the falls. It then redirects the water to a 72 MW hydropower electricity generation station downstream. This station lies at an elevation below the lake, but a few days each year the dam releases water and the lake&#x27;s water levels rise considerably. The days when water is released are especially popular for recreation, including kayaking and whitewater rafting.

==History==

Since the early 19th century, Tallulah Gorge and its waterfalls have been a tourist attraction. In 1882, Tallulah Falls Railway was built, increasing the accessibility of the area to visitors from Atlanta and elsewhere in Georgia, and the gorge became North Georgia&#x27;s leading tourist attraction. Resort hotels and bars sprang up to serve the tourist trade, which, after the addition of the railway, swelled to as many as 2,000 people on any given Sunday. In 1883, tightrope walker Professor Bachman crossed the gorge as part of a publicity stunt for a local hotel. On July 18, 1970, Karl Wallenda became the second man to walk across the gorge on a tightrope.

In the 1910s, Georgia Railway and Power began building dams on the river. The town of Burton, Georgia was purchased and its residents relocated. The area was cleared and then flooded to become Lake Burton in 1919. Many nearby residents opposed the dams, including Helen Dortch Longstreet, widow of Confederate general James Longstreet, who led an unsuccessful campaign in 1911 to have Tallulah Gorge protected by the state. The Georgia Assembly was unable to raise the $1 million required to purchase the gorge, but Mrs. Longstreet&#x27;s efforts are among the first recorded conservation movements in Georgia. Once the dam was completed in 1913, the roar of the Tallulah Falls (which could be heard for miles from the gorge) was quieted, and tourism dwindled. A state park was created by Georgia governor Zell Miller in cooperation with Georgia Power.

==Etymology==
Georgians have long assumed that Tallulah was a Cherokee word, given the prominence of Cherokee history in the extreme northern part of the state. The word&#x27;s etymology remains uncertain, and it does not clearly match either Cherokee or nearby Muscogean languages such as Creek. In his book &quot;Georgia Place-names&quot;, Kenneth K. Krakow cites John Mooney, an authority on the Cherokee language who traced the name from the Native American word &quot;talulu&quot; or &quot;taruri&quot; but concluded that both forms are untranslatable. Krakow also mentions that the American actress Tallulah Bankhead (1902â1968) was named for her grandmother, who was named after Tallulah Falls.

==Tallulah Falls in popular culture==
*The opening credits of the 1976 film &quot;Grizzly&quot; were filmed while flying through the gorge, and several key shots were taken in one of the gift shops on the gorge rim.
*On July 18, 1970, the then 65-year-old Karl Wallenda performed a high-wire walk across the Tallulah Gorge.
*Parts of the 1972 film &quot;Deliverance&quot; were filmed in the gorge.
*Portions of the 2018 film &quot;&quot; were filmed in the state park.

==Geology and ecology==
Tallulah Dome is a rock formation caused by the double folding of the Earth&#x27;s crust during the formation of Pangaea, about 500 to 250 million years ago. The dome is made up of mostly quartzite along with schist.

Because of the variation in sunlight, shade, and moisture caused by the steep cliffs, several different ecosystems exist in and around the canyon-like gorge. The persistent trillium, an endangered species of trillium, grows in this river basin and only few other parts of the South Carolina/Georgia area.

<doc id="589782" wikidata="Q7658716" url="?curid=589782" title="Swingometer">
<text>The swingometer is a graphics device that shows the effects of the swing from one party to another on British election results programmes. It is used to estimate the number of seats that will be won by different parties, given a particular national swing (in percentage points) in the vote towards or away from a given party, and assuming that that percentage change in the vote will apply in each constituency. The device was invented by Peter Milne, and later refined by David Butler and Robert McKenzie.

The first outing on British television was during a regional output from the BBC studios in Bristol during the 1955 general election (the first UK general election to be televised) and was used to show the swing in the two constituencies of Southampton Itchen and Southampton Test.

Following this use in 1955, the BBC adopted the swingometer on a national basis and it was unveiled in the national broadcasts for the 1959 general election. This swingometer merely showed the national swing in Britain but not the implications on that swing on the composition of parliament. These issues were not addressed until the 1964 general election.

The swingometer for that election showed not only the national swing, but also the implications of that national swing. So for instance, a 3.5% swing to Labour would see Labour become a majority government whilst any swing to the Conservatives would see Sir Alec Douglas-Home reelected as Prime Minister with a huge parliamentary majority. In the end the result was a Labour overall majority of 4, and so when the 1966 general election came around, a new element had to be added (namely the prospect of a hung parliament).

At the 1970 general election, the swingometer entered the age of colour television and showed the traditional party colours of red for Labour and blue for Conservative and had to be extended due to the success of the Conservative party at that election.

However, following the success of the Liberals in the by-elections held between the 1970 and February 1974 general elections, the swingometer was reduced in scale to just a small standby as the computers used by the BBC were deemed more reliable. As the Liberal Party reduced in importance the swingometer was brought back for the 1979 general election but for the 1983 and 1987 general elections computers were introduced to show changes in support in both map and graphic form.

The swingometer was brought back for the 1992 general election covering the whole side of the election studio and also had to be manhandled by at least four technicians as well as Peter Snow who had taken over the election graphics role following the death of Bob McKenzie. This swingometer was too big for comfort and in 1997 started on a shrinking process and was changed from an actual swingometer to a virtual reality construct. For the 2001 general election the graphic was reduced further. Following a few experiments in the United Kingdom local elections in 2003 and 2004 the swingometer for the next election in 2005 was held on virtual structs as well as swingometers for the Labour and Liberal Democrats parties.
An online version of the swingometer, featuring Labour and the Conservatives only, was introduced on the BBC News website at the 2001 general election. In 2005 the online swingometer was substantially re-designed to include versions featuring the Liberal Democrats, plus information on specific constituencies - including &quot;VIP&quot; seats - won/ lost on different swings. For the 2010 general election, the swingometer was placed in a completely virtual environment and repositioned to appear on the back wall of the virtual studio, with named constituencies as opposed to virtual MPs. All three swingometers were updated (Con / Lab, Con / Lib Dem, Lab / Lib Dem) in this manner.

==3D swingometer==
The 3D swingometer is used to illustrate the shift in election results from the previous election in a three-party system. It is similar to the &quot;2D&quot; swingometer used in two-party system elections, but uses the extra dimension to allow swings to occur among three parties.

The sum of all the swings between parties must equal zero. In a three party system, the most complicated swings will involve a major swing either to or from one political party, with this swing being made up of two components from each of the other two parties. For instance there may be a 3-point swing towards the Purple party, consisting of a 2-point swing from the Orange party and a 1-point swing from the Brown party. Alternatively, there may be a 5-point swing from the Orange party, of which 3 points are towards the Brown party and 2 towards the Purple party.

It is possible to split the swing space up into different regions indicating what the result would be if the swing indicated occurred linearly across the electorate. This gives rise to four regions: one each indicating overall control for each party, and a fourth region indicating no overall control.

Where there are swings directly from one party to a second party with the third party&#x27;s vote remaining unchanged, the 3D swingometer clearly indicates that the third party also benefits slightly from the reduction in vote of the first party.

The three dimensions consist of the two used to create the swing space and the third for the pendulum to swing in.

During the 2010 UK General election race, the Slapometer website allowed voters to slap along to the live TV debates between party leaders Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Rather than showing a swing in votes it merely gave feedback about the number of slaps each politician was receiving each second.

<text>Harpalyke , also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;. In August 2003, the moon was named after Harpalyce, the incestuous daughter of Clymenus, who in some accounts was also a lover of Zeus (Jupiter).

Harpalyke belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured heliocentric asteroid. It is about 4 kilometres in diameter and appears grey (color index R-V=0.43), similar to C-type asteroids. The satellite orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,064,000 km in 634.19 days, at an inclination of 147Â° to the ecliptic (147Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2441.

<text>HeÅ¡eri (; Manchu: &quot;HeÅ¡eri&quot;), is a clan of Manchu nobility with Jianzhou Jurchens roots, originally hailing from the area which is now the modern Chinese provinces of Jilin and Liaoning. It was once one of the most important and powerful noble families in the early Qing dynasty in China, second only to the royal House of Aisin Gioro, to whom they were closely related by marriage. 

The power of the HeÅ¡eri family reached its zenith in the period of Duke HeÅ¡eri Sonin and his third son Lord HeÅ¡eri Songgotu (from approximately 1650 to 1705). Although its influence declined following Songgotu&#x27;s death, the HeÅ¡eri clan continued to be the hereditary nobility and play a role in Chinese politics until the demise of the Qing dynasty in early 1912.

==History==

===Origins===
The name HeÅ¡eri was first recorded in the &quot;Thirty Common Surnames of Jurchen&quot; during the later Tang dynasty (c. 800-850), and is said to be derived from the name of an ancestral river (&quot;Å¡eri&quot; loosely translating to water-spring in the Manchu language). Alternatively, some have suggested that the name may stem from that of an ancient tribe. During the Tang dynasty, the HeÅ¡eri lived on the northern outskirts of the empire, co-existing to some degree with the then extant Khitan and the Liao dynasty they founded (which dynasty the Jurchen ultimately conquered and destroyed in 1125); while the bulk of the clan maintained their ancestral residencies, the (second) ascendancy of the Jurchen (renamed by this time to Manchu) during the Qing dynasty and the administrative and military appointments clan HeÅ¡eri enjoyed as a result saw moderate diffusion of HeÅ¡eri throughout the more interior northern and central provinces.

After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and the resulting 1912 collapse of the Qing dynasty, the vast majority of HeÅ¡eri saw fit to distance themselves from their Manchu origins. To accomplish this, the more Han-sounding diminutive &quot;He&quot; (Chinese: èµ« / ä½) was adopted as a replacement surname (commonly spelled &quot;Ho&quot; in Hong Kong and several other Cantonese-speaking regions); a few HeÅ¡eri went further and changed their surnames completely to &quot;Gao&quot; (é«), &quot;Kang&quot; (åº·), &quot;Zhang&quot; (å¼ ), &quot;Lu&quot; (è¦), &quot;He&quot; (è´º), &quot;Suo&quot; (ç´¢), &quot;Ying&quot; (è±), &quot;Hao&quot; (é), &quot;Hei&quot; (é»), &quot;Pu&quot; (æ®), &quot;Li&quot; (æ), or &quot;Man&quot; (æ»¡).

<text>Praxidike , also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

It was named in August 2003 after Praxidike, the Greek goddess of punishment.

==Orbit==

Praxidike orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,824,000 km in 609.25 days, at an inclination of 144Â° to the ecliptic (143Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.1840.

Praxidike belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured heliocentric asteroid. With an estimated diameter of 7Â km, Praxidike is the second largest member of the group after Ananke itself (assumed albedo of 0.04).

==Characteristics==
The satellite appears grey (colour indices B-V=0.77, R-V= 0.34), typical of C-type asteroids.

<text>Iocaste, also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii including: David C. Jewitt, Yanga R. Fernandez, and Eugene Magnier led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Iocaste orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20.723 million kilometers in 632 earth days, at an inclination of 147Â° to the ecliptic (146Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2874.

It was named in October 2002 after Jocasta, the mother/wife of Oedipus in Greek mythology. The name ending in &quot;e&quot; was chosen in accordance with the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s policy for designating outer moons with retrograde orbits.

Iocaste belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured heliocentric asteroid.

The satellite is about 5 kilometres in diameter and appears grey (colour indices BâV=0.63, RâV=0.36), similar to C-type asteroids.

<doc id="589802" wikidata="Q7722539" url="?curid=589802" title="The Chimp Channel">
<text>The Chimp Channel is an American sitcom which aired on TBS Superstation in 1999. Based on the &quot;Monkey-ed Movies&quot; interstitials that TBS aired one year prior, it is the network&#x27;s first original sitcom. The series primarily consists of costumed chimpanzees and orangutans, voiced by human actors, parodying popular television shows, movies, and advertising as well as stars and personalities within the industry. &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; marked the first all-simian series since ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp&quot;, which ended in 1972.

==Premise==
The series revolves around the behind the scenes antics of the fictional, eponymous cable network, The Chimp Channel (abbreviated TCC), and the shows it produces. Television programs filmed at the network include &quot;NYPD Zoo&quot;, &quot;Treewatch&quot;, &quot;Ally McSqeal&quot;, &quot;The Murray Price Show&quot;, &quot;News at Night&quot;, and &quot;Movies on Film&quot;. The latter has two critics reviewing films from the &quot;Monkey-ed Movie&quot; library with a non-opposable thumbs up or down. Due to the show&#x27;s racy humor, it earned a TV-14 rating.

==Background and production history==
In 1998, TBS aired Tom Stern&#x27;s &quot;Monkey-ed Movies&quot;. Forty-eight of the short segments were produced to run during the feature-film program &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; and in odd time slots after sporting events. However, one day when a golf tournament ran short, the station played about half an hour of &quot;Monkey&#x27;ed Movies&quot; to unexpected results. The ratings actually increased, which prompted TBS to order 13 episodes of an expanded half-hour series. Aiming for a young male audience, TBS placed &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; on Thursday nights at 10:05Â p.m. ET following the network&#x27;s top-rated professional wrestling show &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;. An April 1999 press release noted the series&#x27; original title as &quot;Channel of the Apes&quot;. The renamed &quot;Chimp Channel&quot; debuted on June 10, 1999.

Not long into production, Stern found himself at odds with TBS management regarding the direction of the series. This led to an incident on March 8, 1999 in which he improvised a raunchy performance art piece that involved full nudity and breaking two liquor bottles on the show&#x27;s set. Stern was promptly fired for the incident despite claiming that he had permission from network officials to do what he called &quot;improv comedy&quot; described as &quot;trying to get stuff off my chest about the wrong-headed direction the show was taking.&quot; On June 9, one day before the &quot;Chimp Channel&quot; series premiere, Stern filed a breach-of-contract suit against TBS, Warner Bros. Domestic Pay TV, Telescopic Pictures, and Palomar Pictures in Los Angeles, seeking damages in excess of $1,675,000. Stern was represented in the suit by Los Angeles attorney David Wall. Production of the series continued for a few more months without its creative founder.

Filming of &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; required a reportedly critical sensitivity regarding its animal cast. In attempt to avoid any performance hampering or distraction, studio personnel and visitors were instructed not to mingle with, make gestures toward, or make eye contact with the chimps. Brief scenes required strenuous rehearsal before filming could begin, and all personnel not required for immediate set consulting, including the director, viewed the shooting from monitors 50 feet away. Regarding the apes&#x27; behavior on set, Tom Stern quipped &quot;Maggie, [the chimp] who plays Marina, loves the Lycra suit she wears and can&#x27;t refrain from going to the bathroom in it â she thinks it&#x27;s just a really cool red diaper. All the chimps wear diapers, though, so it&#x27;s a lot like &quot;Frasier&quot;.&quot;

The ape performances were coached by off-screen trainers using signals to communicate with them. This made shooting more than two chimps at once difficult, so high-tech editing was used to multiply the number of apes in the frame. And since they couldn&#x27;t always follow the script perfectly, the apes&#x27; reactions were cataloged and often edited together to create cohesive scenes. Regarding the unpredictability of the apes, co-executive producer Tim Burns noted, &quot;They&#x27;re a comedy writer&#x27;s best friend. I think the stuff is funny to begin with, but there&#x27;s no replacing how much funnier it is when the monkeys add their own peculiar performance style.&quot;

The American Humane Association&#x27;s Film and Television Unit supervised the filming of both &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; and its predecessor, &quot;Monkey-ed Movies&quot;, and reported:
:&quot;The chimps and orangutans are receiving a very high standard of care. The trainers use modern, humane techniques to cue and motivate the animals. . . The TBS production team has been very cooperative, has upheld the Guidelines and insures the wellbeing [sic] of the chimps during filming.&quot; AHA field representative Netta Bank rated the crew&#x27;s treatment of the apes &quot;A-plus&quot; and noted &quot;This is all chimps, all the time, so they&#x27;re treated like stars. . . They have their own dressing room, their own green room. They have a play area for themselves.&quot;

==Reception==
While the training and animal work was commended, &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; received largely negative critical reception with the notion that it fails its attempt to expand the simple, effective concept of &quot;Monkey-ed Movies&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Caryn James gave a negative review of the show, stating &quot;&quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; is so scattershot and predictable it becomes tiresome in about five minutes. . . And the brief parodies of television shows and movies offer mere glimpses of wit.&quot;

Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; described how the original &quot;Monkey-ed Movies&quot; &quot;proved to be clever stuff, in large part because it was short and sweet&quot; but that &quot;with &quot;Chimp Channel&quot;, TBS monkeys with an undeniably thin concept and stretches it past the limit.&quot; While he commended the &quot;sharp, well-organized direction from Mitchell Walker and the uncannily effective animal work from head trainer Bob Dunn, coordinator Mike Morris and their team,&quot; Richmond added &quot;What seems cute in small doses feels awfully humiliating in this expanded format, sucking out any novelty and leaving in its wake only the uncomfortable entrails.&quot;

Tom Jicha of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; claimed &quot;&quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; sounds a lot funnier than it turns out to be on the air. As an occasional brief skit on a show like &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; or &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; might be entertaining.&quot; However, Jicha also provided additional insight into the series&#x27; predicament, pondering &quot;TBS seems to have it&#x27;s days and nights confused. Cleaned up of its occasional randy references - there&#x27;s even a snarky shot at Monica Lewinsky - &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; might work for the audience at 10 in the morning on Saturday. At 10 at night on Thursdays it&#x27;s a King Kong-sized loser.&quot;

Fan reception appears to be somewhat more positive; as of 2010, &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot; holds an 8.2/10 rating on the Internet Movie Database and 6.2 &quot;Fair&quot; on TV.com.

==In popular culture==
The show was promoted during time trials for the 1999 Coca-Cola 600 by commentator Ken Squier, who, after reading the promo, was jokingly non-verbally referred to as a chimp by broadcasting partners Buddy Baker and Dick Berggren.

<text>Zwier Albertus &quot;Alby&quot; Mangels (born 16 November 1948) is an Australian adventurer and documentary film-maker widely remembered for his &quot;World Safari&quot; adventure travel films (&quot;World Safari&quot;, &quot;World Safari II&quot;, and &quot;World Safari III&quot;).

==Early life==
Mangels was born in the Netherlands on 16 November 1948. His father Johannes (Jos) was a leather tanner. The family moved to Australia in 1955 where they settled in Adelaide, South Australia. 

After about eighteen months in Australia his parents separated. His mother Adrianna (Sjann) remarried but died when he was fifteen. He left school at fourteen.

As a teenager, he undertook a wide variety of professions including chicken farming and house construction.

Mangels set off in 1971 with friend John Fields on what was supposed to be a one-off trip. It turned into a six-year odyssey which they filmed through several continents. The resulting film, first shown in Australia in 1977, was a significant success. Mangels continued to travel through the 1980s, filming all the way. Two more World Safari films were made from this subsequent material. 

Mangels and Fields often spent time living with local inhabitants in many locations, frequently working for room and board or just to get to know the local culture of each area.

==Biographies==
A companion book to the films, &quot;Alby Mangels&#x27; World Safari&quot;, was published in the 1980s. Lynn Santer authored Mangels&#x27;s authorised biography &quot;Beyond World Safari&quot; in 2007. There are also reports that a feature-length Mangels biographical film is in production with multi-awarded Hollywood veteran producer Paul Mason and in 2010 he was rumoured to have been approached to appear on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

<text>Erinome, also known as , is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation .

Erinome is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,986,000 km in 682.80 days, at an inclination of 164Â° to the ecliptic (162Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2552.

It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165Â°.

==Name==
Erinome was named in October 2002 after the mythological Erinoma, a Cypriot woman said by the discovery group to be a &quot;daughter of Celes, compelled by Venus to fall in love with Jupiter.&quot; In the surviving myths however, it is actually Jupiter (Zeus) whom Venus (Aphrodite) makes fall in love with Erinoma, in order to ruin her.

The final -a vowel of the name was changed to -e to accord with IAU naming conventions for retrograde moons.
The story is only known in Latin, and manuscripts have the name as &quot;Erinoma&quot;, &quot;Erinona&quot; and &quot;Erittoma&quot;. The original Greek name, and thus the stressed syllable in Latin, is unknown. It might be a late corruption of Eurynome, in which case the stress would be on the third syllable (?). Since there is no moon named &#x27;Eurynome&#x27; , this would not be ambiguous.

<text>Taygete , also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard, in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Taygete is about 5 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,439,000Â km in 691.62 days, at an inclination of 165Â° to the ecliptic (163Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.3678.

It was named in October 2002 after Taygete, one of the Pleiades, daughter of the Titan Atlas and mother of Lacedaemon by Zeus (Jupiter).

It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165Â°. Like Carme but unlike Kalyke, it is light red in color (BâV=0.56, VâR=0.52).

<text>Kalyke , also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

From infrared thermal measurements by the WISE spacecraft, Kalyke&#x27;s albedo is measured at 2.9%, corresponding to a diameter of 6.9 kilometres. It orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,181,000 km in 766.61 days, at an inclination of 166Â° to the ecliptic (165Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2140.

It was named in October 2002 after the Greek mythological figure Kalyke or Calyce.

It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165Â°. Kalyke is redder in color (BâV=0.94, VâR=0.70) than other moons of the Carme group, suggesting that it is a captured centaur or TNO, or a remnant of such an object that collided with the Carme group progenitor.

<text>Eurydome , also known as &#x27;, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered concurrently with Hermippe by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Eurydome is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,231,000 km in 722.59 days, at an inclination of 149Â° to the ecliptic (147Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.3770.

It was named in August 2003 after Eurydome in Greek mythology, who is sometimes described as the mother of the Graces by Zeus (Jupiter).

Eurydome belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5Â° and 158.3Â°.

<text>The Old Vic is a 1,000-seat, nonprofit producing theatre in Waterloo, London, England. It was established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre, and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre. In 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace. It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall, although by that time it was already known as the &quot;Old Vic&quot;. In 1898, a niece of Cons, Lilian Baylis, assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914. The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened.

The Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today. It was the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed (along with the Chichester Festival Theatre) the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963, under Laurence Olivier. The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank, opening in 1976. The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company, at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. However, with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations, Prospect disbanded in 1981. The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985. In 2003, Kevin Spacey was appointed artistic director, which received considerable media attention. Spacey served as artistic director until 2015; two years after he stepped down, he was accused (but later found not liable) of sexually harassing and assaulting several people. In 2015, Matthew Warchus succeeded Spacey as artistic director.

==History==

===Origins===

The theatre was founded in 1818 by James King and Daniel Dunn (formerly managers of the Surrey Theatre in Bermondsey), and John Thomas Serres, then the marine painter to the King. Serres managed to secure the formal patronage of Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, and named the theatre the Royal Coburg Theatre. The theatre was a &quot;minor&quot; theatre (as opposed to one of the two patent theatres) and was thus technically forbidden to show serious drama. Nevertheless, when the theatre passed to George Bolwell Davidge in 1824 he succeeded in bringing legendary actor Edmund Kean south of the river to play six Shakespeare plays in six nights. The theatre&#x27;s role in bringing high art to the masses was confirmed when Kean addressed the audience during his curtain call saying &quot;I have never acted to such a set of ignorant, unmitigated brutes as I see before me.&quot; In 1825 a young American actor, Ira Aldridge, played here in this second job in the country in an abolitionist play, &#x27;The Revolt of Surinam&#x27;. It was the start of a groundbreaking classical, international career. Aldridge was 18 years old, Black American and by the time of his death in 1867 he was one of the biggest stars of his day. More popular staples in the repertoire at the theatre were &quot;sensational and violent&quot; melodramas demonstrating the evils of drink, &quot;churned out by the house dramatist&quot;, confirmed teetotaller Douglas Jerrold.

When Davidge left to take over the Surrey Theatre in 1833, the theatre was bought by Daniel Egerton and William Abbot, who tried to capitalise on the abolition of the legal distinction between patent and minor theatres, enacted in Parliament earlier that year. On 1 July 1833, the theatre was renamed the Royal Victoria Theatre, under the &quot;protection and patronage&quot; of Victoria, Duchess of Kent, mother to Princess Victoria, the 14-year-old heir presumptive to the British throne. The duchess and the princess visited only once, on 28 November of that year, but enjoyed the performance, of light opera and dance, in the &quot;pretty...clean and comfortable&quot; theatre. The single visit scarcely justified the &quot;Old Vic&quot; its later billing as &quot;Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Theayter&quot;.
In 1841, David Osbaldiston took over as lessee, and was succeeded on his death in 1850 by his lover and the theatre&#x27;s leading lady, Eliza Vincent, until her death in 1856. Under their management, the theatre remained devoted to melodrama. In 1858, sixteen people were crushed to death inside the theatre after mass panic caused while an actor&#x27;s clothing caught fire.

 In 1867, Joseph Arnold Cave took over as lessee. In 1871 he transferred the lease to Romaine Delatorre, who raised funds for the theatre to be rebuilt in the style of the Alhambra Music Hall. Jethro Thomas Robinson was engaged as the architect. In September 1871 the old theatre closed, and the new building opened as the Royal Victoria Palace in December of the same year, with Cave staying on as manager. By 1873, however, Cave had left and Delatorre&#x27;s venture failed.

In 1880, under the ownership of Emma Cons (for whose memory there are plaques outside and inside the theatre) it became the Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern and was run on &quot;strict temperance lines&quot;; by this time it was already known as the &quot;Old Vic&quot;. The &quot;penny lectures&quot; given in the hall led to the foundation of Morley College. An endowment from the estate of Samuel Morley led to the creation of the &quot;Morley Memorial College for Working Men and Women&quot; on the premises, which were shared; lectures were given back stage, and in the theatre dressing rooms. The adult education college moved to its own premises nearby in the 1920s.

On 24 November 1923, the theatre participated in a pioneering radio event, when the first set of the opera &quot;La Traviata&quot; was broadcast live by the BBC, using transmitters in London, Manchester and Glasgow, via a specially installed relay transmitter on the roof of the adjacent Royal Victoria Tavern.

===Old Vic company===

With Emma Cons&#x27;s death in 1912 the theatre passed to her niece Lilian Baylis, who emphasised the Shakespearean repertoire. The first radio broadcasts from the theatre were made as early as October 1923, by the British Broadcasting Company. The Old Vic Company was established in 1929, led by Sir John Gielgud. Between 1925 and 1931, Lilian Baylis championed the re-building of the then-derelict Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, and established a ballet company under the direction of Dame Ninette de Valois. For a few years the drama and ballet companies rotated between the two theatres, with the ballet becoming permanently based at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1935. Baylis died in November 1937.

===Wartime exile===
The Old Vic was damaged badly during the Blitz, and the war-depleted company spent all its time touring, based in Burnley, Lancashire at the Victoria Theatre during the years 1940 to 1943. In 1944, the company was re-established in London with Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier as its stars, performing mainly at the New Theatre (now the NoÃ«l Coward Theatre) until the Old Vic was ready to reopen in 1950. In 1946, an offshoot of the company was established in Bristol as the Bristol Old Vic.

===The Five Year plan===
In 1953, Michael Benthall became the Artistic Director. Michael devised the Five Year plan during his tenure. The plan was to produce Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio in five years, starting the plan with Hamlet, starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom as Hamlet and Ophelia respectively, and ending the plan with Hamlet, starring John Neville and Judi Dench in the leading roles. Michael remained at the Old Vic company until 1962. 

===National Theatre company===
In 1963, the Old Vic company was dissolved and the new National Theatre Company, under the artistic direction of Sir Laurence Olivier, was based at the Old Vic until its own building was opened on the South Bank near Waterloo Bridge in 1976.
In July 1974 the Old Vic presented a rock concert for the first time. National Theatre director Peter Hall arranged for the progressive folk-rock band Gryphon to premiÃ¨re &quot;Midnight Mushrumps&quot;, the fantasia inspired by Hall&#x27;s own 1974 Old Vic production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; starring John Gielgud for which Gryphon had supplied the music.

===Prospect Theatre Company===
For two years prior to the departure of the National Theatre Company, Toby Robertson, director of the Prospect Theatre Company, sustained a campaign that the Old Vic should make Prospect its resident company. For the Old Vic, Robertson&#x27;s overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged by other visiting companies; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Derek Jacobi, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with Alec McCowen and Dorothy Tutin; and &quot;Saint Joan&quot; with Eileen Atkins. In July the Governors of the Old Vic announced &quot;a marriage that was all but a merger&quot; between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of the Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of the Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.

One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect&#x27;s funding by the Arts Council of Great Britain: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the council â already funding the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company in London â could not accept a case for another theatre company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore, any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect&#x27;s first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre&#x27;s finances to breaking point. Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. In December 1978, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled &quot;Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company&quot;. Unfortunately Prospect&#x27;s touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country), followed by &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; with Ian Richardson. The following season, however, proved controversial: the proposed programming, including the double bill of &quot;The Padlock&quot; and &quot;Miss in Her Teens&quot;, to mark the bicentenary of David Garrick&#x27;s death, and a revival of &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;, were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory. An internal report by Prospect now questioned &quot;whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the Arts Council Director of Touring&#x27;s requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson&quot;.

Robertson was in effect fired as artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him. The following season, West&#x27;s first as Robertson&#x27;s successor, saw &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Peter O&#x27;Toole, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday. On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the company, sealing its inevitable demise. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic in 1981, staging &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.

=== Youth Theatre ===
The &#x27;Old Vic Youth Theatreâ was an acting company for young people between the ages of 12 and 20 mainly from the London Borough of Southwark. The group was founded by Tom Vaughan of the Old Vic Theatre, Raymond Rivers of Morley College and Barry Anderson of the Southbank Education Institute. The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) was the enterprise&#x27;s main funding body.

During the early spring term of 1977 auditions consisting of improvisational scenes run by the Youth Theatre&#x27;s first professional directors Lucy Parker and Frederick Proud took place and around 40 applicants were chosen to form the company.

By the middle of the summer in 1977 the &#x27;Old Vic Youth Theatreâ had performed two plays for the paying public. First was âThe Kitchenâ by Arnold Wesker which also incorporated improvised scenes alongside the actual script and was staged in the Emma Cons Hall at Morley College. The Youth Theatre&#x27;s second production, âA Midsummer Nightâs Dreamâ by William Shakespeare was first performed at the George Inn Courtyard as part of the Southwark Shakespeare Festival the same year and was the company&#x27;s debut production at the Old Vic Theatre itself.

In the autumn of 1977 a new round of auditions took place and the existing group expanded into two. One group concentrated on a famous scripted play whilst the other would devise a play through improvisation from which the material was scripted into a play by a professional playwright.

The Youth groups continued to produce plays with new members auditioning each September until the mid 1980s.

===Reopening===
The Old Vic was significantly restored under the ownership of Toronto department-store entrepreneur &#x27;Honest Ed&#x27; Mirvish in 1985. In 1987, his son David Mirvish installed Jonathan Miller as artistic director of the Old Vic and the theatre enjoyed several critical successes â including an Olivier Award for a production of the musical &quot;Candide&quot;, but suffered three straight years of financial loss. In 1990, Mirvish terminated Miller&#x27;s contract over budgetary issues, earning much negative criticism in the British press.

In 1997, Mirvish appointed Sir Peter Hall as artistic director and, again, enjoyed critical acclaim with such productions as &quot;The Master Builder&quot; with Alan Bates and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; with Ben Kingsley, but continuing financial loss. Within a year of the appointment, Mirvish terminated Hall&#x27;s contract â again to much negative comment in the press â and put the Old Vic up for sale. In 1998, the building was bought by a new charitable trust, the &quot;Old Vic Theatre Trust 2000&quot;. In 2000, the production company Criterion Productions was renamed &quot;Old Vic Productions plc&quot;, although relatively few of its productions are at the Old Vic theatre.

===Kevin Spacey (2003-2015) ===
In 2003, actor Kevin Spacey was appointed as new artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre Company. Spacey said he wanted to inject new life into the British theatre industry, and bring British and American theatrical talent to the stage. Spacey served as artistic director until 2015.

In November 2017, amid a series of rape and sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey, 20 people contacted the Old Vic with claims that he had sexually harassed or assaulted them at the theatre during his tenure as artistic director. In the wake of the scandal, The Old Vic released a statement apologising for &quot;not creating an environment or culture where people felt able to speak freely&quot;, and announced a &quot;commitment to a new way forward&quot;.

In 2018, the Old Vic announced that it had established the Guardians Programme, a group of trained staff who offer a confidential outlet for colleagues to share concerns about behaviour or the culture at work. Additionally, a Guardians Network has been formed to bring together the group of organisations from all sectors (not just the arts) who have implemented the principles of a Guardian Programme.

===Matthew Warchus (2015-26)===
Since 2015, Matthew Warchus has been Artistic Director of The Old Vic. His debut season opened in September 2015 with Warchus&#x27;s production of a new play about education, &quot;Future Conditional&quot; by Tamsin Oglesby. He also has directed productions at the theatre such as the world premiere of the musical &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; by Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin, &quot;Present Laughter&quot; by NoÃ«l Coward and from the Christmas 2017 season directed Jack Thorne&#x27;s new version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; which has returned to the theatre every Christmas season since raising Â£1.5million for food poverty and deprivation-focused charities. He announced his resignation in May 2024, leaving the position in September 2026 after 11 years. On 27 November 2024, it was announced that Rupert Goold would take over as Artistic Director with Rebecca Frecknall as Associate Director.

===Bicentenary (2018)===
On 24 October 2017, The Old Vic announced its bicentenary season. The theatre celebrated its 200th birthday on 11 May 2018 with a free performance of Joe Penhall&#x27;s &quot;Mood Music&quot;, featuring Ben Chaplin.

<text>Autonoe , also known as , is a natural satellite of Jupiter.

Autonoe was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the temporary designation .

Autonoe is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,264,000 km in 719.01 days. It orbits at an inclination of 151Â° to the ecliptic (150Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator) in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.369.

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5Â° and 158.3Â°.

Autonoe was named in August 2003 after the Greek mythological figure AutonoÃ«, conquest of Zeus (Jupiter), mother of the Charites (Gracies), according to some authors.

<text>Sponde , also known as &#x27;, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Sponde is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,253,000 km in 734.89 days, at an inclination of 154Â° to the ecliptic (156Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.443.

It was named in August 2003 after one of the Horae (Hours), which presided over the seventh hour (libations poured after lunch). The Hours, goddesses of the time of day but also of the seasons, were daughters of Zeus (Jupiter) and Themis.

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5Â° and 158.3Â°.

<text>Megaclite , also known as &#x27;, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Megaclite is about 6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,687,000 kilometers in 747.09 days, at an inclination of 150Â° to the ecliptic (148Â° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.308.

It was named in October 2002 after Megaclite, mother by Zeus (Jupiter) of Thebe and Locrus in Greek mythology. It was initially erroneously named Magaclite, which was corrected in November 2002. Despite this correction, some earlier research still referred to the moon as Magaclite.

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.7 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5Â° and 158.3Â°. However, while Pasiphae belongs to the grey color class (V=17.22 BâV=0.74, VâR=0.38), Megaclite falls under the light red color class (V=22.07 BâV=0.94, VâR=0.41), similarly to Callirrhoe and Sinope.

<text>Kiviuq is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by J. J. Kavelaars et al. in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000Â SÂ 5. It was named after Kiviuq, a hero of Inuit mythology. 

Kiviuq is about 17 km in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 11.3 million kilometers in 449 days. It is a member of the Inuit group of irregular satellites. It is light red, and the Kiviupian (Kiviuqan) infrared spectrum is very similar to the Inuit-group satellites Siarnaq and Paaliaq, supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a larger body.

Kiviuq is believed to be in Kozai resonance, cyclically reducing its orbital inclination while increasing the eccentricity and vice versa. Its current orbital elements overlap strongly with Phoebe&#x27;s orbit, and the moons will likely eventually collide with each other.

The light curve amplitude of Kiviuq is large, varying in brightness by over 2 magnitudes. The large amplitude of Kiviuq suggests that it has an elongated shape, and may be a possible contact binary.

==Exploration==
On 30 August 2010, the ISS camera of the CassiniâHuygens spacecraft took light-curve data from a distance of 9.3 million km. With these data, the rotation period was measured to 21 hours and 49 minutes.
