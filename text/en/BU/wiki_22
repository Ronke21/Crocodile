<text>Dhanpat Rai Srivastava (31 July 1880 – 8 October 1936), better known as Munshi Premchand based on his pen name Premchand (), was an Indian writer famous for his modern Hindustani literature. 

Premchand was a pioneer of Hindi and Urdu social fiction. He was one of the first authors to write about caste hierarchies and the plights of women and labourers prevalent in the society of the late 1880s. He is one of the most celebrated writers of the Indian subcontinent, and is regarded as one of the foremost Hindi writers of the early twentieth century. His works include &quot;Godaan&quot;, &quot;Karmabhoomi&quot;, &quot;Gaban&quot;, &quot;Mansarovar&quot;, and &quot;Idgah&quot;. He published his first collection of five short stories in 1907 in a book called &quot;Soz-e-Watan&quot; (Sorrow of the Nation).

His works include more than a dozen novels, around 300 short stories, several essays and translations of a number of foreign literary works into Hindi.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Munshi Premchand was born on 31 July 1880 in Lamhi, a village located near Banaras, and was named Dhanpat Rai (&quot;master of wealth&quot;). His ancestors came from a large Chitraguptavanshi Kayastha family, which owned eight to nine bighas of land. His grandfather, Guru Sahai Rai, was a patwari (village land record-keeper), and his father, Ajaib Lal, was a post office clerk. His mother was Anandi Devi of Karauni village, who probably was also his inspiration for the character Anandi in his &quot;Bade Ghar Ki Beti&quot;. Dhanpat Rai was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the first two were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named sama. His uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him &quot;Nawab&quot;, meaning baron. &quot;Nawab Rai&quot; was the first pen name chosen by Dhanpat Rai.

When he was seven years old, Dhanpat Rai began his education at a madrasa in Lalpur, Varanasi, located near Lamhi. He learned Urdu and Persian from a maulvi in the madrasa. When he was 8, his mother died after a long illness. His grandmother, who was responsible for raising him, died soon after. Munshi Premchand felt isolated, as his elder sister Suggi had already been married, and his father was always busy with work. His father, who was now posted at Gorakhpur, remarried, but Premchand received little affection from his stepmother. The stepmother later became a recurring theme in Premchand&#x27;s works.

As a child, Dhanpat Rai sought solace in fiction and developed a fascination for books. He heard the stories of the Persian-language fantasy epic &quot;Tilism-e-Hoshruba&quot; at a tobacconist&#x27;s shop. He took the job of selling books for a book wholesaler, thus getting the opportunity to read a lot of books. He learnt English at a missionary school and studied several works of fiction, including George W. M. Reynolds&#x27;s eight-volume &quot;The Mysteries of the Court of London&quot;. He composed his first literary work at Gorakhpur, which was never published and is now lost. It was a farce on a bachelor who falls in love with a low caste woman. The character was based on Premchand&#x27;s uncle, who used to scold him for being obsessed with reading fiction; the farce was probably written as revenge for this.

After his father was posted to Zamania in the mid-1890s, Dhanpat Rai enrolled at the Queen&#x27;s College at Banaras as a day scholar. In 1895, he was married at the age of 15, while still studying in the ninth grade. The match was arranged by his maternal step-grandfather. The girl was from a rich landlord family and was older than Premchand, who found her quarrelsome and not good-looking.

His father died in 1897 after a long illness. He managed to pass the matriculation exam with second division (below 60% marks). However, only the students with the first division were given fee concessions at the Queen&#x27;s College. He then sought admission at the Central Hindu School but was unsuccessful because of his poor arithmetic skills. Thus, he had to discontinue his studies. He then obtained an assignment to coach an advocate&#x27;s son in Banaras at a monthly salary of five rupees. He used to reside in a mud cell over the advocate&#x27;s stables and used to send 60% of his salary back home. Premchand read a lot during these days. After racking up several debts, in 1899, he went to a bookshop to sell one of his collected books. There, he met the headmaster of a missionary school at Chunar, who offered him a job as a teacher at a monthly salary of . He also took up the job of tutoring a student at a monthly fee of .

In 1900, Premchand secured a job as an assistant teacher at the Government District School, Bahraich, at a monthly salary of . Three months later, he was transferred to the District School in Pratapgarh, where he stayed in an administrator&#x27;s bungalow and tutored his son.

His first short novel was &quot;Asrar-e-Ma&#x27;abid&quot; (&quot;Secrets of God&#x27;s abode&quot;, &quot;Devasthan Rahasya&quot; in Hindi), which explores corruption among the temple priests and their sexual exploitation of poor women. The novel was published in a series in the Banaras-based Urdu weekly &quot;Awaz-e-Khalq&quot; from 8 October 1903 to February 1905. Literary critic Siegfried Schulz states that &quot;his inexperience is quite evident in his first novel&quot;, which is not well-organized, lacks a good plot and features stereotyped characters. Prakash Chandra Gupta calls it an &quot;immature work&quot;, which shows a tendency to &quot;see life only in black or white&quot;.

=== Stay at Kanpur ===
From Pratapgarh, Dhanpat Rai was relocated to Allahabad for training and subsequently posted at Kanpur in 1905. He stayed in Kanpur for around four years, from May 1905 to June 1909. There, he met Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine &quot;Zamana&quot;, in which he later published several articles and stories.

Premchand visited his village, Lamhi, during the summer vacation but did not find the stay enjoyable because of a number of reasons. He did not find the weather or the atmosphere conducive to writing. Moreover, he faced domestic trouble due to quarrels between his wife and his step-mother. Premchand angrily scolded his wife after she unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide by hanging. Dismayed, she went to her father&#x27;s house, and Premchand displayed no interest in bringing her back. In 1906, Premchand married a child widow, Shivarani Devi, who was the daughter of a landlord from a village near Fatehpur. The step was considered to be revolutionary at that time, and Premchand faced a lot of social opposition. After his death, Shivarani Devi wrote a book on him, titled &quot;Premchand Ghar Mein&quot; (&quot;Premchand at Home&quot;).

In 1905, inspired by nationalist activism, Premchand published an article on the Indian National Congress leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale in &quot;Zamana&quot;. He criticised Gokhale&#x27;s methods for achieving political freedom and instead recommended adoption of more extremist measures adopted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Premchand&#x27;s first published story was &quot;Duniya ka Sabse Anmol Ratan&quot; (&quot;The Most Precious Jewel in the World&quot;), which appeared in &quot;Zamana&quot; in 1907. According to this story, the most precious &#x27;jewel&#x27; was the last drop of blood necessary to attain independence. Many of Premchand&#x27;s early short stories had patriotic overtones, influenced by the Indian independence movement.

Premchand&#x27;s second short novel &quot;Hamkhurma-o-Hamsavab&quot; (&quot;Prema&quot; in Hindi), published in 1907, was penned under the name &quot;Babu Nawab Rai Banarsi&quot;. It explores the issue of widow remarriage in the contemporary conservative society: the protagonist, Amrit Rai, overcomes social opposition to marrying the young widow, Poorna, giving up his rich and beautiful fiancée Prema. According to Prakash Chandra Gupta, &quot;While containing seeds of his future greatness in many ways, the novel is still youthful and lacks the discipline which full maturity brings&quot;.

In 1907, another of Premchand&#x27;s short novels, &quot;Kishna&quot; was published by the Medical Hall Press of Banaras. This 142-page work, which satirises women&#x27;s fondness for jewellery, is now lost. Literary critic Nobat Rai criticised the work in &quot;Zamana&quot;, calling it a mockery of the women&#x27;s conditions.

During April–August 1907, Premchand&#x27;s novel &quot;Roothi Rani&quot; was published in serial form in &quot;Zamana&quot;. Also in 1907, the publishers of &quot;Zamana&quot; published Premchand&#x27;s first short story collection, titled &quot;Soz-e-Watan&quot;. The collection, which was later banned, contained four stories that sought to inspire the Indians in their struggle for political freedom.

==== Adoption of the name Premchand ====
In 1909, Premchand was transferred to Mahoba and later posted to Hamirpur as the Sub-deputy Inspector of Schools. Around this time, &quot;Soz-e-Watan&quot; was noticed by British Government officials, who banned it as a seditious work. James Samuel Stevenson, the British collector of Hamirpur district ordered a raid on Premchand&#x27;s house, where around five hundred copies of &quot;Soz-e-Watan&quot; were burnt. After this, Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine &quot;Zamana&quot;, who had published Dhanpat Rai&#x27;s first story &quot;Duniya ka Sabse Anmol Ratan&quot; advised the pseudonym &quot;Premchand&quot;. Dhanpat Rai stopped using the name &quot;Nawab Rai&quot; and became Premchand.

Premchand was often referred to as Munshi Premchand. The fact is, he, along with Kanhaiyalal Munshi, edited the magazine Hans. The credit line read &quot;Munshi, Premchand&quot;. He thenceforth began being called Munshi Premchand. In 1914, Premchand started writing in Hindi (Hindi and Urdu are considered different registers of a single language Hindustani, with Hindi drawing much of its vocabulary from Sanskrit and Urdu being more influenced by Persian). By this time, he was already reputed as a fiction writer in Urdu. Sumit Sarkar notes that the switch was prompted by the difficulty of finding publishers in Urdu. His first Hindi story &quot;Saut&quot; was published in the magazine &quot;Saraswati&quot; in December 1915, and his first short story collection &quot;Sapta Saroj&quot; was published in June 1917.

=== Gorakhpur ===

In August 1916, Premchand was transferred to Gorakhpur on a promotion. He became the Assistant Master at the Normal High School, Gorakhpur.

At Gorakhpur, he developed a friendship with the bookseller Buddhi Lal, who allowed him to borrow novels for reading in exchange for selling exam cram books at the school. Premchand was an enthusiastic reader of classics in other languages and translated several of these works into Hindi.

By 1919, Premchand had published four novels of about a hundred pages each. In 1919, Premchand&#x27;s first major novel &quot;Seva Sadan&quot; was published in Hindi. The novel was originally written in Urdu under the title &quot;Bazaar-e-Husn&quot; but was published in Hindi first by a Calcutta-based publisher, who offered Premchand for his work. The Urdu Publisher of Lahore published the novel later in 1924, paying Premchand . The novel tells the story of an unhappy housewife, who first becomes a courtesan, and then manages an orphanage for the young daughters of the courtesans. It was well received by the critics and helped Premchand gain wider recognition.

In 1919, Premchand obtained a BA degree from Allahabad University. By 1921, he had been promoted to Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February 1921, he attended a meeting in Gorakhpur, where Mahatma Gandhi asked people to resign from government jobs as part of the non-cooperation movement. Premchand, although physically unwell and with two kids and a pregnant wife to support, thought about it for five days and decided, with the consent of his wife, to resign from his government job.

=== Back to Banaras ===
After quitting his job, Premchand left Gorakhpur for Banaras on 18 March 1921 and decided to focus on his literary career. Till his death in 1936, he faced severe financial difficulties and chronic ill health.

In 1923, he established a printing press and publishing house in Banaras, christened &quot;Saraswati Press&quot;. The year 1924 saw the publication of Premchand&#x27;s &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot;, which has a blind beggar called Surdas as its tragic hero. Schulz mentions that in &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot;, Premchand comes across as a &quot;superb social chronicler&quot;, and although the novel contains some &quot;structural flaws&quot; and &quot;too many authorial explanations&quot;, it shows a &quot;marked progress&quot; in Premchand&#x27;s writing style. According to Schulz, it was in &quot;Nirmala&quot; (1925) and &quot;Pratigya&quot; (1927) that Premchand found his way to &quot;a balanced, realistic level&quot; that surpasses his earlier works and manages to &quot;hold his readers in tutelage&quot;. &quot;Nirmala&quot;, a novel dealing with the dowry system in India, was first serialised in the magazine &quot;Chand&quot; between November 1925 and November 1926, before being published as a novel. &quot;Pratigya&quot; (&quot;The Vow&quot;) dealt with the subject of widow remarriage.

In 1928, Premchand&#x27;s novel &quot;Gaban&quot; (&quot;Embezzlement&quot;), focusing on the middle class&#x27; greed, was published. In March 1930, Premchand launched a literary-political weekly magazine titled &quot;Hans&quot;, aimed at inspiring the Indians to mobilise against the British rule. The magazine, noted for its politically provocative views, failed to make a profit. Premchand then took over and edited another magazine called &quot;Jagaran,&quot; which, too, ran at a loss.

In 1931, Premchand moved to Kanpur as a teacher at the Marwari College but had to leave because of differences with the college administration. He then returned to Banaras and became the editor of the &quot;Maryada&quot; magazine. In 1932, he published another novel titled &quot;Karmabhoomi&quot;. He briefly served as the headmaster of the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a local school. After the school&#x27;s closure, he became the editor of the &quot;Madhuri&quot; magazine in Lucknow.

=== Bombay ===
Premchand arrived in Bombay on 31 May 1934 to try his luck in the Hindi film industry. He had accepted a script writing job for the production house Ajanta Cinetone, hoping that the yearly salary of would help him overcome his financial troubles. He stayed in Dadar, and wrote the script for the film &quot;Mazdoor&quot; (&quot;The Labourer&quot;). The film, directed by Mohan Bhawnani, depicted the poor conditions of the labour class. Premchand himself did a cameo as the leader of labourers in the film. Some influential businessmen managed to get a stay on its release in Bombay. The film was released in Lahore and Delhi but was banned again after it inspired the mill workers to stand up against the owners.

Ironically, the film inspired the workers of his own loss-making press in Banaras to launch a strike after they were not paid their salaries. By 1934–35, Premchand&#x27;s Saraswati Press was under a heavy debt of , and Premchand was forced to discontinue the publication of &quot;Jagaran&quot;. Meanwhile, Premchand was beginning to dislike the non-literary commercial environment of the Bombay film industry, and wanted to return to Banaras. However, he had signed a one-year contract with the production house. He ultimately left Bombay on 4 April 1935, before the completion of one year. Himanshu Roy, the founder of Bombay Talkies, tried to convince Premchand to stay back but failed.

=== Last days ===

After leaving Bombay, Premchand wanted to settle in Allahabad, where his sons Sripat Rai and Amrit Kumar Rai were studying. He also planned to publish &quot;Hans&quot; from there. However, owing to his financial situation and ill health, he had to hand over &quot;Hans&quot; to the Indian Literary Counsel and move to Banaras.

Premchand was elected as the first President of the Progressive Writers&#x27; Association in Lucknow in 1936. He died on 8 October 1936, after several days of sickness and while still in office.

&quot;Godaan&quot; (&quot;The Gift of a Cow&quot;, 1936), Premchand&#x27;s last completed work, is generally accepted as his best novel and is considered one of the finest Hindi novels. The protagonist, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. According to Siegfried Schulz, &quot;&quot;Godān&quot; is a well-structured and well-balanced novel which amply fulfils the literary requirements postulated by Western literary standards.&quot; Unlike other contemporary renowned authors such as Rabindranath Tagore, Premchand was not appreciated much outside India. Schulz believes that the reason for this was the absence of good translations of his work. Also, unlike Tagore and Iqbal, Premchand never travelled outside India, studied abroad or mingled with renowned foreign literary figures.

In 1936, Premchand also published &quot;Kafan&quot; (&quot;Shroud&quot;), in which a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of his dead wife but spends it on food and drink. Premchand&#x27;s last published story was &quot;Cricket Match&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Zamana&quot; in 1938, after his death.

== Style and influences ==

Premchand is considered the first Hindi author whose writings prominently featured realism. His novels describe the problems of the poor and the urban middle-class. His works depict a rationalistic outlook, which views religious values as something that allows the powerful hypocrites to exploit the weak. He used literature for the purpose of arousing public awareness about national and social issues and often wrote about topics related to corruption, child widowhood, prostitution, feudal system, poverty, colonialism and on the Indian independence movement.

Premchand started taking an interest in political affairs while at Kanpur during the late 1900s, and this is reflected in his early works, which have patriotic overtones. His political thoughts were initially influenced by the moderate Indian National Congress leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale, but later, he moved towards the more extremist Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He considered the Minto–Morley Reforms and the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms as inadequate, and supported greater political freedom. Several of his early works, such as &quot;A Little Trick&quot; and &quot;A Moral Victory&quot;, satirised the Indians who cooperated with the British Government. He did not specifically mention the British in some of his stories because of strong government censorship but disguised his opposition in settings from the medieval era and foreign history. He was also influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda.

In the 1920s, he was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation movement and the accompanying struggle for social reform. During this period, his works dealt with social issues such as poverty, zamindari exploitation (&quot;Premashram&quot;, 1922), dowry system (&quot;Nirmala&quot;, 1925), educational reform and political oppression (&quot;Karmabhoomi&quot;, 1931). Premchand was focused on the economic liberalisation of the peasantry and the working class and opposed rapid industrialisation, which he felt would hurt the interests of the peasants and lead to the oppression of the workers. This can be seen in works like &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot; (1924).

Premchand&#x27;s influence on Indian literature cannot be overstated. As the late scholar David Rubin wrote in &quot;The World of Premchand&quot; (1969), &quot;To Premchand belongs the distinction of creating the genre of the serious short story—and the serious novel as well—in both Hindi and Urdu. Virtually single-handed, he lifted fiction in these languages from a quagmire of aimless romantic chronicles to a high level of realistic narrative comparable to European fiction of the time; and in both languages, he has, in addition, remained an unsurpassed master.&quot;

In his last days, he focused on village life as a stage for complex drama, as seen in the novel &quot;Godaan&quot; (1936) and the short-story collection &quot;Kafan&quot; (1936). Premchand believed that social realism was the way for Hindi literature, as opposed to the &quot;feminine quality&quot;, tenderness and emotion of the contemporary Bengali literature.

== Legacy ==
Premchand was commemorated with the issue of a special 30-paise postage stamp by India Post on 31 July 1980.

Premchand&#x27;s ancestral house in Lamhi is being restored by the state government. An institute has also been set up in Lamhi to study his work. The Munshi Premchand Mahavidyalaya in Siliguri has been named after him.

An Archive Centre in the name of Munshi Premchand has been established at the Central University Jamia Millia Islamia. It came to store the legacy of Premchand&#x27;s writings as his famous story &#x27;Kafan&#x27; was written by him in Jamia itself and it was first published in &quot;&#x27;Jamia &quot;&#x27;.

On 31 July 2016, Google showed a Google Doodle in honouring the 136th birthday of Munshi Premchand.

== Adaptations of Premchand&#x27;s works ==

&quot;Sevasadanam&quot; (1938) was made into a film with M. S. Subbulakshmi in the lead role. The novel is set in Varanasi, the holy city of Hindus. &quot;Sevasadan&quot; (&quot;House of Service&quot;) is an institute built for the daughters of courtesans. The lead of the novel is a beautiful, intelligent and talented girl named Suman. She belongs to a high caste. She is married to a much older, tyrannical man. She realises that a loveless marriage is just like prostitution, except that there is only one client. Bholi, a courtesan, lives opposite Suman. Suman realises that Bholi is &quot;outside purdah&quot; while she is &quot;inside it&quot;. Suman leaves her husband and becomes a successful entertainer of gentlemen. But after a brief period of success, she ends up as a victim of a political drama played out by self-righteous Hindu social reformers and moralists.

A film version of Premchand&#x27;s novel, &quot;Gaban&quot;, was released in 1966. Sunil Dutt, Sadhana Shivdasani, Kanhaiyalal and Leela Mishra acted in the film and the music was scored by musician duo Shankar–Jaikishan. &quot;Heera Moti&quot;, a 1959 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Krishan Chopra, was based on Premchand&#x27;s &quot;Do Bailon ki Katha&quot;.

In 1977, Satyajit Ray made a film based on Premchand&#x27;s short story &quot;Shatranj ke Khiladi&quot; (&quot;The Chess Players&quot;), which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. The film revolves around the decadence of nawabi Lucknow, where the obsession with a game consumes the players, making them oblivious of their responsibilities in the midst of a crisis.

&quot;Oka Oori Katha&quot; (&quot;A Story of a Village&quot;) is a 1977 Telugu film directed by Mrinal Sen. It is based on the story &quot;Kafan&quot; by Munshi Premchand. It is one of the few art films made in the Telugu language.

Indian film director Satyen Bose adapted Premchand&#x27;s &quot;Panch Parmeshwar&quot; into the 1979 film &quot;Saanch Ko Aanch Nahin&quot;. &quot;Bazaar E Husn&quot;, a 2014 Indian Hindi-language film, was based on Premchand&#x27;s novel of the same name. A 2019 Indian film, &quot;Ek Betuke Aadmi Ki Afrah Raatein&quot;, was based on Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;White Nights&quot; and &quot;The Dream of a Ridiculous Man&quot;, and Premchand&#x27;s &quot;Bhoot&quot;.

At least three television series based on Premchand&#x27;s works have been aired by the Indian national public broadcaster Doordarshan on DD National which include &quot;Munshi Premchand&#x27;s Guldasta&quot;, &quot;Munshi Premchand ki Kahani&quot;, and &quot;Tehreer Munshi Premchand Ki&quot;. The television films &quot;Sadgati&quot; (based on a Premchand short story) and &quot;Seva Sadan&quot; (based on &quot;Bazaar-e-Husn&quot;) were also aired by Doordarshan.

<doc id="591676" wikidata="Q21057" url="?curid=591676" title="Gwichʼin language">
<text>The Gwichʼin language () belongs to the Athabaskan language family and is spoken by the Gwich&#x27;in First Nation (Canada) / Alaska Native People (United States). It is also known in older or dialect-specific publications as Kutchin, Takudh, Tukudh, or Loucheux. Gwich&#x27;in is spoken primarily in the towns of Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson (aka &quot;Teetł&#x27;it Zheh)&quot;, and Tsiigehtchic (formerly Arctic Red River), all in the Northwest Territories and Old Crow in Yukon of Canada. In Alaska of the United States, Gwichʼin is spoken in Beaver, Circle, Fort Yukon, Chalkyitsik, Birch Creek, Arctic Village, Eagle, and Venetie.

The ejective affricate in the name &quot;Gwichʼin&quot; is usually written with symbol , though the correct character for this use (with expected glyph and typographic properties) is .

== Current status ==
According to the UNESCO &quot;Interactive Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger,&quot; Gwichʼin is at present severely endangered. There are about 260 Gwichʼin speakers in Canada out of a total Gwichʼin population of 1,900. About 300 out of a total Alaska Gwichʼin population of 1,100 speak the language. Gwichʼin speakers have been shifting from their heritage language to English as the majority language of both the US and Canada.

===Dialects===
There are two main varieties of Gwichʼin, Eastern and Western, which are delineated roughly at the Canada–US border. There are several dialects within these subgroupings, including Fort Yukon Gwichʼin, Arctic Village Gwichʼin, Western Canada Gwichʼin (Takudh, Tukudh, Loucheux), and Arctic Red River. Each village has unique pronunciation features, vocabulary, and expressions. 

Inhabitants of Old Crow in the northern Yukon speak a similar dialect to those bands living in Venetie and Arctic Village, Alaska. Kâachik and Tâachik dialects are spoken in Johnson Creek village.

=== Language preservation and documentation ===
In 1988, the NWT Official Languages Act named Gwich&#x27;in an official language of the Northwest Territories, and the Official Languages of Alaska Law as amended declared Gwich&#x27;in a recognized language in 2014.

The Gwich&#x27;in language is taught regularly at the Chief Zzeh Gittlit School in Old Crow, Yukon.

Projects are underway to further document the language from a linguistic standpoint, and foster the writing and translation skills of younger Gwich&#x27;in speakers. In one project, lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwichʼin elder Kenneth Frank works with linguists and young Gwich&#x27;in speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy (Mishler and Frank 2020).

=== Residential schools and language decline ===
Assimilation efforts through residential schools played a factor in creating a cultural disruption and a language shift. One of the goals of residential schools was to wipe out indigenous culture and replace it with the European culture, seen as more conducive to “civilized” society. In the process, indigenous children were taken away from their families and placed in a dedicated school (“Indian Schools” in the US). 

Indigenous children were often punished for speaking First-Nation languages, leading children to abandon their heritage languages. Residential schools caused major cultural disruption also among the Gwich’in.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

The consonants of Gwichʼin are shown in IPA notation below, with orthographic symbols in brackets:

===Vowels===
Gwich’in has six phonemic vowel qualities which contrast in duration, nasality, and tones.
==== Allophonic variation ====
Short vowels show different vowel qualities from their long counterparts

* occurs as 
* occurs as 
* occurs as 
* occurs as 
* occurs as 

==== Tone and nasality ====
* Nasal vowels are marked with an ogonek, e.g. ‹ą į ǫǫ› for /ə̃́ ɪ̃́ ṍː/, respectively.
* Low tone is marked with a grave accent, e.g. [à], whereas high tones are never marked.

=== Syllable structure ===
Gwichʼin has moderate complexity of syllable structure, in which the maximal syllable shape is CCVC. However, no consonant clusters occur within a syllable besides /Cj/ onsets, as in /ɬjə̃́h/ &quot;łyąh&quot; “hook”, or -/tʰjɛ̀ʔ/ -&quot;tyèʼ&quot; “father” (i.e. /ʃɪ́tʰjɛ̀ʔ/ &quot;shityèʼ “&quot;my father”). Word-medially, two-consonant sequences may occur. All consonants may occur syllable-initially (i.e. in onset position), but syllable-finally, no ejective, retroflex, affricate, interdental or labialized consonants occur. In coda-position, fricatives are also restricted to the glottal, lateral, and non-sibilant consonants. 
== Written Gwichʼin ==
The missionary Robert McDonald first started working on the written representation of Van Tat and Dagoo dialects Gwichʼin. He also produced a Bible and a hymn book which was written in Gwichʼin in 1898. McDonald used English orthography as his model when representing Gwichʼin. This was unusual for missionaries at the time: other missionaries were translating the Bible from French into languages such as northern Slavey. After 1960, Wycliffe Bible translator Richard Mueller introduced a new modified spelling system. The purpose of his writing system was to better distinguish the sounds of the Gwichʼin language. Later on, Mueller&#x27;s writing system was officially adopted by the Yukon Territory. The new writing system helped expand the uses of the Gwichʼin language since speakers previously found the system for writing Gwichʼin less user friendly.

== Grammar ==
Gwich’in is a highly polysynthetic, head-marking language with extensive exclusive prefixal inflection. Word order is relatively flexible but generally follows a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) pattern. The language exhibits evidentiality and verbal inflection that conveys aspectual distinctions rather than tense. Gwich’in uses postpositions rather than prepositions. Like other Athabaskan languages, Gwich’in has classifier prefixes in verbs that indicate transitivity and valency changes. 

===Verb configuration===
A verb in Gwich’in contains a great number of smaller meaningful units or morphemes (e.g. in English &quot;un-spok-en&quot;) that combine to give the verb its intended meaning. A verb is composed of the stem preceded by a varying number of prefixes, which in Gwich’in contain information about tense, aspect, and the number of people involved in the action. 

Unlike English verbs, which come with comparatively very little derivation and inflection (i.e. number of affixes), a Gwich’in verb is so rich in affixes that a single inflected and conjugated verb can correspond to whole sentences in English, as in (1).

== In popular culture ==
In the PBS Kids television show Molly of Denali, the main character Molly comes from a family of Gwich&#x27;in background, and therefore uses words in the Gwich&#x27;in language such as &#x27;Mahsi&#x27; Choo&#x27; throughout the show. Molly shares her Gwich&#x27;in background with the show&#x27;s creative producer, Princess Daazhraii Johnson.

<doc id="591678" wikidata="Q1914250" url="?curid=591678" title="Nation of Domination">
<text>The Nation of Domination (NOD) was an American-Canadian professional wrestling faction who competed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from November 17, 1996 to November 28, 1998.

The group was formed by newcomer Faarooq in 1996 and remained an influencing faction in the company. While in the group, The Rock was a one-time Intercontinental Champion and D&#x27;Lo Brown was a two-time European Champion. Near the end of The Nation&#x27;s existence, the group was joined by Owen Hart.

== Concept ==
The group was based loosely on the Nation of Islam and street gang lifestyle (with group members adopting Islamic names and wearing Muslim headgear) and the Black Panther Party. The extremism of the group&#x27;s pro-black theme – often including the &quot;Nation Salute&quot; and Faarooq&#x27;s angry tirades on the microphone – garnered them an excessive amount of heat from fans in arenas.

== History ==
=== Formation in WWF (1996–1997) ===
The Nation of Domination heel faction formed in the WWF when wrestler Faarooq was joined by manager Clarence Mason. On the October 28, 1996 edition of Monday Night Raw, announcer Jim Ross revealed that Faarooq had taken Mason as his new manager after Ross recommended Mason&#x27;s services for a lawsuit against Ahmed Johnson. Ross noted the duo would appear on WWF Livewire that Saturday with &quot;big changes&quot; in store for Faarooq, meaning the dropping of his &quot;Roman gladiator&quot; gimmick. The two men were also accompanied by three actors, Albert Armstrong, Charles Hines, and Richard Beach, whose names were unacknowledged on screen and were supposed to represent other members of the Nation. Many wrestlers joined the heel stable over time including Crush, D&#x27;Lo Brown, and Savio Vega. Their first feud was with Ahmed Johnson, who had a rivalry with Faarooq since SummerSlam. At the Royal Rumble, the Nation assisted Faarooq during his match against Johnson. Faarooq lost by disqualification after Crush interfered and attacked Johnson.

Faarooq, Crush, and Vega were the members of Nation of Domination who wrestled while others supported them during their matches. These three men often teamed up together in six-man tag team matches such as one at In Your House 13: Final Four against Bart Gunn, Goldust, and Flash Funk and most notably in a Chicago Street Fight at WrestleMania 13 against the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and Ahmed Johnson. At A Cold Day In Hell, the Nation faced Johnson in a Gauntlet match. Johnson defeated Crush and Vega in the Gauntlet before losing to Faarooq.

=== Black Supremacy and The Gang Warz (1997–1998) ===
On the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Faarooq promised that he would deliver a &quot;Bigger, Badder, Better and Blacker&quot; version of the Nation, after &quot;firing&quot; Crush, Mason, and Savio Vega, retaining only Brown. This led to the induction of Kama Mustafa and Ahmed Johnson into the group after Johnson turned on then WWF Champion The Undertaker during a tag team match against Faarooq and Kama. Johnson would be forced out of the group due to a legit injury. He was replaced by Rocky Maivia. Meanwhile, former Nation members Vega and Crush formed their own rival factions, Los Boricuas (made up entirely of Puerto Rican wrestlers), and The Disciples of Apocalypse (made up entirely of white biker wrestlers) respectively. This led to a WWF style &quot;gang war&quot;.

In the following months, the Nation feuded with Los Boricuas and the Disciples of Apocalypse. This feud culminated in a triple threat match between Faarooq, Vega, and Crush who were the leaders of Nation, Los Boricuas, and DOA respectively at Ground Zero, which Vega won. They restarted their feud with the Legion of Doom, whom the Nation defeated at Badd Blood: In Your House in a 3-on-2 handicap match. As part of his heel turn, Rocky Maivia shortened and changed his ring name to The Rock. Around this time, Ahmed Johnson restarted the feud with the Nation as well and joined the Legion of Doom and Ken Shamrock. This led to a Survivor Series match at Survivor Series, which the Nation lost to the Legion of Doom, Johnson, and Shamrock. At D-Generation X: In Your House, The Rock got a shot at the Intercontinental Championship against Stone Cold Steve Austin. In the closing minutes of the match, Austin performed a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; on the referee. A second referee came down to count a pin for Austin, although the first referee intended to disqualify Austin.

As a result of this controversy, Austin was forced to defend the title against The Rock the next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. Rock was awarded the Intercontinental Championship, however, after Austin forfeited him the title instead of defending the title in a rematch, delivering a stunner on Rock and took the championship belt back afterward. Austin appeared the next week on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, taunting Rock and eventually throwing the Intercontinental Championship belt over a bridge, into a river. Ken Shamrock, who was already a rival of the Nation, began feuding with The Rock for the Intercontinental Championship. On the January 12, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Mark Henry turned heel and joined the Nation, by assaulting his tag team partner, Ken Shamrock, in a tag team match against The Rock and D&#x27;Lo Brown.

=== Leadership of The Rock (1998) ===
On the March 30, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the night after WrestleMania XIV, The Rock went on to usurp leadership of the Nation from Faarooq, at which point the group permanently dropped &quot;of Domination&quot; from its name and its militant focus. Instead, The Rock&#x27;s gimmick spread throughout the faction with Nation members taking on considerably more hip characters, the most notable being Kama Mustafa&#x27;s transformation into The Godfather, D&#x27;Lo Brown&#x27;s &quot;bobble-head&quot; and strut, and a new hip version of the group&#x27;s entrance theme, that would become associated with The Rock&#x27;s character and be remixed over and over during the years to become his current theme. The Nation&#x27;s primary focus by now was that The Rock retained the Intercontinental title &quot;by any means necessary&quot;, which was the group&#x27;s motto. They mainly feuded with Faarooq, who had just been kicked out of the stable. At Mayhem in Manchester, The Rock and D&#x27;Lo Brown lost to Ken Shamrock and Owen Hart. At , The Nation lost to Shamrock, Faarooq, and Steve Blackman in a six-man tag team match. On the April 27 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, The Rock and Mark Henry faced Shamrock and Hart in a tag team match that saw Hart attacking Shamrock and joining the Nation.

The group then engaged in a rivalry with D-Generation X (DX), which saw the infamous parody DX performed in which they spoofed Nation members; Rock thoroughly humiliating Chyna by alluding to a possible romantic encounter between the two while the rest of DX were held at bay in their locker room by a forklift; a street fight between the two groups that wound up in Triple H being, in particular, singled out by the rest of the group and being beaten down with a ladder after Southern Justice interfered with the match on the Nation&#x27;s behalf; the ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship between the two at SummerSlam; and X-Pac and Brown trading back and forth the European Championship. The Nation and DX also wrestled in a six-man tag team match at Over the Edge: In Your House, which the Nation won.

=== Fall of Nation (1998) ===
Toward the end of the year, the group showed signs of dissension as Rock&#x27;s mannerisms and swagger began to catch on with fans. This would lead the WWF to turn The Rock face. Hart left the group when he &quot;injured&quot; Dan Severn following a botched reverse piledriver on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; the night after . The incident was a mimicry of the legit incident in which Hart injured Stone Cold Steve Austin using the same move a year earlier. The guilt from the injury to Severn led Hart to &quot;retire&quot;, but then re-surface as The Blue Blazer, effectively ending his affiliation with the Nation. The Godfather would venture out on his own as a fan favorite, bringing with him a bevy of beauties to the ring before his match with any wrestler. Rock would later be assaulted by Brown and Henry in October 1998 which would ultimately be the end of the Nation as a faction. After kicking Godfather out of the group on the &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; episode before Judgment Day: In Your House, Brown and Henry briefly continued using the Nation name, a modified Titantron, and music until dropping all three by year&#x27;s end as they moved on to the tag team division without the Nation moniker.

== Aftermath ==
Shortly after the Nation was disbanded, The Rock decided to run solo, riding his immense rise in popularity. He won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series and turned heel again by joining Mr. McMahon&#x27;s Corporation faction. He would subsequently enjoy several years of success, not just in the world of wrestling, but also in Hollywood. He retired from professional wrestling in 2019. Owen Hart would go on to form a successful tag team with Jeff Jarrett, and later revive his Blue Blazer character before his death in May 1999.

D&#x27;Lo Brown and Mark Henry would remain a tag team following the dissolution of the Nation, enjoying moderate success. After Brown attempted to help Henry lose weight, Henry turned on Brown in the summer of 1999, ending the final remnants of the Nation of Domination. Brown would eventually hold both the Intercontinental and European titles at the height of his popularity. Henry would form his &quot;Sexual Chocolate&quot; character and would later be awarded the European Championship by Jeff Jarrett later that year. Henry would also go onto win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship later in his career. The Nation had something of a reunion in late 1999 when D&#x27;Lo realigned himself with The Godfather, imitating his pimp gimmick. This alliance lasted all the way into early 2000, when D&#x27;Lo turned on The Godfather, thus ending the tag team. The Godfather would later win the Intercontinental and World Tag Team Championships in the following years.

Former leader Faarooq would also find success after the group&#x27;s dissolution, going on to form the highly popular tag team the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) with Bradshaw. The APA would later win the World Tag Team Championship three times before disbanding in 2004.

As of now, The Rock, Faarooq, and Godfather are the only former members still employed by the WWE. Rock is signed on a part-time basis, while also being one of the highest paid movie stars in the world, Faarooq makes occasional appearances under his real name of Ron Simmons since his 2004 retirement, and Godfather was released in 2002 and retired to manage a gentleman&#x27;s club; he still occasionally makes guest appearances in WWE. Brown was released by WWE in 2003, but was rehired in 2008; he was let go once again the following year. Faarooq, Godfather and Henry were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2012, 2016, and 2018 respectively.

==Reunion==
Qatar Pro Wrestling announced on April 26, 2021 that Henry, Brown, Godfather and Faarooq will be reprising their roles as the Nation of Domination in the upcoming QPW SuperSlam 3 in Doha on February 26, 2022 as special guests. This will be the first reunion in 22 years.

<text>A World Rally Car is a racing automobile built to the specific regulations set by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) and designed for competition in the World Rally Championship (WRC). The cars were introduced in 1997 as a replacement for Group A regulations used in the manufacturers&#x27; championship, and were replaced by Group Rally1 in 2022.

==Regulations==
===1997–2010===

Between 1997 and 2010, the regulations mandated that World Rally Cars must have been built upon a production car with a minimum production run of 2500 units. A number of modifications could be made including increasing the engine displacement up to 2.0L, forced induction (including an anti-lag system), addition of four wheel drive, fitment of a sequential gearbox, modified suspension layout and attachment points, aerodynamic body modifications, weight reduction to a minimum of 1230 kg and chassis strengthening for greater rigidity. The maximum width was set at 1770 mm while front and rear tracks shouldn&#x27;t exceed 1550 mm.

Unlike the requirements for the preceding Group A cars, manufacturers were no longer required to build &quot;homologation specials&quot; in order to meet approval. The base model did not need to have all the characteristics of the WRC car, as evidenced from cars such the Peugeot 206, 307, Citroën Xsara, and Škoda Fabia, which during this period had no road car variant with a turbocharged petrol engine or four-wheel-drive.

To limit power, all forced induction cars were fitted with a 34 mm diameter air restrictor before the turbocharger inlet, limiting the airflow to about 10 cubic meters per minute. The restriction was intended to limit power output to although some WRC engines were believed to produce around . Engine development did not focus on peak power output but towards producing a very wide powerband (or power curve). Typically, power output in excess of was available from 3000 rpm to the 7500 rpm maximum, with a peak of at around 5500 rpm. At 2000 rpm (the engine idle speed in &quot;stage&quot; mode) power output was slightly above .

By 2004, the best cars had ABS, electronic clutch control, paddle-shift, traction control, three active differentials, ride height control with GPS, electronic dampers and active suspension.

For 2005 the maximum width of the WRC cars was increased from 1770 mm to 1800 mm.

In an attempt to cut costs, since 2006 new regulations required mechanical front and rear differentials, while the central differential remained active. Active suspension and water injections were also prohibited. Cars entered by a manufacturer had to be equipped with the same engine for two rallies; further limitations were imposed on the changing of some parts, including suspension, steering, turbochargers, and gearboxes.

===2011–2016===
Starting in 2011, rules for WRC cars changed to be more restrictive. New regulations were derived from Super 2000 cars with a different aerodynamic kit. The cars could be smaller models (there was no longer a minimum 4 m length) and include a custom-build or production 1600 cm3 direct injection turbo-charged global race engine with a diameter air restrictor and a maximum boost pressure of absolute. This limited torque to about or less).

Exotic materials (titanium, magnesium, ceramics and composite) were forbidden except when present in the base model. Carbon fibre and aramid fibre were very restricted (&quot;only one layer of fabric is used and is affixed to the visible face of the part&quot;), except for bodywork&#x27;s side protections where multiple layers of aramid fibre were allowed.

The gear changes must be made with a mechanical linkage system, so paddle-shifters were outlawed. However the system was re-allowed in 2015. There was no center differential (earlier it used to be 3 differentials, with a center/3rd differential included), but the new regulation allows the only front and rear axle differential and a mechanical clutch to disconnect the rear axle during handbrake use (to reduce cost and make the cars&#x27; driving style more exciting again for both spectators and TV broadcasts). These two differentials must be mechanical, without electronic control or hydraulic or viscous systems (from 2006 to 2010 the center differential and previously all three could be active).

The minimum weight was 1200 kg empty and 1350 kg (1360 kg from 2013) with driver and co-driver (in both cases when measured with only one spare wheel).

=== 2017–2021 ===
The 1.6 L turbo-charged global race engine was retained in the 2017 World Rally Car regulations, but the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine&#x27;s power output from . The minimum empty vehicle weight was decreased by 10 kg but the combined vehicle, crew and spare wheel weight remained at 1360 kg.

Manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, including large brake cooling ducts in fairings forming enlarged wheel arches. Electronically controlled active centre differentials were permitted, while the front and rear differentials remain mechanical.

While 2011 specification World Rally Cars were allowed to compete in 2017, the new World Rally Cars were allowed for use by manufacturers&#x27; teams only.

<text>Group A is a set of motorsport regulations administered by the FIA covering production derived touring cars for competition, usually in touring car racing and rallying. In contrast to the short-lived Group B and Group C, Group A vehicles were limited in terms of power, weight, allowed technology and overall cost. Group A was aimed at ensuring numerous entries in races of privately owned vehicles.

Group A was introduced by the FIA in 1982 to replace the outgoing Group 2 as &quot;modified touring cars&quot;, while Group N would replace Group 1 as &quot;standard touring cars&quot;. During the early years there were no further formula for production based race cars. Cars from multiple Groups could contest the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers for example until 1997 when the specific World Rally Car formula was introduced as the only option. In recent years Groups A and N have begun to be phased out in eligibility in championships though they continue to form the homologation basis for most production based race car formulae including the Groups Rally which must first be homologated in Group A. Both Groups N and A, and the details of their differences are described in the FIAs International Sporting Code and several of its Appendices J articles.

==Homologation==
To qualify for FIA approval, 2,500 identical models have to be built in 12 consecutive months. The homologation period lasts for every subsequent year of production and seven years after the year that less than 10% (250) are produced in one year and the model is considered out of production by the FIA. Evolutions of the series production model homologated are permitted with a ET (Evolution of the type) extension applied. Before 1993 the initial production requirement was 5000.

However, not all manufacturers who built such models sold them all, some stripped the majority of them to rebuild them as stock models or used them to allow teams to use modified parts. One such example of this was Volvo with the 240 Turbo in 1985, an evolution of a model first homologated in 1982. After they had produced 500 such models, Volvo stripped 477 cars of their competition equipment and sold them as standard 240 turbo roadcars. As a result, after FISA&#x27;s failed attempt at finding an &quot;Evolution&quot; car in any European countries, Volvo were forced to reveal the names of all 500 &quot;evo&quot; owners to be permitted to compete. 


==Touring car racing==

For touring car competition, vehicles such as the BMW 635 CSi and M3, Jaguar XJS, various turbo Ford Sierras the V8 Ford Mustang, the turbo Volvo 240T, Rover Vitesse, various V8 Holden Commodores, various turbo Nissan Skylines, including the 4WD, twin turbo GT-R, Mitsubishi Starion Turbo, Alfa Romeo 75 (turbo) and GTV6, various Toyota Corollas and the Toyota Supra Turbo A were homologated. In the European Touring Car Championship, Group A consisted of three divisions, Division 3 – for cars over 2500cc, Division 2 – for car engine sizes of 1600–2500cc, Division 1 for cars that are less than 1600cc. These cars competed in standard bodykits, with the production-derived nature required manufactures to release faster vehicles for the roads in order to be competitive on the track. Tyre width was dependent on the car&#x27;s engine size.

The FIA continued to promulgate regulations for Group A touring cars until at least 1993, however Group A survived in touring car racing in domestic championships until 1993. The German Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) switched to a 2.5L Class 1 formula in 1993, while in Japan in 1994 the Japanese Touring Car Championship organisers followed suit and switched classes like most other countries who had adopted the British Touring Car Championship-derived Supertouring regulations. Many of the redundant Skylines found a new home in the form of the JGTC (Japanese GT Championship) with modified aerodynamic devices, showing its competitiveness whilst being up against Group C, former race modified roadcars and specially developed racers, like the Toyota Supras during the earlier years.

The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport had originally announced in mid-1983 that Australia would adopt Group A from 1 January 1985 to replace the locally developed Group C (not to be confused with FIA Group C racing cars) rules that had been in place since 1973. A class for the new Group A cars was included in selected Australian Touring Car endurance races in late 1984, prior to the replacement of Group C for 1985. The category would be officially termed Group 3A Touring Cars from 1988. From 1993, CAMS replaced the existing Group A-based category with a new formula which would also be designated Group 3A Touring Cars. This was initially open to five litre V8 powered cars and two litre cars (later to become known as V8 Supercars and Super Touring Cars respectively).

Hillclimb competitions still use Group A as a touring car class across Europe, while in Australia Group A is now a historic class, though only actual cars raced from 1985 to 1992 (complete with log books) are allowed to compete.

==Rallying==
Under Group A in the World Rally Championship, the cars used were modified road cars, often based on turbocharged, four wheel drive versions of small cars such as the Lancia Delta Integrale, Ford Escort RS Cosworth, Toyota Celica GT-Four, Nissan Pulsar GTI-R, Subaru Impreza WRX, Mazda 323 GT-R and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.

The cars are modified for greater power and torque, and fitted with suspension and tyres specifically suited to the conditions of the specific rally, which may take place entirely on asphalt roads, different consistencies of gravel and dirt roads and even snow/ice-covered roads on some rallies held in northern Europe.

By 1990, Group A cars exceeded the performance of the defunct Group B cars on many events, because although they had far less power they had better handling and traction. They were also much safer.

Group A is still used as the basis for most rally competitions around the world, but the most competitive cars are limited-production prototypes, known as kit cars (which competed in the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup), World Rally Cars, Super 1600 and Super 2000.

The last car to use the old Group A homologation requirement in the WRC Manufacturers&#x27; championship was the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI. Group A cars could continue to enter WRC rallies until 2018 and can still enter the FIA&#x27;s regional rally championships today.

<doc id="591685" wikidata="Q2261503" url="?curid=591685" title="Grógaldr">
<text>Grógaldr or The Spell of Gróa is the first of two Old Norse poems, now commonly published under the title &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot; found in several 17th-century paper manuscripts with &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. In at least three of these manuscripts, the poems are in reverse order and separated by a third eddic poem titled, &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. For a long time, the connection between the two poems was not realized, until in 1854 Svend Grundtvig pointed out a connection between the story told in &quot;Gróagaldr&quot; and the first part of the medieval Scandinavian ballad of &quot;Ungen Sveidal&quot;/&quot;Herr Svedendal&quot;/&quot;Hertig Silfverdal&quot; (TSB A 45, DgF 70, SMB 18, NMB 22). Then in 1856, Sophus Bugge noticed that the last part of the ballad corresponded to &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. Bugge wrote about this connection in &quot;Forhandlinger i Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiania 1860&quot;, calling the two poems together &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot;. Subsequent scholars have accepted this title.

&quot;Grógaldr&quot; is one of six eddic poems involving necromantic practice. It details Svipdagr&#x27;s raising of his mother Groa, a völva, from the dead. Before her death, she requested him to do so if he ever required her help; the prescience of the völva is illustrated in this respect. The purpose of this necromancy was that she could assist her son in a task set him by his cunning stepmother. Svipdag&#x27;s mother, Gróa, has been identified as the same völva who chanted a piece of Hrungnir&#x27;s hone from Thor&#x27;s head after their duel, as detailed in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. There, Gróa is the wife of Aurvandil, a man Thor rescues from certain death on his way home from Jötunheim. The news of her husband&#x27;s fate makes Gróa so happy, she forgets the charm, leaving the hone firmly lodged in Thor&#x27;s forehead.

In the first stanza of this poem Svipdag speaks and bids his mother to arise from beyond the grave, at her burial mound, as she had bidden him do in life. The second stanza contains her response, in which she asks Svipdag why he has awakened her from death.

He responds by telling her of the task he has been set by his stepmother, i.e. to win the hand of Menglöð. He is all too aware of the difficulty of this: he presages this difficulty by stating that:

:&quot;she bade me travel to a place
:where travel one cannot
:to meet with fair Menglöð&quot;

His dead mother agrees with him that he faces a long and difficult journey but does not attempt to dissuade him from it.

Svipdag then requests his mother to cast spells for his protection.

Groa then casts nine spells, or incantations.

<text>Upton Park is a London Underground station on Green Street in the Upton Park area of the London Borough of Newham, east London. It is served by the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines between Plaistow and East Ham stations. It is located in Zone 3.

The station was opened by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) in 1877. District line service began in 1902, and the Hammersmith &amp; City (at that time the Metropolitan line) followed in 1936. LTSR services were withdrawn in 1962. The station has two working platforms, one for each direction. Two other platforms used to serve the LTSR but are now disused.

Nowadays, the station serves Queens Road Market and Green Street.

==History==
Upton Park was the first station on the LT&amp;SR to be built by a property developer. Read was a developer who proposed the station and given approval designed and built a two platform station between the houses of Queen&#x27;s Road and Harold Road. The station fronted Queen&#x27;s Square on the corner of Green Street and Queen&#x27;s Road opened in September 1877. The building was demolished in 1903/04 when the line was quadrupled and the present station was constructed.

Upton Park tube station appears in the English slang term, &quot;He/She is Upton Park - two stops short of Barking&quot;, indicating that the individual in question is slightly mad.

==Services==
The service frequency is 15 services per hour on the District line and 6 services per hour on the Hammersmith &amp; City line.

==Connections==

London Buses routes 58, 104, 330 and 376 serve the station.

==Facilities==

There are two ticket office windows, two touch screen ticket machines, and three of the more traditional coin-only button machines.

At present there are no lifts at the station for disabled access, nor are there plans to install any.

==Trivia==

* The station previously served as the local station for the Boleyn Ground, the home ground of West Ham United football club. However, this changed when in Summer 2016, West Ham United moved to the Olympic Stadium.

<doc id="591689" wikidata="Q1537159" url="?curid=591689" title="First Battle of Fallujah">
<text>The First Battle of Fallujah, code-named Operation Vigilant Resolve, was an American-led operation of the Iraq War against militants in Fallujah as well as an attempt to apprehend or kill the perpetrators of the killing of four U.S. contractors in March 2004.

The chief catalyst for the operation was the highly publicized killing and mutilation of four Blackwater USA private military contractors, and the killings of five American soldiers in Habbaniyah a few days earlier.

The battle, and especially the images of Iraqi civilians killed or injured in the fighting, caused many Iraqis to become resentful of the US presence. Western journalists found that even some Iraqis who previously supported the US invasion, and welcomed American state-building efforts, became increasingly alienated and skeptical of such promises.

==Background==

Fallujah had generally benefited economically under Saddam Hussein, and many residents were employed as military and intelligence officers by his administration. However, there was little sympathy for him following the collapse of his government, which many residents considered oppressive. The city was one of the most religious and culturally traditional areas in Iraq.

Following the collapse of the Ba&#x27;ath infrastructure in early 2003, local residents had elected a town council led by Taha Bidaywi Hamed, who kept the city from falling into the control of looters and common criminals. The town council and Hamed were both considered to be nominally pro-American, and their election originally meant that the United States had decided that the city was unlikely to become a hotbed of activity, and didn&#x27;t require any immediate troop presence. This led to the United States committing few troops to Fallujah from the start.

Although Fallujah had seen sporadic air strikes by American forces, public opposition was not galvanized until 700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division first entered the city on 23 April 2003, and approximately 150 members of Charlie Company occupied &quot;al-Qa&#x27;id&quot; primary. On 28 April, a crowd of approximately 200 people gathered outside the school past curfew, demanding that the Americans vacate the building and allow it to re-open as a school. The protesters became increasingly heated, and the deployment of smoke gas canisters failed to disperse the crowd. The protest escalated as gunmen reportedly fired upon U.S. forces from the protesting crowd and U.S. Army soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division returned fire, killing 17 people and wounding more than 70 of the protesters. There were no U.S. Army or coalition casualties in the incident. U.S. forces said that the shooting took place over 30–60 seconds, however other sources claim the shooting continued for half an hour.

Two days later, a protest at the former Ba&#x27;ath party headquarters decrying the American shootings was also fired upon by U.S. forces, this time the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which resulted in three more deaths. Following both incidents, coalition forces asserted that they had not fired upon the protesters until they were fired upon first.

The 82nd Airborne soldiers were replaced by soldiers from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and 2/502nd Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. On 4 June, members of B Company (&quot;Renegades&quot;), 2/502nd, came under attack after a presence patrol on foot. An RPG round struck the lead vehicle as these soldiers mounted vehicles to return to base; PFC Brandon Oberleitner was killed and six were injured. Oberleitner&#x27;s death was the only loss of life for B. Co. during the deployment. Soon after this attack, the 3rd Armored Cavalry requested an additional 1,500 troops, to counter growing resistance in Fallujah and nearby Habbaniyah.

In June, American forces began confiscating motorcycles from local residents, claiming that they were being used in hit-and-run attacks on coalition forces.

On 30 June, a large explosion occurred in a mosque in which the imam, Sheikh Laith Khalil and eight other people were killed. While the local population claimed that Americans had fired a missile at the mosque, U.S. forces claimed that it was an accidental detonation by insurgents constructing bombs.

On 12 February 2004, insurgents attacked a convoy carrying General John Abizaid, commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, and the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s Major General Charles Swannack, firing on the vehicles from nearby rooftops with RPGs, after seemingly infiltrating the Iraqi security forces.

Eleven days later, insurgents diverted Iraqi police to a false emergency on the outskirts of the city, before simultaneously attacking three police stations, the mayor&#x27;s office and a civil defence base. At least 17 police officers were killed, and as many as 87 prisoners released.

During this time, the 82nd Airborne was conducting regular &quot;lightning raids&quot; inside the city, where Humvee convoys would destroy road barriers and curbs that could hide IEDs, and oversee searches of homes and schools, which frequently saw property damage, and led to shoot-outs with local residents.

In March 2004, Swannack transferred authority of the Al-Anbar province to the I Marine Expeditionary Force commanded by Lt. General Conway.

By early March 2004, the city began to fall under the increasing influence of guerrilla factions. The rising violence against the American presence resulted in the complete withdrawal of troops from the city, with only occasional incursions trying to gain and reinforce a &quot;foothold in the city&quot; being attempted. This was coupled with one or two patrols around the outer limits of FOB Volturno, the former site of Qusay and Uday Hussein&#x27;s palace.

On 27 March, a JSOC surveillance team was compromised in the town and had to shoot its way out of trouble.

On the morning of 31 March, a combat engineer team from the 1st Engineer Battalion/1st Infantry Division was sent out on a route clearance mission in support of the 82nd Airborne and Blackwater movements. While en route from Habbaniyah to Fallujah, they were hit with the largest roadside bomb used at that point in the war, resulting in the deaths of 5 Bravo Company soldiers.

== Blackwater deaths ==
On 31 March 2004, Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy containing four American private military contractors from Blackwater USA who were conducting delivery for food caterers ESS.

The four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, were killed by machine gun fire and a grenade thrown through a window of their SUVs. A mob then set their bodies ablaze, and their corpses were dragged through the streets before being hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The insurgents provided images to news agencies for broadcast worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States. An announcement of an upcoming &quot;pacification&quot; of the city promptly followed.

The intended Marine Corps strategy of foot patrols, less aggressive raids, humanitarian aid, and close cooperation with local leaders was suspended on orders to mount a military operation to clear guerrillas from Fallujah.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was originally suspected as the organizer of the ambush as he was known to be planning attacks and believed to be in the area. The intelligence community was doubtful, however, because the exhibitionism of broadcasting images of the desecration of the victim&#x27;s bodies was uncharacteristic of al-Zarqawi, whose typical style was to leak to Al Jazeera that he had planned an attack some weeks after it occurred. Intelligence reports ultimately concluded that Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi was the mastermind behind the attack. By September 2004, al-Zarqawi was the &quot;highest priority&quot; target in Fallujah for the United States military; he died in a targeted killing in June 2006 when a United States Air Force jet dropped two 500-pound (230 kg) guided bombs on the safehouse in which he was attending a meeting.

al-Isawi was also an important target, whose attacks continued until a 2009 SEAL special operation raid captured him without a shot being fired. He made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing courts-martial against three Navy SEALs (all of whom were acquitted). Subsequently, he was handed over to Iraqi authorities, who tried and executed him by hanging at some point before November 2013.

==Campaign==
On 1 April, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of U.S. military operations in Iraq, promised an &quot;overwhelming&quot; response to the Blackwater USA deaths, stating &quot;We will pacify that city.&quot;

On 3 April 2004, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force received a written command from the Joint Task Force, ordering offensive operations against Fallujah. This order went against the wishes of the Marine Commanders on the ground who wanted to conduct surgical strikes and raids against those suspected of involvement in the Blackwater deaths.

On the night of 4 April 2004, American forces launched a major assault in an attempt to &quot;re-establish security in Fallujah&quot; by encircling it with around 2000 troops. At least four homes were hit in aerial strikes, and there was sporadic gunfire throughout the night.

By the morning of 5 April 2004, headed by the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, American units had surrounded the city with an aim towards retaking it. American troops blockaded roads leading into the city with Humvees and concertina wire. They also took over a local radio station and handed out leaflets urging residents to remain inside their homes and help American forces identify insurgents and any Fallujans who were involved in the Blackwater deaths.

It was estimated that there were 12–24 separate &quot;hardcore&quot; groups of insurgents, armed with RPGs, machine guns, mortars and anti-aircraft weapons, some of it supplied by the Iraqi Police. By 6 April 2004, U.S. military sources said that &quot;Marines may not attempt to control the center of the town&quot;.

In the opening days, it was reported that up to a third of the civilian population had fled the city.

The siege forced the closing of Fallujah&#x27;s two main hospitals, Fallujah General Hospital and the Jordanian Hospital, which were re-opened during the ceasefire on 9 April 2004. Also on that date, the port visit to Jebel Ali by the aircraft carrier was cancelled, and the &quot;George Washington&quot; carrier strike group and its embarked Carrier Air Wing Seven were ordered to remain on station in the Persian Gulf as fighting intensified between Coalition Forces and Iraqi insurgents around Fallujah.

The resulting engagements set off widespread fighting throughout Central Iraq and along the Lower Euphrates, with various elements of the Iraqi insurgency taking advantage of the situation and commencing simultaneous operations against the Coalition forces. This period marked the emergence of the Mahdi Army, the militia of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, as a major armed faction which, at that time, actively participated in anti-Coalition operations. The happenings were also punctuated by a surge of a Sunni rebellion in the city of Ramadi. During this period, a number of foreigners were captured by insurgent groups. Some were killed outright, whilst others were held as hostages in an attempt to barter for political or military concessions. Some elements of the Iraqi police and Iraqi Civil Defense Corps also turned on the Coalition forces or simply abandoned their posts.

The rebels in Fallujah held on, as the Americans attempted to tighten their hold on the city. Air bombardments rained on insurgent positions throughout the city, Lockheed AC-130 gunships attacked targets with their Gatling guns and howitzers a number of times. Scout Snipers became a core element of the Marines&#x27; strategy, with reports claiming that some had killed up to 31 insurgents. Tactical Psychological Operations Detachment 910 conducted psychological warfare in support of Marine units during the battle, reportedly blaring Metallica over their loud speakers to weaken insurgents&#x27; morale.

Due to the fact that American attacks were taking a toll on civilians as well as Iraqi insurgents, coalition forces faced growing criticism from within the Iraqi Governing Council, where Adnan Pachachi said, &quot;these operations by the Americans are unacceptable and illegal.&quot;

Al-Jazeera reporter Ahmed Mansur, and cameraman Laith Mushtaq, the only two non-embedded journalists covering the conflict since 3 April 2004, reported that an unknown source stated that United States insisted that the reporters be withdrawn from the city, as a pre-condition to the ceasefire.

At noon on 9 April 2004, under pressure from the Governing Council, Paul Bremer announced that the U.S. forces would be unilaterally holding a ceasefire, stating that they wanted to facilitate negotiations between the Iraqi Governing Council, insurgents, and city spokespersons, and to allow government supplies to be delivered to residents.

As a consequence, much-needed humanitarian relief which had been held up by the fighting and blockade finally managed to enter the city, notably a major convoy organized by private citizens, businessmen and clerics from Baghdad as a joint Shi&#x27;a-Sunni effort. Some U.S. forces used this time to occupy and scavenge abandoned houses and convert them into &quot;de facto&quot; bunkers, while a number of insurgents did the same.

At this point, it was estimated that 600 Iraqis had been killed, at least half of whom were non-combatants.
Although hundreds of insurgents had been killed in the assault, the city remained firmly under their control. American forces had by then only managed to gain a foothold in the industrial district to the south of the city. The end of major operations for the time being led to negotiations between various Iraqi elements and the Coalition forces, punctuated by occasional firefights.

On 12 April 2004, two U.S. Marines (Robert Zurheide and Brad Shuder) along with an ally interpreter were killed in a friendly fire mortar mission at a schoolhouse in Fallujah.

On 13 April 2004, U.S. Marines fell under attack from insurgents located within a mosque. An airstrike destroyed the mosque, prompting a public outcry.

On 15 April 2004, an American F-16 Fighting Falcon dropped a JDAM GPS guided bomb over the northern district of Fallujah.

On 19 April 2004, the ceasefire seemed to be consolidated with a plan to reintroduce joint US/Iraqi patrols in the city. Over time this arrangement broke down and the city remained a major center of opposition to the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government. Additionally, the composition of the armed groups in Fallujah changed during the following months, shifting from domination by secular, nationalist and ex-Ba&#x27;athist groups towards a marked influence of warlords with ties to organized crime and groups following a radical Wahhabi stance.

On 27 April 2004, insurgents attacked U.S. defensive positions, causing the Americans to call in air support. In response, on 28 April 2004, the aircraft carrier launched squadrons VFA-136, VFA-131, VFA-11, and VFA-143 to fly combat air sorties against insurgents in Fallujah. During this operation, aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Seven dropped 13 GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs on insurgent positions and also provided combat air support to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.

===US withdrawal===

On 1 May 2004, the United States withdrew from Fallujah, as Lieutenant General James Conway announced that he had unilaterally decided to turn over any remaining operations to the newly formed Fallujah Brigade - a Sunni security force formed by the CIA, which would be armed with U.S. weapons and equipment under the command of former Ba&#x27;athist Army General Jasim Mohammed Saleh. Several days later, when it became clear that Saleh had been involved in military actions against Shi&#x27;ites under Saddam Hussein, U.S. forces announced that Muhammed Latif would instead lead the brigade. Nevertheless, the group dissolved and had turned over all the supplied weapons to the insurgency by September. The Brigade soldiers declared loyalty to the insurgents and joined various jihadist and nationalist groups that vied for authority in the town.

The loss of the Fallujah Brigade prompted the Second Battle of Fallujah in November that year. After intense fighting, the Americans successfully occupied the city.

During the interim period between the two battles, U.S. forces maintained a presence at Camp Baharia, a few miles outside the city limits.

==Legacy==
The largest combat mission since the declaration of the end of &quot;major hostilities&quot;, the First Battle of Fallujah marked a turning point in public perception of the ongoing conflict. This was because insurgents, rather than Saddam loyalists, were seen as the chief opponents of U.S. forces. It was also judged by both military and civilian agencies, that reliance upon U.S.-funded regional militias, such as the failed Fallujah Brigade, could prove disastrous. American strategists were mercurial about the outcome of the battle with one writing &quot;the handwriting is on the wall. The Battle of Fallujah was not a defeat—but we cannot afford many more victories like it.&quot;

The battle also pushed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi into the public spotlight as the best-known commander of anti-Coalition forces in Iraq, and brought public attention to the concept of a Sunni Triangle.

27 U.S. servicemen were killed during the battle in Fallujah. Iraq Body Count estimated that around 800 Iraqis died in the battle as well, of which 572–616 were civilians and 184–228 insurgents. Many of the Iraqis killed were buried inside the city&#x27;s former football stadium, which became known as the Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery.

<text>Luboš Kohoutek (; 29 January 1935 – 30 December 2023) was a Czech astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets and comets, including Comet Kohoutek which was visible to the naked eye in 1973.
He also discovered a large number of planetary nebulae.

==Biography==
Kohoutek was born on 29 January 1935 to Hynek and Jarmila Kohoutek. His brother was the Czech composer Ctirad Kohoutek.

Kohoutek was interested in astronomy since high school. He studied physics and astronomy at universities in Brno and Prague (finished 1958). Then he started to work in the Astronomical Institute of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, where he published a well-cited catalogue (&quot;Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae&quot;, 1967). Kohoutek obtained a long term position at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg. After the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia (1968) he decided to stay in West Germany (1970). His discoveries in the 1970s made him well-known in the media. In later years, Kohoutek worked in observatories in Spain and Chile, studying planetary nebulae. He officially retired in 2001, yet kept researching at the Hamburg-Bergedorf Observatory. Kohoutek published 162 scientific works.

Kohoutek is most famous for his discovery of numerous comets, including periodic comets 75D/Kohoutek and 76P/West–Kohoutek–Ikemura, as well as the famously disappointing &quot;Comet Kohoutek&quot; (C/1973 E1).

Kohoutek also discovered numerous asteroids, including the Apollo asteroid 1865 Cerberus. The main-belt asteroid 1850 Kohoutek was named after him.

Kohoutek died on 30 December 2023, at the age of 88.

==Discoveries==
Kohoutek discovered supernova SN 1973f, 5 comets, and 76 minor planets.

<text>Barry Buchanan (born January 15, 1968) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (WWF/WWE) under the ring names Recon, Bull Buchanan and B² and for his appearances with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah (NOAH) as Buchanan. Primarily a tag team wrestler, Buchanan is a former WWF World Tag Team Champion, All Asia Tag Team Champion, GHC Tag Team Champion and USWA World Tag Team Champion.

== Professional wrestling career ==

===Early career (1995)===
Buchanan was trained to wrestle by James Hammonds. He debuted in 1995, wrestling on the North Georgia independent circuit as &quot;The Punisher&quot;. Buchanan formed a tag team with Ric Savage called &quot;Body Count&quot;. The duo competed in National Championship Wrestling (NCW) until Buchanan was recruited by Jim Cornette for Smoky Mountain Wrestling.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1995)===
Buchanan debuted in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) in 1995 as &quot;The Punisher&quot;. He was a member of Jim Cornette&#x27;s stable &quot;The Militia&quot; and acted as Cornette&#x27;s bodyguard, feuding with Boo Bradley and The Bullet. Buchanan wrestled on the final SMW show in December 1995, teaming with Tommy Rich to wrestle Buddy Landel and The Bullet.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996)===
Known as Stud, he teamed with Billy Black as The Dark Riders. The team made two appearances for ECW, with clips of a March 1996 match against ECW World Tag Team Champions, The Eliminators, airing on ECW&#x27;s weekly television show.

===United States Wrestling Association (1996–1997)===

After SMW closed, Buchanan signed a WWF developmental contract and was assigned to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), where he was known as &quot;Recon&quot; of the Truth Commission. With his partner The Interrogator, Buchanan won the USWA World Tag Team Championship on March 6, 1997, when they beat Billy Joe Travis and Flash Flanagan. The duo only held the titles for a week before losing them back to Flash Flanagan and Billy Joe Travis. The Truth Commission regained the titles on April 19 when they beat Billy Kidman and Ace Darling in Memphis, Tennessee. The second reign came to an end on May 14 when Steven Dunn and Paul Diamond defeated &quot;Recon&quot; and the Interrogator. Two weeks later, the Truth Commission became three times champions and held them until the titles were held up on June 14. The titles were vacated because Truth Commission member Tank teamed up with &quot;Recon&quot; and the titles could not be defended by a substitute. The Truth Commission left the USWA only a short time later as they were being called up to the World Wrestling Federation.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (1997–2003)===
==== The Truth Commission (1997–1998) ====

The entire Truth Commission faction (except &quot;Sniper&quot;) up until that point were brought in to the World Wrestling Federation. They made their WWF debut on the June 28, 1997, episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. The following week, Sniper made his debut and soon after Tank was removed from the team. The Truth Commission stable was short-lived; it disbanded in 1998, but Buchanan and Sniper of the Truth Commission stayed together as the short-lived tag team, Armageddon. After that team disappeared from TV, Buchanan remained under WWF contract, and was sent to their &quot;developmental territory&quot; Ohio Valley Wrestling to improve his skills. While there, Buchanan and partner Mr. Black captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship.

==== Right to Censor (2000–2001) ====
Buchanan returned to the WWF on the March 19, 2000, edition of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, now under the name &quot;Bull Buchanan&quot; and dressed in a SWAT uniform, helping the Big Boss Man attack Mideon. Buchanan and the Big Boss Man continued wearing matching SWAT-style uniforms and teaming together as Buchanan acted as some sort of a protégé to Boss Man. The team had a decent amount of success as they defeated The Godfather and D&#x27;Lo Brown at WrestleMania 2000, and beat the Acolytes the following month at Backlash. The team split on the June 5, 2000, edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;; after a loss to the Hardy Boyz, Buchanan and Boss Man began to argue which led to shoving and eventually Boss Man knocking out Buchanan with his nightstick when Buchanan&#x27;s back was turned.

Buchanan briefly struck out on his own after that alliance ended, unsuccessfully participating in the King of the Ring tournament, before joining Steven Richards&#x27; ultra-conservative stable Right to Censor (RTC). On the July 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Buchanan faced the Godfather, in which he agreed to give up pimping if he lost. Buchanan defeated The Godfather, who promptly joined RTC and renounced his former ways. At SummerSlam on August 27, Right to Censor defeated Too Cool in a six-man tag team match. On the September 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Buchanan and the rechristened Goodfather defeated the Acolytes. After the match, Val Venis attacked the Acolytes, joining the group in the process. At Unforgiven, RTC defeated the Acolytes and the Dudley Boyz. At No Mercy on October 22, Buchanan and Goodfather entered into an elimination tag team tables match, which was won by the Dudley Boyz. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Ivory was announced as the newest member of the group. Buchanan and Goodfather won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Hardy Boyz on the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Survivor Series, Buchanan and Goodfather teamed up with Edge and Christian, to face the Hardys and the Dudleys in a losing effort. At Rebellion, the duo retained the titles against the Hardys. They lost the titles to Edge and Christian at Armageddon in a fatal four-way tag team match also involving K-Kwik and Road Dogg and the Dudleys.

Buchanan entered the 2001 Royal Rumble match on January 21, 2001, at entry number 2, but was eliminated by the Hardys. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Buchanan, Goodfather and Venis were defeated by the APA (formerly the Acolytes) and Tazz. Also at WrestleMania, Ivory lost the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship to Chyna. On the April 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, RTC lost to the Brothers of Destruction on a 4-on-2 handicap match, after all other members walked out on Richards mid-match. Buchanan would continue to team with Goodfather, until the June 17 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, where they lost to the Dudley Boyz.

==== Teaming with John Cena and departure (2002–2003) ====
After Right to Censor was disbanded in mid-2001, Buchanan was once again sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling. In August 2002 he returned to the WWE after wrestling several matches with seemingly no character or purpose, until November 21 when John Cena was pinned by Rikishi. Buchanan came out and attacked Rikishi after the match thus aligning himself with Cena, who was beginning a rapper gimmick in which he would freestyle rhyme about his opponent as he made his entrance. Buchanan stood as an enforcer character for Cena and eventually finished Cena&#x27;s Freestyles with his own quote: &quot;Boo-yah!&quot; Buchanan also began using the name B-2 (also written as B², pronounced &quot;B-Squared&quot;), and was also called Bling Bling Buchanan. This pairing did not last long. On the January 16, 2003, edition of SmackDown!, Cena and B-2 lost to Los Guerreros in a tag team title match which led to Cena blaming B-2 after the match for being pinned. This led to Cena slapping B-2 and B-2 shoving Cena down. As B-2 went to attack Cena, Redd Dogg debuted and came through the crowd and joined Cena in a beatdown on B-2; thus, Redd Dogg replaced B-2 at Cena&#x27;s side. B-2&#x27;s last televised match was on January 19 at the Royal Rumble in which he entered at number 11 and was eliminated rather quickly. B-2&#x27;s last match was cut out of the January 23 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in which Redd Dogg defeated B-2. B-2 was released from WWE on January 26, 2003.

==== Sporadic appearances (2006, 2011) ====
Buchanan returned for one night on September 5, 2006, losing to Henry Godwinn in a dark match for &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

On the November 14, 2011, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Buchanan made a one-night return to WWE in a segment where Mick Foley was bringing out people from John Cena&#x27;s past, and Buchanan claimed that Cena ruined his life.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2003–2007)===

After parting ways with WWE, he signed with top Japanese promotion All Japan Pro Wrestling and performed as Buchanan. He debuted in early October and immediately aligned himself with Taka Michinoku, D&#x27;Lo Brown and The Gladiator and eventually joined Roughly Obsess and Destroy. On October 26, Buchanan and Brown took on Arashi and Keiji Muto for the World Tag Team Championship and lost. In the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League 2003, Buchanan teamed with Gigantes where they gained six points, therefore not enough to progress further. On February 11, 2004, he teamed with Gladiator in his second Unified World Tag Team Championship and lost to the champions, Kaz Hayashi and Satoshi Kojima. Once again, Buchanan participated in the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League for that year and teamed with D&#x27;lo Brown but would once again fall at the first hurdle. After teaming with various members of RO&amp;D and having little success, he decided to bring in a new member which was Rico. This would prove to be the right choice as in their first match, on February 5, 2005, they defeated Masayuki Naruse and Mitsuya Nagai to become the All Asia Tag Team Champions. With that win, RO&amp;D held all the championships in AJPW. Later in the month, there was an AJPW vs RO&amp;D which RO&amp;D won. Buchanan would participate in his first Champion Carnival 2005 where he gained five points. On May 27, 2005, Buchanan and Rico vacated the All Asia Tag Team Championship due to Rico retiring. In late 2005, RO&amp;D became faces and feuded against the Voodoo Murders. During the transitional time, Buchanan and D&#x27;lo Brown lost to Katsuhiko Nakajima and Kensuke Sasaki in a match for the All Asia Tag Team Championship and later in the year took part in World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League 2005. Over the last part of 2005 and most of 2006, Buchanan would team with various members of RO&amp;D and take part in tournaments and had very little success. With that in mind, on September 17, 2006, Buchanan and his regular tag team partner, D&#x27;lo Brown, betrayed RO&amp;D and joined the rival Voodoo Murders faction. Buchanan and Brown continued to team with each other in Voodoo Murders and even took part in the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League 2006 and once again lost. In early 2007, Buchanan and Brown left Voodoo Murders and AJPW to join Pro Wrestling Noah.

===Pro Wrestling Noah (2007–2010)===

On May 17, 2007, Buchanan along with D&#x27;lo Brown and Taka Michinoku debuted for Pro Wrestling Noah and would reform Roughly Obsess and Destroy. On July 8, Buchanan and Brown took on Jun Akiyama and Takeshi Rikio for the GHC Tag Team Championship and lost. After the tag titles were vacated, Buchanan and Brown took part in the GHC Tag Team Championship Decision Tournament where whoever gained the most points would win the tournament and the title. Buchanan and Brown gained six points, the most of any team, and therefore became the GHC Tag Team Champions. However, the celebrations would be cut short because only a week later, on October 10, they lost the titles to Naomichi Marufuji and Takashi Sugiura. They would enter to Global Tag League 2008 and 2009 but would come short. After being eliminated from the tournament, Buchanan would leave Noah but returned in February 2010 for one last tour.

===Independent circuit (2003–2014, 2019–present)===
On October 30, 2004, Buchanan and AJ Steele defeated David Young and Sonny Siaki to become the GCW Tag Team Champions but a week later, Steele would turn on him and teamed up with Damien Steel in a two on one handicapped match for the titles which the Steele Brothers won. Buchanan formed a stable called Bad Company which consisted of himself, David Young and The Grappler. In late 2004, Buchanan and The Grappler took on The Steele Brothers for the GCW Tag Team Championship and lost. On April 23, 2005, Buchanan and Young defeated Southside Trash (Big Daddy and Rowdy) for the GCW Tag Team Championship. on July 11, they lost the titles to John Bogie and Lee Thomas. Over a year later on December 13, 2006, Buchanan and Johnny Swinger defeated The Diamonds In The Rough (David Young and Elix Skipper) to become a three time GCW Tag Team Champion. They would hold the titles for 56 days before losing them to the NOW (Hale Collins and Vik Dalishus).

On September 29, 2007, Buchanan defeated former tag team partner, Johnny Swinger, to become the GCW Heavyweight Champion. In December, Buchanan would lose the title back to Swinger. He would challenge Swinger to several rematches but lost his first and won the second via DQ, therefore not winning the title back. In mid-2008, Buchanan would team up with another former partner, David Young, and Sonny Siaki. Although neither of them had a tag team title shot, the three of them earned a shot at Swingers&#x27; heavyweight title and in a four-way elimination match, Swinger came out on top. On June 27, 2008, Buchanan and Scotty Beach defeated Hot Like Lava (Cru Jones and Shaun Banks) for the GCW Tag Team Championship. They held the titles until September 18 when they lost them to Micah Taylor and Cru Jones. On January 28, 2010, Buchanan defeated Kyle Matthews to become a two time GCW Heavyweight Champion, however, he would lose it to Murder-1 on February 11. For the rest of 2010, Buchanan had multiple title shots but failed to capitalize on any of them.

Buchanan worked mainly for Universal Independent Wrestling in Georgia in his final years as a performer. He retired from professional wrestling on November 22, 2014, teaming with D&#x27;Lo Brown to face AJ Steele and Brad Lynch in his final match.

In March 2019, Buchanan returned to the ring teaming with his son Ben where they won a tag team match.

== Personal life ==
Buchanan has two sons named Benjamin and Zach. Benjamin, who is also a professional wrestler currently performs for the WWE on NXT under the ring name Brooks Jensen. His other son, Zach, is currently an independent wrestler within the West Georgia area.

Buchanan has also started a wrestling promotion called &quot;Bullpen Professional Wrestling&quot;, including independent wrestlers such as Zach Buchanan, AJ Black, Jaden Vain, JT Paradox, Sean Nelson, Dante Diamond and Trey Jordan.

<doc id="591699" wikidata="Q3410369" url="?curid=591699" title="Drag (entertainment)">
<text>Drag is a performance of exaggerated femininity, masculinity, or other forms of gender expression, usually for entertainment purposes. Drag usually involves cross-dressing. A drag queen is someone (usually male) who performs femininely and a drag king is someone (usually female) who performs masculinely. Performances often involve comedy, social satire, and at times political commentary. The term may be used as a noun as in the expression &quot;in drag&quot; or as an adjective as in &quot;drag show&quot;.

==Etymology==

The use of &quot;drag&quot; in this sense appeared in print as early as 1870 but its origin is uncertain. One suggested etymological root is 19th-century theatre slang, from the sensation of long skirts trailing on the floor. It may have been based on the term &quot;grand rag&quot; which was historically used for a masquerade ball.

==In folk custom==
Men dressed as women have been featured in certain traditional customs for centuries. For example, the characters of some regional variants of the traditional mummers&#x27; play, which were traditionally always performed by men, include Besom Bet(ty); numerous variations on Bessy or Betsy; Bucksome Nell; Mrs Clagdarse; Dame Dolly; Dame Dorothy; Mrs Finney; Mrs Frail; and many others.

The variant performed around Plough Monday in Eastern England is known as the Plough Play (also Wooing Play or Bridal Play) and usually involves two female characters, the young &quot;Lady Bright and Gay&quot; and &quot;Old Dame Jane&quot; and a dispute about a bastard child. A character called Bessy also accompanied the Plough Jags (also known as Plough Jacks, Plough Stots, Plough Bullocks, etc.) even in places where no play was performed: &quot;she&quot; was a man dressed in women&#x27;s clothes, who carried a collecting box for money and other largesse.

&quot;Maid Marian&quot; of the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is played by a man, and the Maid Marians referred to in old documents as having taken part in May Games and other festivals with Morris dancers would most probably also have been men. The &quot;consort&quot; of the Castleton Garland King was traditionally a man (until 1956, when a woman took over the role) and was originally simply referred to as &quot;The Woman&quot;.

==Theatre==
Cross-dressing elements of performance traditions are a widespread and longstanding cultural phenomena.

The ancient Roman playwright Plautus&#x27; ( – 184 BCE) &quot;Menaechmi&quot; includes a scene in which Menaechmus I puts on his wife&#x27;s dress, then wears a cloak over it, intending to remove the dress from the house and deliver it to his mistress. Menaechmus says: &quot;Look at me. Do I look the part?&quot; [&quot;Age me aspice. ecquid adsimulo similiter?&quot;] Peniculus responds: &quot;What in the world have you got on?!&quot; [&quot;Quis istest ornatus tuos?&quot;] Menaechmus says: &quot;Tell me I am gorgeous.&quot; [&quot;Dic hominem lepidissimum esse me.&quot;]
In England, actors in Shakespearean plays, and all Elizabethan theatre (in the 1500s and 1600s), were all male; female parts were played by young men in drag because women were banned from performing publicly. Shakespeare used the conventions to enrich the gender confusions of &quot;As You Like It,&quot; and Ben Jonson manipulated the same conventions in &quot;Epicœne, or The Silent Woman&quot; (1609). During the reign of Charles II of England (latter 1600s) the rules were relaxed to allow women to play female roles on the London stage, reflecting the French fashion, and the convention of men routinely playing female roles consequently disappeared.
In the 1890s the slapstick drag traditions of undergraduate productions (notably Hasty Pudding Theatricals at Harvard College, annually since 1891, and at other Ivy League schools like Princeton University&#x27;s Triangle Club or the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Mask and Wig Club), and many other universities in which women were not permitted admission, were permissible fare to the same upper-class American audiences that were scandalized to hear that in New York City, rouged young men in skirts were standing on tables to dance the can-can in Bowery dives like The Slide.

Drag shows were popular night club entertainment in New York in the 1920s, then were forced underground, until the &quot;Jewel Box Revue&quot; played Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater in the 1950s with their show, &quot;49 Men and a Girl&quot;. For most of the performance, the &quot;girls&quot; were men in glamorous drag. At the end, the &quot;one girl&quot; was revealed to be the dashing young &quot;man&quot; in dinner clothes—Stormé DeLarverie—the MC who had been introducing each of the evening&#x27;s acts.

The plot device of the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998) turns upon the Elizabethan convention of the Shakespearean originals and the changes that came with women being allowed on stage during the reign of Charles II. However, drag remains a strong tradition in British comedy. This is seen in current-day British pantomime, where traditional roles such as the pantomime dame are played by a man in drag and the principal boy, such as Prince Charming or Dick Whittington, is played by a girl or young woman, as well as in comedy troupes such as Monty Python (formed in 1969).

Within the dramatic fiction, a double standard historically affected the uses of drag. In male-dominated societies where active roles were reserved to men, a woman might dress as a man under the pressures of her dramatic predicament. In these societies a man&#x27;s position was above a woman&#x27;s, causing a rising action that suited itself to tragedy, sentimental melodrama and comedies of manners that involved confused identities. A man dressed as a woman was thought to be a falling action only suited to broad low comedy and burlesque. Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo are an all-male ballet troupe where much of the humor is in seeing male dancers &quot;en travesti;&quot; performing roles usually reserved to females, wearing tutus and dancing &quot;en pointe&quot; with considerable technical skill.

These conventions of male-dominated societies were largely unbroken before the 20th century, when rigid gender roles were undermined and began to dissolve. This evolution changed drag in the last decades of the 20th century. Among contemporary drag performers, the theatrical drag queen or street queen may at times be seen less as a &quot;female impersonator&quot; per se, but simply as a drag queen. Examples include The Cockettes, Danny La Rue or RuPaul.

== Ball culture ==

Ballroom culture (also known as &quot;ball culture&quot;, and other names) is an underground LGBT subculture that originated in 1920s New York in which people &quot;walk&quot; (i.e., compete) for trophies, prizes, and glory at events known as balls. Ball participants are mainly young African-American and Latin American members of the LGBTQ community. Attendees dance, vogue, walk, pose, and support one another in one or more of the numerous drag and performance competition categories. Categories are designed to simultaneously epitomize and satirize various genders, social classes and archetypes in society, while also offering an escape from reality. The culture extends beyond the extravagant formal events as many participants in ball culture also belong to groups known as &quot;houses&quot;, a longstanding tradition in LGBT communities, and racial minorities, where chosen families of friends live in households together, forming relationships and community to replace families of origin from which they may be estranged.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball culture first gained exposure to a mainstream audience in 1990 when its voguing dance style was featured in Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Vogue&quot;, and in Jennie Livingston&#x27;s documentary &quot;Paris is Burning&quot; the same year. Voguing is a highly stylized type of modern house dance that emerged in the 1980s and evolved out of 1960s ball culture in Harlem, New York. In 2018, the American television series &quot;Pose&quot; showcased Harlem&#x27;s ball culture scene of the 1980s and was nominated for numerous awards.

==Opera==
In Baroque opera, where soprano roles for men were sung by castrati, Handel&#x27;s heroine Bradamante, in the opera &quot;Alcina,&quot; disguises herself as a man to save her lover, played by a male soprano; contemporary audiences were not the least confused. In Romantic opera, certain roles of young boys were written for alto and soprano voices and acted by women &quot;en travestie&quot; (in English, in &quot;trouser roles&quot;). The most familiar trouser role in pre-Romantic opera is Cherubino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786). In Beethoven&#x27;s opera Fidelio Leonore, the faithful wife of Florestan, disguises herself as a man to save her husband. Romantic opera continued the convention: there are trouser roles for women in drag in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; (Arsace), Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Rosamonda d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; and &quot;Anna Bolena,&quot; Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Benvenuto Cellini,&quot; and even a page in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo.&quot; The convention was beginning to die out with Siebel, the ingenuous youth in Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1859) and the gypsy boy Beppe in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amico Fritz,&quot; so that Offenbach gave the role of Cupid to a real boy in &quot;Orphée aux Enfers.&quot; But Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in tights, giving French audiences a glimpse of Leg (the other in fact being a prosthesis) and Prince Orlovsky, who gives the ball in &quot;Die Fledermaus,&quot; is a mezzo-soprano, to somewhat androgynous effect. The use of &quot;travesti&quot; in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; (1912) is a special case, unusually subtle and evocative of its 18th-century setting, and should be discussed in detail at &quot;Der Rosenkavalier.&quot;

==Film and television==
The self-consciously risqué bourgeois high jinks of Brandon Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (London, 1892) were still viable theatre material in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1978), which was remade, as &quot;The Birdcage,&quot; as late as 1996.

Dame Edna, the drag persona of Australian actor Barry Humphries, was the host of several specials, including &quot;The Dame Edna Experience.&quot; Dame Edna also toured internationally, playing to sell-out crowds, and appeared on TV&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal.&quot; Dame Edna represented an anomalous example of the drag concept. Her earliest incarnation was unmistakably a man dressed (badly) as a suburban housewife. Edna&#x27;s manner and appearance became so feminised and glamorised that even some of her TV show guests appear not to see that the Edna character was played by a man. The furor surrounding Dame Edna&#x27;s &quot;advice&quot; column in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine suggests that one of her harshest critics, actress Salma Hayek, was unaware Dame Edna was a female character played by a man.

In 2009, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; first premiered as a television show in the United States. The show has gained mainstream and global appeal, and it has exposed multiple generations of audiences to drag culture.

===United States===
In the United States, early examples of drag clothing can be found in gold rush saloons of California. The Barbary Coast district of San Francisco was known for certain saloons, such as Dash, which attracted female impersonator patrons and workers.

William Dorsey Swann was the first person to call himself &quot;queen of drag&quot;. He was a former slave, who was freed after the American Civil War, from Maryland. By the 1880s, he was organizing and hosting drag balls in Washington, D.C. The balls included folk dances, such as the cakewalk, and the male guests often dressed in female clothing.

In the early 20th century, drag—as an art form and culture—began to flourish with minstrel shows and vaudeville. Performers such as Julian Eltinge and Bothwell Browne were drag queens and vaudeville performers. The Progressive Era brought a decline in vaudeville entertainment, but drag culture began to grow in nightclubs and bars, such as Finnochio&#x27;s Club and Black Cat Bar in San Francisco.

During this period, Hollywood films included examples of drag. While drag was often used as a last-resort tactic in situational farce (its only permissible format at the time), some films provided a more empathetic lens than others. In 1919, Bothwell Browne appeared in &quot;Yankee Doodle in Berlin&quot;. In 1933, came out in Germany, which later inspired &quot;First a Girl&quot; (1935) in the United States. That same year, Katharine Hepburn played a character who dressed as a male in &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot;. In 1959, drag made a big Hollywood splash in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959).

In the 1960s, Andy Warhol and his Factory scene included superstar drag queens, such as Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn, both immortalized in the Lou Reed song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;.

By the early 1970s, drag was influenced by the psychedelic rock and hippie culture of the era. A San Francisco drag troupe, The Cockettes (1970–1972), performed with glitter eyeshadow and gilded mustaches and beards. The troupe also coined the term &quot;genderfuck&quot;. Drag broke out from underground theatre in the persona of Divine in John Waters&#x27; &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972): see also Charles Pierce. The cult hit movie musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975) inspired several generations of young people to attend performances in drag, although many of these fans would not call themselves drag queens or transvestites.

For many decades, American network television, only the broadest slapstick drag tradition was generally represented. Few American TV comedians consistently used drag as a comedy device, among them Milton Berle, Flip Wilson, and Martin Lawrence, although drag characters have occasionally been popular on sketch TV shows like &quot;In Living Color&quot; (with Jim Carrey&#x27;s grotesque female bodybuilder) and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (with the Gap Girls, among others). On the popular 1960s military sitcom, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy,&quot; Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) sometimes had to dress in drag (often with hilarious results) whenever McHale and/or his crew had to disguise themselves in order to carry out their elaborate schemes. &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; occasionally features men dressing in women&#x27;s clothes, though this was not considered drag since it was not for a performance.

On stage and screen, the actor-playwright-screenwriter-producer Tyler Perry has included his drag character of Madea in some of his most noted productions, such as the stage play &quot;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&quot; and the feature film he based upon it.

Maximilliana and RuPaul co-star together in the TV show &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; starring Don Johnson and Cheech Marin during the two-part episode &quot;&#x27;Cuda Grace&quot;. Maximilliana, looking passable, leads one of the investigators to believe he is &quot;real&quot; and sexually advances only to learn that he is, in fact, male, much to his chagrin.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, drag has been more common in comedy, on both film and television. Alastair Sim plays the headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton in &quot;The Belles of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954) and &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1957). He played the role straight; no direct joke about the actor&#x27;s true gender is made. However, Miss Fritton is quite non-feminine in her pursuits of betting, drinking and smoking. The gag is that whilst her school sends out girls into a merciless world, it is the world that need beware. Despite this, or perhaps because of Sim&#x27;s portrayal, subsequent films in the series went on to use actresses in the headmistress role (Dora Bryan and Sheila Hancock respectively). The 21st century re-boot of the series however reverted to drag, with Rupert Everett in the role.

On television, Benny Hill portrayed several female characters. The Monty Python troupe and The League of Gentlemen often played female parts in their skits. The League of Gentlemen are also credited with the first ever portrayal of &quot;nude drag&quot;, where a man playing a female character is shown naked but still with the appropriate female anatomy, like fake breasts and a merkin. Within the conceit of the sketch/film, they are actually women: it is the audience who are in on the joke.

Monty Python women, whom the troupe called pepperpots, are random middle-aged working/lower middle class typically wearing long brown coats that were common in the 1960s. Save for a few characters played by Eric Idle, they looked and sounded very little like actual women with their caricatural outfits and shrill falsettos. However, when a sketch called for a &quot;real&quot; woman, the Pythons almost always called on Carol Cleveland. The joke is reversed in the Python film &quot;Life of Brian&quot; where &quot;they&quot; are pretending to be men, including obviously false beards, so that they can go to the stoning. When someone throws the first stone too early the Pharisee asks &quot;who threw that&quot;, and they answer &quot;she did, she did...&quot; in high voices. &quot;Are there any women here today?&quot; he says, &quot;No no no&quot; they say in gruff voices.

In the 1970s the most familiar drag artist on British television was Danny La Rue. La Rue&#x27;s act was essentially a music hall one, following on from a much older, and less sexualised tradition of drag. His appearances were often in variety shows such as &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; (itself a pastiche of music hall) and &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. Such was his popularity that he made a film, &quot;Our Miss Fred&quot; (1972). Unlike the &quot;St Trinians&quot; films, the plot involved a man having to dress as a woman.

David Walliams and (especially) Matt Lucas often play female roles in the television comedy &quot;Little Britain&quot;; Walliams plays Emily Howard—a &quot;rubbish transvestite&quot;, who makes an unconvincing woman.

In the UK, non-comedic representations of drag acts are less common, and usually a subsidiary feature of another story. A rare exception is the television play (1968) and film (1973) &quot;The Best Pair of Legs in the Business&quot;. In the film version Reg Varney plays a holiday camp comedian and drag artist whose marriage is failing.

===Canada===
Early representations of drag in Canadian film included the 1971 film &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, adapted from a theatrical play by John Herbert, and the 1974 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in the East&quot;, adapted from a theatrical play by Michel Tremblay.

The 1977 film &quot;Outrageous!&quot;, starring Canadian drag queen Craig Russell as a fictionalized version of himself, was an important milestone in Canadian film, as one of the first gay-themed films ever to receive widespread theatrical distribution in North America. A sequel film, &quot;Too Outrageous!&quot;, was released in 1987.

In the 1980s, the sketch comedy series &quot;CODCO&quot; and &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; both made prominent use of drag performance. &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; consisted of five men, while &quot;CODCO&quot; consisted of three men and two women; however, all ten performers, regardless of their own gender, performed both male and female characters. Notably, both troupes also had openly gay members, with Scott Thompson of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; and Greg Malone and Tommy Sexton of &quot;CODCO&quot; being important pioneers of gay representation on Canadian TV in their era. The use of drag in &quot;CODCO&quot; also transitioned to a lesser extent into the new series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; in the 1990s; although cross-gender performance is not as central to &quot;22 Minutes&quot; as it was in &quot;CODCO&quot;, Cathy Jones and Mary Walsh, the two cast members common to both series, both continued to play selected male characters.

The Canadian film &quot;Lilies&quot;, directed by John Greyson and adapted from a theatrical play by Michel Marc Bouchard, made use of drag as a dramatic device. Set in a men&#x27;s prison, the film centres on a play within a play staged by one of the prisoners; however, as the roles in the play are performed by fellow prisoners, even the female characters within it are played by men, and the film blends scenes in which they are clearly depicted as men performing in their own clothes in the prison chapel with scenes in which they are performing in drag in more &quot;realistic&quot; settings. It became the first gay-themed film ever to win the Genie Award for Best Picture.

The short-lived French-language sitcom &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, aired in 2005 on Télévision de Radio-Canada, centred on three drag queens sharing ownership of a drag cabaret in Montreal.

In 2017 Ici ARTV aired &quot;Ils de jour, elles de nuit&quot;, a documentary series profiling Montreal drag queens Rita Baga, Barbada de Barbades, Gaby, Lady Boom Boom, Lady Pounana and Tracy Trash. The documentary web series &quot;Canada&#x27;s a Drag&quot;, launched on CBC Gem in 2018, has profiled various Canadian drag performers, inclusive of all genders, over three seasons to date.

&quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, a Canadian spinoff of the American &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; franchise, was launched in 2020 on Crave. The same year also saw the release of Phil Connell&#x27;s film &quot;Jump, Darling&quot;, centred on a young aspiring drag queen, and Thom Fitzgerald&#x27;s film &quot;Stage Mother&quot;, about a religious woman who inherits her son&#x27;s drag club after his death, as well as the comedy web series &quot;Queens&quot;, starring several real Toronto-area drag queens. 2023 saw the release of the films &quot;Enter the Drag Dragon&quot;, &quot;Solo&quot;, &quot;Gamodi&quot; and &quot;Queen Tut&quot;.

OutTV, a Canadian television channel devoted to LGBTQ programming, has aired the documentary series &quot;Drag Heals&quot; and the reality competition shows &quot;Call Me Mother&quot; and &quot;Sew Fierce&quot;. It has also been directly involved as a production partner in some programs filmed in the United States, including &quot;The Boulet Brothers&#x27; Dragula&quot; and &quot;Hey Qween!&quot;.

==Music==
The world of popular music has a venerable history of drag. Marlene Dietrich was a popular actress and singer who sometimes performed dressed as a man, such as in the films &quot;Blue Angel&quot; and &quot;Morocco.&quot;

In the glam rock era many male performers (such as David Bowie and The New York Dolls) donned partial or full drag. This tradition waned somewhat in the late 1970s but was revived in the synth-pop era of the 1980s, as pop singers Boy George (of Culture Club), Pete Burns (of Dead or Alive), and Philip Oakey (of The Human League), frequently appeared in a sort of semi-drag, while female musicians of the era dabbled in their own form of androgyny, with performers like Annie Lennox, Phranc and The Bloods sometimes performing as drag kings.

The male grunge musicians of the 1990s sometimes performed wearing deliberately ugly drag—that is, wearing dresses but making no attempt to look feminine, not wearing makeup and often not even shaving their beards. (Nirvana did this several times, notably in the &quot;In Bloom&quot; video.) However, possibly the most famous drag artist in music in the 1990s was RuPaul. Maximilliana worked with RuPaul in the &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; episode &quot;Cuda Grace&quot; and was a regular at the now defunct Queen Mary Show Lounge in Studio City, California until the very end. Max (short for Maximilliana) is most well known for her performance as Charlie/Claire in &quot;Ringmaster: the Jerry Springer Movie.&quot; Max has also appeared in other movies including &quot;Shoot or Be Shot&quot; and &quot;10 Attitudes&quot; as well as on television shows including &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; as mentioned above, &quot;Clueless,&quot; &quot;Gilmore Girls,&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&quot; &quot;Mas Vale Tarde with Alex Cambert,&quot; &quot;MadTV,&quot; &quot;The Tyra Banks Show,&quot; &quot;The Tom Joyner Show,&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent,&quot; and many others.

In Japan there are several musicians in the visual kei scene, such as Mana (Moi dix Mois and Malice Mizer), Kaya (Schwarz Stein), Hizaki and Jasmine You (both Versailles), who always or usually appear in full or semi-drag.

==Drag kings and queens==
A drag queen (first use in print, 1941) is a person, usually a man, that dresses in drag, either as part of a performance or for personal fulfillment. The term &quot;drag queen&quot; distinguishes such men from transvestites, transsexuals or transgender people. Those who &quot;perform drag&quot; as comedy do so while wearing dramatically heavy and often elaborate makeup, wigs, and prosthetic devices (breasts) as part of the performance costume.
Women who dress as men and perform as hypermasculine men are sometimes called drag kings; however, &quot;drag king&quot; also has a much wider range of meanings. It is currently most often used to describe entertainment (singing or lip-synching) in which there is no necessarily firm correlation between a performer&#x27;s deliberately macho onstage persona and offstage gender identity or sexual orientation, just as individuals assigned male at birth who do female drag for the stage may or may not identify as being either gay or female in their real-life personal identities.

A bio queen, or female-bodied queen, on the other hand, is usually a cisgender woman performing in the same context as traditional (men-as-women) drag and displaying such features as exaggerated hair and makeup (as an example, the performance of the actress and singer Lady Gaga during her first appearance in the 2018 film &quot;A Star is Born&quot;).

Constructing a drag persona can be seen as a form of &quot;stigma resistance,&quot; where consumers who practice drag are able to &quot;embody pride&quot; and work to combat stigma and shame. Stigma (&quot;social stigma&quot; page on Wikipedia) often operates through a process of shame, and drag queens are often both socially and economically marginalized. However, drag practices can also provide a means of stigma resistance, offering new ways of managing individual stigma with performances in a supportive community. Venkatraman et al&#x27;s (2024) interviewees also highlighted that building pride in one&#x27;s self and identity through drag could then permeate outward into other aspects of the drag performer&#x27;s life, while Berkowitz and Belgrave (2010) indicate the empowering rewards of drag. We might thus see the transformative potential of drag as a practice, particularly for marginalized individuals.

<text>The Green Progression is a 1992 novel by American author L. E. Modesitt and Bruce Scott Levinson about how good intentions have a way of backfiring, especially when the people involved in the cause are being manipulated by others.

==Plot summary==
As a former staffer at the Environmental Protection Agency, Jack McDarvid, the main character, knows all about extremists in the cause of virtue. He now works for a law firm that represents companies that need clearances or information about just what is or is not allowed. But then his boss is killed in a shootout near the Capitol, and nothing is what it seems. And no one what they appear to be.

From Moscow to Washington, from a near hit and run to the very real threat of a nuclear time bomb in the hands of a fanatic with a point to prove, The Green Progression moves non-stop through the machinations behind the scenes of the environmental movement.

<text>In arithmetic combinatorics, Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem is a result concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. In 1936, Erdős and Turán conjectured that every set of integers &quot;A&quot; with positive natural density contains a &quot;k&quot;-term arithmetic progression for every &quot;k&quot;. Endre Szemerédi proved the conjecture in 1975.

==Statement==
A subset &quot;A&quot; of the natural numbers is said to have positive upper density if

:formula_1

Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem asserts that a subset of the natural numbers with positive upper density contains an arithmetic progression of length &quot;k&quot; for all positive integers &quot;k&quot;.

An often-used equivalent finitary version of the theorem states that for every positive integer &quot;k&quot; and real number formula_2, there exists a positive integer

:formula_3

such that every subset of {1, 2, ..., &quot;N&quot;} of size at least formula_4 contains an arithmetic progression of length &quot;k&quot;.

Another formulation uses the function &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ..., &quot;N&quot;} without an arithmetic progression of length &quot;k&quot;. Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the asymptotic bound

:formula_5

That is, &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) grows less than linearly with &quot;N&quot;.

Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem, a precursor of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, was proved in 1927.

The cases &quot;k&quot; = 1 and &quot;k&quot; = 2 of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem are trivial. The case &quot;k&quot; = 3, known as Roth&#x27;s theorem, was established in 1953 by Klaus Roth via an adaptation of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method. Szemerédi next proved the case &quot;k&quot; = 4 through combinatorics. Using an approach similar to the one he used for the case &quot;k&quot; = 3, Roth gave a second proof for &quot;k&quot; = 4 in 1972.

The general case was settled in 1975, also by Szemerédi, who developed an ingenious and complicated extension of his previous combinatorial argument for &quot;k&quot; = 4 (called &quot;a masterpiece of combinatorial reasoning&quot; by Erdős). Several other proofs are now known, the most important being those by Hillel Furstenberg in 1977, using ergodic theory, and by Timothy Gowers in 2001, using both Fourier analysis and combinatorics while also introducing what is now called the Gowers norm. Terence Tao has called the various proofs of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem a &quot;Rosetta stone&quot; for connecting disparate fields of mathematics.

==Quantitative bounds==

It is an open problem to determine the exact growth rate of &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;N&quot;). The best known general bounds are

:formula_6

where formula_7. The lower bound is due to O&#x27;Bryant building on the work of Behrend, Rankin, and Elkin. The upper bound is due to Gowers.

For small &quot;k&quot;, there are tighter bounds than the general case. When &quot;k&quot; = 3, Bourgain, Heath-Brown, Szemerédi, Sanders, and Bloom established progressively smaller upper bounds, and Bloom and Sisask then proved the first bound that broke the so-called &quot;logarithmic barrier&quot;. The current best bounds are

:formula_8, for some constant formula_9, 

respectively due to O&#x27;Bryant, and Bloom and Sisask (the latter built upon the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka, who obtained the same upper bound, with &quot;1/9&quot; replaced by &quot;1/12&quot;).

For &quot;k&quot; = 4, Green and Tao proved that

:formula_10

For k=5 in 2023 and k≥5 in 2024 Leng, Sah and Sawhney proved in preprints that:

:formula_11

==Extensions and generalizations==

A multidimensional generalization of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem was first proven by Hillel Furstenberg and Yitzhak Katznelson using ergodic theory. Timothy Gowers, Vojtěch Rödl and Jozef Skokan with Brendan Nagle, Rödl, and Mathias Schacht, and Terence Tao provided combinatorial proofs.

Alexander Leibman and Vitaly Bergelson generalized Szemerédi&#x27;s to polynomial progressions: If formula_12 is a set with positive upper density and formula_13 are integer-valued polynomials such that formula_14, then there are infinitely many formula_15 such that formula_16 for all formula_17. Leibman and Bergelson&#x27;s result also holds in a multidimensional setting.

The finitary version of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem can be generalized to finite additive groups including vector spaces over finite fields. The finite field analog can be used as a model for understanding the theorem in the natural numbers. The problem of obtaining bounds in the k=3 case of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem in the vector space formula_18 is known as the cap set problem.

The Green–Tao theorem asserts the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. It is not implied by Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem because the primes have density 0 in the natural numbers. As part of their proof, Ben Green and Tao introduced a &quot;relative&quot; Szemerédi theorem which applies to subsets of the integers (even those with 0 density) satisfying certain pseudorandomness conditions. A more general relative Szemerédi theorem has since been given by David Conlon, Jacob Fox, and Yufei Zhao.

The Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions would imply both Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem and the Green–Tao theorem.

<text>() is a village in the Beskid Śląski mountain range in Cieszyn County, Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland. It is the highest village by elevation in the Silesian Beskids and lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The village is primarily known for its tradition of intricate lace-making.

The name is possessive in origin, derived from personal name &quot;Koniak&quot;. It is thought that the name was conveyed by settlers from Koňákov (Koniaków) who supposedly established (or took part in the process of establishing of) the village.

== History ==
The settlement on the territory of the village began in the first half of the 17th century. It was settled by inhabitants of Istebna looking for new pastures and meadows, and clearing trees in the local forests to create land for grazing. This was deemed illegal by the owners of the Duchy of Teschen, as the forest was a part of defensive system of the duchy in the times of Thirty Years War. Later &quot;chalupy na Koniakowie&quot; (cottages in &quot;Koniaków&quot;) were being mentioned in the documents in the years 1695-1712. The year 1712 is nowadays accepted as the one the village was established, however it became independent from Istebna in 1816. The first inhabitants (from Koniaków?) were mainly cattle herders.

After the 1848 Revolutions in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was part of the political district of Cieszyn and the legal district of Jablunkov. According to censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910, the population of the municipality grew from 857 in 1880 to 1,120 in 1910, with all the inhabitants being native Polish speakers. In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (88.7%), followed by Protestants (11.3%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Gorals, speaking the Jablunkov dialect.

After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland and was transferred to Cieszyn County. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war, it was restored to Poland.

== Koniaków lace ==
The tradition of lace-making in Koniaków is more than 150 years old. Koniaków laces are handmade by crocheting cotton thread, using motifs inspired by nature. Lace motifs are worked separately, then connected to form larger pieces. The lace additions began appearing in pillows, shirts, blouses, and tablecloths around 1900.

Real fame was brought to Koniaków by lace tablecloths and table runners, which reached the tables of kings, aristocrats, and bishops. One was prepared for Queen Elizabeth II and another for Pope John Paul II. There are many examples of Koniaków lace lying on altars in Poland and other countries.

Lace-making became subject to anger and disapproval in 2003, dividing the small Koniaków society, when some young lace makers started to make underwear out of Koniaków lace. Some elders in Koniaków view this activity as a disgrace upon an ancient and respectful profession; however, the new twist on Koniaków lace was a big success.

Koniaków lingerie is a byproduct of the lace-making tradition in the village. Although traditional lace has always been a village staple for industry, it wasn&#x27;t until lace makers turned their knitting needles to crafting G-strings, thongs and other lingerie items that the village had its products become more and more popular.

Understanding that the Polish political system went through upheaval after the fall of communism in 1989, the $1,000 tablecloths became much harder to sell. Although considered heirlooms and taking more than a week to craft, tablecloths and doilies weren&#x27;t bringing in enough money for the village lace makers, which affected all aspects of life.

<text>Iban Mayo Diez (born 19 August 1977 in Igorre, Basque Country, Spain) is a former professional road bicycle racer.

==Biography==
Renowned as a climber, Mayo turned pro with in 2000, and became one of the Basque Country&#x27;s prospects for glory. He stayed with Euskaltel-Euskadi throughout 2000–2006. The biggest result came in the 2003 Tour de France, when he won a stage up Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Mayo finished the Tour sixth.

In 2004 Mayo won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, regarded as preparation for the Tour de France. He beat Lance Armstrong by two minutes in a time trial on Mont Ventoux, breaking the record. He was seen as a dangerous outsider for the Tour de France in the same year. It turned out a disappointment, and after losing time due to a crash, he lost more in the Pyrenees due to injuries and mononucleosis. Mayo quit before the 15th stage.

After a lackluster 2005, in 2006 he returned in the Dauphiné Libéré with second place in Briançon and a win on the stage to La Toussuire. He was seen as a contender for the 2006 Tour de France, but retired during the 11th stage. In 2007 Mayo signed for .

Mayo won the 19th stage of the 2007 Giro d&#x27;Italia. On 30 July 2007 the UCI confirmed he had failed a test for EPO during the Tour de France, in which he finished 16th. On 22 October the Spanish federation cleared Mayo after a second test proved negative. The UCI president Pat McQuaid stopped short of clearing the rider, pending further tests.

On 19 December a French laboratory confirmed the positive test. In 2008, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Mayo&#x27;s two-year ban, which ended on 31 July 2009.

On 13 September 2009, Mayo decided not to make a comeback to professional cycling, thus effectively ending his career.

<text>This is a list of [[mayor]]s of [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==History==
As a result of a yellow fever epidemic in 1879, Memphis lost so much of its population that it was disincorporated and was not rechartered until 1895. This accounts for the absence of a mayor during the period 1879–1893. The city leaders during this period were known as President of the Taxing District. They were David T. Porter (1879-1881), John Overton (1881-1883), David P. Hadden (1883-1891), William D. Bethell (1891-1893) and Walter L. Clapp (1893-1895) who then became mayor. See the article History of Memphis, Tennessee for more information.

<text>Surat Buhid is an abugida used to write the Buhid language. As a Brahmic script indigenous to the Philippines, it closely related to Baybayin and Hanunó&#x27;o. It is still used today by the Mangyans, found mainly on island of Mindoro, to write their language, Buhid, together with the Filipino latin script.

There are efforts to reinvigorate the use of Surat Buhid. Buhid script use varies across Northern (Bansud area) and Southern Buhid (Bongabong) communities.

== Structure ==
The Buhid script has 18 independent characters; 15 are consonants and 3 vowels. As an abugida, there are additional diacritic vowels. Consonants have an inherent /a/ vowel. The other two vowels are indicated by a diacritic above (for /i/) or below (for /u/) the consonant. Depending on the consonant, ligatures are formed, changing the shape of the consonant-vowel combination. Vowels at the beginning of syllables are represented by their own, independent characters. Syllables ending in a consonant are written without the final consonant.

The letter order of the Buhid alphabet Buhid, is based on phonetic principles that consider both the manner and place of articulation of the consonants and vowels they represent.

Buhid writing makes use of single and double danda punctuation marks.

== Unicode ==

Buhid script was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2002 with the release of version 3.2.

The Unicode block for Buhid is U+1740–U+175F:

<text>Tagbanwa is one of the scripts indigenous to the Philippines, used by the Tagbanwa and the Palawan people as their ethnic writing system.
The Tagbanwa languages (Aborlan, Calamian and Central), which are Austronesian languages with about 8,000-25,000 total speakers in the central and northern regions of Palawan, are dying out as the younger generations of Tagbanwa are learning and using non-traditional languages such as Cuyonon and Tagalog, thus becoming less knowledgeable of their own indigenous cultural heritage. There are proposals to revive the script by teaching it in public and private schools with Tagbanwa populations.

==Origin==
The Tagbanwa script was used in the Philippines until the 17th century. Closely related to Baybayin, it is believed to have come from the Kawi script of Java, Bali and Sumatra, which in turn, descended from the Pallava script, one of the southern Indian scripts derived from Brahmi.

==Features==
Tagbanwa is an alphasyllabary or abugida in which each letter represents a syllable consisting of a consonant and an inherent vowel /a/, a feature that it shares with many related scripts from SE Asia as they derive from variants of the Brahmic scripts of India. Similar to these scripts, vowels other than /a/ are indicated by the addition of a diacritic above (for /i/) or below (for /u/) the letter. Lone vowels are represented by their own, independent letters, thus /a/, /i/ and /u/ since there are only three. Syllables ending in a consonant are written without the final consonant. Tagbanwa is distinguished from Baybayin by the shapes of several letters, most notably ‹ka› and ‹wa› that are markedly different from other varieties.

Tagbanwa is traditionally written on bamboo in vertical columns from bottom to top and left to right. However, it is read from left to right in horizontal lines.

Tagbanwa writing makes use of single () and double () punctuation marks.

==Ibalnan==
In the 20th century, this script was adopted from the Tagbanwa by the Palawan people further south in the island. They call this alphabet Ibalnan and the vowel mark an &quot;ulit&quot;.

==Unicode==
Tagbanwa script was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2002 with the release of version 3.2.

The Unicode block for Tagbanwa is U+1760–U+177F:

<text>Haldan Keffer Hartline (December 22, 1903 – March 17, 1983) was an American physiologist who was a co-recipient (with George Wald and Ragnar Granit) of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in analyzing the neurophysiological mechanisms of vision.

==Biography==
Haldan Hartline did his undergraduate studies at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1923. He began his study of retinal electrophysiology as a National Research Council Fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, receiving his medical degree in 1927.

==Scientific career==
After attending the universities of Leipzig and Munich as an Eldridge Johnson traveling research scholar from the University of Pennsylvania, he returned to the US to take a position in the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics at Penn, which was under the directorship of Detlev W. Bronk at that time. In 1940–1941, he was Associate Professor of Physiology at Cornell Medical College in New York City but returned to Penn and stayed until 1949. Then he became professor of biophysics and chairman of the Jenkins Department of Biophysics at Johns Hopkins University in 1949. One of Hartline&#x27;s graduate students at Johns Hopkins, Paul Greengard, also won the Nobel Prize. Hartline joined the staff of Rockefeller University, New York City, in 1953 as professor of neurophysiology.

Hartline investigated the electrical responses of the retinas of certain arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks, because their visual systems are much simpler than those of humans and thus easier to study. He concentrated his studies on the eye of the horseshoe crab (&quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;). Using minute electrodes, he obtained the first record of the electrical impulses sent by a single optic nerve fibre when the receptors connected to it are stimulated by light. He found that the photoreceptor cells in the eye are interconnected in such a way that when one is stimulated, others nearby are depressed, thus enhancing the contrast in light patterns and sharpening the perception of shapes. Hartline thus built up a detailed understanding of the workings of individual photoreceptors and nerve fibres in the retina, and he showed how simple retinal mechanisms constitute vital steps in the integration of visual information.

==Awards and honors==
In 1948, Hartline was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1952 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. He was elected to the inaugural class of Fellows of the Optical Society (OSA) of America in 1959. Later, OSA elected him an Honorary Member in 1980. Hartline was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1966. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967.

== Personal life ==
Hartline married Elizabeth Kraus Hartline in 1936. They had three children.

<text>Axel Eddy Lucien [[Jonkheer]] Merckx (born 8 August 1972) is a Belgian former professional road bicycle racer and the son of five-time Tour de France champion Eddy Merckx. He is team director of UCI Continental team .

In his professional career, he won the Belgian national road race championship in 2000 and a bronze medal in the road race at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

==Cycling career==
Born in Uccle, Axel Merckx became a professional cyclist in 1993, winning the Belgian national road race championship in 2000. He vowed to make his mark by accomplishing feats that had eluded his father, such as winning a Tour de France stage at Alpe d&#x27;Huez and the Paris–Tours classic. He did not succeed, but competed in eight Tours de France and finished as the highest-placed Belgian rider six times. His personal best finish was tenth in the 1998 edition.

Merckx won the bronze medal in the road race at the 2004 Games in Athens, breaking free in the final kilometre.

During the 2006 Tour de France, Merckx announced that he signed a new contract for one extra season with Phonak, later renamed iShares. He stated that this would be his last season as a professional road bicycle racer. However, after Phonak announced that it would stop sponsoring the cycling team, Merckx signed a contract with Team T-Mobile, where he had started his professional career. During the 2006 Tour Merckx was instrumental in forcing the pace of the peloton for teammate Floyd Landis who won the Tour. He was oftentimes the only teammate able to stay with Landis and the group of favorites and he initially finished 31st overall, however it was later discovered that Landis had failed a doping control after stage 17 and the Tour win was revoked.

Merckx announced his retirement from professional cycling at the end of the 2007 Tour de France. He won his last race at Lommel, in August 2007.

His name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France then retested in 2004. Merckx was not one of then 18 riders named as testing positive for EPO but was on a list of 12 named riders whose test results were listed as &quot;suspicious&quot;.

Merckx is the owner and directeur sportif of the team.

==Personal life==
Merckx married Canadian triathlete Jodi Cross in 1997, and they lived in Kelowna, British Columbia. They have two children, Axana (born 5 May 2001) and Athina Grace (born 29 June 2005).

As of April 2024, Merckx was in a relationship with American cyclist Chloe Dygert, with whom he lives in Belgium.

When his father was made a baron—a personal title—in Belgium, he also received the hereditary title &quot;Écuyer&quot; (in French) or &quot;Jonkheer&quot; (in Dutch). Thereby Axel Merckx has also been ennobled.

<text>719 Albert, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid, approximately 2.5 kilometers in diameter, classified as a near-Earth object of the Amor group of asteroids. It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory on 3 October 1911, and subsequently a lost minor planet for 89 years. The asteroid was named in memory of Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild, an Austrian philanthropist and banker. &quot;Albert&quot; was the second Amor asteroid discovered, the first being 433 Eros.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Albert&quot; orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,567 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.55 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid&#x27;s first observation is a precovery taken in September 1911 at Heidelberg Observatory, two weeks prior to its discovery at Vienna. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins the night following its official discovery observation. &quot;Albert&quot; is also a Mars-crossing asteroid.

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has a minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , which translates into 79.1 lunar distances. On 8 September 1911, shortly before its discovery, it made its closest approach at . After another close encounter in 1941, &quot;Albert&quot; will not approach Earth to a similar distance until 2078.

== Discovery ==

Discovered in 1911 by Johann Palisa, &quot;Albert&quot; was named after one of the Imperial Observatory in Vienna&#x27;s major benefactors, Albert Salomon von Rothschild, who had died some months before. Due to inaccuracies in the asteroid&#x27;s computed orbit it was subsequently lost and not recovered until 2000 by Jeffrey Larsen using data from the Spacewatch asteroid survey project. Prior to being recovered in 2000, Albert was the last &quot;lost asteroid&quot; among those assigned numbers (69230 Hermes was not numbered until 2003). The second-last &quot;lost&quot; numbered asteroid, 878 Mildred, had been recovered in 1991.

When it was rediscovered, &quot;Albert&quot; was mistakenly thought to be a new asteroid and was designated . Upon further investigation, however, it was noticed that its orbital plane matched up nicely with the last remaining &quot;lost&quot; asteroid and it was properly identified. Using the new observational data, the period was determined to be about 4.28 years instead of the 4.1 years calculated in 1911; this discrepancy was the primary reason the asteroid was lost.

== Physical properties ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Albert&quot; is a common stony S-type asteroid. Others also characterized it as a stony asteroid, while a study using Sloan photometry considers it to be an X-type asteroid.

Most of what is known about 719 Albert comes from observations taken after its rediscovery. In 2001 it passed near the Earth, allowing for a series of observations at differing phase angles. During this pass its rotational period was calculated at 5.802 hours and a measured absolute magnitude of 15.43 together with an assumed albedo of 0.12 gave a diameter of 2.8 km. Another group led by R. P. Binzel measured an absolute magnitude of 15.8; they, however, used an assumed albedo of 0.15 leading to a calculated diameter of 2.4 km.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 2.36 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.5.

<text>Alexander Lloyd (né Wasiliev; born 19 November 1974) is an Australian singer-songwriter. Four of his albums, &quot;Black the Sun&quot;, &quot;Watching Angels Mend&quot;, &quot;Distant Light&quot; and &quot;Alex Lloyd&quot;, released between 1999 and 2005, made the top ten on the ARIA charts. Lloyd has also won the ARIA Award for Best Male Artist on three occasions.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Wasiliev was born to a father of Russian descent and a mother of Irish descent. Lloyd grew up in the inner Sydney suburb of Balmain, New South Wales, and attended Balmain High School (now Sydney Secondary College Balmain Campus).

At the age of 15, Lloyd was a member of a school rock band that won the 1990 Balmain Battle of the Bands. This mainly blues-rock band evolved into &quot;The Beefs&quot;, which began playing in local pubs and clubs and into indie rock band Mother Hubbard.

<text>Colin Michael Maurice Cashman, Baron Cashman, (born 17 December 1950) is a British actor, dancer, politician, and LGBT rights activist. A member of the Labour Party, he served as a Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands from 1999 to 2014. He has been a member of the House of Lords since 2014. He is a patron of Humanists UK.

== Acting ==
A former child actor, Cashman had a long career, principally on television in supporting roles. His first television appearance was in the 14th episode &quot;The Tin God&quot; of the ITC series &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; filmed in 1964 and aired in 1965. He appeared with the National Youth Theatre in &quot;Zigger Zagger&quot; at the Strand Theatre in the West End in March 1968. In 1980, Cashman was a regular in series two and three of ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; as Mike Wallace, codenamed Sandbagger 2 (initially Sandbagger 3). He also played First Officer Bilton in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Time-Flight&quot; in March 1982.

Cashman had been in the business for more than 20 years when he landed the role of Colin Russell in the BBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1986. In 1989 the character had the first same-sex mouth-to-mouth kiss in a British soap, watched by an estimated 17 million people and leading to some MPs calling for &quot;EastEnders&quot; to be taken off-air. He remained a regular character in the series until 1989. He also appeared at the National Theatre in Martin Sherman&#x27;s play &quot;Bent&quot; with Ian McKellen, where his understudy was Christopher Eccleston. It was announced on 25 August 2016 that Cashman would reprise his role as Colin Russell in &quot;EastEnders&quot; for two episodes in September. Cashman briefly reprised the role again in 2022 for the funeral of Dot Branning (June Brown).

== Politics ==
Cashman is a founder of Stonewall, an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, a Patron of The Food Chain, a London-based HIV charity and a patron of LGBT Labour.

In the European Parliament he was Labour spokesman on human rights.

A member of the Civil Liberties Committee, Cashman was rapporteur on several key initiatives including an initiative on funerals of those who die in third countries.

He is a trenchant critic of discrimination against minorities within the European Union. He led a cross-party coalition to tackle the rise in homophobia throughout Europe. He has in the past supported the gay pride march in Warsaw, which he attended. He was also the president of the European Parliament&#x27;s Intergroup on gay and lesbian issues. Cashman was a member of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. In 2014, he criticised McDonald&#x27;s, Coca-Cola and Visa Inc. during a session of parliament in protest at their sponsorship of the 2014 Winter Olympics taking place in Sochi, Russia, despite Vladimir Putin having recently introduced legislation against the LGBT community. Cashman cut up his Visa card during the session.

In 2007 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Staffordshire for his human rights work. That same year he was elected MEP of the Year for Justice and Fundamental Rights by his peers.

Cashman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for public and political service.

It was reported on 8 August 2014 Cashman was to be among 22 new life peers announced by the government. On 23 September 2014 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Cashman, of Limehouse in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is also his birthplace. On 23 September 2014, Cashman was appointed Labour&#x27;s special envoy on LGBT issues worldwide.

In June 2015, Cashman announced his involvement and investment in SuitLink Ltd., a global LGBT and ally professional social network.

In 2007, Cashman supported Alan Johnson for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party. In 2010, he supported David Miliband for the leadership of the party. In 2015, Cashman supported Yvette Cooper for the leadership. He supported Sadiq Khan in his bid for Mayor of London.

Cashman released his memoir &quot;One of Them: From Albert Square to Parliament Square&quot; with Bloomsbury Publishing in February 2020. It was shortlisted for the 2021 RSL Christopher Bland Prize.

He resigned from the Labour Party on 22 May 2019 in opposition to Brexit, and offered his support to the Liberal Democrats. He sat in the Lords as a non-affiliated peer, before returning to Labour on 11 January 2022.

In June 2024 he apologised on X after a tweet in which he mocked Labour MP Rosie Duffield&#x27;s concerns for her own security during the general election campaign. Shortly afterwards, he lost the Labour whip with Sir Keir Starmer saying Cashman&#x27;s comments were &quot;totally inappropriate&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Cashman registered a civil partnership with Paul Cottingham, his partner of over twenty years, on 11 March 2006. They were together a total of 31 years before Cottingham died. They were introduced in 1983 by Barbara Windsor. A fellow actor and humanitarian activist, Cottingham also worked for the Labour Party as High Value fundraiser and for Britain in Europe, and became Cashman&#x27;s researcher during his time in the European Parliament. In March 2011 he was diagnosed with a very rare cancer, angiosarcoma, and died on 23 October 2014 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. He was cremated in a humanist service at the City of London Crematorium on 7 November 2014.

<text>Xanthophylls (originally phylloxanthins) are yellow pigments that occur widely in nature and form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group; the other division is formed by the carotenes. The name is from Greek: (), meaning &quot;yellow&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;leaf&quot;), due to their formation of the yellow band seen in early chromatography of leaf pigments.

==Molecular structure==

As both are carotenoids, xanthophylls and carotenes are similar in structure, but xanthophylls contain oxygen atoms while carotenes are &quot;purely hydrocarbons&quot;, which do not contain oxygen. Their content of oxygen causes xanthophylls to be more polar (in molecular structure) than carotenes, and causes their separation from carotenes in many types of chromatography. (Carotenes are usually more orange in color than xanthophylls.)
Xanthophylls present their oxygen either as hydroxyl groups and/or as hydrogen atoms substituted by oxygen atoms when acting as a bridge to form epoxides.

==Occurrence==
Like other carotenoids, xanthophylls are found in highest quantity in the leaves of most green plants, where they act to modulate light energy and perhaps serve as a non-photochemical quenching agent to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll), which is overproduced at high light levels in photosynthesis. The xanthophylls found in the bodies of animals including humans, and in dietary animal products, are ultimately derived from plant sources in the diet. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from ingested xanthophylls—primarily lutein, which is added to chicken feed for this purpose.

The yellow color of the macula lutea (literally, &quot;yellow spot&quot;) in the retina of the human eye results from the presence of lutein and zeaxanthin. Again, both these specific xanthophylls require a source in the human diet to be present in the human eye. They protect the eye from ionizing light (blue and ultraviolet light), which they absorb; but xanthophylls do not function in the mechanism of sight itself as they cannot be converted to retinal (also called retinaldehyde or vitamin A aldehyde). Their physical arrangement in the macula lutea is believed to be the cause of Haidinger&#x27;s brush, an entoptic phenomenon that enables perception of polarizing light.

==Example compounds==
The group of xanthophylls includes (among many other compounds) lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, flavoxanthin, and α- and β-cryptoxanthin. The latter compound is the only known xanthophyll to contain a beta-ionone ring, and thus β-cryptoxanthin is the only xanthophyll that is known to possess pro-vitamin A activity for mammals. Even then, it is a vitamin only for plant-eating mammals that possess the enzyme to make retinal from carotenoids that contain beta-ionone (some carnivores lack this enzyme). In species other than mammals, certain xanthophylls may be converted to hydroxylated retinal-analogues that function directly in vision. For example, with the exception of certain flies, most insects use the xanthophyll derived R-isomer of 3-hydroxyretinal for visual activities, which means that β-cryptoxanthin and other xanthophylls (such as lutein and zeaxanthin) may function as forms of visual &quot;vitamin A&quot; for them, while carotenes (such as beta carotene) do not.

==Xanthophyll cycle==

The xanthophyll cycle involves the enzymatic removal of epoxy groups from xanthophylls (e.g. violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, diadinoxanthin) to create so-called de-epoxidised xanthophylls (e.g. diatoxanthin, zeaxanthin). These enzymatic cycles were found to play a key role in stimulating energy dissipation within light-harvesting antenna proteins by non-photochemical quenching- a mechanism to reduce the amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers. Non-photochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against photoinhibition. 
In higher plants, there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll cycle: violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin. During light stress, violaxanthin is converted, i.e. reduced, to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin, which plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid-protective anti-oxidant and by stimulating non-photochemical quenching within light-harvesting proteins. This conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin is done by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase (EC 1.23.5.1), while the reverse reaction, i.e. oxidation, is performed by zeaxanthin epoxidase (EC 1.14.15.21).

In diatoms and dinoflagellates, the xanthophyll cycle consists of the pigment diadinoxanthin, which is transformed into diatoxanthin (diatoms) or dinoxanthin (dinoflagellates) under high-light conditions.

Wright et al. (Feb 2011) found that, &quot;The increase in zeaxanthin appears to surpass the decrease in violaxanthin in spinach&quot; and commented that the discrepancy could be explained by &quot;a synthesis of zeaxanthin from beta-carotene&quot;, however they noted further study is required to explore this hypothesis.

==Food sources==
Xanthophylls are found in all young leaves and in etiolated leaves. Examples of other rich sources include papaya, peaches, prunes, and squash, which contain lutein diesters.
Kale contains about 18mg lutein and zeaxanthin per 100g, spinach about 11mg/100g, parsley about 6mg/100g, peas about 3mg/110g, squash about 2mg/100g, and pistachios about 1mg/100g.

<text>Ray Washington Traylor Jr. (May 2, 1963 – September 22, 2004) was an American professional wrestler best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring name (The) Big Boss Man, as well as for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as the Boss, the Man, the Guardian Angel, and Big Bubba Rogers. During his appearances with the WWF, Big Boss Man held the WWF World Tag Team Championship once and the WWF Hardcore Championship four times. Traylor was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2016. 

==Professional wrestling career==
===Jim Crockett Promotions (1985–1987)===
A former corrections officer in Cobb County, Georgia, Traylor debuted in 1985. He then began working as a jobber for Jim Crockett Promotions, under his real name. During this time, he faced the likes of Tully Blanchard, The Barbarian, Ivan Koloff, The Midnight Express, The Road Warriors, and Wahoo McDaniel. Seeing his potential, head booker Dusty Rhodes pulled Traylor from TV for 12 weeks, in order to repackage him as &quot;Big Bubba Rogers&quot; with Traylor debuting as Rogers on the May 31 edition of WorldWide. As Big Bubba, Traylor was a silent bodyguard for Jim Cornette, who, along with The Midnight Express, was feuding with the James Boys (Dusty Rhodes and Magnum T. A., under masks). He got a solid push as a seemingly unstoppable heel and feuded with Rhodes (the top face at the time) in a series of Bunkhouse Stampede matches in 1986. He and Rhodes were tied for wins in this series, leading to a tiebreaking cage match, which Rhodes won on February 27. Traylor also defeated Ron Garvin in a Louisville Street Fight at Starrcade 1986.

===Universal Wrestling Federation (1987)===
In 1987, Traylor joined the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) after it was purchased by Jim Crockett. On April 19, Traylor challenged and won the UWF Heavyweight Championship from One Man Gang, who was leaving the UWF for the World Wrestling Federation. Following his title win, he aligned himself with General Skandor Akbar and his Devastation Inc. stable. Traylor would hold the championship for nearly 3 months defending it against Steve Cox, Barry Windham, and Michael Hayes before losing the title to &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams on July 11, 1987, in Oklahoma City during the Great American Bash 1987 tour.

In the second WarGames match on July 30, 1987, The Road Warriors, Nikita Koloff, Dusty Rhodes, and Paul Ellering defeated The Four Horsemen and Traylor as The War Machine at 19:38 when Road Warrior Animal forced the War Machine to submit by gouging his eyes with a spiked armband.

After losing the heavyweight championship, Traylor began pursuing the UWF Tag Team Championship which were held by The Lightning Express as he teamed with The Angel of Death, The Terminator, and Black Bart, but was never able to win the titles.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1988)===
Traylor made his first tour to Japan in March 1988 for All Japan Pro Wrestling as Big Bubba. 

===World Wrestling Federation (1988–1993)===
====Twin Towers (1988–1990)====

In May 1988, Traylor joined the WWF as &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, a character inspired by his previous career as a corrections officer. Wrestling as a heel and managed by Slick, Boss Man&#x27;s post-match routine often included handcuffing his defeated opponents to the ring ropes and beating them with a nightstick or ball and chain.
After defeating Koko B. Ware at the inaugural SummerSlam, Boss Man began his first major WWF angle by attacking Hulk Hogan on &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot;. During this feud, he also challenged Randy Savage for the WWF Championship, and formed a team with Akeem (formerly billed as One Man Gang, his UWF opponent) to form The Twin Towers. They feuded with Hogan and Savage (who had formed The Mega Powers), and were a key part in the top storyline of Savage turning on Hogan, leading to the WrestleMania V main event; in the later part of a tag match between the four on &quot;The Main Event II&quot;, Hogan abandoned Savage to attend to the hurt Miss Elizabeth and went backstage. After being double-teamed for a while, Savage eventually rallied until Hogan returned to the match. After Savage tagged Hogan in, he slapped Hogan and left him to defeat The Twin Towers on his own, which led to The Mega Powers&#x27; demise as Savage beat Hulk in the backstage medical room where fellow wrestlers, managers and staff had to break them up.

At WrestleMania V, The Twin Towers defeated The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and then, for most of spring and early summer 1989, feuded with Demolition (Ax and Smash) over the Tag Team Championship. Meanwhile, Boss Man concluded his feud with Hogan in a series of Steel Cage matches; one of the most memorable aired on the May 27 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXI&quot;, with Hogan&#x27;s WWF Championship on the line. During the match, Hogan superplexed Boss Man off the top of the cage.

====Face turn and various feuds (1990–1993)====

The Big Boss Man turned face on the February 24, 1990, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, when Ted DiBiase had paid Slick to have Boss Man retrieve the Million Dollar Championship belt from Jake Roberts, who had stolen it. Boss Man retrieved a bag containing both the belt and Roberts&#x27; pet python, Damien. On &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot;, he refused to accept DiBiase&#x27;s money for the bag, and returned it to Roberts.

As a face, Boss Man adopted a new entrance theme called &quot;Hard Times&quot; that was performed by the lead singer of Survivor, Jimi Jamison. Boss Man then feuded with former partner Akeem, defeating him in less than two minutes at WrestleMania VI. As part of his face turn, he later stopped handcuffing and beating jobbers after matches. He made peace with Hogan, appearing in his corner in his match against Earthquake at Summerslam 1990, and teaming with him at the 1990 Survivor Series, along with &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan and Tugboat, to defeat Earthquake&#x27;s team.

In the fall of 1990, Boss Man began feuding with Bobby Heenan and Heenan Family after Heenan continually insulted Boss Man&#x27;s mother. He won a series of matches against Heenan Family members in 1991, including The Barbarian at the Royal Rumble and Mr. Perfect (via disqualification) at WrestleMania VII in an Intercontinental Championship match, which featured the return of André the Giant. At SummerSlam, he defeated The Mountie, who he feuded with to see who the real officer of the WWF was in a Jailhouse Match, a match in which the loser must spend a night in jail; this was the only such match ever held by the promotion.

In 1992, Boss Man began feuding with Nailz, an ex-convict character who, in a series of promos aired before his debut, claimed Boss Man had been his abusive Officer in prison, and warned he was seeking revenge. On the May 30 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;, Nailz – clad in an orange prison jumpsuit – ran into the ring and attacked Boss Man, handcuffing him to the top rope and repeatedly choking and beating him with the nightstick. Boss Man took time off TV to sell his (kayfabe) injuries, eventually returning and having a series of matches with Nailz in the latter half of 1992. The feud culminated at Survivor Series, when Boss Man defeated Nailz in a Nightstick on a Pole match. The Big Boss Man&#x27;s last pay-per-view match came at the 1993 Royal Rumble, where he suffered his first clean loss on a pay-per-view to Bam Bam Bigelow.

He left the WWF shortly after a house show in Gatineau, Quebec, on March 14, 1993. During the next few months he made appearances in Japan, Australia, the USWA and SMW. On December 4, 1993, he made a one-time return to the WWF as a special guest referee to officiate the main event of a house show in Anaheim, California, between Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett. Boss Man was expected to rejoin to the WWF but elected to sign with WCW instead.

===World Championship Wrestling (1993–1998)===
====Early years (1993–1995)====
Traylor returned to the United States to debut for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), as &quot;The Boss&quot;, on the December 18, 1993, episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, pinning the International World Champion, Rick Rude, in a non-title match. A face, he received a title match against Rude at Starrcade &#x27;93: 10th Anniversary, but lost. In light of legal complaints from the WWF regarding the similarity of &quot;The Boss&quot; to &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, Traylor was renamed &quot;The Guardian Angel&quot;, and wore similar attire to those in the organization he was named after. In early 1995, he turned heel, and became again known as &quot;Big Bubba Rogers&quot;. He defeated Sting at Uncensored in 1995.

====Dungeon of Doom and feud with nWo (1996–1998)====
In 1996, Rogers joined the Dungeon of Doom, and feuded with former Dungeon of Doom member John Tenta, along with newcomer Glacier. By the end of the year, he had turned on the Dungeon of Doom and joined the nWo. His stay in the nWo was brief, with Traylor knocked out by an unknown assailant at the start of the February 17, 1997, edition of Nitro, with Traylor later explaining Eric Bischoff fired him from the nWo while he was temporarily paralyzed. Traylor returned on September 1, now using his real name and vowing to rip Bischoff&#x27;s head off, feuding with the nWo. He formed an alliance with The Steiner Brothers, who also sought Ted DiBiase as their manager. The union abruptly ended when Scott Steiner turned on them to join the nWo in February 1998. After losing his final WCW match to Goldberg on the March 30 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he was sent home and the company let his contract expire.

===Return to WWF/E (1998–2003)===
====Hardcore and Tag Team Champion (1998–1999)====


Traylor rejoined the WWF shortly after his WCW release and once again became &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;. On October 12, 1998, he returned to television with a new look, abandoning his blue police shirt for an all-black SWAT-style uniform, including a tactical vest and gloves. He served as Vince McMahon&#x27;s bodyguard during his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin and his later feud with D-Generation X (DX), briefly wearing a mask before his identity was revealed.

Big Boss Man was one of the first members of McMahon&#x27;s heel stable, The Corporation, and served as a bodyguard for other members, such as Vince&#x27;s son Shane. While in The Corporation, Big Boss Man won the WWF Tag Team Championship with Ken Shamrock and won the WWF Hardcore Championship four times overall. On the November 30, 1998, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Big Boss Man defeated Mankind to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. A few weeks later, Big Boss Man and Shamrock were initially defeated by the WWF Tag Team Champions the New Age Outlaws at the December 1998 pay-per-view Rock Bottom: In Your House; however, on the following day&#x27;s &quot;Raw is War&quot; broadcast, Big Boss Man and Shamrock defeated the New Age Outlaws in a rematch to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. As a result, Big Boss Man was the holder of two championships in WWF, although Big Boss Man lost the WWF Hardcore Championship to New Age Outlaws member Road Dogg nearly two weeks later. Big Boss Man entered the 1999 Royal Rumble match as the 22nd entrant, and he eliminated both X-Pac and D&#x27;Lo Brown before being eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. At the same Royal Rumble event, Big Boss Man defeated New Age Outlaws member Road Dogg in a non-title match while Big Boss Man&#x27;s partner Shamrock defeated the other New Age Outlaws member Billy Gunn in a separate singles match. Big Boss Man and Shamrock eventually lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to the team of Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett on the January 25, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. At WrestleMania XV, Big Boss Man and The Undertaker faced each other in a Hell in a Cell match, which The Undertaker won. After the match, The Undertaker hanged him from the roof of the cage (an illusion made possible by a full-body safety harness concealed under Big Boss Man&#x27;s outfit). While a video package of the &quot;WrestleMania Rage Party&quot; was then shown, Big Boss Man had to be safely taken down onto a stretcher so that he could get to a hospital just fine with minor injuries.

In the WWF&#x27;s hardcore division, Big Boss Man&#x27;s major feud was with Al Snow, a feud that eventually involved Snow&#x27;s pet chihuahua, Pepper. Big Boss Man had first won the WWF Hardcore Championship from Snow at the July Fully Loaded pay-per-view. One month later at SummerSlam, the two had a Falls Count Anywhere match that spilled into the backstage area, the street and, finally, into a nearby bar. Just prior to the match, Snow had set Pepper&#x27;s pet carrier near the entrance way; minutes into the match, Big Boss Man picked it up, taunted Pepper, struck Snow with the carrier, and carelessly tossed it behind him. Commentator Jim Ross then immediately apologized to viewers for the act, and stated that Pepper had been removed from the box before the match. Snow ended up as the winner of the match, thus regaining the WWF Hardcore Championship.

Snow&#x27;s reign was short-lived as Big Boss Man regained the WWF Hardcore Championship on the subsequent episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Two weeks later, Big Boss Man kidnapped and ransomed Pepper, arranging a meeting in which he fed Snow a meat dish supposedly made from Pepper&#x27;s remains. On the same night, Big Boss Man lost the WWF Hardcore Championship to the returning British Bulldog, in which Bulldog then gifted the title to Snow. Big Boss Man and Snow settled their feud in a Kennel from Hell match at Unforgiven, in which a blue solid steel cage surrounded the ring itself and also the ringside was surrounded by a chain-link fenced &quot;cell&quot;. The object of the match was to escape from the cage and the cell while avoiding &quot;attack dogs&quot; (which turned out to be disappointingly docile) positioned outside the ring. Snow won the match and retained the WWF Hardcore Championship. Big Boss Man would later win back the WWF Hardcore Championship in a triple threat match involving Snow and Big Show nearly two weeks later. Big Boss Man held the championship for slightly over three months, although he only defended it sparingly, which included the likes of Al Snow, Faarooq, Kane, and The Godfather.

While as WWF Hardcore Champion, Big Boss Man feuded with Big Show over the WWF Championship; during the feud, Big Boss Man showed up at Big Show&#x27;s father&#x27;s funeral, made some disrespectful remarks, then chained the casket to the back of his car and drove off. Big Show attempted to save the coffin by jumping on it, riding it for a few yards before losing his grip and tumbling off. Big Boss Man became the #1 contender for the WWF Championship by defeating The Rock on the November 15, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. At Armageddon, Big Show defeated Big Boss Man to retain the title. On the following episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Big Show defeated Big Boss Man and Prince Albert in a handicap match to retain his title, marking the end of the feud.

====Various tag teams and departure (1999–2003)====

On the December 30, 1999, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Boss Man and Prince Albert defeated Test in a handicap match as part of the McMahon-Helmsley Regime&#x27;s vendetta against Test. The alliance between Boss Man and Prince Albert ended on the January 13, 2000, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after they lost to the Hardy Boyz. Over the following weeks, Boss Man feuded with both Prince Albert and Test, with Test winning the WWF Hardcore Championship from Boss Man on the January 17, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. Boss Man entered the 2000 Royal Rumble match, where he eliminated Rikishi, Chyna and Faarooq, before being eliminated by The Rock. On the March 19 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, he introduced Bull Buchanan as his protégé. They teamed to defeat The Godfather and D&#x27;Lo Brown at WrestleMania 2000, and the Acolytes Protection Agency the next month at Backlash. On the June 5 &quot;Raw is War&quot;, after losing to The Hardy Boyz and subsequently arguing, Boss Man knocked Buchanan out with his nightstick when his back was turned and the team split up.

In the summer of 2000, Boss Man disappeared from the WWF&#x27;s primary television shows, wrestling mainly on &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;, where he had a minor feud with Crash Holly until suffering a legit injury in April 2001, keeping him out of The Invasion storyline, which featured invading WCW and ECW wrestlers, for much of the year. When he returned on the December 20, 2001, of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he formed a team with Booker T, after Vince McMahon ordered him to be Booker T&#x27;s enforcer. On the December 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Boss Man and Booker T defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a handicap match. On the January 7, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Boss Man and Booker T were defeated by Austin and The Rock. On the January 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Boss Man lost to Diamond Dallas Page. At the Royal Rumble, Boss Man competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Rikishi. The team quietly split in late January 2002, and Boss Man returned to &quot;Jakked/Metal&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;. In April, he formed a short-lived tag team with Mr. Perfect after both were drafted to the Raw brand. On the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Boss Man and Mr. Perfect lost to The Hardy Boyz. On the May 26 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, he lost his final WWE match to Tommy Dreamer. Once again, he was taken off the main roster after an injury from a motorcycle accident.

Traylor was assigned to train developmental wrestlers in Ohio Valley Wrestling. He wrestled one match for OVW when he teamed with John Cena and Charlie Haas defeating Lance Cade, René Duprée and Sean O&#x27;Haire on November 6, 2002. He was released from WWE in 2003. He took a nearly two-year hiatus. 

===Later career (2004)===
After leaving WWE, and being inactive in wrestling Traylor returned on June 20, 2004, to teaming with Greg Valentine losing Jim Duggan and Tonga Kid at Empire Wrestling Federation Ted DiBiase&#x27;s Christian Event in Wilcox, Arizona. 

Traylor&#x27;s final matches were in the International Wrestling Association of Japan, where he competed in a tournament for the vacant IWA World Heavyweight Championship. He made it to the final by defeating Freddie Krueger before losing to Jim Duggan.

==Personal life==
Traylor had two daughters, Lacy Abilene Traylor and Megan Chyanne Traylor, and was married to Angela, his childhood sweetheart.

Traylor suffered a motorcycle accident on his Harley-Davidson in May 2002 after he hit a deer, and was badly injured. He spent a year recovering from his injuries, and he was badly affected by close friend Curt Hennig&#x27;s death in 2003.

In July 2004, Traylor unsuccessfully ran for Commission chairman for Paulding County, Georgia. He was the owner of a Dallas, Georgia, storage company called RWT Enterprises.

===Death and legacy===

Traylor died of a heart attack on September 22, 2004, at his home in Dallas, Georgia. According to &quot;The Wrestling Observer&quot;, Traylor and his family were visiting with his sister at his home, and while his two daughters went upstairs to play, his wife Angela briefly left the room at about 10:00p.m., and returned to find him dead on the sofa. He was 41 years old. Traylor was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016, with his wife and daughters accepting the award on his behalf.

<doc id="591759" wikidata="Q911956" url="?curid=591759" title="Ey Iran">
<text>&quot;&quot; () is an Iranian patriotic song that serves as the country&#x27;s unofficial national anthem. The music was composed by Ruhollah Khaleqi, and the lyrics were written by Hossein Gol-e-Golab. This anthem was first performed by Gholam-Hossein Banan.

==History==

The song&#x27;s history dates back to World War II. In September 1941, Allied forces occupied Iran following an Anglo-Soviet invasion that overthrew Reza Shah. Hossein Gol-e-Golab was inspired to write a poem on Iranian nationalism when he saw Allied flags waving from an Iranian military barracks in Tehran. One day, when visiting Tehran, Gol-e-Golab witnessed a heated conversation between a British soldier and an Iranian officer. When Gol-e-Golab recounted the incident, he wanted to write a poem to keep Iran and the Iranian spirit alive in it. Khaleqi decided to compose the song and Banan would sing the poem.

Gol-e-Golab was inspired to write this song by his patriotism. He was quoted as saying:

&quot; served as the country&#x27;s de facto national anthem for a brief period with the establishment of Iran&#x27;s interim government following the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

==Performances==
Its first performance was held for two consecutive nights on 27 October 1944 in the military primary school, performed by Banan on Istanbul Street. &quot; garnered a lot of popularity that listeners demanded its repetition; thus, it was renewed three times. The reception and impact of this anthem caused the then minister of culture to invite the musicians to the Sound Broadcasting Center to record a page of it and broadcast it daily on Radio Tehran.

After the Revolution of 1979, several people were imprisoned for collaborating in the preparation of this anthem, and singing it was considered a crime, but after a while, it was used to inspire soldiers in the Iran–Iraq War.

In 1990, Golnush Khaleqi, the daughter of Ruhollah Khaleghi, who was in Tehran for the 25th anniversary of her father&#x27;s death, re-arranged the anthem for orchestra, solo and group singing, which was released on the album &quot;May Nab&quot; by Sorush Publications. The monologue in this version is performed by Rashid Vatandust.

<doc id="591762" wikidata="Q5282892" url="?curid=591762" title="Distant Light (Alex Lloyd album)">
<text>Distant Light is the third studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Alex Lloyd. It was released in September 2003, and peaked at number 9 on the ARIA Charts and it was certified gold.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, the album was nominated for two awards.

==Background and released ==
On the Chaos Music website, Lloyd states that the album is based on homesickness after a long stretch on the road promoting his second album &quot;Watching Angels Mend&quot;. &quot;That was the headspace of where I was at the time. We went to a lot of strange places, maybe places I don’t want to revisit. It was a pretty lonely time. I think I’d reached a point where I’d just travelled too much.&quot;

&quot;Distant Light&quot; features Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey of Midnight Oil on several tracks. It was produced by Stuart Miller, who had also produced &quot;Watching Angels Mend&quot; and mixed by Tony Hoffer who has worked with Air, Beck and Turin Brakes.

<doc id="591767" wikidata="Q474537" url="?curid=591767" title="Nicomachean Ethics">
<text>The Nicomachean Ethics (; , ) is Aristotle&#x27;s best-known work on ethics: the science of the good for human life, that which is the goal or end at which all our actions aim. It consists of ten sections, referred to as books, and is closely related to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;. The work is essential for the interpretation of Aristotelian ethics.

The text centers upon the question of how to best live, a theme previously explored in the works of Plato, Aristotle&#x27;s friend and teacher. In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, he describes how Socrates, the friend and teacher of Plato, turned philosophy to human questions, whereas pre-Socratic philosophy had only been theoretical, and concerned with natural science. Ethics, Aristotle claimed, is &quot;practical&quot; rather than &quot;theoretical&quot;, in the Aristotelian senses of these terms. It is not merely an investigation about what good consists of, but it aims to be of practical help in achieving the good.

It is connected to another of Aristotle&#x27;s practical works, &quot;Politics&quot;, which reflects a similar goal: for people to become good, through the creation and maintenance of social institutions. Ethics is about how individuals should best live, while politics adopts the perspective of a law-giver, looking at the good of a whole community.

The &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; had an important influence on the European Middle Ages, and was one of the core works of medieval philosophy. As such, it was of great significance in the development of all modern philosophy as well as European law and theology. Aristotle became known as &quot;the Philosopher&quot; (for example, this is how he is referred to in the works of Thomas Aquinas). In the Middle Ages, a synthesis between Aristotelian ethics and Christian theology became widespread, as introduced by Albertus Magnus. The most important version of this synthesis was that of Thomas Aquinas. Other more &quot;Averroist&quot; Aristotelians such as Marsilius of Padua were also influential.

Until well into the seventeenth century, the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; was still widely regarded as the main authority for the discipline of ethics at Protestant universities, with over fifty Protestant commentaries published before 1682. During the seventeenth century, however, authors such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes argued that the medieval and Renaissance Aristotelian tradition in practical thinking was impeding philosophy.

Interest in Aristotle&#x27;s ethics has been renewed by the virtue ethics revival. Recent philosophers in this field include Alasdair MacIntyre, G. E. M. Anscombe, Mortimer Adler, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Martha Nussbaum.

==Title and abbreviations==
The title is usually assumed to refer to Aristotle&#x27;s son Nicomachus. One theory is that the work was dedicated to him, another is that it was edited by him (though he is believed to have died young, probably before he could have managed this alone.) Another possibility is that the work was dedicated to Aristotle&#x27;s father, who was also named Nicomachus. It is unlikely that it was dedicated by Aristotle himself, as it does not appear to be in a form Aristotle intended for publication. Rather it seems to be something like lecture notes meant for the lecturer or for consultation by students.

The oldest known reference to the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; by that title is in the works of Atticus (c. ), who also references the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot; by name.

In Greek the title is &#x27; (), which is sometimes also given in the genitive form as &#x27; (). The Latin version is or .

=== Referencing ===
The &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is often abbreviated as NE or EN. Books and chapters are referred to with Roman and Arabic numerals respectively, along with corresponding Bekker numbers. For example, &quot;NE II.2, 1103b1&quot; means &quot;&quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, book II, chapter 2, Bekker page 1103, column b, line number 1&quot;. Chapter divisions, and the number of chapters in a book, are somewhat arbitrary and sometimes different compilers divide books into chapters differently.

==Background==
Parts of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; overlap with Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;: Books V, VI, and VII of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; are identical to Books IV, V, and VI of the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;. Opinions about the relationship between the two works differ. One suggestion is that three books from &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; were lost and subsequently replaced by three parallel works from the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;, which would explain the overlap. Another is that both works were not put into their current form by Aristotle, but by an editor.

No consensus dates the composition of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. However, a reference in the text to a battle in the Third Sacred War in acts as a for that part of the work. The traditional position, held for example by W. D. Ross, is that the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is a product of the last period of Aristotle&#x27;s life, during his time in Athens from until his death in .

According to Strabo and Plutarch, after Aristotle&#x27;s death, his library and writings went to Theophrastus (Aristotle&#x27;s successor as head of the Lycaeum and the Peripatetic school). After the death of Theophrastus, the library went to Neleus of Scepsis.

The Kingdom of Pergamon conscripted books for a royal library, leading the heirs of Neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent its seizure. The library remained there for about a century and a half, in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation. On the death of Attalus III, which also ended the royal library ambitions, the existence of Aristotelian library was disclosed, and it was purchased by Apellicon and returned to Athens in about .

Apellicon sought to recover the texts, many of which were degraded by their time in the cellar. He had them copied into new manuscripts, and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable.

When Sulla seized Athens in , he seized the library and transferred it to Rome. There, Andronicus of Rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of Aristotle&#x27;s works (and works attributed to him). These relics form the basis of present-day editions, including that of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;.

Aspasius wrote a commentary on the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; in the early . It suggests &quot;that the text [at that time] was very like what it is now, with little or no difference, for instance, of order or arrangement, and with readings identical for the most part with those preserved in one or other of our best [extant manuscripts].&quot; Aspasius noted &quot;the existence of variants—which shows that there was some element of uncertainty as to the text even in this comparatively early stage in the history of the book.&quot;

The oldest surviving manuscript is the &quot;Codex Laurentianus&quot; LXXXI.11 (referred to as &quot;Kb&quot;) which dates to the 10th century.

==Synopsis==
Aristotle was the first philosopher to write ethical treatises, and begins by considering how to approach the subject. He argues that the correct approach for subjects like Ethics or Politics, which involve a discussion on beauty or justice, is to start by considering what would be roughly agreed to be true by people of good upbringing and substantial life experience, and then to work from those intuitions toward a more rigorous understanding. Over the course of the &quot;Ethics&quot;, Aristotle alternates between a theoretical/systematic approach to formalizing ethics and an empirical approach of consulting opinion, prior philosophical or literary works, and linguistic clues.

Aristotle&#x27;s ethics is said to be teleological, in that it is based on an investigation into the , or end, of a human. In Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, the of a thing &quot;can hardly be separated from the perfection of that thing&quot;, and &quot;the final cause of anything becomes identical with the good of that thing, so that the end and the good become synonymous terms&quot;.

Taking this approach, Aristotle proposes that the highest good for humans is , a Greek word often translated as &quot;flourishing&quot; or sometimes &quot;happiness&quot;. Aristotle argues that is a way of taking action () that is appropriate to the human &quot;soul&quot; () at its most &quot;excellent&quot; or virtuous (). is the most &quot;complete&quot; aim that people can have, because they choose it for its own sake. An excellent human is one who is good at living life, who does so well and beautifully (). Aristotle says such a person would also be a serious () human being. He also asserts that virtue for a human must involve reason in thought and speech (), as this is a task () of human living.

After proposing this ultimate end of human activity, Aristotle discusses what ethics means. Aristotelian Ethics is about how specific beneficial habits (virtues) enable a person to achieve and how to develop a virtuous character (). He describes a sequence of necessary steps: The first step is to practice righteous actions, perhaps under the guidance of teachers, in order to develop good habits. Practiced habits form a stable character in which those habits become voluntary, which then achieves .

The Greek word , or &quot;character&quot;, is related to modern words such as ethics and ethos. Aristotle does not equate character with habit ( in Greek, with a short &quot;e&quot;) because character involves conscious choice. Instead, character is an like health or knowledge—a stable disposition that must be maintained with effort. However, good habits are a precondition for good character.

Aristotle reviews specific ways in which people are thought worthy of praise or blame. He describes how the highest types of praise require having all the virtues, and these in turn imply more than good character, indeed a kind of wisdom. The four essential virtues are:
*Magnanimity (&quot;great soul&quot;), which requires a correct attitude towards the honor this involves, in Book IV.
*Justice, as established by a good ruler in a good community, in Book V.
*, or practical judgment, in Book VI.
*Friendship, in Book VIII.

(The &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot; VIII.3 also uses the word &quot;&quot;, the nobility of a gentleman (), to describe this same concept of a virtue encompassing all the moral virtues.)

The view that praiseworthy virtues in their highest form, even virtues such as courage, require intellectual virtue, is a theme Aristotle associates with Socrates; it is portrayed in the Socratic dialogues of Plato. Aristotle professes to work differently from Plato by trying to start with what well-brought up men would agree with, and to take a practical approach, but by Book VII Aristotle argues that the highest of virtues is not a practical one: contemplative wisdom (). However, achieving wisdom requires all the virtues of character, or &quot;moral virtues&quot;.

Aristotle&#x27;s view that the highest good for man has both a practical and theoretical side is in the tradition of Socrates and Plato—but in opposition to pre-Socratic philosophy. As Ronna Burger points out: &quot;The &quot;Ethics&quot; does not end at its apparent peak, identifying perfect happiness with the life devoted to ; instead it goes on to introduce the need for a study of legislation, on the grounds that it is not sufficient only to know about virtue, but one should try to put that knowledge to use.&quot; At the end of the book, according to Burger, the thoughtful reader is led to understand that &quot;the end we are seeking is what we have been doing&quot; while engaging with the &quot;Ethics&quot;.

===Book I===

Book I attempts to define the subject matter of ethics and justify his method for examining it. As part of this, Aristotle considers common-sense opinions along with those of poets and philosophers.

====Who should study ethics, and how====

Aristotle points out that &quot;things that are beautiful and just, about which politics investigates, involve great disagreement and inconsistency, so that they are thought to belong only to convention and not to nature&quot;. For this reason Aristotle says we should not demand exacting rigor (), like we might expect from a mathematician, but rather look for answers about &quot;things that are so for the most part&quot;. He claimed that people are satisfactory judges of such subjects after they become acquainted with them. However as the young (in age or in character) are inexperienced, they are less likely to benefit from this kind of study.

I.6 contains a famous digression in which Aristotle appears to question his &quot;friends&quot; who &quot;introduced the forms&quot;. This refers to Plato and his school, and their Theory of Forms. Aristotle says that while both &quot;the truth and one&#x27;s friends&quot; are loved, &quot;it is a sacred thing to give the highest honor to the truth&quot;, signaling his belief that the Theory of Forms is not that. A Forms-based discussion of the Good might try to discover some characteristic that all good things have in common. Aristotle does not find this approach promising because the word &quot;good&quot; is used in too many ways. He says that while it is probably not coincidental that various things called good share that description, it is perhaps better to &quot;let go for now&quot; the quest for some common characteristic, as this &quot;would be more at home in another type of philosophic inquiry&quot;: not helpful for discussing how people should act, in the same way that doctors do not need to philosophize over the definition of health in order to treat each case.

====Defining and the aim of the &quot;Ethics&quot;====
The opening passage asserts that all technical arts, all investigations (every , including the &quot;Ethics&quot; itself), indeed all deliberate actions and choices, aim at some good apart from themselves. Many such goods are intermediate, desired only as means to higher goods.

Aristotle asserts that there is one highest good— (traditionally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;flourishing&quot;)—which is what good politics should target, because what is best for an individual is less beautiful () and divine () than what is good for a people () or community (). Politics organizes communal practical life, so the proper aim of politics should include the proper aim of all other pursuits, and &quot;this end would be the human good ()&quot;. The human good is a practical target, in contrast to Plato&#x27;s references to &quot;the Good itself&quot;. Aristotle concludes that ethics (&quot;our investigation&quot; or ) is &quot;in a certain way political&quot;.

Aristotle then elaborates on the methodological concern with exactness. He claims that ethics, unlike some other types of philosophy, is inexact and uncertain. He says that it would be unreasonable to expect demonstrations of strict mathematical exactitude, but rather &quot;each man judges correctly those matters with which he is acquainted&quot;.

Aristotle states that while most would agree to call the highest aim of humanity , and also to equate this with both living well and doing things well, disagreement about what this is persists between the majority () and &quot;the wise&quot;. He distinguishes three possible ways of life that people associate with happiness:
*the way of slavish pleasure
*the way of refined and active honorable politics 
*the way of contemplation

Aristotle mentions two other possibilities that he argues can be discarded:
*passive virtue that suffers evils and misfortunes. Aristotle says no one would propose such a thing unless sacrificing to defend a shaky hypothesis (as Sachs points out, this is what Plato depicts Socrates doing in his Gorgias).
*money making, which Aristotle asserts is a life based on a merely intermediate good

Each commonly proposed happy way of life is a target that some people aim at for its own sake, just like they aim at happiness itself for its own sake. As for honor, pleasure, and intelligence (), as well as every virtue, though they lead to happiness, even if they did not we would still pursue them.

Happiness in life, therefore, includes the virtues, and Aristotle adds that it would include self-sufficiency ()—not the self-sufficiency of a hermit, but of someone with a family, friends, and community—someone whose leaves them satisfied, lacking nothing.

To describe more clearly what happiness is like, Aristotle next asks what the work or function () of a human is. All living things have nutrition and growth as a work, all animals (according to Aristotle&#x27;s definition of animal) have perception as part of their work, but what work is particularly human? The answer according to Aristotle is that it must involve reason (), including both being open to persuasion by reasoning, and thinking things through. Not only does human happiness involve reason, but is also an active being-at-work (), not just a potential. And it is measured over a lifetime, because &quot;one swallow does not make a spring&quot;. The definition given is therefore:
Because the good of a person is a work or function, just as we can contrast casual harpists with serious harpists, the person who lives well and beautifully in this actively rational and virtuous way will be a &quot;serious&quot; () person.

If happiness is virtue, or a certain virtue, then it must not just be a condition of being virtuous, potentially, but an actual way of virtuously &quot;being at work&quot; as a human. For as in the Ancient Olympic Games, &quot;it is not the most beautiful or the strongest who are crowned, but those who compete&quot;. And such virtue will be good, beautiful, and pleasant; indeed Aristotle asserts that in most people different pleasures are in conflict with each other while &quot;the things that are pleasant to those who are passionately devoted to what is beautiful are the things that are pleasant by nature and of this sort are actions in accordance with virtue&quot;. External goods are also necessary in such a virtuous life, because a person who lacks things such as good family and friends might find it difficult to be happy.

====Questions that might be raised about the definition====
Aristotle addresses some objections that might be raised against his proposed definition of .

First, he considers a Socratic question (found for example in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;) of whether might be a result of learning or habit or training, or perhaps divine grace or random chance. Aristotle says that does result from some sort of learning or training. But, although not god-given, is one of the most divine things, and &quot;for what is greatest and most beautiful to be left to chance would be too discordant&quot;.
Aristotle says must be considered over a lifetime, otherwise Priam, for example, might be defined as unhappy only because of his unhappy old age.

Concerning the importance of chance to , Aristotle argues that a person at work in accordance with virtue &quot;will bear with dignity whatever fortune sends, and will always make the best of his circumstances, as a good general will turn the forces at his command to the best account, and a good shoemaker will make the best shoe that can be made out of a given piece of leather, and so on with all other crafts&quot;. Only many great misfortunes will limit how blessed such a life can be, but &quot;even in these circumstances something beautiful shines through&quot;.

Aristotle says that it &quot;seems too unfeeling and contrary to people&#x27;s opinions&quot; to claim that the postmortem &quot;fortunes of one&#x27;s descendants and all one&#x27;s friends have no influence at all&quot; on one&#x27;s . But he says it seems that if anything at all gets through to the deceased in this indirect way, whether good or bad, it would be something faint and small.

Aristotle distinguishes virtue and . Virtue, through which people &quot;become apt at performing beautiful actions&quot; is &quot;praiseworthy&quot;, while is something beyond praise: &quot;blessed&quot;, &quot;since every one of us does everything else for the sake of this, and we set down the source and cause of good things as something honored and divine&quot;.

====Introduction to the rest of the Ethics====
Aristotle asserts that some things can be accepted about the soul (another reference to Plato), including the division of the soul into rational and irrational parts, and the further division of the irrational parts into two parts:
*one that is &quot;not human&quot; but &quot;vegetative&quot; and most at work during sleep, when virtue is least obvious
*another that is amenable to reason: &quot;the faculty of appetite or of desire&quot; in the soul that can comprehend and obey reason, much as a child can act &quot;rationally&quot; not by reasoning but by obeying a wise father.

The virtues then are similarly divided, into intellectual () virtues, and virtues of character concerning the irrational part of the soul that is amenable to reason.

This second set of virtues, &quot;moral virtues&quot; as they are often translated, are the central topic of Book II.

===Books II–III: Concerning excellence of character, or moral virtue===

Aristotle says that whereas intellectual virtue requires teaching, experience, and time, virtue of character comes about as a consequence of adopting good habits. Humans have a natural capacity to develop these virtues, but that training determines whether they actually develop.

Aristotle says moral virtues are found at a mean () between deficiency and excess. For example, someone who flees is a coward (with a deficiency of bravery, or an excessive response to fear), while someone who fears nothing is rash (the opposite extreme). The virtue of courage is a &quot;mean&quot; between these two extremes. For this reason, Aristotle is considered a proponent of the &quot;golden mean&quot; doctrine. People first perform actions that are virtuous, possibly guided by teachers or experience; these habitual actions then become virtues when people characteristically choose such actions deliberately.

According to Aristotle, character, properly understood, is not just any tendency or habit but something that influences what causes pleasure or pain. A virtuous person feels pleasure when they perform the most beautiful or noble () actions; their practice of virtues and their pleasure therefore coincide. A person who is not virtuous, on the other hand, often finds pleasure to be misleading. For this reason, the study of virtue (or of politics) requires consideration of pleasure and pain.

It is not enough to perform virtuous actions by chance or by following advice. It is not like in the productive arts, where the product is judged as well-made or not. To be a virtuous person, one&#x27;s virtuous actions must be

* done knowingly
* chosen for their own sakes
* chosen according to a stable disposition (not on a whim, or uncharacteristically).

Just knowing what would be virtuous is not enough.

According to Aristotle&#x27;s analysis, the soul contains:

* feelings (), 
* faculties or capacities (), 
* acquired habits ().

Virtues are — none of the other qualities of the soul are chosen, and none is praiseworthy in the way that virtue is.

As with the productive arts (), with virtues of character the focus must be on the making of a good human in a static sense, and on making a human that functions well as a human.

In II.7 Aristotle gives a list of character virtues and vices that he discusses in Books II and III. This list differs between the &quot;Nicomachean&quot; and &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;. He reiterates that it is not meant to be exhaustive.

Aristotle also mentions some &quot;ways of observing the mean&quot; that involve feelings or emotions: a sense of shame, for example, is sometimes praised, or said to be in excess or deficiency. Righteous indignation () is a sort of mean between and envy. Aristotle says he intends to discuss such cases later, before the discussion of Justice in Book V. But the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; does not discuss righteous indignation there (which is however discussed in the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot; Book VIII).

Aristotle says that in practice people tend by nature towards the more pleasurable of the vicious extremes, and therefore to them the virtuous mean appears to be relatively closer to the less pleasant extreme. For this reason it is a good practice to steer toward the extreme that is less pleasant while you are hunting for the mean, which will help to correct for that tendency. However this rule of thumb is shown in later parts of the &quot;Ethics&quot; to apply mainly to some bodily pleasures, and Aristotle asserts it to be wrong as an accurate general rule in Book X.

====Moral virtue as conscious choice====
Aristotle begins by distinguishing human actions as voluntary &amp; involuntary, and chosen &amp; unchosen, and investigates what makes an action worthy of praise or blame, honor or punishment, and pardon or pity.

Aristotle divides wrong actions into three categories:
*Voluntary () acts which are caused by a person&#x27;s will or desire or choice.
*Involuntary or unwilling () acts, which are caused by some outside factor or by ignorance (for example the wind carries a person off, or a person has a wrong understanding of the particular facts of a situation).
*&quot;Non-voluntary&quot; or &quot;non willing&quot; actions () that are bad actions done by choice, but not deliberately, for example actions that are demanded from us under threat, or actions that are the lesser evil when no good actions are available. If you regret a non-voluntary wrong action of this sort, it is effectively equivalent to an involuntary action for the purposes of assigning blame.

The two varieties of ignorance differ as to how they affect blame. Ignorance of what is good and bad is itself blameworthy—a sign of bad character. But once the difference is learned, misconceptions about some particular situation that leads to choosing the bad while thinking it good is excusable. Aristotle explains this in terms of syllogistic reasoning. Imagine a syllogism of this form: &quot;It would be bad to serve poison to your father. This glass of wine has been poisoned. Therefore it would be bad to serve this glass of wine to your father.&quot; Serving the wine in ignorance of the first (universal) premise, but not the second, is depraved. Ignorance of the second (particular) premise, but not the first, is merely a mistake.

Aristotle defines and discusses several more critical terms:
*Deliberate choice (): &quot;seems to determine one&#x27;s character more than one&#x27;s actions do&quot;. Things done on the spur of the moment, and things done by animals and children, can be willing, but driven by desire and spirit and not deliberate choice. Choice is rational and can be in opposition to desire. Choice always concerns realistic aims and available actions (which distinguishes it from &quot;opinion&quot; which can be about anything).
*Deliberation (), at least for sane people, does not include theoretical contemplation about universals, nor about distant things, nor about things already precisely known, such stand or sit. &quot;We deliberate about things that are up to us and are matters of action&quot; and concerning things where it is unclear how they will turn out. Deliberation is therefore not about reasoning which ends to pursue (health, for example) but how to think through the means of achieving those ends. When desire (for an end) and deliberation (about the means) combine, a choice is born.
*Wishing () is something like deliberation, but focuses on ends rather than means. Contrary to some theories, Aristotle says that people do not wish for what is good by definition (though perhaps for what &quot;appears&quot; to be good). A worthy () person, however, does wish for what is &quot;truly&quot; good. Most people are misled by pleasure, &quot;for it seems to them to be a good, though it is not&quot;.






Virtue and vice according to Aristotle are &quot;up to us&quot;. Although no one is willingly unhappy, vice, which leads to unhappiness, always involves chosen actions. Vice comes from bad habits and aiming at the wrong things, not from seeking to be unhappy.

Lawmakers are cognizant of these distinctions: they try to encourage or discourage various voluntary actions, but do not concern themselves with involuntary actions. They also tend not to be lenient towards people who act from negligent ignorance, for instance if they are drunk, ignorant about things that are easy to learn, or have allowed themselves to develop bad habits and a bad character. Though people with a bad character may be ignorant and even seem incapable of choosing right things, such a condition stems from decisions that were originally voluntary, similar to how poor health can develop from past choices—and, &quot;While no one blames those who are ill-formed by nature, people do censure those who are that way through lack of exercise and neglect.&quot;

Aristotle then considers some specific character virtues, starting with two that concern &quot;the irrational parts of the soul&quot; (fear and desire): courage and temperance.

====Courage====

To have courage means to characteristically display appropriate confidence in the face of fearful situations. (However some fears are noble, like the fear of disgrace, and to be fearless in such a situation is something closer to shamelessness.) Courage usually refers to confidence and fear concerning man-made evils; it is exemplified by courage in the face of the most fear-laden thing, death, particularly death in battle. Aristotle says that fear of death is particularly pronounced in those who have lived a life that is both happy and virtuous—death is worse if the life it threatens is unusually good—and this may make courage ironically more difficult to achieve for people who otherwise are skilled in the virtues.

Everything humans do characteristically, that is, as a manifestation of some characteristic trait such as courage, is done for a purpose that is identical to the purpose of that trait. Any particular courageous act has the same aim (at least with respect to its courageousness) as the general trait of courageousness does. The aim of a particular act done courageously is not in the specific and incidental goals of the action, but in the service of the virtue of courageousness. A person develops courage once he or she sees courageousness as honorable, beautiful, and noble, as &quot;a glory to human nature&quot; as J.A. Stewart put it in his summary of this chapter.

People who have excessive fearlessness would be mad (Aristotle remarks that some describe Celts this way). Aristotle also says that &quot;rash&quot; people (), those with excessive confidence, are generally cowards putting on a brave face.

Aristotle notes that the term courage is sometimes misapplied to five other types of character:

*Citizen-soldiers who display a quasi-courage that is motivated by penalties for disobedience, by hope of honors, or by fear of shame when caught acting cowardly. Such motivations can make an army fight &quot;as if&quot; brave, but true courage is motivated by the love of virtue, not by external motives. Aristotle notes that Homeric heroes such as Hector had this type of courage.
*People who are experienced in dealing with some particular danger often seem courageous, though it is their skill rather than their courage which gives them confidence.
*Passion or anger () can look like courage. People who exhibit can be blind to dangers, but unlike truly courageous people they do not aim at virtue. Aristotle notes however that this is &quot;something akin to courage&quot; and if it were combined with deliberate choice and purpose it would seem to be true courage.
*The boldness of someone who feels confident based on many past victories is not true courage. Like a person who is overconfident when drunk, this apparent courage is based on a &quot;lack&quot; of fear (not confidence in the face of fear), and will disappear if circumstances change.
*People who are overconfident simply due to ignorance of the danger can mimic courage.

Avoiding fear is more important when aiming at courage than avoiding overconfidence. As in the examples above, overconfident people are likely to be called courageous, or considered close to courageous. As Aristotle said in Book II, with moral virtues such as courage, the extreme one&#x27;s normal desires tends away from is the best one to aim towards when trying to find the mean.

Courage leads people to risk pain, and therefore away from what they would more typically desire. The courageous person values courageous action more than they fear pain or even death.

Aristotle&#x27;s treatment of this subject is often compared to Plato&#x27;s. Courage was dealt with by Plato in &quot;Laches&quot;.

====Temperance ()====

Temperance (Sophrosyne, also translated as soundness of mind, moderation, discretion) is a mean with regards to pleasure. The vice that occurs most often is excess in pursuit of pleasure (: licentiousness, intemperance, profligacy, dissipation, etc.). The vice of deficiency by contrast is so unusual that Aristotle calls people with it &quot;almost imaginary characters&quot; and cannot find a Greek word for that vice.

Pleasures are divided into those of the soul and those of the body. But those who are concerned with pleasures of the soul—honor or learning, for example—are not typically referred to as temperate or dissolute. Not all bodily pleasures are relevant, either; for example delighting in sights or sounds or smells are about temperance, unless it is a smell (food or perfume) that triggers yearning. Temperance and dissipation concern the animal-like, Aphrodisiac pleasures of touch and taste.

Some desires, like that of food and drink, or sex, are shared by all creatures. But such desires may manifest themselves variously. Desiring the wrong thing, desiring too much, or desiring in the wrong manner are all intemperate.

The temperate person desires things that are not impediments to health, not contrary to what is beautiful, nor beyond that person&#x27;s resources. Such a person judges according to right reason ().

Appetite is a form of pain; the intemperate are pained excessively about not getting bodily-touch pleasure. Temperate people are not so easily pained.

Intemperance is a more willingly chosen vice than cowardice, because it positively seeks pleasure, while cowardice avoids pain; pain can make it harder to exercise choice. For this reason intemperance is more criticized, because it should be easier to habituate so as to avoid it. In Greek, the word Aristotle uses for &quot;intemperate&quot; is the same one used for &quot;unchastened&quot;, as in a spoiled child. Aristotle thinks this is apt, as temperance is about disciplining the needy child inside of us, so that appetites do not escape the control of reason.

===Book IV. The second set of examples of moral virtues===
The moral virtues discussed in Book IV concern behavior in social or political situations. Book IV is sometimes described as reflecting the norms of an Athenian gentleman in Aristotle&#x27;s time. While this is consistent with the approach Aristotle said he would take in Book I, long-running disagreement concerns whether this was a framework for deriving more general conclusions, for example in Book VI, or whether it shows that Aristotle failed to generalize, and that his ethical thinking was parochial.

====Liberality or generosity ()====

This virtue concerns how people act with regards to donating/receiving money and things whose worth is valued in terms of money. The two extremes of deficiency and excess are wastefulness and stinginess, respectively.

Aristotle&#x27;s approach to defining the correct balance is to treat money like any other useful thing, and say that virtue is to know how to use money: giving to the right people, in the right amount, at the right time. As with each of the ethical virtues, Aristotle emphasizes that a virtuous person is pleased to do the virtuous and beautiful thing.

It is better to err on the side of generosity: A liberal person &quot;is more annoyed if he has not spent something that he ought than pained if he has spent something that he ought not&quot;.

Aristotle pointed out that we do not praise someone simply for not taking (which might however earn praise for being just). &quot;[I]t is more characteristic of virtue... to do what is noble than not to do what is base.&quot; He also points out that &quot;generous people are loved practically the most of those who are recognized for virtue, since they confer benefits&quot;.

Aristotle says the source of donated money is important: &quot;a decent sort of taking goes along with a decent sort of giving&quot;. Profligate people are often wasteful and stingy at the same time; when trying to be generous they often take from the wrong sources (for example pimps, loan sharks, gamblers, thieves), and give to the wrong people. Such people can be helped by guidance, unlike stingy people (and most people are somewhat stingy). Stinginess is the opposite of generosity, &quot;both because it is a greater evil than wastefulness, and because people go wrong more often with it than from the sort of wastefulness described&quot;.

====Magnificence====

Magnificence is similar to generosity but concerns larger amounts. Aristotle says that while &quot;the magnificent man is liberal, the liberal man is not necessarily magnificent&quot;.

The immoderate vices in this case concern &quot;making a great display on the wrong occasions and in the wrong way&quot;. The extremes to be avoided in order to achieve this virtue are paltriness or chintziness on the one hand and vulgarity on the other.

Aristotle notes that moral dispositions () are caused by activities (), meaning that a magnificent person&#x27;s virtue can be seen from the way he chooses to do magnificent acts at the right times.

Aristotle emphasizes the public nature of the giving—receiving foreign dignitaries, making religious offerings, erecting public buildings, funding festivals and entertainments, throwing weddings, lavishly decorating a home (&quot;for even a house is a sort of public ornament&quot;).

Because he seeks spectacle, a person with this virtue does not focus on doing things cheaply, which would be petty, and may well overspend. As with liberality, Aristotle sees a potential conflict between some virtues and skill with money. He says that magnificence requires spending according to means, at least in the sense that poor men cannot be magnificent. The vices of paltriness and vulgar chintziness &quot;do not bring serious discredit, since they are not injurious to others, nor are they excessively unseemly&quot;.

====Magnanimity or &quot;greatness of soul&quot;====

Magnanimity is a Latinization of the Greek , which means greatness of soul. Although the word has a connection to Aristotelian philosophy, it has a distinct meaning in English, which may confuse. Some modern translations refer to greatness of soul. The term implies not just greatness, but a person who correctly thinks themselves worthy of great things. Although that could imply vainglory, Aristotle defines it as a virtue. He says &quot;not everybody who claims more than he deserves is vain&quot; and indeed &quot;most small-souled of all would seem to be the man who claims less than he deserves when his deserts are great&quot;.

Vanity, or small-souls, are the two extremes that fail to achieve the virtue of magnanimity. The small-souled person, according to Aristotle, &quot;seems to have something bad about him&quot;.

To have the virtue of greatness of soul, and be worthy of what is greatest, one must possess greatness in all virtues. Sachs points out: &quot;Greatness of soul is the first of four virtues that Aristotle will find to require the presence of all the virtues of character.&quot; The others are a type of justice, or practical judgment as shown by good leaders, and truly good friends. Aristotle views magnanimity as &quot;a sort of adornment of the moral virtues; for it makes them greater, and it does not arise without them&quot;.

Aristotle considers what things are most worthy. Of external goods, the greatest is honor, because this is what we assign to gods, and this is what people of the highest standing target. Aristotle says that great-souled people don&#x27;t pursue anything immoderately, including honor. Excellence and becoming &quot;worthy&quot; of honor is more important. (The haughty unconcern and disdain of a great-souled person, and his presumption and self-regard and the way he works to dominate others can make him seem arrogant, like an undeserving vain person.)

Leo Strauss proposes &quot;a close kinship between Aristotle&#x27;s justice and biblical justice, but Aristotle&#x27;s magnanimity, which means a man&#x27;s habitual claiming for himself great honors while he deserves these honors, is alien to the Bible&quot;.

Aristotle lists characteristics of the great-souled person:

* Deserves and claims great things, but above all, honor.
* Good in the highest degree, great in every virtue. He never behaves in a cowardly manner or wrongs another person, because, loving honor above all, lacks motive to do such things.
* Moderately pleased at receiving great honors from good people. Despises casual honors from middling people, however.
* Indifferent to what fate brings—&quot;neither over-joyed by good fortune nor over-pained by evil&quot; and cares not for power and wealth, except as a means to honor. Even honor, loved above all, does not consume him.
* It helps to be rich, powerful, and well-born, though none of those things are sufficient.
* Does not court danger (little that is worth courting danger). Confronts danger &quot;unsparing of his life, knowing that there are conditions on which life is not worth having&quot;.
* Asks for nothing, but gives readily. Give benefits and gifts, but hates to receive them. Hates to be in another&#x27;s debt, and overpays a debt to gain an advantage.
* Remembers (and likes to be reminded of) services to others, but not those received (which are reminders of having been in an inferior position).
* Projects dignity before people of high position and riches. Behaves in an unassuming manner towards common people, rejecting vulgar pomposity.
* Does not reach for common honors, only for the best ones. Few deeds, but those few are extraordinary.
* Speaks directly &quot;except when he speaks in irony to the vulgar&quot;. Respects truth more than people&#x27;s opinions, so does not hesitate to offer contempt and does not try to be tactful.
* Rejects service to a &quot;superior&quot;, but may choose to serve a friend.
* Admires little, since to a great person, nothing else is particularly outstanding.
* Refuses to bear grudges or remember wrongs.
* Refuses to gossip or praise or demean others, rejecting typical motives to do so.
* Prefers to possess beautiful things of no particular use more than practical things.
* Moves slowly and deliberately, and speaks in a deep, level voice.
* He is definitely a male, though Aristotle does not think he needs to point this out explicitly.

====A balanced ambitiousness concerning smaller honors====

In the same way that normal generosity was considered a scaled-down version of magnificence, Aristotle proposes two levels of virtue associated with honors, one concerned with great honors, Magnanimity or &quot;greatness of soul&quot; and another with ordinary honors. This latter virtue is a kind of correct respect for honor, which he said was at a mean between being ambitious (, honor-loving) and unambitious (, not honor-loving).

This virtue might be exhibited by a noble and manly person with appropriate ambition, or in a less ambitious person who is moderate and temperate. (There is no amount of virtuous .) To have the correct balance in this virtue means pursuing the right types of honor from the right sources of honor. In contrast, the glory hound craves accolades even from dubious sources and whether or not they are deserved, while the improperly unambitious man does not desire appropriately to be honored for noble reasons.

====Gentleness () concerning anger====

The virtue of is the correct mean concerning anger. Someone with the vice of excess, irascibility or quickness to anger, is angry at the wrong people, in the wrong manner, and so on. The vice of deficiency is found in people who refuse to defend themselves: milquetoasts, servile.

Aristotle does not deny anger a place in the behavior of a good person, but says it should be &quot;on the right grounds and against the right persons, and also in the right manner and at the right moment and for the right length of time&quot;. Aristotle says it is not easy to behave according to the mean.

The virtue with regards to anger is not led by the emotions (), but by reason (). Anger can be virtuous and rational in the right circumstances, and a small amount of excess is not blameworthy, and might even be praised as &quot;manly and fitted for command&quot;. It is better, however, to err on the side of forgiveness than anger; the person with a deficiency in this virtue, despite seeming foolish and servile, is closer to the virtue than someone who angers too easily.

====Friendliness====

Another virtue concerns interaction with others. An obsequious () person is overly concerned with pleasing others, backing down too easily, even when it is dishonorable or harmful to do so. A surly () or quarrelsome () person objects to everything and does not care what pain they cause others. No specific Greek word names the correct virtuous mean, but Aristotle says it resembles friendship (). The difference is that this friendly virtue concerns behavior towards friends and strangers alike, and does not involve friends&#x27; emotional bond. (Concerning true friendship see books VIII and IX.)

According to Aristotle, getting this virtue right also involves:
* Dealing appropriately with different types of people, for example people in a higher social position than oneself, or people more or less familiar to you.
* Sometimes sharing in the pleasure of companions at some expense, if this pleasure is not harmful or dishonorable.
* Willingness to experience pain in the short term for longer-run pleasure of a greater scale.

He describes flattery as a sort of cunning obsequiousness practiced to gain advantage.

====Honesty about oneself: the virtue between boasting and self-deprecation====

Aristotle is concerned with a specific type of honesty: self-representation. (Other types of honesty might involve virtues such as justice.)

Aristotle said that no convenient Greek word names the virtuous and honest mean, describing someone who claims his good qualities without exaggeration or understatement. The vice of excess is boastfulness; that of deficiency is self-deprecation. As in the previous case concerning obsequiousness and flattery, vices concerned with self-representation might be part of one&#x27;s character, or they might be performed as if they were in character, but really with some ulterior motive.

As in many of these examples, Aristotle says the vice of excess (boastfulness) is more blameworthy than that of deficiency (self-deprecation).

Aristotle says a person might be relatively blameless if they are occasionally dishonest about their own qualities, as long as this does not become a fixed disposition. Specifically, boasting is not very blameworthy if the aim is honor or glory, but is if the aim is money.

Parts of this section critique Aristotle&#x27;s practice of philosophy. At one point he says that examples of areas where dishonest boasting for gain might go undetected, and be very blameworthy, would be prophecy, philosophy, or medicine, all of which have both pretense and bragging. This appears to be a criticism of contemporary sophists. But one of the words for the vices under discussion, self-deprecation (Greek , from which English &quot;irony&quot;), was and is used to describe the philosophical technique of Socrates. Aristotle specifically mentions Socrates as an example, writing &quot;For they seem to be avoiding bombast, not looking for profit, in what they say. The qualities that win reputation are the ones that these people especially disavow, as Socrates also used to do.&quot; But at the same time he notes that although the vice of deficiency is often less blameworthy, it is still a moral deficiency.

====Wit and charm====

The virtue of wit, charm, and tact, and generally saying the right things when speaking playfully, Aristotle said is a necessary part of life. In contrast a buffoon can never resist making any joke, and the deficient vice in this case is an uncultivated person who does not get jokes, and is useless in playful conversation. He doubts the existence of rules about playful discourse, so a person with this virtue will tend to be &quot;a law unto himself&quot;.

====Shame (quasi-virtue)====
The sense of shame is not a virtue, but more like a feeling than a stable character trait (). Shame derives from voluntary acts, and a decent person does not voluntarily act shamefully, so a sense of shame fits awkwardly into a scheme of virtues, though shamelessness is certainly a vice.

In youth, shame is attractive, since young people are expected to make mistakes because of their inexperience, and responding to these mistakes with appropriate shame is praiseworthy. In adults, shame is not admirable.

===Book V: Justice and fairness===
Book V is the same as Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics; the first of three books common to both works. It represents the discussion on justice () foreseen in earlier books, which covers some of the same material as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, though in a strikingly different way.

Burger points out that although the chapter nominally follows the same path () as previous chapters &quot;it is far from obvious how justice is to be understood as a disposition in relation to a passion: the proposed candidate, greed (), would seem to refer, rather, to the vice of injustice and the single opposite of the virtue.&quot; In other words, justice is not described as a mean between two extremes.

He distinguishes such states-of-character from &quot;science&quot;. A science concerns a subject matter in which knowledge and skill aim for opposite extremes: for example, a doctor knows the science of health, and uses this knowledge to heal or possibly harm patients. A state-of-character, on the other hand, goes in only one direction—having a courageous state-of-character does not make it easier for you to be cowardly, nor vice versa. Justice, he says, is a state of character that is possessed by people who engage in just acts from just desires, not merely the science of knowing theoretically about just outcomes or processes.

Aristotle claims that people use the word &quot;just&quot; to mean either &quot;law abiding&quot; or lawful (), or equitable or fair (). He envisions an ideal legal system in which &quot;all that is unfair is unlawful, but not all that is unlawful is unfair ... [and] the law bids us practise every virtue and forbids us to practise any vice.&quot; But: &quot;It would seem that to be a good man is not in every case the same thing as to be a good citizen.&quot; These two common meanings of justice coincide only to the extent that the laws are themselves good, something only lawmakers can ensure.

Aristotle says that a complete virtue encompasses all types of justice and indeed all types of excellence of character, while a partial virtue is distinct from other character traits. For example, a soldier who flees in battle might be exhibiting cowardice, but could also be exhibiting a sort of injustice (e.g. not wanting to equally share risks with other soldiers).

To understand how justice aims at what is good, it is necessary to look beyond particular good or bad things, and this includes considering the viewpoint of a community (the subject of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;). Alone of the virtues justice looks like &quot;someone else&#x27;s good&quot;, an argument also confronted by Plato in his &quot;Republic&quot;.

Concerning areas in which law-abiding behavior might conflict with fairness, Aristotle says that this is part of Politics. Aristotle divides particular justice further into two parts: distribution of divisible goods, and rectification in private transactions. The first relates to members of a community in which it is possible for one person to have more or less of a good than another person. The second concerns transactions that have resulted in an imbalance. This part is itself divided into two parts: voluntary and involuntary. Involuntary is divided into furtive and violent divisions.





Aristotle says that justice involves the allocation of shares of goods in a way that concerns &quot;at least four terms, namely, two persons for whom it is just and two shares which are just&quot;. The just must fall between what is too much and what is too little, and what is just requires consideration not just for equality but for the relative political standing of the parties.

How to judge the mean is not clear, because &quot;if the persons are not equal, they will not have equal shares; it is when equals possess or are allotted unequal shares, or persons not equal equal shares, that quarrels and complaints arise&quot;.

Aristotle does not state how to decide who deserves more or less. Political systems variously define &quot;fair share&quot;. Democrats think that citizens should have equal shares, and others a lesser share. Others (believers in oligarchy, aristocracy, etc.) think that shares ought to be proportionate to wealth, fortune of birth, or honor. Distributive justice then allocates goods according to that rule, so that if persons A and B stand in a ratio A:B by the accepted standard, shares of the good should be divvied out in a ratio C:D so that (A+C):(B+D) = A:B; in other words, so that in divvying up the goods the relative status of A and B is respected.

The second part of particular justice is restorative; it concerns voluntary and involuntary transactions between people and looks to remediate harm () caused to an individual. Emphasizing justice as a mean, he says that &quot;men require a judge to be a middle term or medium—indeed in some places judges are called mediators—for they think that if they get the mean they will get what is just. Thus the just is a sort of mean, inasmuch as the judge is a medium between the litigants.&quot; To restore both parties to this just mean, a judge must redistribute the value so that both have the mean. This rule rectifies both voluntary and involuntary transactions.

Finally, Aristotle turns to the idea that retaliation (&quot;an eye for an eye&quot;) is justice, an idea he associates with the Pythagoreans. One problem with this approach is that it ignores different reasons for committing a crime. For example, a crime of passion or ignorance rather than from defective character, which makes a critical difference when determining the just action. Another problem is that it does not preserve the original proportions of the parties involved: &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is blindly equal in its application and does not respect the status of the parties prior to the transgression. For example: &quot;if an officer strikes a man, it is wrong for the man to strike him back; and if a man strikes an officer, it is not enough for the officer to strike him, but he ought to be punished as well&quot;.

Aristotle mentions that what is legal is not the same as what is just: &quot;Political Justice is of two kinds, one natural, the other conventional.&quot; Aristotle makes a point that recalls debates from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;: &quot;Some people think that all rules of justice are merely conventional, because whereas a law of nature is immutable and has the same validity everywhere, as fire burns both here and in Persia, rules of justice are seen to vary.&quot; Aristotle insists that justice is fixed in one sense, and variable in another: &quot;the rules of justice ordained not by nature but by man are not the same in all places, since forms of government are not the same, though in all places there is only one form of government that is natural, namely, the best form&quot;. He claimed people can generally see which types of rules are conventional and which natural—and he felt that most important when trying to judge whether someone was just or unjust was determining whether they did something voluntarily. Harmful acts can be categorized as:
* accidental – from ignorance of the nature of the act, that cause an unforeseeable harm
* mistaken – from ignorance of the nature of the act, that cause a foreseeable injury, but that do not imply vice
* unjust – with knowledge of the nature of the act (therefore voluntary), but not premeditated (e.g., done from passion)
* viciously unjust – both voluntary and chosen

The discussion of voluntary acts in this section and that in Book III are not consistent. In this section, Aristotle calls acts done in and from ignorance varieties of involuntary acts; in Book III he says such acts are not involuntary, except for those that both were done from ignorance and were then regretted.

Aristotle next discusses (usually translated as &quot;equity&quot;), which is a skillful, nuanced corrective to by-the-books justice.

==== Chapter 5 – Currency ====
In chapter five, Aristotle gives his theory for the origin of currency as a medium of exchange. He begins from an assumption that in voluntary economic transactions, the people in the transaction begin with a certain relative proportion of goods, and end with the same relative proportion of goods. If this does not occur—if the proportion goes out of balance during the transaction—some injustice has occurred. A problem with this is that it is difficult for people to exchange things that are actually equal such that they preserve this proportion: imagine a cobbler trying to exchange shoes for a house, for example. Clearly no house-builder is going to accept a single pair of shoes in trade or a pile of shoes (as unwieldy and impractical). Money exists, says Aristotle, so that both parties in a transaction can weigh their contributions on a common scale. But how does a cobbler, for instance, know how to value their product on this scale? Aristotle says that the key to determining this quantitative measure of value is . This has often been translated as &quot;demand&quot; by translators eager to suggest that Aristotle anticipated the modern supply and demand theory of price, but could also be translated as &quot;use&quot;, &quot;advantage&quot;, or &quot;service&quot;.

===Book VI: Intellectual virtues===
Book VI of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is identical to Book V of the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;.

If a virtue is the habit of deliberately choosing a virtuous mean, how is that mean identified? And how is that translated into action—how does knowledge become choice?

Recognizing the mean means recognizing the correct boundary-marker () that defines the frontier of the mean. So practical ethics (having a good character) requires knowledge.

Aristotle divides the soul () into a part having reason (the intellect) and parts without it (one part concerning perception or sensation, and another with appetite or desire). He has so far discussed the type of virtue or excellence () of the appetitive, non-reasonable part—that of the character (, the virtue of which is , moral virtue). Now he intends to discuss the other type: that of thought ().

Choice happens when an end desired by the appetitive part of the soul combines with a discovery of means by the intellectual part of the soul. Both parts of the soul are equal partners in this; describing it as the desire enlisting the intellect or the intellect guiding the desire is a matter of convention.

The part of the soul with reason is divided into two parts:
*one concerning things with invariable causes
*one concerning variable things and deliberation about actions

Aristotle says that if recognition depends upon likeness and kinship between the things being recognized and the recognizing parts of the soul, then the soul grows naturally in two parts.

Aristotle enumerates five types of (stable dispositions) of the soul and that can disclose truth:

====Practical judgement ()====
The closing chapters of Book VI examine (practical judgement, practical wisdom, or prudence) more closely.

 concerns practical matters, and matters that can be meaningfully influenced by human effort. Syllogistic reasoning is important to this variety of reasoning: you must be able to know the truth about the universal, the particular, and the syllogistic process that enables you to draw a conclusion from such truths.

 has subcategories for different spheres of human life:
* prudence – for practical wisdom about governing yourself
* domestic management – for practical wisdom about home economics
* legislation – for practical wisdom about politics
* deliberative and judicial government for practical wisdom about the execution of political principles

People who apply practical wisdom to themselves and their homes are esteemed as wise, but people who apply their wisdom to other people&#x27;s lives are considered meddlesome. Aristotle believes that such busybodies are nonetheless important to the health of the polis.

 seems to require experience; it is unlike mathematics that a talented child learn. Aristotle thinks this is because expertise in mathematics requires an understanding of abstract universals, while practical wisdom requires encounters with real-life particulars. A savant can grasp a mathematical truth immediately; but may be skeptical about a truth of practical wisdom and to need to see that truth exemplified in real-life examples before adopting it.

Practical wisdom also concerns intuitively-grasped &quot;particulars&quot; (somewhat resembling , which is intuition about &quot;universals&quot;). For example, recognizing a triangle without having to count the sides and add up the angles is using practical wisdom in this way.

People with practical wisdom deliberate well. Deliberation is a sort of inquiry into what would be a good course of action. It is not:
* scientific knowledge (which is invariable/eternal and so not amenable to deliberation)
* clever guessing, just so stories, or facile wit (deliberation is more careful)
* truth (knowledge can be true or false, but deliberation is better or worse)
* correctness (having the correct opinion is a conclusion, not a deliberation)
* good reasoning toward bad ends (such as a clever but intemperate person might do)
* true conclusions arrived at through mistaken logic
* true conclusions arrived at through unnecessarily cumbersome logical tangles
* good reasoning toward ends that are good, but not all that good; not good enough to contribute to .

Understanding is like deliberation, but is meant to comprehend the nature of a thing or situation (which can then aid in deliberation). Understanding aids evaluating the knowledge or choices of others.

&quot;&quot; is notoriously difficult to translate. It is a deeper, holistic understanding of a situation. In particular, it is what allows a person to add to their virtue of Justice.

Aristotle uses in a different sense to tie understanding, deliberation, and together. This use of is understanding, deliberation, and that is integrated and practiced. It aids in identifying the relevant aspects of a situation and the relevant hypotheses that enable best decisions. This is a skill that can only be acquired through experience, and is how elders earn their reputation for wisdom.

Aristotle ends his investigation by comparing the importance of practical wisdom () and philosophical wisdom (). Although Aristotle describes as the more serious (it is concerned with higher things), he mentions the earlier philosophers, Anaxagoras and Thales, as examples proving that one can be wise, having both knowledge and intellect, and yet lack practical judgement. He describes the dependency of upon as like the dependency of health upon medical knowledge. Wisdom is aimed at for its own sake, like health, a necessary component of that most complete virtue, happiness.

Aristotle closes by arguing that in their highest form, virtues all exist together.

===Book VII. Impediments to virtue===
This book is Book VI in &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;. It extends previously developed discussions, especially from the end of Book II, in relation to the vice of and the virtue of .

This book shows signs of having been cobbled together from multiple fragmentary sources; it is repetitive.

Aristotle lists three impediments to virtue:

These stand in a sort of hierarchy:
* heroic greatness (near-divine)
* virtue (habitually good, not badly tempted in the first place)
* continence (habitually capable of resisting temptation)
* endurance (able to resist temptation for sufficient reward)
* passion (sometimes overcome by anger or other very strong emotion)
* incontinence (often overcome by mere desire)
* vice (habitually bad)
* brutishness (nearly subhuman)

====Self-control and hedonism====

According to Aristotle, self-control and (incontinence) are not &quot;identical with Virtue and Vice, nor yet as different in kind from them&quot;. Temperance is distinct from self-control, both because self-control could be used to restrain good desires as much as bad ones, and because a temperate person would not have bad desires that need restraining.

Another way of stating the difference between lack of self control and intemperance is that intemperance is a choice and a habit of character — an exercise of the will — while incontinence is contrary to choice — a failure of will. By analogy, the incontinent person is like a city that has good laws on the books but that doesn&#x27;t enforce them; the intemperate person is like a city with bad laws.

Aristotle reviews notions about self-control, including one he associates with Socrates. According to Aristotle, Socrates argued that incontinent behavior must be a result of ignorance, as people only choose what they think to be good: it&#x27;s not that the unrestrained person does things that they know to be bad, disregarding their knowledge under the influence of passion, but that they are ignorant about what is good and bad. Aristotle says at first that &quot;this view plainly contradicts the observed facts&quot;, but comes to conclude that &quot;the position that Socrates sought to establish actually seems to result&quot;.

His way of accommodating Socrates relies on syllogistic reasoning. Aristotle suggests that an incontinent person has competing universal premises, for example &quot;χ would be unjust&quot; and &quot;χ would satisfy my sensual desire.&quot; When they then encounter a particular &quot;α is an example of χ&quot; the universal premise that has a sensual payoff associated with it crowds out the one that does not when it comes time for the incontinent person to choose a course of action (&quot;α would satisfy my sensual desire&quot; ∴ &quot;I shall α!&quot;). The incontinent person therefore remains in ignorance about what they should be able to know (&quot;α would be unjust&quot;).

Aristotle says that someone who lacks self-control is typically influenced either by &quot;necessary&quot; pleasures or pains, like those associated with food and sex, or by more supererogatory pleasures and pains like those associated with victory, honor, or wealth. Lack of self-control in the first case is simple lack of self-control, and is a sort of vice (in a similar domain to intemperance). Lack of self-control in the second case is somewhat different: pursuing good things, but in an excessive, unrestrained way.

Some have unusual desires or aversions after they were victimized as children or experience some sort of psychopathology or other malady. Aristotle says that &quot;every sort of senselessness or cowardice or dissipation or harshness that goes to excess is either animal-like or disease-like&quot;.

For Aristotle, (&quot;incontinence&quot;), is distinct from animal-like behavior because it is specific to humans and involves rational thinking, even though the conclusions are not put into practice. Someone who behaves in a purely animal-like way is not acting based upon conscious choice.

Returning to the question of anger (), Aristotle distinguishes it from desires because he says it listens to reason, but often hears incorrectly. He contrasts this with desire, which does not listen to reason. Someone overcome by anger is conquered by flawed, crude reason, but at least by an argument; someone overcome by desire is conquered by desire alone. He also says that anger is more natural and less blameworthy than desire for excessive unnecessary pleasure. Acts from anger are more likely to be sudden and unpremeditated, while those motivated by desire are more likely to be plotted. Furthermore, acts of never result from anger, but always have a connection to pleasure-seeking, whereas angry people act from often-regretted pain.

The two ways that people lose mastery of their own actions and do not act according to their own deliberations include excitability, where a person does follows their imagination, and that of a weak person who has thought things through, but is carried away by passion. Nevertheless, it is better to have than the vice of , in which intemperate acts are chosen for their own sake. People with such a vice do not even know they are wrong, and feel no regrets. These are less curable.

Aristotle compares self-control (resisting the temptation of the pleasant) with endurance (resisting the temptation of the unpleasant), and he describes the (who wilts in the face of moderate displeasure) as a sort of counterpart to the person without self control.

Finally Aristotle addresses questions raised earlier:
*Not everyone who stands firm has self-control. &quot;Stubborn&quot; people are more like a person without self-control, because they are partly led by the pleasure that comes from exhibiting confident decisiveness or by avoiding the pain of admitting a mistake.
*Not everyone who fails to stand firm has a true lack of self-control. Aristotle gives the example of Neoptolemus (in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot;) who feels honor-bound both to lie to Philoctetes for the sake of Odysseus, and not to lie for the sake of remaining an honest person.
*A person with practical judgment () cannot have . It might sometimes seem so, but only in the sense that a clever person can sometimes recite words that make them sound wise, like an actor or a drunk reciting poetry. A person lacking self-control can have knowledge, but not an &quot;active&quot; knowledge that they pay attention to.

====Hedonism and pleasure====

Aristotle discusses pleasure in two separate parts of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (VII.11–14 and X.1–5). Plato discussed similar themes in several dialogues, including the &quot;Republic &quot;and the &quot;Philebus&quot; and &quot;Gorgias&quot;.

He begins this section by rebutting the arguments of Speusippus who opposed the idea that pleasure is a (or the) good.

According to Aristotle&#x27;s way of analyzing causation, a good or bad thing can either be an activity () or a stable disposition (). The pleasure that comes from returning to a natural are accidental and not natural, for example the temporary pleasure that can come from a bitter taste. Things that are pleasant by nature are activities that are pleasant in themselves and involve no pain or desire. The example Aristotle gives is contemplation. Such pleasures are activities that are ends themselves, not just processes of coming into being aimed at some higher end.

Pain is clearly bad, either in a simple sense or as an impediment. Aristotle argues that this makes it clear that pleasure is good. He rejects the argument of Speusippus that pleasure and pain are different only in degree, because this still does not make pleasure bad, nor or imply that some pleasure is not the best thing. Aristotle points out that if pleasure is not good then a happy () person will not have a more pleasant life than another, and would have no reason to avoid pain.

While any level of pain is bad, it is only excessive bodily pleasures that are bad. Aristotle considers why people are so attracted to bodily pleasures. Apart from depravities and cases where a bodily pleasure comes from returning to health, Aristotle asserts a more complex metaphysical reason, which is that for humans change is sweet, but only because of some disequilibrium, which is because part of every human is perishable, and &quot;a nature that needs change... is not simple nor good&quot;. God, in contrast, &quot;enjoys a single simple pleasure perpetually&quot;.

===Books VIII and IX: Friendship===
Book II Aristotle discussed friendship. Here Sachs discusses Aristotle&#x27;s ideas about friendship (&quot;philia&quot;).
Friendship, says Aristotle, is a virtue, or at any rate it implies virtue. And it is necessary for eudaimonia; indeed, if you had everything else but had no genuine friends, life would not be worth living. It is also an important consideration in justice and politics, as friendship is what holds states together.

Friendship exists when two people each wish for each other&#x27;s good, and are both aware of this mutual relationship. The two sorts of friendship are friends who love each other because (and to the extent that) they are useful or pleasant to each other, and friends who love each other because they are good and virtuous and wish good things for the other for the other&#x27;s sake. The first sort is inferior to the last because of the motive (friendships of utility and pleasure do not regard friends as people, but for what they can offer) and also because they are more fragile (likely to disintegrate if the utility or pleasure goes away).

Friendships of utility are relationships formed without regard to the other person. These friendships are grouped along with family ties and of hospitality to foreigners, types of friendships Aristotle associates with older people. Friendships of pleasure are based on fleeting emotions and are more associated with young people. While such friends like to be together, such friendships end whenever people no longer enjoy the shared activity, or can no longer participate in it together.

Friendships based upon what is good are the perfect form of friendship, in which both friends enjoy each other&#x27;s virtue. As long as both friends maintain a virtuous character, the relationship will endure and be pleasant, useful, and good for both parties, since the motive behind it is care for the friend. Such relationships are rare, because good people are rare, and bad people do not take pleasure in each other.

Aristotle suggests that although the word friend is used in these different ways, it is best to say that friendships of pleasure and usefulness are only analogous to real friendships. It is sometimes possible that, at least in the case of people who are friends for pleasure, familiarity will lead to a better friendship as the friends learn to admire each other&#x27;s characters. Perfect friendship may be incidentally utilitarian (it is in fact pleasant and useful) but is not primarily so. It requires trust, and it is difficult to trust someone who is not virtuous. The lesser, utilitarian species of friendship is also worthy of attention, but it is only a shadow of the real thing.

Genuine friendship seems to require regular in-person encounters. Friend must be amiable and enjoy spending time together (though these are not sufficient). It is possible to have many utilitarian friendships, but only a few true friends.

Friendships between people of differing status can present difficulties. People in authority sometimes have friends quick-witted of the pleasurable, and obedient friends of the useful sort, but the quick-witted ones may not be obedient, and obedient ones tend not to be quick-witted, rarely are the two united. Good, virtuous people tend not to make friends with people above their station (except with rare examples who are also exceptionally good and virtuous).

However, a sort of friendship between unequals is possible: such as friendship between a father and son. Rulers can have a friendly regard for their subjects. In such cases, friendship is a sort of respect that should be apportioned, like justice, according to the relative status of the parties: a son should respect the father more than the father respects the son; subjects should love their king more than the king loves any subject; etc. This is another way such friendship differs from genuine friendship, in which love and respect is equal, regardless of status, and in which loving rather than being-loved is valued. This makes it difficult for differently-situated people to become genuine friends, or for a genuine friendship to survive a rebalancing in status between the friends.

In friendships between unequals, the superior person thinks their status should qualify them for a superior share of its benefits; the inferior person thinks that they should be able to expect more benefits as they have less to give. Aristotle thinks one way to resolve this is to allow the inferior person receives a larger share of actual goods and assistance, while the superior person gains the larger share of honor from such beneficence, so they both benefit. This is true of the polis in general: some people contribute little and take much, other people contribute much and take little, but are repaid in honor. This is how mortals behave towards gods, and children towards parents. The relationship between benefactors and those they benefit also has a paradoxical friendship dynamic; the giver may enjoy the gift-giving more than the recipient enjoys the gift, and the giver may be more fond of the recipient than vice-versa.

Friendship is a form of love, best exhibited in the giving rather than in the receiving.

Associations and friendships bind the together. Different relationships can be compared to the different types of constitution, according to the classification system Aristotle explains in his &quot;Politics&quot; (Monarchy, Tyranny, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, Timocracy, and Democracy). The difference between the good and bad types has to do with how virtuous, or self-serving, are those in power. A monarch cares for his kingdom and subjects; a tyrant, for himself. An aristocracy looks out for the good of the polis; an oligarchy tries to accrue more power and wealth for itself. A timocracy has the good of everyone in mind; a democracy tries to rob the minority to feed the majority. Similarly, a good friendship between a man and his wife in a patriarchy is like the friendship between an aristocracy and the commoners; a good friendship between brothers is like the friendship between timocrats.

The friendship between relatives is closer than that of fellow-citizens. And the closeness of such friendship is related to the closeness of kinship, as well as to their closeness-in-age, and the extent to which they have been brought up together. The friendship of parents and children is a special sort, akin to the relationship between the gods and mortals. The friendship between husband and wife is natural and fundamental—even more so than that of the tendency of people to come together in communities. Marriages may be utilitarian friendships or genuine ones.

Genuine friends don&#x27;t have reason to complain about the justice of their friendship, because if they love more than they are loved, an imbalance is OK. In utilitarian friendships complaints over whether one of friend is contributing to the friendship, and each friend is eager to give less and get more. These sorts of conflicts are not best handled by a model of objective justice, but, in such cases, the value of favors received (and therefore how much return is due) ought generally to be determined by the recipient.

If obligations to friends conflict with each other, or with other obligations, no rules describe how to resolve them, but heuristics may help: repay debts, prefer kin to non-kin, prefer friends to others, respect elders, etc. A right answer, might be available, but no universal formula applies.

Utilitarian friendships are expected to last only as long as the utility. Genuine friendships can also end, for instance if one of the parties stops considering it a genuine friendship, or if one of friend descends into vice, or ascends beyond the other in virtue.

A virtuous person seeks friendships that resemble the relationship he has with himself. A virtuous person has integrity, and wishes what is actually good for himself, for his own sake. In this way he is like a genuine friend to himself, for a friend wishes for a friend what is good for the friend. Vicious people, on the other hand, are in conflict even with themselves (their appetites conflict with their reason, and so forth), and so they lack a foundation on which to build genuine friendships.

Enlightened self-regard is an important prerequisite for loving others. But the sort of self-love practiced by the intemperate is worse than useless. For this reason a good person ought to be encouraged in self-love, while a wicked person ought to be discouraged in it, since he does not know how to do so properly.

In times of bad fortune, it is good to have helpful friends; in times of good fortune, it is even better to be a helpful friend. Friends should not hesitate to aid each other, even unasked, but should avoid becoming the objects of a friends&#x27; kindness.

===Book X: Pleasure, happiness, and upbringing===

Aristotle discusses pleasure throughout the &quot;Ethics&quot;, but gives it a more focused and theoretical treatment in Book X. He starts by questioning the rule advanced in the more approximate early sections, by which people think pleasure should be avoided—if not because it is simply bad because people tend too much towards pleasure-seeking. He argues that people&#x27;s actions show this to not be what they really believe, but is a &quot;noble lie&quot; taught for its supposed salutary effects.

He reviews arguments of previous philosophers, including Eudoxus (who considered pleasure to be the good) and Plato and Speusippos (who did not), to advance his own middle-way argument: pleasure is &quot;a&quot; good pursued for its own sake even if it is not &quot;The Good&quot; in a Platonic or ultimate sense.

Even if pleasure and pain are entirely orthogonal to virtue and vice, because these sensations are powerful motivators, particularly in the young. it is important for the ethicist to consider them.

To define what pleasure &quot;is&quot;, Aristotle applies his theory of motion () as an (as explained in his &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics)&quot;. In this approach, pleasure is not a movement or because unlike the movement of walking across a room, or building a house, it has no completion endpoint. It is more like seeing, which is either happening in a complete way or not happening. &quot;Each moment of pleasurable consciousness is a perfect whole.&quot;

A sense perception like sight is in perfect activity () when it is in its best conditions and directed at the best objects. Any sense in such perfect activity produces pleasure; similarly thinking () and contemplation () have their associated pleasures. But seeing, for example, is a whole, as is the associated pleasure. Pleasure completes the seeing or thinking, in a way, but as an additional supervening activity that crowns it, rather than as something necessary to it.

Why doesn&#x27;t pleasure last? Why does it fade as if from fatigue? Aristotle proposes that this is because pleasure accompanies activity and no activity can be continued indefinitely without fatigue, and because sensation requires some novelty and any pleasurable stimulus loses its appeal when repeated too often. Life is an activity () made up of many activities such as music, thinking, and contemplation, and pleasure brings supervening completion to each of these, leading to fulfillment and a life worth living. Aristotle says the question of whether life is for pleasure or pleasure is for the sake of living, for the two activities seem irreversibly intertwined.

Different activities—sense perceptions, thinking, contemplating—bring different kinds of pleasure, and these pleasures intensify the activities. Thus &quot;for each activity has its own proper pleasure.&quot; For example a flute player gets better at playing while getting more pleasure from it. But these pleasures and their associated activities may impede each other, just as a flute player cannot participate in an argument while playing. This raises the question of which pleasures are to be pursued. Some pleasures are more beautiful and some are more base or corrupt. The pleasure a virtuous person feels from practicing virtue is a good pleasure; the pleasure a vicious person feels from practicing vice, less so (such &quot;pleasures&quot; hardly deserve the name).

Aristotle argues that each type of animal has pleasures appropriate to it, and in the same way people differ in the pleasures most suitable to them. Aristotle proposes that the person of serious moral stature is the appropriate standard.

====Happiness====
Finally, Aristotle returns to , the aim of the whole &quot;Ethics&quot;. According to the Book I definition it is an activity, good in and of itself, and chosen for its own sake (not instrumentally). Aristotle argued that virtues fit this definition, but perhaps recreational activity also fits the bill (a tennis game, for example, may be played for its own sake).

Aristotle thinks that this trivializes . Anybody can enjoy recreation, even a slave, and no one would want to be a slave. He believes recreation is not an end in itself, but a way of relaxing in preparation for (or to recover from) more noble activity: in other words it is instrumental.

Aristotle says that if &quot;perfect&quot; is activity in accordance with the &quot;highest&quot; virtue, then this highest virtue must be the virtue of the highest &quot;part&quot; of the soul. He says this must be the intellect () &quot;or whatever else it be that is thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine&quot;. This highest activity, Aristotle says, must be philosophical contemplation (). This is also the most sustainable, pleasant, self-sufficient activity; and it is chosen for its own sake. To achieve it means to live in accordance with something immortal and divine which is within humans, and, &quot;so far as we can, make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to live in accordance with the best thing in us&quot;. According to Aristotle, contemplation is the only type of happy activity in which the gods might be imagined to engage in. The intellect is the true self, and this type of happiness is the happiness most suited to humans, in that only humans possess both happiness () and the intellect (). Aristotle also claims that compared to other virtues, contemplation requires the least in terms of possessions and allows the most self-reliance, &quot;though it is true that, being a man and living in the society of others, he chooses to engage in virtuous action, and so will need external goods to carry on his life as a human being&quot;.

What distinguishes humans from other animals is that we reason. This is a hint to our purpose. And that in turn tells us how to fulfill our . &quot;That which is proper to each thing is by nature best and most pleasant for each thing; for man, therefore, the life according to reason is best and pleasantest, since reason more than anything else is man. This life therefore is also the happiest.&quot; Indeed, itself is something peculiar to human beings, and this is fundamental:

Happiness extends... just so far as contemplation does, and those to whom contemplation more fully belongs are more truly happy, not as a mere concomitant but in virtue of the contemplation; for this is in itself precious. Happiness, therefore, must be some form of contemplation.

====The need for education, habituation, and good laws====
Aristotle reiterates that the &quot;Ethics&quot; has not reached its aim if it has no effect in practice. The point is not just to learn how to live, but to actually live that way. Theories are not enough.

The practice of virtue requires good education and habituation from an early age. Young people otherwise do not get to experience the highest forms of pleasure and are distracted by the easiest ones. While parents often attempt this sort of education, it is critical that the community enact good laws.

Concerning this need for good laws and education, Aristotle says he seeks to address an eternal problem: unlike in medical science, theoreticians of happiness and teachers of virtue such as sophists never have practical experience themselves, while good parents and lawmakers have never developed a scientific approach to analyzing what the best laws are. Furthermore, few lawmakers, perhaps only the Spartans, made education a focus of law-making, as they should. Education needs to be more like medicine, with both practice and theory, and this requires a new approach to studying politics. Such study should, he says, help even in communities where the laws are not good and the parents need to try to create the right habits in young people without help from lawmakers.

Aristotle closes the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; therefore by highlighting his sequel, &quot;Politics&quot;. (However, &quot;Politics&quot; as we have it today is significantly different from the promised discussion of politics Aristotle alludes to there.)

==Influence and derivative works==
The &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot; is sometimes considered to be a later commentary or paraphrase of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. The &quot;Magna Moralia&quot; is usually also interpreted as a post-Aristotle synthesis of Aristotelian Ethics including the &quot;Nicomachean&quot; and &quot;Eudemian&quot;, although it is sometimes also attributed to Aristotle.

Parts of a commentary about the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; by Aspasius exist. This is the earliest extant commentary on any of Aristotle&#x27;s works, and is notable because Aspasius was a peripatetic, that is, of the Aristotelian scholastic tradition.

Aristotelian ethics was superseded by epicureanism and stoicism in Greek philosophy. In the West it did not regain interest until the 12th century, when the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (and Averroes&#x27;s 12th-century commentary on it) was rediscovered. Thomas Aquinas called Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, and published a separate commentary on the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; as well as incorporating (or responding to) many of its arguments in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;.

Domenico da Piacenza relied on Aristotle&#x27;s description of the pleasures of motion in Book X as an authority in his 15th-century treatise on dance principles (one of the earliest written documents on the formal principles of dance that eventually become classical ballet). Da Piacenza, who taught that the ideal smoothness of dance movement could only be attained by a balance of qualities, relied on Aristotelian philosophical concepts of movement, measure, and memory to extol dance on moral grounds, as a virtue.

In G. E. M. Anscombe&#x27;s 1958 essay &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot;, she noted that ethical philosophy had diverged so much since Aristotle that people who use modern ethical notions when discussing Aristotle&#x27;s ethics &quot;constantly feel like someone whose jaws have somehow got out of alignment: the teeth don&#x27;t come together in a proper bite&quot;. Modern philosophy had, she believed, discarded Aristotle&#x27;s human (and in its skepticism toward divine law as an adequate substitute), and lost a way of making the study of ethics meaningful. As a result, modern moral philosophy was floundering, unable to recall how its intuitions of good and bad could possibly be grounded in facts. She suggested that it might be possible to backtrack and recover an Aristotelian ethics, but that to do this would require updating some of Aristotle&#x27;s metaphysical and psychological assumptions that are no longer plausible: &quot;philosophically there is a huge gap, at present unfillable as far as we are concerned, which needs to be filled by an account of human nature, human action, the type of characteristic a virtue is, and above all of human &#x27;flourishing.&#x27;&quot;

The modern virtue ethics revival has taken up this challenge. Notably, Alasdair MacIntyre in &quot;After Virtue&quot; (1981) explicitly defended an Aristotelian ethics against modern ethical theories. He claimed that Nietzsche had shown the varieties of modern moral philosophy to be hollow and had effectively refuted them. But he says Nietzsche&#x27;s refutations do not apply to &quot;the quite distinctive kind of morality&quot; found in Aristotelian ethics. So to recover ethics, &quot;the Aristotelian tradition can be restated in a way that restores intelligibility and rationality to our moral and social attitudes and commitments&quot;.

<text>The Raisin River is a river in South Stormont and South Glengarry, United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry in eastern Ontario, Canada, with the watershed encompassing portions of North Stormont, North Glengarry and the city of Cornwall as well. It empties into Lake Saint Francis on the Saint Lawrence River near the community of Lancaster.

The river&#x27;s name is an anglicised form of the earlier French settler name &quot;la rivière aux Raisins&quot;, which referred to the wild grapes (raisins in French) that can still be found growing along the shores of the river.

==Course==
The river begins in a field about west of the community of Newington. It travels south to the community of Bunker Hill, then turns east, and takes in the left tributaries Palen Creek, Shaver Drain and Wereley Creek near the community of North Lunenburg. The Raisin River continues east, takes in the left tributary Stoney Creek at the community of Black River, and passes under Ontario Highway 138 at the community of St. Andrews. It heads northeast, takes in the left tributary Beaver Creek and right tributary McIntosh Drain, then the left tributary North Raisin River at the community of Martintown. It heads east, passes into South Glengarry, takes in the right tributary Glen Falloch Drain and left tributary McIntyre Creek, then reaches the community of Williamstown and the right tributary South Raisin River. The river continues east, takes in the right tributary Glen Drain, passes under Ontario Highway 401, and reaches Lake Saint Francis.

==Recreation==
The &quot;Great Raisin Raisin River Foot Race&quot; is held in Williamstown. In spring, the &quot;Raisin River Canoe Race&quot; runs from Saint Andrews to Williamstown.

<text>Philibert Jacques Melotte (29 January 1880 – 30 March 1961) was a British astronomer whose parents emigrated from Belgium.

In 1908 he discovered a moon of Jupiter, today known as Pasiphaë. It was simply designated &quot;Jupiter VIII&quot; and was not given its present name until 1975. The outer main-belt asteroid 676 Melitta, the only asteroid he discovered, is named after the Attic form of the Greek &quot;Melissa&quot;, the bee, but its resemblance to the discoverer&#x27;s name is not fortuitous.

The conspicuous star cluster in the Coma Berenices constellation is commonly designated Mel 111 since it appeared in Melotte&#x27;s 1915 catalogue of star clusters, but not in Charles Messier&#x27;s famous catalogue of deep sky objects or in the New General Catalogue since it was not proved to be a true cluster until 1938 by the astronomer R J Trumpler.

Melotte was awarded the Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1909. A collection of his papers is held at Cambridge University Library.

<text>Concerto in F is a composition by George Gershwin for solo piano and orchestra which is closer in form to a traditional concerto than his earlier jazz-influenced &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. It was written in 1925 on a commission from the conductor and director Walter Damrosch. A full performance lasts around half an hour.

== Genesis of the Concerto ==
Damrosch had been present at the February 12, 1924 concert arranged and conducted by Paul Whiteman at Aeolian Hall in New York City titled &quot;An Experiment in Modern Music&quot; which became famous for the premiere of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, in which the composer performed the piano solo. The day after the concert, Damrosch contacted Gershwin to commission from him a full-scale piano concerto for the New York Symphony Orchestra, closer in form to a classical concerto and orchestrated by the composer.

Because of contractual obligations for three different Broadway musicals, he was not able to begin sketching ideas until May 1925. He began the two-piano score on July 22, after returning from a trip to London, and the original drafts were entitled &quot;New York Concerto&quot;. The first movement was written in July, the second in August, and the third in September, much of the work being done in a practice shack at the Chautauqua Institution. This had been arranged through the Australian composer and teacher Ernest Hutcheson, who offered seclusion for Gershwin at Chautauqua, where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily. Thanks to this, Gershwin was able to complete the full orchestration of the concerto on November 10, 1925. Later that month, Gershwin hired a 55-piece orchestra, at his own expense, to run through his first draft at the Globe Theatre. Damrosch attended and gave advice to Gershwin, who made a few cuts and revisions.

According to a newspaper reporter in attendance, the pipe &quot;wandered in and out of his mouth all through the rehearsal. In particular, he used it to point accusingly at members of the orchestra who were not solving their jazz problems successfully.&quot;

The Concerto in F shows considerable development in Gershwin&#x27;s compositional technique, particularly because he orchestrated the entire work himself, unlike the &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; which was scored by Ferde Grofé, Paul Whiteman&#x27;s section pianist and principal orchestrator. The English composer and orchestrator William Walton commented that he adored Gershwin&#x27;s orchestration of the concerto. 

==Instrumentation==

In addition to the solo piano, the work calls for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B♭, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 Horns in F, 3 trumpets in B♭, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 3 percussionists (first player: bass drum, glockenspiel, xylophone and triangle; second player: snare drum, woodblock, whip; third player: cymbals, (crash &amp; suspended), triangle and gong), and strings.

== Form ==
The concerto is in the traditional three movements:

# Allegro (F major)
# Adagio - Andante con moto (D-flat major)
# Allegro agitato (G minor → F minor → F major)

There are strong thematic links among the three movements, all of which are heavily influenced by jazz. However, there exists, in each movement, a very subtle structural integrity that, while perhaps not immediately apparent to the listener, is rooted in the classical tradition.

The first movement begins with blasts from the timpani, introducing elements of the main thematic material. After an extended orchestral introduction, the piano enters with a solo section, introducing another melody found throughout the movement. From here, the music alternates with contrasting sections of grandiosity and delicacy. The climax is reached at the &quot;Grandioso&quot;, in which the orchestra resounds the piano&#x27;s original melody, accompanied by a large triplet figure in the soloist. There is a cadenza of quick triplet ostinatos which leads to the final section: speeding octaves and chords, culminating in a large run of the triplet ostinato up the keyboard along an F Major 6 chord, bringing the movement to a close.

The second movement is reminiscent of the blues - beginning with an elegant melody in a solo trumpet accompanied by a trio of clarinets. A faster section featuring the piano follows, building gradually until near the end, at which point the piece deceptively pulls back to the original melody, now given to the flute. The movement ends in a peaceful, introspective cadence.

The final movement is pulsating and energetic with several references to ragtime, featuring both new material and melodies from the previous movements. A false climax is found in a &quot;Grandioso&quot; section identical to that of the first movement, which in turn evolves into another build to the true pinnacle of the concerto, again dominated by the F Major 6 chord, bringing the piece to a close.

In his own words Gershwin wrote a description of the concerto:

=== Allegro ===
The first movement weaves together three rhythms and themes: Charleston, pentatonic runs and sultry. The timpani begins the movement with wham-bok beats, then the orchestra introduces a pentatonic melody accompanied by the Charleston in the horns and percussion. Thirty seconds in, the timpani and orchestra alternate wham-bok beats with the pentatonic melody. After the strings lull, the piano introduces the main sultry theme used throughout the piece. It is repeated again with an orchestral counter-melody played by the cellos and strings at the same time, followed by pentatonic runs in the piano and continuing accompaniment in the orchestra. It climaxes to a chromatic scale run in the piano and resolves with Spanish-sounding syncopation in the orchestra. Piano Charleston syncopation reintroduces the sultry theme heard at the beginning of the piece. This time the piano plays the counter-melody while the orchestra plays the sultry theme. A &quot;micro-cadenza&quot; of arpeggios in the piano bridges the sultry in the orchestra with another variation of Charleston accompaniment and pentatonic melody. Gershwin plays with this variant of the sultry in E major as he leads the listener to a climax of the piece. 
After the climax, Gershwin combines Charleston, pentatonic melody and fast-paced triplets to modulate from one key to another before reintroducing another sultry variation in D-Flat major. Charleston rhythms transition from the sultry to the &quot;Grandioso&quot; climax followed by triplet ostinatos, fast-paced chords, more ostinatos and a C dominant 7 scale. A coda ends the last two minutes with Charleston and sultry in the orchestra and pentatonic lines in the piano before finally ending the movement with an F Major 6 chord.

=== Adagio-Andante con moto ===
In the second movement, Gershwin uses two blues themes, similar to the theme from the first movement and foreshadows the theme of the third movement in a faster theme played between the two blues melodies. A blues chord progression opens the movement, and a solo trumpet plays the first blues theme. The theme is introduced by alternating major seconds in the French horns, then a trumpet solo. By the first minute, the trumpet solo sounds very similar to the sultry theme heard in the first movement. Gershwin continues with improvised and variant themes of the blues melody. The trumpet then repeats the theme played at the beginning. When the trumpet solo ends, the piano enters with a pentatonic variant of the first theme before transitioning into a faster, upbeat second theme. This theme foreshadows the melody of the third movement- through repeated notes. This theme is also a variant of the one heard in the first movement. A violin solo bridges this theme and reintroduces the first theme played at the beginning. The piano then takes over with another variation in a cadenza of both the theme and accompanying arpeggios. After the cadenza, Gershwin passes the original theme to the orchestra, then back to the piano and a flute. He then builds to the climax of the piece, alternating between the piano and the orchestra. The movement ends with the piano playing the theme from the beginning, soft flute and string accompaniment, and a D-Flat Major cadence.

=== Allegro agitato ===
The third movement is a fast-paced rondo and reintroduces the theme heard in the first movement, at a more vigorous tempo. The orchestra begins by playing the main theme of the movement in g minor and then the piano repeats the theme in f minor. As the piano continues to play the fast-paced notes, the orchestra plays a counter-melody. A glissando from the piano reintroduces the theme from the first movement played in the orchestra before transitioning back to the main theme. The orchestra then plays a second theme with soft piano accompaniment. Variants of the main and secondary themes return. After a modulation into B-Flat major, the orchestra plays the second blues theme heard in the second movement and the piano responds with the secondary theme. The rat-a-tat rhythm returns, bridging the blues theme and the repeated note melody from the second movement, played by the orchestra. The movement&#x27;s secondary theme returns in the piano before playing a chord progression heard in the first movement. A series of fast-paced octave scales crescendo into the same &quot;grandioso&quot; heard in the first movement. The rat-a-tat theme returns for the final time in the movement; pentatonic chord progressions and a final F Major 6 tremolo and F major chord finish the piece.

== Release and reception ==
The work was premiered by the New York Symphony Orchestra with Damrosch conducting (three years later the orchestra would merge with the Philharmonic Symphony Society into the New York Philharmonic Orchestra) at Carnegie Hall in New York on December 3, 1925, and featured the composer as the soloist. The same forces presented several performances very soon after—two more in New York, and one each in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, preceding another at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 16 January 1926. The concert was sold out and the concerto was very well received by the general public. However, the reviews were mixed, with many critics unable to classify it as jazz or classical. Indeed, there was a great variety of opinion among Gershwin&#x27;s contemporaries. Sergei Prokofiev found it &quot;amateurish&quot;. 
Arnold Schoenberg, one of the most influential composers at the time, praised Gershwin&#x27;s concerto in a posthumous tribute in 1938:

Damrosch himself provided a note praising Gershwin&#x27;s work:

== Performance in film ==
A performance of the 3rd movement of the concerto is featured during a humorous fantasy sequence in the film &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951). In one of the film&#x27;s many musical numbers, Oscar Levant&#x27;s character Adam Cook, a struggling pianist, daydreams that he is performing the concerto for a gala audience in a concert hall. As the scene progresses, Adam fantasizes that he is also every other member of the orchestra, as well as the conductor, and even envisions that he is applauding himself from the audience at the concerto&#x27;s conclusion.

There is also a performance of an excerpt in the Gershwin biopic &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945) where it is partially played onscreen by Robert Alda (dubbed by Oscar Levant), and then at the film&#x27;s conclusion by Levant himself. It is heard at especially poignant moments, once when Gershwin stumbles over the notes because of the effects of his fatal brain tumor, and once more in the scene in which Gershwin&#x27;s death is announced.

Levant&#x27;s performance of the concerto in &quot;An American in Paris&quot; is noteworthy because Levant was himself an accomplished concert pianist and composer who had befriended Gershwin in 1928.
A 2003 filming on DVD features the Marcus Roberts Trio with Seiji Ozawa conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker at Waldbühne, Berlin.

== Radio broadcast ==
Although Gershwin never recorded the concerto, he was invited by Rudy Vallee to play the third movement from the concerto on an NBC radio broadcast in 1931, which was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on both LPs and compact discs. Vallee used a special arrangement prepared for his studio orchestra. Gershwin also played a few of his popular songs on the broadcast.

== Popular culture ==
Figure skater Yuna Kim of South Korea skated to a four-minute edited version of this piece at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, as well as 2009 Trophée Éric Bompard, 2009 Skate America, and 2009–10 Grand Prix Final, winning the gold medal for ladies&#x27; figure skating and breaking the world record score for the women&#x27;s long program. When she competed in the 2010 World Championships, she won the silver medal totaling 190.79 points.

<doc id="591782" wikidata="Q175772" url="?curid=591782" title="Sundiata Keita">
<text>Sundiata Keita (Mandinka, Malinke: ; 1217 – c. 1255, N&#x27;Ko spelling: ; also known as Manding Diara, Lion of Mali, Sogolon Djata, son of Sogolon, Nare Maghan and Sogo Sogo Simbon Salaba) was a prince and founder of the Mali Empire. He was also the great-uncle of the Malian ruler Mansa Musa, who is usually regarded as the wealthiest person of all time, although there are no reliable ways to accurately calculate his wealth.

Written sources augment the Mande oral histories, with the Moroccan traveller Muhammad ibn Battúta (1304–1368) and the Tunisian historian Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) both having travelled to Mali in the century after Sundiata&#x27;s death, and providing independent verification of his existence. The semi-historical but legendary &quot;Epic of Sundiata&quot; by the Malinké/Maninka people centers on his life. The epic poem is primarily known through oral tradition, transmitted by generations of Maninka griots (&quot;djeli&quot; or &quot;jeliw&quot;). The Manden Charter issued during his reign is listed by UNESCO as one of an intangible cultural heritage.

==Epic of Sundiata==
The oral traditions relating to Sundiata Keita were passed down generation after generation by the local griots (&quot;djeli&quot; or &quot;jeliw&quot;), until eventually their stories were put into writing. Sundiata was the son of Naré Maghann Konaté (variation: &quot;Maghan Konfara&quot;) and Sogolon Condé (variations: &quot;Sogolon Kolonkan&quot; or &quot;Sogolon Kédjou&quot;, the daughter of the &quot;buffalo woman&quot;, so-called because of her ugliness and hunchback). Sundiata was crippled from childhood and his mother (Sogolon) was the subject of ridicule among her co-wives. She was constantly teased and ridiculed openly for her son&#x27;s disability. This significantly affected Sundiata and he was determined to do everything he possibly could in order to walk like his peers. Through this determination, he one day miraculously got up and walked. Among his peers, he became a leader. His paternal half-brother, Dankaran Touman, and Dankaran&#x27;s mother, Sassouma Bereté, were cruel and resentful of Sundiata and his mother. Their cruelty escalated after the death of Naré Maghann (the king and father of Sundiata). To escape persecution and threats on her son&#x27;s life, Sogolon took her children, Sundiata and his sisters, into exile. This exile lasted for many years and took them to different countries within the Ghana Empire and eventually to Mema, where the king of Mema granted them asylum. Sundiata was admired by the King of Mema for his courage and tenacity. As such, he was given a senior position within the kingdom. When King Soumaoro Kanté of Sosso conquered the Mandinka people, messengers were sent to go and look for Sogolon and her children, as Sundiata was destined to be a great leader according to prophecy. Upon finding him in Mema, they persuaded him to come back in order to liberate the Mandinkas and their homeland. On his return, he was accompanied by an army given to him by the King of Mema. The warlords of Mali at the time who were his age group included: Tabon Wana, Kamadia Kamara (or Kamadia Camara), Faony Condé, Siara Kuman Konaté and Tiramakhan Traore (many variations: &quot;Trimaghan&quot; or &quot;Tiramaghan&quot;, the future conqueror of Kaabu). It was on the plain of Siby (var: Sibi) where they formed a pact brotherhood in order to liberate their country and people from the powerful Sosso king. At The Battle of Kirina, Sundiata and his allies defeated the Sosso king, and he became the first Emperor of the Mali Empire. He was the first of the Mandinka line of kings to adopt the royal title &quot;Mansa&quot; (&quot;king&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot; in the Mandinka language).

The Mandinka epic does not give us dates, but Arab and North African writers who visited the area about a century after the epic&#x27;s events documented on paper some of the information, including dates and a genealogy. Conversely, the written sources left out other pieces of information that the oral tradition includes.

*Sogolon Djata
*Sundjata Keyita
*Mari Djata or &quot;Mārī-Djāta&quot; (according to Ibn Khaldun in the late 14th century)
*The Lion King
The proper English spelling of Sundiata&#x27;s name is Sunjata, pronounced &quot;soon-jah-ta&quot;, approaching the actual pronunciation in the original Mandinka. The name &quot;Sogolon&quot; derives from his mother and &quot;Jata&quot; means &quot;lion&quot;. It is the traditional way of praising someone in some West African societies (Gambia, Senegal, Mali and Guinea in particular). The name &quot;Sundiata&quot; praises him through his mother which means &quot;the lion of Sogolon&quot; or &quot;Sogolon&#x27;s lion&quot;. The name &quot;Jata&quot; derives from &quot;Jara&quot; (lion). Jara and many of its variations such as &quot;jata&quot;, &quot;jala&quot; or &quot;jada&quot; are merely regional variations, from Gambia, Guinea or Mali, for instance. Sundiata&#x27;s name is thus a derivation of his mother&#x27;s name Sogolon (&quot;Son&quot; or its variation &quot;Sun&quot;) and Jata (lion).

==Surname (Keita or Konaté?)==

Some Bambaras and Mandinkas have proposed that the name &quot;Keita&quot; actually means &quot;inheritor&quot; (heir-apparent) in the Mandinka language, and that Sundiata&#x27;s real surname is &quot;Konaté&quot; (French spelling in Mali) or &quot;Konateh&quot;, variations: Konate, Conateh (English spelling in the Gambia where the Mandinkas make up the largest ethnic group). It is proposed that Sundiata Keita&#x27;s father, Naré Maghann Konaté, took the real family name &quot;Konaté&quot; while his successors were &quot;Keitas in waiting&quot; (heirs to the throne). The name &quot;Keita&quot; is a clan name rather than a surname. Although in some West African societies a clan can be similar to the family name (see Joof family), such similarities do not exist between the names &quot;Keita&quot; and &quot;Konaté&quot;. Both points of contention agree that Keita is not a real surname, but rather a royal name, in spite of the fact that Sundiata is referred to as Sundiata Keita in many scholarly works. At present, there is no consensus among the scholars regarding the name &quot;Sundiata Konaté.&quot;

==Battle of Kirina==
French ethnographer Maurice Delafosse previously proposed that Soumaoro Kanté&#x27;s grandfather, with the help of his army and the Sosso nobility of Kaniaga, captured what was left of the sacked Ghana Empire and by 1180, Diara Kanté (var: &quot;Jara Kante&quot;), Soumaoro&#x27;s father, gained control of Koumbi Saleh, dethroned a Muslim dynasty and continued the Diarisso Dynasty (variation: &quot;Jariso&quot; or &quot;Jarisso&quot;) whose son (Soumaoro) went on to succeed him and launched an offensive against the Mandinkas. Delafosse&#x27;s original work has been refuted and discarded by many scholars including Monteil, Cornevin, etc. There was no Diara Kanté in the oral sources. That was an addition by Delafosee which was contrary to the original sources.
The consensus is, in c. 1235, Sundiata who had survived one of Soumaoro&#x27;s earlier raids went to war with the help of his allies against King Soumaoro of Sosso. Although a valiant warrior, Soumaoro was defeated at The Battle of Kirina (c. 1235). Soumaoro is regarded as one of the true champions of the Traditional African religion. According to Fyle, Soumaoro was the inventor of the balafon and the &quot;dan&quot; (a four-string guitar used by the hunters and griots). After his victory at Kirina, Sundiata took control of the former conquered states of the Sosso and appropriated privileges among those who participated in the defeat of Soumaoro. The former allies of Soumaoro were also later defeated, in particular the king of Jolof. Serer oral tradition speaks of a Serer king of Jolof, involved in the occult (just as Soumaoro), who was later defeated by Tiramakhan Traore (one of the generals of Sundiata) after Sundiata sent his men to buy horses in Jolof. It is reported that, when Sundiata sent his men to Jolof to buy horses in a caravan loaded with gold, the king of Jolof took all the gold and horses – known among some as &quot;the robbery of the horses&quot;. In a revenge attack, Sundiata sent his general to Jolof to assassinate the king. It is believed that, it was probably this king of Jolof (known as Mansa Jolofing or Jolofing Mansa) who sided with Soumaoro at The Battle of Kirina and possibly belongs to the Ngom Dynasty of Jolof, the predecessors of the Diaw and Ndiaye Dynasties of Jolof. At present, little is known about the Ngom Dynasty of Jolof.

Niane has advanced the claim that, the Jolofing Mansa sided with Sumaguru [or &quot;Soumaoro&quot;] because &quot;like him, he was hostile to Islam.&quot; He went on to state that:
:&quot;He&quot; [the King of Jolof] &quot;confiscated Diata&#x27;s&quot; [Sundiata&#x27;s] &quot;horses and sent him a skin, saying that he should make shoes out of it since he was neither a hunter nor a king worthy to mount a horse.&quot;

==Religion==
In his piece in the &quot;General History of Africa&quot;, Volume 4, p. 133, Djibril Tamsir Niane alludes to Sundiata being a Muslim. According to Fage, there is nothing in the original epos that supports the claim. Sundiata is regarded as a great hunter and magician whose subjects predominantly adhered to traditional beliefs, as did Sundiata. However, some of Sundiata&#x27;s successors were Muslim, with Mansa Musa Keita being one of the most widely known. The explorer Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali during the reign of Sundiata&#x27;s great-nephew Suleyman, claimed that Mansa Musa&#x27;s grandfather was named Sariq Jata and had converted to Islam. This may be a reference to Sundiata, though if so Ibn Battuta was apparently mistaken about the genealogy, as Musa&#x27;s grandfather was Sundiata&#x27;s brother Mande Bory. Other medieval Arabic sources claim that a ruler before Sundiata named Barmandana was the first ruler of Mali to convert to Islam.

Some Muslim griots later added to the epic of Sundiata by claiming that Sundiata has &quot;an ancestral origin among the companions of Muhammad in Mecca&quot; (namely, Bilal Ibn Rabah) and speaks of himself as a successor to Dhu al-Qarnayn, a conqueror and king mentioned in the Quran, commonly regarded as a reference to Alexander the Great. Claims such as these are referred to by scholars like G. Wesley Johnson as nothing more than &quot;Islamic legitimacy&quot; - in African countries where Islam is now the predominant religion such as Senegal, and where Muslim griots try to link historical African figures to Muhammad either through a line of descent or by claiming that the ancestor of the historical figure belonged to Muhammad&#x27;s tribe or was one of his followers (an attempt to distance them from their traditional African religious past). Although Sundiata was not a Muslim, it is clear that the original epic of Sundiata was later affected by what Ralph Austen calls &quot;Islamicate&quot; culture—that is, the integration of Islamic and Arab culture.

==Imperial Mali==
After his victory at Kirina, Mansa Sundiata established his capital at Niani, near the present-day Malian border with Guinea. Assisted by his generals, Tiramakhan being one of the most prominent, he went on to conquer other states. The lands of the old Ghana Empire were conquered. The king of Jolof was defeated by Tiramakhan and his kingdom reduced to a vassal state. After defeating the former ally of Soumaoro, Tiramakhan ventured deep into present-day Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea Bissau and conquered them. Tiramakhan was responsible for the conquest of the Senegambia. In Kaabu (part of present-day Guinea Bissau), he defeated the last great Bainuk king (King Kikikor) and annexed his state. The great Kikikor was killed and his kingdom was renamed Kaabu. Sundiata was responsible for the conquest of Diafunu and Kita. Although the conquered states were answerable to the Mansa (&quot;king&quot;) of Mali, Sundiata was not an absolute monarch despite what the title implies. Though he probably wielded popular authority, the Mali Empire was reportedly run like a federation with each tribe having a chief representative at the court. The first tribes were Mandinka clans of Traore, Kamara, Koroma, Konde (or &quot;Conde&quot;), and of course Keita. The Great Gbara Assembly was in charge of checking the Mansa&#x27;s power, enforcing his edicts among their people, and selecting the successor (usually the Mansa&#x27;s son, brother or sister&#x27;s son). The Empire flourished from the 13th to the late 14th century but began to decline as some vassal states threw away the yoke of Mali and regained their independence. Some of these former vassals went on to form empires of their own.

==Death==
The generally accepted death year of Mansa Sundiata Keita is c. 1255. However, there is very little information regarding his cause of death. Not only are there different versions, mainly modern, but Mandinka tradition forbids disclosing the burial ground of their great kings. According to some, he died of drowning while trying to cross the Sankarani River, near Niani. If one is to believe Delafosse, he was &quot;accidentally killed by an arrow during a ceremony.&quot; Others have maintained that he was assassinated at a public demonstration, also known as a Gitten. At present, the generally accepted cause of death is drowning in the Sankarani River, where a shrine that bears his name still remains today (&quot;Sundiata-dun&quot; meaning &quot;Sundiata&#x27;s deep water&quot;). His three sons (Mansa Wali Keita, Mansa Ouati Keita and Mansa Khalifa Keita) went on to succeed him as Mansas of the Empire. The famous and notably ostentatious West African ruler Mansa Musa was Sundiata Keita&#x27;s great-nephew.

==Legacy==

A strong army was a major contributor to the success of Imperial Mali during the reign of Mansa Sundiata Keita. Credit to Mali&#x27;s conquests cannot all be attributed to Sundiata Keita but equally shared among his generals, and in this, Tiramakhan Traore stood out as one of the elite generals and warlords of Sundiata&#x27;s Imperial Mali. However, in a wider perspective of 13th century West African military history, Sundiata stood out as a great leader who was able to command the loyalties of his generals and army.

It was during his reign that Mali first began to become an economic power, a trend continued by his successors and improved on thanks to the ground work set by Sundiata, who controlled the region&#x27;s trade routes and gold fields. The social and political constitution of Mali were first being codified during the reign of Mansa Sundiata Keita. Known as the Gbara and the Kouroukan Fouga, although not written and even subject to alterations in retelling and when they were first recorded in written form, they were part of the social and political norms of Mali. Many of these laws have been incorporated into the constitution of modern-day Mali.

Sundiata Keita was not merely a conqueror who was able to rule over a large empire with different tribes and languages, but also developed Mali&#x27;s mechanisms for agriculture, and is reported to have introduced cotton and weaving in Mali. Towards the end of his reign, &quot;absolute security&quot; is reported to have &quot;prevailed throughout his dominion.&quot;

From a global perspective, the Epic of Sundiata and the Mali Empire is taught in many schools, colleges and universities, not just in West Africa but in many parts of the World. Some scholars such as Ellen Snodgrass and others have observed similarities with the 13th-century Epic of Sundiata to Walt Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Disney has maintained that the film was inspired by William Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet.

The 1995 Burkinabe movie &quot;Keïta! l&#x27;Héritage du griot&quot; tells the legend of Sundiata Keita.

The video game &quot;Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms&quot; contains a five-chapter campaign depicting Sundjata.

The 4X video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot; includes Sundiata Keita as an alternate leader for the Malian civilization in the &quot;Rulers of the Sahara&quot; Pack of the New Leader Pass.

<text>Jacob (Jack) Shulman, (1914–1999), was a Jewish American anti-revisionist communist activist and Hoxhaist who fought in the Spanish Civil War and later moved to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Background==

Jacob Schulman was born and raised in Rochester, New York, to Jewish parents who had fled Tsarist Russia. His father was a housepainter and his mother a washerwoman. Shulman won a scholarship to college but had to leave due to the onset of the Great Depression.

==Career==

Shulman joined the Young Communist League in 1930 and went on in 1936 to serve with the Lincoln Brigade for 26 months during the Spanish Civil War and in United States Army during World War II. In the early 1950s he worked in the South as part of the Party&#x27;s organizing efforts with African Americans. He was for several years William Z. Foster&#x27;s secretary.

Shulman was dissatisfied by the Communist Party USA&#x27;s turn away from Marxism–Leninism following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; in 1956. Following his resignation from the Party, Shulman traveled to Albania and China in pursuit of his political objectives.

Shulman visited Albania then moved to China in 1968 and worked as an editor of English language publications during the Cultural Revolution in Beijing. As China itself began to display outward revisionist tendencies Shulman grew closer to the Party of Labour of Albania. He returned to the United States, published &quot;Albania Report&quot; and organized the USA-Albania Friendship Association. He had good relationships with the India-Albania Friendship Association and Indian Marxist–Leninists. After the fall of communism in Albania he participated in the Alliance Marxist–Leninist (North America) and supported International Struggle Marxist–Leninist (ISML). He was associated with the British Marxist–Leninist W. B. Bland. In 2008, former political associates of Shulman helped found the American Party of Labor.

==Personal life==

Shulman married three times. The ashes of his third wife, Ruth, are buried in the Martyr&#x27;s Hill in Tirana.

Shulman died in 1999.

His son Norman, an American draft dodger who joined him in China during the Vietnam War, stayed behind in China for several years and met and later married Jan Wong, a Canadian student who later became a journalist.

<text>Botho Strauss (; written as Botho Strauß) (born 2 December 1944) is a German playwright, novelist, and essayist.

== Early life ==
His father was a chemist.

After finishing his secondary education, Strauss studied German, History of the Theatre and Sociology in Cologne and Munich. He never finished his dissertation on &quot;Thomas Mann und das Theater&quot;. During his studies, he worked as an extra at the Munich Kammerspiele.

== Career ==

From 1967 to 1970, he was a critic and editorial journalist for the journal &quot;Theater heute&quot; (&quot;Theater Today&quot;). Between 1970 and 1975, he worked as a dramaturgical assistant to Peter Stein at the West Berlin Schaubühne am Halleschen Ufer.

After his first attempt as a writer, a Gorky film adaptation, he decided to work as a writer. Strauss had his first breakthrough as a dramatist with the 1977 &quot;Trilogie des Wiedersehens&quot;, five years after the publication of his first work. In 1984, he published &quot;Der Junge Mann&quot; (&quot;The Young Man)&quot;, translated by Roslyn Theobald in 1995.

With a 1993 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; essay, &quot;Anschwellender Bocksgesang&quot; (&quot;Swelling He-Goat Song&quot;) a critical examination of modern civilisation, he triggered a major political controversy as his conservative politics was anathema to many.

In his theoretical work, Strauß showed the influence of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Adorno, but his outlook was also radically anti-bourgeois.

In 2014, Carl Hanser Verlag brought out a compendium of Strauß’s aphorisms called &quot;Allein mit allen&quot;, spanning close to four decades from 1977 to 2013, and edited by German scholar Sebastian Kleinschmidt.

Strauss lives in Berlin as well as in the nearby Uckermark region. In 2017, he switched from his long-time publisher Carl Hanser Verlag to Rowohlt Verlag.

<text>Herman Stevens Jr. (born June 17, 1965) is an American attorney and former professional wrestling manager, best known for his attorney gimmicks as Clarence Mason in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and as J. Biggs in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1999–2000.

==Early life==
As a child, Stevens always wanted to be a performer in the wrestling industry. While in college, he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain an internship with WCW. When Stevens was in the Southern University Law Center, he befriended Ernie Ladd, who managed to get him a meeting with the WWF. Stevens went to New York to meet with Vince McMahon and was eventually signed to a contract.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Federation (1995–1997)===
Stevens entered the WWF in 1995 as Clarence Mason (whose stage name was a play on Clarence Darrow and Perry Mason), a lawyer primarily introduced to play off the publicity lawyers had gotten during the ongoing O. J. Simpson trial. His character and speaking style were based on Johnnie Cochran.

Clarence Mason was introduced as the legal counsel for Jim Cornette, who was attempting to reverse a decision at an In Your House 3 pay per view event that had seen Yokozuna and the British Bulldog, whom Cornette was managing, lose the WWF Tag Team Championship held by Diesel and Shawn Michaels. Following this, Mason continued his association with Cornette and his stable of wrestlers.

In August 1996, Mason left the Cornette stable and managed Crush (Brian Adams). Adams had been arrested in March 1995 and spent some time in jail; upon his return the WWF gave him a biker gimmick and used his real-life incarceration as part of a storyline, with Mason as his attorney. Later that year Mason became manager of Faarooq and the two formed The Nation of Domination, a heel stable loosely based on the Nation of Islam and Black Panther Party, Crush would join the stable as well. Mason still managed Owen &amp; Bulldog while with The Nation, but got fired by the Bulldog in March 1997. In June 1997, Faarooq &quot;fired&quot; Mason from the Nation of Domination, according to Mason in a shoot interview, he requested to be taken out of the Nation because he was uncomfortable with their racial comments in storylines and interviews that they were doing, the other reason was because Vince McMahon wanted managers to start taking more bumps and getting involved in matches and Mason was written off television and released from his WWF contract.

===World Championship Wrestling===
In 1999, Stevens resurfaced in WCW as J. Biggs, where he managed Chris Kanyon. A few months later, Kanyon dropped his association with Biggs, which left him to search for a new client. This time, Biggs picked the newly established tag team of Harlem Heat 2000, which consisted of Stevie Ray and Big T. The team feuded with Booker T. Biggs gained a (kayfabe) court order against Booker T, which stated he could not use the letter &quot;T&quot; after defeating Booker at SuperBrawl 2000 when the lights were turned off and Big T rolled Booker up when they were turned back on as per match stipulation. Shortly thereafter, Biggs was released from his contract and left professional wrestling.

===Post-wrestling===
After leaving WCW, Stevens headed to South Florida and returned to his original profession, a practicing attorney. He currently practices out of offices in Delray Beach.

<text>Channel 9 was a Microsoft website for hosting videos and podcasts that Microsoft employees create.

Launched in 2004 when Microsoft&#x27;s corporate reputation was at a low, Channel 9 was the company&#x27;s first blog. It was named after the United Airlines audio channel that lets airplane passengers listen to the cockpit&#x27;s conversations unhindered; the site published conversations among Microsoft developers, rather than its chairman Bill Gates, who had historically been the &quot;face&quot; of Microsoft. This made it an inexpensive alternative to Microsoft&#x27;s Professional Developers Conference, then the main public platform where customers and outside developers could speak to Microsoft employees without the intervention of the company&#x27;s PR department. The Channel 9 team produced interviews with Bill Gates, Erik Meijer, and Mark Russinovich.

On November 5, 2021, it was announced that Microsoft would merge Channel 9 into Microsoft Learn. The move was completed on December 1, effectively rendering the original site defunct. However, past videos from the former site can still be seen there.

Channel 9, however, was not a community website and did not host any content made by the community. That had not always been the case. The site once hosted discussion forums, as well as a wiki based on Microsoft&#x27;s own FlexWiki. The wiki had been used to provide &quot;ad hoc&quot; feedback to Microsoft teams, such as the Internet Explorer team.

He is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and has served in the House of Representatives since 2001. He held ministerial office in the governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2007 to 2013, including as a member of cabinet from 2012 to 2013. He was a member of the shadow cabinet from 2013 to 2022.

O&#x27;Connor announced his retirement from Federal Parliament effective at 2025 Australian federal election.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Connor was born on 2 March 1962 in London, England. He is the son of Michael and Philomena O&#x27;Connor. His parents were both born in Ireland, his mother in Thurles and his father in Tralee. O&#x27;Connor was born with both Irish and British citizenship, renouncing the latter in the early 1980s. He acquired Australian citizenship by naturalisation in 1995 and renounced his Irish citizenship in 2001 in order to stand for parliament.

O&#x27;Connor arrived in Australia when he was six years old.

At the time of his endorsement for Burke in 2001 he was aligned with the &#x27;Independent Left&#x27;, a breakaway group from the Socialist Left. This group included Julia Gillard. O&#x27;Connor has been a close ally of Julia Gillard since they were both involved in student politics during the 1980s along with Michael O&#x27;Connor. In 2015, the Independent Left rejoined the Socialist Left.

<doc id="591839" wikidata="Q25416839" url="?curid=591839" title="Flammulina filiformis">
<text>Flammulina filiformis, commonly called enoki mushroom, is a species of edible agaric (gilled mushroom) in the family Physalacriaceae. It is widely cultivated in East Asia, and well known for its role in Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Until recently, the species was considered to be conspecific with the European &quot;Flammulina velutipes&quot;, but DNA sequencing has shown that the two are distinct.

==Etymology==

In Japanese, the mushroom is known as &quot;enoki-take&quot; or &quot;enoki-dake&quot;, both meaning &quot;hackberry mushroom&quot;. This is because it is often found growing at the base of hackberry (&quot;enoki&quot;) trees.

In Mandarin Chinese, the mushroom is called &quot;jīnzhēngū&quot; ( &quot;gold needle mushroom&quot;) or &quot;jīngū&quot; ( &quot;gold mushroom&quot;).

In Korean, it is called &quot;paengi beoseot&quot; (팽이버섯) which means &quot;mushroom planted near catalpa&quot;. In Vietnamese it is known as &quot;nấm kim châm&quot;. In India it is called &quot;futu&quot;.

== Description ==
Basidiocarps are agaricoid and grow in clusters. Individual fruit bodies are up to tall, the cap convex at first, becoming flat when expanded, up to across. The cap surface is smooth, viscid when damp, ochraceous yellow to yellow-brown. The lamellae (gills) are cream to yellowish white. The stipe (stem) is smooth, pale yellow at the apex, yellow-brown to dark brown towards the base, and lacking a ring. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid to cylindrical, c. 5 to 7 by 3 to 3.5μm.

There is a significant difference in appearance between wild and cultivated basidiocarps. Cultivated enokitake are not exposed to light, resulting in white or pallid fruit bodies with long stipes and small caps.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Flammulina filiformis&quot; was originally described from China in 2015 as a variety of &quot;F. velutipes&quot;, based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. Further molecular research using a combination of different sequences has shown that &quot;F. filiformis&quot; and &quot;F. velutipes&quot; are distinct and should be recognized as separate species.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The fungus is found on dead wood of &quot;Betula platyphylla&quot;, &quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;, &quot;Dipentodon sinicus&quot;, &quot;Neolitsea&quot; sp., &quot;Salix&quot; spp, and other broad-leaved trees. It grows naturally in China, Korea, and Japan.

==Nutritional profile==
Enoki mushrooms are 88% water, 8% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). In a 100-gram reference serving, enoki mushrooms provide of food energy and are an excellent source (20% or more of the Daily Value) of the B vitamins, thiamine, niacin, and pantothenic acid, while supplying moderate amounts of riboflavin, folate, and phosphorus (table).

=== Potential health benefits ===
The nutritional value of &quot;F. filiformis&quot; has long been recognised, which makes them an object of interest in current research. &quot;F. filiformis&quot; is a rich source for carbohydrates, proteins and unsaturated fatty acids as well as several noteworthy micronutrients and dietary fiber. 

While its nutritional value and culinary applications are well established, recent studies have begun exploring its potential medicinal properties in greater depth. Several bioactive molecules from various chemical classes have been isolated from &quot;F. filiformis&quot; extracts, showing promising potential for future applications as nutraceuticals or dietary supplements. Moreover, bioactive polysaccharides derived from &quot;F. filiformis&quot; have demonstrated to exhibit a broad spectrum of bioactivities, including anticancer, immunomodulatory, and anti-neurodegenerative effects. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear and warrant further investigation in future research.

In conclusion, &quot;F. filiformis&quot; holds significant promise as both a functional food and a nutraceutical, and may serve as an interesting source of bioactive compounds for therapeutic and pharmaceutical purposes.

==Uses==
&quot;F. filiformis&quot; has been cultivated in China since 800 AD. Commercial production in China was estimated at 1.57 million tonnes per annum in 2010, with Japan producing an additional 140,000 tonnes per annum. The fungus can be cultivated on a range of simple, lignocellulosic substrates including sawdust, wheat straw, and paddy straw. Enokitake are typically grown in the dark, producing pallid fruitbodies having long and narrow stipes with undeveloped caps. Exposure to light results in more normal, short-stiped, colored fruitbodies.

===As food===
The mushroom is widely eaten in East Asia. Cultivated &quot;F. filiformis&quot; is sold both fresh and canned. The fungus has a crisp texture and can be refrigerated for approximately one week. It is a common ingredient for soups, especially in East Asian cuisine, but can be used for salads and other dishes.

=== Improved storaging ===
&quot;F&quot;. &quot;filiformis&quot; extract can be added to whipped cream. It was observed that this measure helps to slow down the development of ice crystals, which would maintain the quality of whipped cream longer while storing it in a frozen state.

=== Nutritionally improved meat products ===

&quot;F. filiformis&quot; are an object of interest in current research for their potential to enhance food products and animal feed by using the stem waste. 

Studies indicate that the addition of &quot;F. filiformis&quot; stem waste powder to meat products can improve nutritional quality by increasing dietary fiber and ash content. This ingredient also enhances tenderness, inhibits lipid and protein oxidation, and extends shelf life, without negatively impacting the texture or flavor of the meat products. 

=== Feed additive for livestock ===
Natural feed additives become more important in livestock farming. Following this trend, &quot;F.&quot; filiformis was checked for livestock health and production efficiency improving properties. There are studies showing that the use of Enoki mushroom residue as a feed additive offers several benefits for livestock. It enhances antioxidant enzyme activity, and improves animal digestibility, hormone levels, and immunity. 

The addition of mushroom residue in the livestock diet can reduce the feed cost and feed conversion ratio and enhance the meat quality, providing consumers with healthier and higher-quality meat products. 

== Cultivation and harvest ==

The common way to cultivate &quot;F. filiformis&quot; is in a large-scale factory style. By using modern possibilities to mechanize processes, over 300&#x27;000 tons a year of &quot;F. filiformis&quot; can be harvested that way.

=== Indoor cultivation ===
&quot;F. filiformis&quot; thrive in a warm, moist environment during the incubation phase, with substrate temperatures ranging from 18 to 25°C (64 to 77°F). &quot;F. filiformis&quot; need significantly cooler conditions to trigger fruiting. Pinning is triggered at temperatures ranging between 7 to 10°C (45 to 50°F), and the optimal temperature range for fruiting is 10 to 16°C (50 to 61°F). As with most fungi, &quot;F. filiformis&quot; also demand elevated humidity levels—95 to 100% during pinning and 85 to 95% during fruiting. 

The ideal size to harvest enoki mushrooms is generally recommended to be about 2-4 inches in length. At that time, the cap of &quot;F. filiformis&quot; should still be tightly closed and the stem should be long and sturdy. If people grow enoki mushrooms at home, they can use a sharp knife or scissors to snip off the mushroom cluster at the base of the stem where it meets the growing medium. It&#x27;s important to remove both the mushrooms and any remaining mycelium (the white, thread-like structures) from the growing medium during harvest. This helps prevent decaying, which could negatively impact future mushroom growth.

=== Post-harvest handling ===

&quot;F. filiformis&quot; have thin, delicate stems that need to be handled with care to prevent damage. The following steps are for reference. First, gently brush off any dirt or substrate with a soft brush or a damp cloth. Once cleaned, separate the clusters into individual stems for easier cooking and better presentation. After cleaning, separate the mushroom clusters into individual stems for easier cooking and presentation.

=== Storage ===
&quot;F. filiformis&quot; should be kept at temperatures between 7-10°C (44.6-50°F) for optimal freshness. For brief storage (fewer than 7 days), a temperature interval of 1-2°C (34-36°F) with 90-98% relative humidity is advised. 

=== Proneness to Listeria ===
&quot;F. filiformis&quot; have the potential to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, which is why disease control centers recommend cooking the mushroom upon consumption. 

Singapore Food Agency advise people to do the following to ensure food security when consuming &quot;F. filiformis:&quot;

# Enoki mushrooms should never be eaten raw
# Instead, make sure to cook the mushrooms properly before eating them
# If there are cooking directions at hand, make sure to follow them
# Enoki mushrooms should be stored at cold temperatures to ensure a slower growth of microbes. This should be done even if the packaging is not opened yet
# Uncooked enoki mushroom should be stored separately to avoid cross-contamination

<doc id="591849" wikidata="Q114275" url="?curid=591849" title="Congress of Laibach">
<text>The Congress of Laibach was a conference of the allied sovereigns or their representatives, held in 1821 in Ljubljana (then Laibach) as part of the Congress System which was the decided attempt of the five Great Powers to settle international problems after the Napoleonic Wars through discussion and collective weight rather than on the battlefield. A result of the Congress was the authorization of Austrian intervention in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in order to quell a liberal uprising.

==Background==
The Congress was held in Laibach (modern day Ljubljana) in what is now Slovenia but was then part of the Austrian Duchy of Carniola, from January 26 until May 12, 1821. Before the breakup of the Congress of Troppau it had been decided to adjourn it until the following January, and to invite King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, Laibach being chosen as the place of meeting. Castlereagh, in the name of Great Britain, had cordially approved this invitation, as implying negotiation and therefore as a retreat from the position taken up in the Troppau Protocol. Before leaving Troppau however, the three autocratic powers, Russia, Austria and Prussia, had issued a circular letter on December 8, 1820, in which they reiterated the principles of the Protocol, i.e. the right and duty of the powers responsible for the peace of Europe to intervene to suppress any revolutionary movement by which they might conceive that peace to be endangered (Hertslet, No. 105). Against this view Castlereagh once more protested in a circular dispatch of January 19, 1821, in which he clearly differentiated between the objectionable general principles advanced by the three powers, and the particular case of the unrest in Italy, the immediate concern not of Europe at large, but of Austria and of any other Italian powers which might consider themselves endangered (Hertslet, No. 107).

==Events==
The conference opened on January 26, 1821, and its constitution emphasized the divergences revealed in the above circulars. Emperors Alexander I of Russia and Francis I of Austria were present in person, and with them were Counts Nesselrode and Capodistria, Metternich and Baron Vincent; Prussia and France were represented by plenipotentiaries. Britain, on the ground that she had no immediate interest in the Italian question, was represented only by the Lord Stewart, the ambassador at Vienna, who was not armed with full powers, his mission being to watch the proceedings and to see that nothing was done beyond or in violation of the treaties. Of the Italian princes, Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies and Francis IV, Duke of Modena came in person; the rest were represented by plenipotentiaries.

It was soon clear that a more or less open breach between Britain and the other powers was inevitable. Metternich was anxious to secure an apparent unanimity of the powers to back the Austrian intervention in Naples, and every device was used to entrap the British representative into subscribing a formula which would have seemed to commit Britain to the principles of the other allies. When these devices failed, attempts were made unsuccessfully to exclude Lord Stewart from the conferences on the ground of defective powers. Finally, he was forced to an open protest, which he caused to be inscribed on the journals, but the action of Capodistria in reading to the assembled Italian ministers, who were by no means reconciled to the large claims implied in the Austrian intervention, a declaration in which as the result of the intimate union established by solemn acts between all the European powers the Russian emperor offered to the allies the aid of his arms, should new revolutions threaten new dangers, an attempt to revive that idea of a universal union based on the Holy Alliance against which Britain had consistently protested.

The objections of Britain were, however, not so much to an Austrian intervention in Naples as to the far-reaching principles by which it was sought to justify it. King Ferdinand had been invited to Laibach, according to the circular of December 8, in order that he might be free to act as mediator between his erring peoples and the states whose tranquillity they threatened. Ferdinand made cynical use of his freedom to repudiate obligations solemnly contracted (albeit under duress) with the Neapolitan people. The result of this action was the Neapolitan declaration of war and the occupation of Naples by Austria, with the sanction of the congress. This was preceded, on March 10, by the revolt of the garrison of Alessandria and the military revolution in Piedmont, which in its turn was suppressed, as a result of negotiations at Laibach, by Austrian troops.

==Eastern Question==

It was at Laibach too that on March 19 Emperor Alexander received the news of Alexander Ypsilantis&#x27; invasion of the Danubian Principalities, which heralded the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, and from Laibach that Capodistria (himself of Greek origin) issued the tsar&#x27;s repudiation of the action to the Greek leader.

The conference closed on the May 12, 1821, on which date Russia, Austria and Prussia issued a declaration (Hertslet, No. 108) to proclaim to the world the principles which guided them in coming to the assistance of subdued peoples, a declaration which once more affirmed the principles of the Troppau Protocol. In this lay the European significance of the Laibach conference, of which the activities had been mainly confined to Italy. The issue of the declaration without the signatures of the representatives of Britain and France proclaimed the disunion of the alliance; within which, to use Lord Stewart&#x27;s words, there existed a triple understanding which bound the parties to carry forward their own views in spite of any difference of opinion between them and the two great constitutional governments.

<text>Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe OMSG (5 December 1924 – 27 February 1978) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and founding member of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), serving as the first president of the organization.

Sobukwe was regarded as a strong proponent of an Africanist future for South Africa and opposed political collaboration with anyone other than Africans, defining &quot;African&quot; as anyone who lives in and pays allegiance to Africa and who is prepared to subject themselves to African majority rule. In March 1960, Sobukwe organized and launched a non-violent protest campaign against pass laws, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison on grounds of incitement. In 1963, the enactment of the &quot;Sobukwe Clause,&quot; allowed an indefinite renewal of his prison sentence, and Sobukwe was subsequently relocated to Robben Island for solitary confinement. At the end of his sixth year at Robben Island, he was released and placed under house arrest until his death in 1978.

==Early life==

=== Childhood: 1924–1947 ===
Sobukwe was born in Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape Province on 5 December 1924, as the youngest child of Hubert and Angelina Sobukwe. While his father who was from Lesotho worked as a general store clerk and part-time woodcutter, Sobukwe&#x27;s Xhosa mother served as a domestic worker in white homes. He grew up in a poor household and was educated at a local Methodist mission for primary school. At age 15, Sobukwe continued and eventually completed his secondary education at the Healdtown Institute, which provided a Methodist Christian and liberal arts education to all students.

=== Fort Hare: 1947–1949 ===
In 1947, Sobukwe enrolled at the South African Native College at Fort Hare, the premier undergraduate institution for black students of his time. Although Sobukwe was initially not interested in politics, his study of Native Administration (relating to the administration of South Africa&#x27;s Bantustans), combined with his exposure to politics at Fort Hare, made Sobukwe keener to the topic.

*He joined the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in 1948. The organisation had been established on the university campus by Godfrey Pitje, who later became its president. In 1949, Sobukwe was elected as the first president of the Fort Hare Students&#x27; Representative Council, where he proved himself to be a distinguished orator.

==Mainstream politics==

=== Standerton: 1950–1954 ===
In 1950, Sobukwe was appointed as a teacher at a high school in Standerton, a position he lost when he spoke out in favour of the Defiance Campaign in 1952; he was, however, later reinstated. In 1952, Sobukwe achieved notoriety backing the Defiance Campaign. During this period he was not directly involved with mainstream ANC activities, but still held the position of secretary of the organisation&#x27;s branch in Standerton.

=== Johannesburg: 1954–1959 ===
In 1954, after moving to Johannesburg, Sobukwe became a lecturer of African Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand. During his time in Johannesburg he became editor of &quot;The Africanist&quot; newspaper and soon began to criticise the ANC for allowing itself to be dominated by sympathizers of the Progressive Party, which he termed &quot;liberal-left-multi-racialists&quot;. He stood for an Africanist Socialist Democracy. was an ardent supporter of Africanist views about liberation in South Africa and rejected the idea of working with Whites.

=== Pan-Africanist Congress: 1959–1960 ===

==== Formation and ideology ====
Sobukwe was a strong believer in an Africanist future for South Africa and rejected any model suggesting working with anyone other than Africans, defining African as anyone who lives in and pays his allegiance to Africa and who is prepared to subject himself to African majority rule. He grew discontented with the progress of the liberation struggle during the 1950s, in which the apartheid government continually introduced new means to suppress the liberation struggle. Resonating with many members of the ANC, Sobukwe had become impatient with the ANC&#x27;s inability to achieve results. Sobukwe, an anticommunist, also rejected the ANC&#x27;s alliance with the South African Communist Party. He later left the ANC to form the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and was elected its first President in 1959.
Sobukwe became known as the Professor or simply &quot;Prof&quot; to his close comrades and followers, a testament to his educational achievements and powers of speech and persuasion. He spoke of the need for black South Africans to &quot;liberate themselves&quot; without the help of non-Africans; Sobukwe defined non-Africans as anyone who lives in Africa or abroad Africa and who does not pay his allegiance to Africa and who is not prepared to subject himself to African majority rule. His strong convictions and active resistance inspired many other individuals and organisations involved in the anti-apartheid movement, notably the Black Consciousness Movement.

Sobukwe argued that whites should be excluded from the ANC as it was impossible to have a relationship between blacks and whites until further progress had been made. He argued that a reliance on whites would disempower the realization that many of these Africans had, that they had the power to overtake a society that had been taken from them. Sobukwe rejected collaboration with sympathetic whites as he considered such multi-racial cooperation between slave owner and slave as an &quot;ungodly alliance&quot; before equality was attained.

==== Anti-pass campaign of 1960 ====
On 21 March 1960, the PAC led a nationwide protest against the pass laws which required black people to carry a pass book at all times. Sobukwe led a march to the local police station at Orlando, Soweto, in order to openly defy the laws. He was joined en route by a few followers and, after presenting his pass to a police officer, he purposely made himself guilty under the terms of the pass law of being present in a region/area other than that allowed as per his papers. In a similar protest on the same day in Sharpeville, police opened fire on a crowd of PAC supporters, killing 69 in the Sharpeville Massacre. In the aftermath, Sobukwe was taken without a fair trial and both the ANC and PAC were banned. Other organizations such as Steve Bikos&#x27;s Black Consciousness Movement were inspired by the actions of Sobukwe.
==Imprisonment==

=== Initial imprisonment: 1960–1963 ===
Following Sobukwe&#x27;s arrest after the Sharpeville massacre, he was charged with and convicted of incitement, and sentenced to three years in prison. He served one year of his sentence in Witbank Prison (1960—1961) followed by two years in Pretoria Gaol (1961—1963).

=== Robben Island: 1963–1969 ===
As the end of Sobukwe&#x27;s three-year sentence approached, the National Party parliament passed the General Law Amendment Act, which introduced a clause allowing for political dissidents to be indefinitely detained. This allowed Sobukwe&#x27;s sentence to be renewed for an additional six years, which he spent on Robben Island. The clause became known as the &quot;Sobukwe Clause&quot; as no other individual was sentenced under this provision. At Robben Island, Sobukwe was in company of other revolutionaries in liberation struggle such as Nelson Mandela, Johnson Mlambo, and John Nyathi Pokela, among many others.Sobukwe was kept in solitary confinement but enjoyed a unique prisoner-plus status; he was permitted certain privileges including books, magazines, newspapers, civilian clothing, etc. He lived in a separate area on the island and was strictly prohibited from contact with other prisoners, though Sobukwe was able to communicate sporadically through visual signals while outside for exercise. He studied during this time and received (among others) a degree in economics from the University of London. It is speculated that Sobukwe was subjected to this special treatment because the South African government had profiled him as a greater troublemaker than the regular ANC prisoners. Sobukwe&#x27;s son disputes terming this treatment as &quot;special&quot;.

Throughout his imprisonment, Sobukwe maintained communication with his friend Benjamin Pogrund who later became his biographer.

=== House arrest: 1969–1978 ===
As authorities recognized Sobukwe&#x27;s deteriorating physical and mental health, he was released from Robben Island in 1969. Sobukwe was allowed to live in Kimberley with his family but remained under house arrest. Kimberley was suggested as an area where he could not easily foster subversive activities and also a place where he could live and work while being easily monitored by the state. He was also restricted through a banning order, which disallowed political activities.

Various restrictions barred Sobukwe from travelling overseas, thus curtailing his attempts to further his education. For this same reason, he had to turn down several positions as a teacher at various locations in the United States. Sobukwe completed his law degree with the help of a local lawyer, in Galeshewe, and he then started his own practice in 1975 in Kimberley.

==Illness and death==
In early 1977, Sobukwe fell ill and applied for permission to receive medical treatment; his request was denied indefinitely until the intervention of his friend Benjamin Pogrund. Subsequently, in September 1977, Sobukwe travelled to Johannesburg where he was diagnosed with lung cancer and then transferred to a hospital in Cape Town. Although the South African government granted Sobukwe access to treatment, they imposed strict conditions on his travel; Sobukwe was required to report to a police station every time he left Kimberley or arrived at the hospital. He died from complications of lung cancer on 27 February 1978 and was buried in Graaff-Reinet on 11 March 1978.

==Legacy==
Sobukwe has become a key historical figure in the black liberation struggle of South Africa. His vision of a society dedicated to individual rights, irrespective of race or ethnicity, is shared by many of his contemporaries such as in elements of the ANC and Pan-Africanists.:478 In Sobukwe&#x27;s 1959 PAC inaugural speech, he shared a sentiment that continues to be quoted by anti-racism rhetoric in popular media, as he stated:There is only one race to which we all belong, and that is the human race. In our vocabulary therefore, the word &#x27;race&#x27; as applied to man, has no plural form.Following Sobukwe&#x27;s imprisonment and the official South African banning of the anti-apartheid parties in 1960, the influence of the Pan-Africanist Congress steadily waned and was eventually overshadowed again by the African National Congress. The PAC, along with many other anti-apartheid organizations, were forced to move to underground operations. Under the leadership of Potlako Leballo, the PAC came to sponsor and create a paramilitary wing Poqo. Leballo&#x27;s revolutionary rhetoric inspired the planning of violent operations, ultimately leading to the public arrest of 3,246 PAC and Poqo members.

In 2012, Robert Sobukwe Street in Pretoria (formerly known as Esselen Street) was renamed after him in commemoration of his contributions to the black liberation struggle. Similarly, in 2013, Robert Sobukwe Road in Cape Town (formerly known as Modderdam Road) was renamed after him. Central Block at the University of the Witwatersrand was renamed to Robert Sobukwe Block in 2016 following major support among students and alumni.

<text>The Football Alliance was an association football league in England which ran for three seasons, from 1889–90 to 1891–92.

==History==
In 1888, the same year the Football League was founded, The Combination was established by clubs who had been excluded from the Football League, initiated by Crewe Alexandra secretary J. G. Hall, and announced at the Royal Hotel in Crewe. However, while the Football League quickly proved a success, the Combination lacked central organisation, with poor planning and unfulfilled fixtures, and failed to complete its first season, finishing in April 1889 without a winner.

===Foundation===

Several of The Combination founders met after the final Combination board meeting to discuss a new combination; four of those who agreed in principle to form a new league, South Shore, Burslem Port Vale, Notts Rangers, and Derby Midland, did not in fact do so, while Grimsby Town, originally considered too distant, was brought back into the fold. The remaining clubs then established the Football Alliance, to begin in the 1889–90 season. The Alliance covered a similar area to the League, stretching from the English Midlands to the North West, but also further east in Sheffield, Grimsby and Sunderland. The president of the Football Alliance was John Holmes, also the president of The Wednesday who were the first champions winning fifteen games out of twenty-two.

The nine founder clubs (eight bolded in the table below) originally decided to form the Alliance, originally under the name of the Northern Counties League, and considered applications from 6 clubs to fill the remaining three places. Crewe Alexandra, Nottingham Forest, and Walsall Town Swifts were elected in the ballot, with Long Eaton Rangers, Halliwell, and Witton missing out. The clubs attended a meeting at the Midland Hotel in Derby in May 1889 to arrange fixtures, but, as Sunderland did not attend, it was assumed Sunderland did not intend to play; and Witton, South Shore, Burslem Port Vale, Derby Midland, Halliwell, and Long Eaton Rangers applied to join in its place. After Long Eaton Rangers and Witton tied in the voting, the casting vote of the chairman (Harry Mitchell of Mitchell St George&#x27;s) was in favour of the Rangers.

===Alliance seasons===

At the end of the Alliance&#x27;s first season, in accordance with the rules agreed at the start of the season, the bottom four clubs - Walsall Town Swifts, Small Heath, Long Eaton Rangers, and Nottingham Forest - had to apply for re-election, and, unlike the rule in the Football League the previous season, they were not allowed to vote; seven clubs (Stoke, Witton, South Shore, Chester, Burslem Port Vale, Sheffield United, and Lincoln City) applied for admission. Stoke, who had just failed re-election to the Football League, was admitted in place of Long Eaton Rangers, and the other bottom four clubs were re-elected. The prizes awarded to the champions included a blue silk flag, with a white border, 12 feet by 6 feet, with the words &quot;Alliance Champions&quot; on it.

The following year, Stoke and Darwen, another Alliance club, were accepted into the Football League, taking its membership to 14 clubs. Stoke&#x27;s biggest challenge in winning the title was the threat of expulsion from the Alliance, as Stoke had arranged a friendly with League club Notts County which clashed with an Alliance match at Nottingham Forest, and refused to pay the £10 fine imposed for so doing.

At the end of the 1890-91 season, Sunderland Albion resigned in protest at having to pay half of the train fare of visiting clubs, and the bottom four clubs were re-elected back into the Alliance. To fill the three vacancies, eight clubs applied; Ardwick, Bury, Burton Swifts, Gainsborough Trinity, Middlesbrough, Northwich Victoria, Lincoln City, and Sheffield United. The successful clubs were Ardwick, Burton Swifts, and Lincoln City - the last by one vote.

===Merger into the Football League===

In 1892 it was decided to merge the two leagues, and so the Football League Second Division was formed, consisting mostly of Football Alliance clubs; the only Alliance club not to apply to join the League was the insolvent Birmingham St George&#x27;s. The existing League clubs, plus three of the strongest Alliance clubs, comprised the Football League First Division.

<doc id="591874" wikidata="Q2268380" url="?curid=591874" title="Local multipoint distribution service">
<text>Local multipoint distribution service (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV). It was conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile.
LMDS commonly operates on microwave frequencies across the 26 GHz and 29 GHz bands. In the United States, frequencies from 31.0 through 31.3 GHz are also considered LMDS frequencies.

Throughput capacity and reliable distance of the link depends on common radio link constraints and the modulation method used either phase-shift keying or amplitude modulation. Distance is typically limited to about due to rain fade attenuation constraints. Deployment links of up to from the base station are possible in some circumstances such as in point-to-point systems that can reach slightly farther distances due to increased antenna gain.

== History and outlook ==

=== United States ===
There was interest in LMDS in the late 1990s and it became known in some circles as &quot;wireless cable&quot; for its potential to compete with cable companies for provision of broadband television to the home. The Federal Communications Commission auctioned spectrum for LMDS in 1998 and 1999.

Despite its early potential and the hype that surrounded the technology, LMDS was slow to find commercial traction. Many equipment and technology vendors simply abandoned their LMDS product portfolios.

Industry observers believe that the window for LMDS has closed with newer technologies replacing it. Major telecommunications companies have been aggressive about deploying alternative technologies such as IPTV and fiber to the premises, also called &quot;fiber optics&quot;. Moreover, LMDS has been surpassed in both technological and commercial potential by the LTE, WiMax and 5G NR standards.

===Europe and worldwide===
Although some operators use LMDS to provide access services, LMDS is more commonly used for high-capacity backhaul for interconnection of networks such as GSM, UMTS, LTE and Wi-Fi.

<text>The Congress of Verona met at Verona from 20 October to 14 December 1822 as part of the series of international conferences or congresses that opened with the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15, which had instituted the Concert of Europe at the close of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Representation==
The Quintuple Alliance was represented by the following persons:
* : Emperor Alexander I and Count Karl Robert Nesselrode (minister of foreign affairs). Count George Mocenigo (Ambassador of Russia in Turin) was also present; 
* : Prince Metternich;
* : Prince Hardenberg and Count Christian Gunther von Bernstorff; 
* : Anne-Adrien-Pierre de Montmorency-Laval (minister of Foreign Affairs) and François-René de Chateaubriand; 
* : The Duke of Wellington, who was taking the place of Foreign Secretary Lord Londonderry after the latter&#x27;s suicide on the eve of the congress. Accompanying Wellington was the British ambassador to Austria, the new Lord Londonderry, the younger brother of the former Foreign Secretary.

Aside from the five leading powers a variety of other nations were represented in Verona, marking the largest gathering since Vienna seven years earlier. The attendees included Oscar, Crown Prince of Sweden.

A delegation of Greeks, currently fighting for their independence, were turned away at Ancona. Recognition was also refused to representatives of the Urgel Regency of Spain, royalist opponents of the country&#x27;s liberal government.

== Issues ==

While the representatives of Great Britain and the other European powers had at first, during the Congress of Vienna, acted largely in concert, the extent to which the concord epitomized in the expression the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot; had unraveled in seven years became apparent in the way in which the three main questions before this Congress were handled.

The instructions drawn up by Londonderry, as he then was, for his own guidance, had been handed to Wellington by George Canning without alteration. They defined the British position towards the three questions which it was supposed would be discussed: the Eastern question (currently surfacing in the Greek insurrection), the question of intervention in favor of the Bourbon royal power in Spain and the revolted Spanish colonies in America, and the Italian Question.

===Italian Question===
The matter of the Italian Question dealt with the continued Austrian rule in Northern Italy. Since Britain could not undertake to support a system in which she had merely acquiesced, Wellington did not even formally present his credentials until the other Powers had disposed of the matter, a British minister Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (Castlereagh&#x27;s half-brother and successor in the Londonderry title) attending merely to keep informed and to see that nothing was done inconsistent with the European system and the treaties.

===Greek Question===
In the Greek Question, the probable raising of which had alone induced the British government to send a minister plenipotentiary to the Congress, Wellington was instructed to suggest the eventual necessity for recognizing the belligerent rights of the Greeks, and, in the event of concerted intervention, to be careful not to commit Britain, beyond a supporting role. (See Greek War of Independence.)

As for Russia and Austria, the immediate problems arising out of the Greek Question had already been privately settled between the Emperor Alexander and Metternich, to their mutual satisfaction, at the preliminary conferences held at Vienna in September.

===Spanish Question===
When the plenipotentiaries met in Verona, the only question raised was the Spanish Question, of the proposed French intervention in Spain, in which Wellington&#x27;s instructions were to express London&#x27;s uncompromising opposition to the whole principle of intervention.

The discussion was opened by three questions formally propounded by Montmorency:
# Would the Allies withdraw their ministers from Madrid in the event of France being compelled to do so?
# In case of war, under what form and by what acts would the powers give France their moral support, so as to give to her action the force of the Quintuple Alliance, and inspire a salutary fear in the revolutionaries of all countries?
# What material aid would the powers give if asked by France to intervene, under restrictions which France would declare and they would recognize?

A series of gilt-copper medals apparently struck in England represent participants of the Congress in less than flattering lights: the &quot;Count de Chateaubriand&quot; (Ludwig Ernst Bramsen, &quot;Médallier&quot;) bears an inscription that offers the British view of the French position in a nutshell: &quot;The , while the Emperor Francis I of Austria asserts &quot;My troops occupy Naples to chastise the Neapolitans for daring to change their constitution.&quot;

The reply of Alexander, who expressed his surprise at the desire of France to keep the intervention wholly French, was to offer to march 150,000 Russians through Germany to Piedmont, where they could be held ready to act against any Jacobins, whether in Spain or France. This solution appealed as little to Metternich and Montmorency as to Wellington; but though united in opposing it, four days of confidential communications revealed a fundamental difference of opinion. Wellington, firmly based on the principle of non-intervention, refused to have anything to do with the suggestion, made by Metternich, that the powers should address a common note to the Spanish government in support of the action of France. Finally, Metternich proposed that the Allies should hold a common language, but in separate notes, though uniform in their principles and objects. This solution was adopted by the continental powers; but Wellington, in accordance with his instructions not to countenance any intervention in Spanish affairs, took no part in the conferences that followed. On October 30 the powers handed in their formal replies to the French memorandum.

Russia, Austria and Prussia would act as France should in respect of withdrawing their ministers, and would give to France every assistance she might require, the details to be specified in a treaty. Wellington, on the other hand, replied on behalf of Great Britain that having no knowledge of the cause of dispute, and not being able to form a judgment upon a hypothetical case, he could give no answer to any of the questions.

Thus was proclaimed the open breach of Britain with the principles and policy of the Quintuple Alliance, as it had become with the admission of France in 1818, which development is what gives to the congress its main historical interest. The ensuing French intervention ended with the Battle of Trocadero, which reinstated Ferdinand VII of Spain and opened a reactionary period of Spanish and European politics that led to the Year of Revolutions, 1848.

<text>is a special file in Unix-like operating systems that provides as many null characters (ASCII NUL, 0x00) as are read from it. One of the typical uses is to provide a character stream for initializing data storage.

==Function==
Read operations from return as many null characters (0x00) as requested in the read operation.

Unlike , may be used as a source, not only as a sink for data. All write operations to succeed with no other effects. However, is more commonly used for this purpose.

When is memory-mapped, e.g., with mmap, to the virtual address space, it is equivalent to using anonymous memory; i.e. memory not connected to any file.

==History==
 was introduced in 1988 by SunOS-4.0 in order to allow a mappable BSS segment for shared libraries using anonymous memory. HP-UX 8.x introduced the MAP_ANONYMOUS flag for mmap(), which maps anonymous memory directly without a need to open . Since the late 1990s, MAP_ANONYMOUS or MAP_ANON are supported by most UNIX versions, removing the original purpose of .

==Examples==

Erasing a file system partition or drive:

 cp /dev/zero /dev/&lt;destination drive or partition&gt;

(Note that this does not perform a secure erasure, may not destroy the data at all, and may take significantly more time than required – for this purpose, domain-specific tooling like &quot;blkdiscard&quot; may be preferred for devices that support TRIM.)

Creating a 1 MiB file, called &quot;foobar&quot;, filled with null characters:

 head -c $(( 1024 * 1024 )) /dev/zero &gt; foobar

Instead of creating a file really filled with only zero bytes, many file systems also support the creation of sparse files, which return zeros upon reading but use less actual space. The classic way of doing this (without the domain-specific &quot;truncate&quot; utility) would be, to create a 1 GiB file:

 dd =1 seek=$(( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 - 1 )) count=1 &lt; /dev/zero &gt; foobar

which seeks to position &quot;seek&quot;·&quot;bs&quot;=1GiB−1 in the output and copies &quot;count&quot;·&quot;bs&quot;=1 byte from /dev/zero, thus making the file contain only one data block.

<text>Ivor Seward Richard, Baron Richard, (30 May 1932 – 18 March 2018) was a British Labour politician who served as a member of Parliament (MP) from 1964 until 1974. He was also a member of the European Commission and latterly sat as a life peer in the House of Lords.

==Education==
Born in Cardiff, Wales, Ivor Richard was educated at St. Michael&#x27;s School, an independent school in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, followed by Cheltenham College, an independent school in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke College at the University of Oxford.

==Political career==

===1959–1974===
Lord Richard had been an active member of the Labour Party and the Fabian Society since University and stood for Parliament in Kensington South in the general election of 1959. This was one of the most prosperous constituencies in the whole country, and he came third, but it was intended as no more than an opportunity to try his campaigning skills. For the 1964 election, Richard was adopted as candidate for Baron&#x27;s Court, a highly marginal constituency between Hammersmith and Fulham. Baron&#x27;s Court had seen knife-edge contests before, and the presence of the BBC television centre nearby ensured good media coverage.

Richard won the seat by just over 1,000 votes. In Parliament he served briefly as an assistant to Denis Healey as Secretary of State for Defence and was appointed as Minister for the Army in 1969. He was lucky to keep his seat despite the swing to the Conservatives in the 1970 election, and he became an opposition spokesman on telecommunications. He lost this job when he voted in favour of joining the European Communities (Common Market) in 1971, but was swiftly reappointed as a Foreign Affairs spokesman.

However, the Baron&#x27;s Court seat was too small to survive the redistribution that took effect in 1974. Richard found it difficult to find a new seat, as pro-Europeanism was not popular within the Labour Party. He was eventually chosen at the last minute to fight Blyth against the sitting Labour MP who had been deselected in a row over his allegations of the corruption of the local Labour Party. With no background in the area and a popular opponent, Richard was defeated convincingly.

===1974–1985===
The incoming Labour Government appointed him in June 1974 as the UK Permanent Representative to the UN, where he served for five years. Richard played a role in trying to bring together the sides in the Middle East and Rhodesia conflicts. He became a figure of controversy after the then US Ambassador, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, criticised the UN for passing a resolution stating that Zionism was a form of racism, and Richard denounced him for behaving &quot;like the Wyatt Earp of international politics.&quot;

Richard presided as chairman over the Geneva Conference on Rhodesia from 28 October to 14 December 1976. The conference was called to implement the terms of Henry Kissinger&#x27;s agreement with Prime Minister Ian Smith of Rhodesia from the previous month on the creation of an interim government to preside. At the same time, a new majority-rule constitution was written. But the various African nationalists from Rhodesia refused to recognise the agreement and no progress was made during the six weeks of the conference. Smith was scathing in his treatment of Richard in his memoirs, citing Richard&#x27;s &quot;lack of integrity and courage&quot; in failing to hold to the terms of the Kissinger agreement.

The incoming Conservative government in 1979 replaced Richard within months. However, in 1980 he was chosen by the Labour Party to take one of the posts on the European Commission (replacing Roy Jenkins). It was known that he was the Labour Party&#x27;s third choice for the position: former Treasury Minister Joel Barnett had rejected an invitation, and the Conservative government had vetoed former Defence Secretary Fred Mulley. Richard took responsibility for Employment, Social Policy, Education and Training.

===After 1985===
Richard returned to Wales in 1985 and was appointed Chairman of World Trade Centre Wales Ltd., which tried to attract international investors for Welsh business. He unsuccessfully sought the Labour nomination for Cardiff West losing to Rhodri Morgan. In 1990, his name was included on a list of Labour Party &#x27;Working Peers&#x27;, and was created a life peer on 14 May 1990 taking the title Baron Richard, of Ammanford in the County of Dyfed and became an opposition spokesman in the House of Lords. His barrister&#x27;s style led to his appointment as Leader of the Labour Peers from 1992, which brought with it appointment to the Privy Council. Richard led Labour in the Lords during their final spell in their near 20-year opposition before the landslide victory in 1997. Richard attempted to step up the Labour attack and in late 1993 pioneered an unprecedented (for the House of Lords) Motion of No Confidence in the Government, although he acknowledged it was a symbolic gesture and would not bring down the government, due to the primacy of the House of Commons.

When Labour won the 1997 election, Richard became Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. With Labour policy favouring a reform of the House starting with removing the hereditary peers, Richard began work on the new composition of the House but was shocked when he was suddenly removed at the first reshuffle in July 1998 to be replaced by Baroness Jay of Paddington. His thoughts on the reform of the House were published in &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; in 1999, and Richard became a critical friend of the Government.

Lord Richard latterly served as chairman of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the Draft House of Lords Reform Bill.

==Death==
Lord Richard died in Lambeth, London, in March 2018 at the age of 85.

==Richard Commission==
The Coalition Government in the National Assembly for Wales invited Richard to chair a commission on the future powers of the Assembly from 2002. The report was published on 31 March 2004 and recommended that the Assembly have full primary legislative powers in devolved areas from 2011, a recommendation that was controversial with Wales&#x27; Labour MPs.

<text>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, also known as the Foreign Minister, is the minister of state of the Commonwealth of Australia charged with overseeing the creation and implementation of international diplomacy, relations and foreign affairs policy, as the head of the foreign affairs section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The current Foreign Minister is Senator Penny Wong, who was appointed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May 2022 following the 2022 federal election. 

Wong is the first female Foreign Minister from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the third female foreign minister in a row, following Julie Bishop and Marise Payne. The position is one of two cabinet-level portfolio ministers under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the other being the Minister for Trade and Tourism. The Foreign Minister is vested with several subordinate positions, including the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, currently held by Pat Conroy, and the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, currently held by Tim Watts.

==Scope==

The minister is usually one of the most senior members of Cabinet – the position is equivalent to that of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in Britain or Secretary of State in the United States – as shown by the fact that eleven Prime Ministers of Australia have also worked as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister is seen as one of the people most responsible for formulating Australia&#x27;s foreign policy, as they along with other relevant ministers advise the Prime Minister in developing and implementing foreign policy, and also acts as the government&#x27;s main spokesperson on international affairs issues. In recent times, the minister also undertakes numerous international trips to meet with foreign representatives and Heads of State or Government.

==List of ministers for foreign affairs==
The portfolio has existed continuously since 1901, except for the period 14 November 1916 to 21 December 1921. Prior to 6 November 1970, the office was known as the Minister for External Affairs. Between 24 July 1987 and 24 March 1993 it was known as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Starting with the Keating government, the Trade portfolio has been administered separately by the Minister for Trade.

The following individuals have been appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs, or any of its precedent titles:
Notes
: Also served as Prime Minister for some or all of their term.
: Barton was knighted in 1902, while serving as Minister.

==List of ministers for international development and the Pacific==
The Minister for International Development was responsible, in the Rudd Cabinet, for the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the international development and humanitarian aid policies of the Commonwealth of Australia, administered through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). AusAID was abolished by the incoming prime minister, Tony Abbott, in September 2013 and under the operations of the Abbott Cabinet its functions were absorbed into DFAT.

<text>The Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, held in the autumn of 1818, was a high-level diplomatic meeting of France and the four allied powers Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, which had defeated it in 1814. The purpose was to decide the withdrawal of the army of occupation from France and renegotiate the reparations it owed. It produced an amicable settlement, whereby France refinanced its reparations debt; the Allies in a few weeks withdrew all of their troops.

It was part of the series of conferences known as the Concert of Europe.

The occupation was formally terminated at the conference on 30 September 1818; by 30 November evacuation was complete. The French representative Duc de Richelieu succeeded in having France admitted as a full discussion partner in the European congress system and France&#x27;s position as a European power was restored.

Financially, France was originally obligated to pay 700 million francs, in installments every four months for five years (1815 Treaty of Paris). When the Congress met, Paris had discharged its obligations punctually. 332 million remained; France offered to pay the sum of 265 million. Of that, 100 million francs would be in the form of French bonds bearing interest, the rest in installments through to English banks.

The main achievement of the Congress was to definitively terminate the wars of 1792–1815. They closed out all claims against France, and accepted France as an equal and full member of the Concert of Four, which was now composed of Five Powers. To hedge their bets, the Four secretly renewed the Quadruple Alliance, but this was a formality of no consequence. The Four drifted apart year by year over questions dealing with Italy, South America, and Greece.

==Background==
British Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh proposed in March 1818 that there should be a Congress later in the year. Metternich took up the proposal but was concerned to limit the number of countries attending. In particular he was alarmed by the prospect of Spain, 
whose growing closeness to Russia was clear, strengthening the hand of the Tsar. It was therefore agreed that only those five countries that had signed the 1815 Treaty of Paris would take part. This excluded a large number of participants who had previously taken part in the Congress of Vienna.

While several locations were considered for the Congress Aix-la-Chapelle, which had been part of Prussia since 1815, was chosen due to its proximity to Wellington&#x27;s Army of Occupation in northern France. Seventy years before the spa town had hosted the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle of 1748 that ended the War of the Austrian Succession.

Britain&#x27;s Prince Regent commissioned the country&#x27;s leading portrait painter Thomas Lawrence to travel to the Congress and paint the leading dignitaries. Amongst them was his &quot;Portrait of Francis I of Austria&quot; and &quot;Portrait of the Duke of Richelieu&quot;. These works became the core of the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle.

==Delegates==
The congress, convened in Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle) on 1 of October, and its first session was attended by Emperor Alexander I of Russia, the Emperor Francis I of Austria, and King Frederick William III of Prussia. Britain was represented by Lord Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington, Austria by Prince Metternich, Russia by Counts Capo d&#x27;Istria and Nesselrode, Prussia by Prince Hardenberg and Count Bernstorff. The Duc de Richelieu, by favour of the Allies, was present on behalf of France. Members of the Rothschild banking dynasty were also heavily involved in the congress. The British Secretary at War Lord Palmerston, a future Foreign Secretary, was also present.

==A treaty for withdrawal==
The evacuation of France by Allied units was agreed to in principle at the first session, the consequent treaty being signed on 9 October. The immediate object of the conference being thus readily disposed of, the time of the congress was mainly occupied in discussing the form to be taken by the European alliance, and the &quot;military measures&quot;, if any, to be adopted as a precaution against a fresh outburst on the part of France. The proposal of the Emperor Alexander I to establish a &quot;universal union of guarantee&quot; on the broad basis of the Holy Alliance, after much debate, broke down on the uncompromising opposition of Britain; and the main outcome of the congress was the signature, on 15 November, of two instruments:
# a secret protocol confirming and renewing the Quadruple Alliance established by the treaties of Chaumont and Paris (of 20 November 1815) against France
# a public &quot;declaration&quot; of the intention of the powers to maintain their intimate union, &quot;strengthened by the ties of Christian brotherhood&quot;, of which the object was the preservation of peace on the basis of respect for treaties.
The secret protocol was communicated in confidence to Richelieu; to the declaration France was invited publicly to adhere.

==Diverse discussions==

The Russian tsar proposed the formation of an entirely new alliance, to include all of the signatories from the Vienna treaties, to guarantee the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and preservation of the ruling governments of all members of this new coalition. The tsar further proposed an international army, with the Russian army as its nucleus, to provide the wherewithal to intervene in any country that needed it. Castlereagh, speaking for Britain saw this as a highly undesirable commitment to reactionary policies. He recoiled at the idea of Russian armies marching across Europe to put down popular uprisings. Furthermore, to admit all the smaller countries, would create intrigue and confusion. Britain refused to participate, so the idea was abandoned.

The delegates discussed several topics left unsettled in the hurried winding up of the Congress of Vienna, or which had arisen since. The most important were the methods to be adopted for the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and the Barbary pirates. In neither case was any decision arrived at, owing mainly to the refusal of the other powers to agree with the British proposal for a reciprocal right of search on the high seas and to the objection of Britain to international action which would have involved the presence of a Russian squadron in the Mediterranean.

In matters of less importance the Congress was more unanimous. 
Thus on the urgent appeal of King Frederick VI of Denmark, Charles XIV of Sweden received a peremptory summons to carry out the terms of the Treaty of Kiel; The petition of the Prince-elector of Hesse to be recognized as king was unanimously rejected; and measures were taken to redress the grievances of the German mediatized princes.

The important outstanding questions in Germany, e.g. the Baden succession, were after consideration reserved for a further conference to be called at Frankfurt am Main, which occurred on 10 July 1819.

In addition to these a great variety of questions were considered, from the treatment of Napoleon in exile at Saint Helena to the grievances of the people of Monaco against their prince and the position of the Jews in Austria and Prussia. An attempt made to introduce the subject of the Spanish colonies was defeated by the opposition of Britain.

==Diplomacy==
Certain vexatious questions of diplomatic etiquette were settled once and for all. (see diplomatic rank and )

==Assessment==
The Congress, which broke up at the end of November, is of historical importance mainly as marking the highest point reached during the 19th century in the attempt to govern Europe by an international committee of the powers. The detailed study of its proceedings is highly instructive in revealing the almost insurmountable obstacles to any really effective international diplomatic system prior to the creation of the League of Nations after the First World War.

<doc id="591931" wikidata="Q4350180" url="?curid=591931" title="Dependency ratio">
<text>The dependency ratio is an age-population ratio of those typically not in the labor force (the &quot;dependent&quot; part ages 0 to 14 and 65+) and those typically in the labor force (the &quot;productive&quot; part ages 15 to 64). It is used to measure the pressure on the productive population.

Consideration of the dependency ratio is essential for governments, economists, bankers, business, industry, universities and all other major economic segments which can benefit from understanding the impacts of changes in population structure. A low dependency ratio means that there are sufficient people working who can support the dependent population. 

A lower ratio could allow for better pensions and better health care for citizens. A higher ratio indicates more financial stress on working people and possible political instability. While the strategies of increasing fertility and of allowing immigration especially of younger working age people have been formulas for lowering dependency ratios, future job reductions through automation may impact the effectiveness of those strategies.

==Formula==
In published international statistics, the dependent part usually includes those under the age of 15 and over the age of 64. The productive part makes up the population in between, ages 15 – 64. It is normally expressed as a percentage:
:formula_1

As the ratio increases there may be an increased burden on the productive part of the population to maintain the upbringing and pensions of the economically dependent. This results in direct impacts on financial expenditures on things like social security, as well as many indirect consequences.

The (total) dependency ratio can be decomposed into the child dependency ratio and the aged dependency ratio:

:formula_2

:formula_3

== Total dependency ratio by regions ==
===Projections===
Below is a table constructed from data provided by the UN Population Division. It shows a historical ratio for the regions shown for the period 1950 - 2010. Columns to the right show projections of the ratio. Each number in the table shows the total number of dependents (people aged 0–14 plus people aged over 65) per hundred people in the workforce (number of people aged 15–64). The number can also be expressed as a percent. So, the total dependency ratio for the world in 1950 was 64.8% of the workforce.

As of 2010, Japan and Europe had high aged dependency ratios (that is over 65 as % of workforce) compared to other parts of the world. In Europe 2010, for every adult aged 65 and older there are approximately four working age adults (15-64); This ratio (one:four, or 25%) is expected to decrease to one:two, or 50%, by 2050. An aging population is caused by a decline in fertility and longer life expectancy. The average life expectancy of males and females are expected to increase from 79 years in 1990 to 82 years in 2025. The dependency amongst Japan residents aged 65 and older is expected to increase which will have a major impact on Japan&#x27;s economy.

== Inverse dependency ratio ==
The inverse of the dependency ratio, the inverse dependency ratio can be interpreted as how many independent workers have to provide for one dependent person (pension &amp; expenditure on children).

== Old-age dependency ratio ==
A high dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country if a large proportion of a government&#x27;s expenditure is on health, social security &amp; education, which are most used by the youngest and the oldest in a population. The fewer people of working age, the fewer the people who can support schools, retirement pensions, disability pensions and other assistances to the youngest and oldest members of a population, often considered the most vulnerable members of society. The ratio of old (usually retired) to young working people is called old age dependency ratio (OADR) or just dependency ratio.

The old-age dependency ratio ignores the fact that the 65+ are not necessarily dependent (an increasing proportion of them are working, see also retirement age) and that many of those of &#x27;working age&#x27; are actually not working. Alternatives have been developed&#x27;, such as the &#x27;economic dependency ratio&#x27;, but they still ignore factors such as increases in productivity and in working hours. Worries about the increasing (demographic) dependency ratio should thus be taken with caution.

== Labor force dependency ratio ==
The &quot;labor force dependency ratio&quot; (LFDR) is a more specific metric than the &quot;old age dependency ratio&quot; because it measures the ratio of the older &quot;retired&quot; population to the &quot;employed&quot; population at &quot;all ages&quot; (or the ratio of the inactive population to the active population at all ages).

== Productivity weighted labor force dependency ratio ==
While OADRs or LFDRs provide reasonable measures of dependency, they do not account for the fact that middle-aged and educated workers are usually the most productive. Hence the productivity weighted labor force dependency ratio (PWLFDR) may be a better metric to determine dependency. The PWLFDR is the ratio of inactive population (all ages) to active population (all ages), weighted by productivity for education level. Interestingly, while OADRs or LFDRs can change substantially, the PWLFDR is predicted to remain relatively constant in countries like China for the next couple of decades. PWLFDR assessments recommend to invest in education and life-long learning and child health to maintain social stability even when populations age.

== Migrant labor dependency ratio ==
Migrant labor dependency ratio (MLDR) is used to describe the extent to which the domestic population is dependent upon migrant labor.

== Impact on savings and housing markets ==
High dependency ratios can lead to long-term economic changes within the population such as saving rates, investment rates, the housing markets, and the consumption patterns. Typically, workers will start to increase their savings as they grow closer to retirement age, but this will eventually affect their long-term interest rates due to the retirement population increasing and the fertility rates decreasing. If the demographic population continues to follow this trend, their savings will decrease while their long-term interest rates increase. Due to the saving rates decreasing, the investment rate will prevent economic growth because there will be less funding for investment projects. There is a correlation between labor force and housing markets, so when there is a high age-dependency ratio in a country, the investments in housing markets will decrease since the labor force is decreasing due to a high dependency population.

==Solutions==
Low dependency ratios promote economic growth while high dependency ratios decrease economic growth due to the large amounts of dependents that pay little to no taxes. A solution to decreasing the dependency ratio within a country is to promote immigration for younger people. This will stimulate a higher economic growth because the working-age population will grow in number if more young adults migrate into their country.

The increase in the involvement of women in the work force has contributed to the working-age population which complements the dependency ratio for a country. Encouraging women to work will help decrease the dependency ratio. Because more women are getting higher education, it is less likely for them to have children, causing the fertility rates to decrease as well.

Using productivity weighted labor force dependency ratio (PWLFDR) suggests that even an aging or decreasing population can maintain a stable support for the dependent (primarily ageing) population by increasing its productivity. A consequence from PWLFDR assessments is the recommendation to invest in education and life-long learning, child health, and to support disabled workers.

== Demographic transition model ==
The age-dependency ratio can determine which stage in the Demographic Transition Model a certain country is in. The dependency ratio acts like a rollercoaster when going through the stages of the Demographic Transition Model. During stages 1 and 2, the dependency ratio is high due to significantly high crude birth rates putting pressure onto the smaller working-age population to take care of all of them. In stage 3, the dependency ratio starts to decrease because fertility and mortality rates start to decrease which shows that the proportion of adults to the young and elderly are much larger in this stage.

In stages 4 and 5, the dependency ratio starts to increase once again as the working-age population retires. Because fertility rates caused the younger population to decrease, once they grow up and start working, there will be more pressure for them to take care of the previous working-age population that just retired since there will be more young and elderly people than working-age adults during that time period. 

The population structure of a country is an important factor for determining the economic status of their country. Japan is a great example of an aging population. They have a 1:4 ratio of people 65 years and older. This causes trouble for them because there is not enough people in the working-age population to support all of the elders. Rwanda is another example of a population that struggles with a younger population (also known as the &quot;youth bulge&quot;). Both of these countries are struggling with high dependency ratios even though both countries are on opposite stages of the Demographic Transition Model.

==Criticism==
The dependency ratio has been criticized for ignoring that many older adults are employed, and many younger adults are not, and obscuring other trends such as improving health for older people that might make older people less economically dependent. For this reason, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has characterized the metric as ageist, and recommends avoiding its use. Alternative metrics, such as the economic dependency ratio (defined as the number of unemployed and retired people divided by the number of workers) do address this oversimplification, but ignore the effects of productivity and work hours.

<doc id="591936" wikidata="Q9030262" url="?curid=591936" title="Goliad massacre">
<text>The Goliad massacre was an event of the Texas Revolution that occurred on March 27, 1836, following the Battle of Refugio and the Battle of Coleto; 425–445 prisoners of war from the Texian Army of the Republic of Texas were executed by the Mexican Army in the town of Goliad, Texas. The men surrendered under the belief they would be set free within a few weeks; however, this was not to be. Despite appeals for clemency by General José de Urrea, the massacre was carried out by Lt. Colonel José Nicolás de la Portilla, under orders from General and President of Mexico Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. 

The entire Texian force was killed, except for 28 men who feigned death and escaped. Among these was Herman Ehrenberg, who later wrote an account of the massacre; William Lockhart Hunter survived despite being bayoneted and clubbed with a musket. Because of the intervention of Francita Alavez (known as the &quot;Angel of Goliad&quot;), 20 more men were spared to act as doctors, interpreters, or workers. Also spared were the 75 soldiers of the Miller and Nashville Battalion, who were given white arm bands. Among those killed were commanders Colonel James Fannin (of the Coleto battle) and Lieutenant Colonel William Ward (of the Refugio battle).

==Background==
After Santa Anna learned that a force of Texas rebels was heading toward Matamoros, he sent General Urrea to march north along the coast of Texas to stop them. Urrea arrived in Matamoros and worked to secure cooperation from the local inhabitants on January 31, 1836. Meanwhile, General Sam Houston had persuaded all but 70 to 100 men and their leaders, Frank W. Johnson and James Grant, to give up on the expedition and to defend locations in Texas, principally Goliad. On February 12, Fannin took most of the men to defend Presidio La Bahía at Goliad, which he renamed &quot;Fort Defiance&quot;.

On February 16, Urrea crossed the Rio Grande with 188 cavalry and 205 infantry. He recruited about 200 Tejano volunteers from the area, including some previously sympathetic to the Texians, to join him. At 3:00 a.m. on February 27, Urrea&#x27;s advance patrol surprised Johnson and about 45 men, initiating the Battle of San Patricio. Urrea&#x27;s force killed 16 men and took 24 prisoners. Johnson and four others escaped in the darkness and rejoined Fannin&#x27;s command at Goliad, where they said that all the prisoners had been executed. They had first given this account at a ranch where they had taken refuge after the escape. Urrea had sent 18 of the 24 prisoners to Matamoros, where they were sentenced to death, but later released. Johnson&#x27;s news persuaded Fannin to abandon any further attempt to send relief to the Alamo or to try to secure badly needed supplies waiting at Matagorda; he prepared the Presidio La Bahía at Goliad for defense against the advancing Mexican Army.

On March 2, at the Battle of Agua Dulce, Grant was killed, as were about 20 other men under his command.
On March 6, the Mexican force under Santa Anna stormed the Alamo and killed the garrison. On March 14, Colonel William Ward and 200 men, who had been sent to help Captain Amon B. King evacuate colonists at Refugio, were surrounded by Urrea&#x27;s force. Although Ward and his men fled that night during a blinding rainstorm, the Mexicans overtook part of Ward&#x27;s force, killing 18 and capturing 31. King and a group were executed on March 16 at Refugio. After capturing one of Fannin&#x27;s messengers, who was carrying dispatches that told of the commander&#x27;s plan to wait at Goliad and retreat after King and Ward returned, Urrea ordered the execution of 30 prisoners who he decided were mercenaries. He freed more than 20 others who he determined to be Mexicans or colonists, so he would not be hindered by taking prisoners along on his advance on Fannin&#x27;s force.

On March 19, Urrea had quickly advanced and surrounded 300 men of the Texian Army on the open prairie, near La Bahia (Goliad). The two-day Battle of Coleto ensued, with the Texians holding their own on the first day. The Mexicans received overwhelming reinforcements and heavy artillery. In this critical predicament, Fannin and the majority of the men voted to surrender the Texian forces on March 20. Led to believe that they would be paroled and released into the United States, they were returned to the fort at Goliad, now their prison. Albert Clinton Horton and his company had been acting as the advance and rear guards for Fannin&#x27;s company. Surprised by an overwhelming Mexican force, most were chased off and escaped, but 18 were captured and marched back to Goliad. The 75 soldiers of William Parsons Miller and the Nashville Battalion were captured on March 20 and marched to Goliad on March 23. On March 22, William Ward and the Georgia Battalion (80 men plus Ward) surrendered after escaping from the Battle of Refugio. About 26 men were retained at Victoria as laborers, but 55 of the prisoners were marched into Goliad on March 25.

==Massacre==
The Mexicans took the Texians back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance (Presidio La Bahia). The Texians thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. Urrea departed Goliad, leaving Colonel José Nicolás de la Portilla in command. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texians. Under a decree that Santa Anna had pushed for, and which was passed by the Mexican Congress on December 30, 1835, armed foreigners taken in combat were to be treated as pirates and executed. Urrea wrote in his diary that he &quot;...wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.&quot; Santa Anna responded to this entreaty by repeatedly ordering Urrea to comply with the law and execute the prisoners. He also had a similar order sent directly to the &quot;Officer Commanding the Post of Goliad&quot;. This order was received by Portilla on March 26, who decided it was his duty to comply, despite receiving a countermanding order from Urrea later that same day.

The next day, Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, Portilla had between 425 and 445 Texians marched from Fort Defiance in three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and the Victoria Road, between two rows of Mexican soldiers. The sick and injured stayed in the chapel. The ones marching out of the fort were told they were gathering wood and other supplies and they believed they would be freed soon. The Mexicans forced them to turn facing away from the soldiers, confused, the Texian rebels were shot point blank. Wounded survivors were clubbed and knifed to death. The sick and injured in the chapel were killed in their beds and shot against the chapel walls. Forty Texians were unable to walk. Thirty-nine were killed inside the fort under the direction of Captain Carolino Huerta of the Tres Villas battalion, with Colonel Garay saving one, Jack Shackelford. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair. He made three requests: that his personal possessions be sent to his family, to be shot in the heart and not the face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned his body along with those of the other Texians killed that day.

The entire Texian force was killed, except for 28 men who feigned death and escaped. Among these was Herman Ehrenberg, who later wrote an account of the massacre; William Lockhart Hunter, also of the New Orleans Greys, who survived despite being bayoneted and clubbed with a musket; and four members of Shackelford&#x27;s Red Rovers: Dillard Cooper, Zachariah S. Brooks, Wilson Simpson, and Isaac D. Hamilton, who escaped after days on the run. Because of the intervention of Francita Alavez (known as the &quot;Angel of Goliad&quot;), 20 more men, including Shackelford, were spared to act as doctors, interpreters, or workers. Also spared were the 75 soldiers of Miller and the Nashville Battalion. They were later marched to Matamoros. Spared men were given white arm bands and, while wearing them, could walk about freely. They were advised not to take off the arm band, since Mexican troops were hunting for those few who had escaped from Coleto, Victoria, and the massacre itself.

== Aftermath ==
The Goliad massacre contributed to the frenzy of the Runaway Scrape. After the executions, the Texians&#x27; bodies were piled and burned. Their charred remains were left in the open, unburied, and exposed to vultures and coyotes. Nearly one month later, word reached La Bahia (Goliad) that Santa Anna had been defeated and had surrendered while trying to flee at the Battle of San Jacinto. General Thomas J. Rusk found the remains of the massacre victims in June 1836 and gave orders for a formal military funeral. The remains were interred at a location southeast of the Presidio la Bahia. This has since been preserved and designated as the Fannin Memorial Monument. The location of the gravesite was forgotten until 1930, when human bone fragments were discovered by a group of Boy Scouts and their leader. The massacre is commemorated in Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, section 34. This is featured in his collected poems titled &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. In 1939, the Fannin Memorial Monument by Raoul Josset was erected at the gravesite. It features an art deco relief sculpture and the names of the men who were killed.370 known names of the dead

<text>Sir Thomas Richard Edmund Southwood (20 June 1931 – 26 October 2005) was a British biologist, professor of zoology and vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. A specialist on entomology, he developed the field of insect ecology and the development of study techniques. He wrote a landmark textbook on &quot;Ecological Methods&quot; that went into numerous editions. He also was well known for developing the field of entomology through mentorship of a circle of researchers at Silwood Park.

==Biography==
Southwood was born in Marlborough Cottage in Northfleet near Gravesend, where his father&#x27;s family dealt in farm and dairy products. In 1935 the family moved to Parrock Manor. His parents encouraged his interest in natural history. Richard became interested in natural history at an early age, and developed his skills on the family dairy farm in Kent; he had his first research article on sunbathing in birds in &quot;British Birds&quot; when he was fifteen and about insects published in the &quot;Entomologist&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; when he was a year older. His father had received some education at the Wye College. Other early influences included Tom Longstaff. He was educated at Bronte School, Gravesend Grammar School and Imperial College London BSc in biology, MSc botany, then worked for his PhD degree in zoology studies at Rothamsted Experimental Station. He returned to Imperial as a research assistant and lecturer, and in 1967 became head of the department of zoology and applied entomology, and director of Imperial College&#x27;s Field Station at Silwood Park. He later became dean of science and chair of the division of life sciences.

Southwood&#x27;s research at Imperial concentrated on insect communities and population dynamics. His 1966 book &quot;Ecological Methods&quot; described techniques available for the study of populations and ecosystems, including population estimates with different sampling techniques.

In 1979, he took up the Linacre Chair of Zoology in the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of Merton College. In 1989, he moved from being head of the department of zoology to take up the vice-chancellorship of the university, from which position he set up a working party that would recommend the reform of the university&#x27;s governance. Having stepped down from that position in 1993, he continued to research, teach and write, and in 2003 published &quot;The Story of Life&quot;, a book based on the first-year undergraduate lectures he gave at Oxford.

Southwood served as chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution from 1981 to 1985, having been first appointed to the commission in 1974. Under his chairmanship, the 1983 report &quot;Lead in the Environment&quot; aroused public concern about lead pollution. He was chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board from 1985 until 1994, and also chaired the Working Party on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) set up by the British Government in 1988. In 1993–1994 he was the first head of the department of environmental sciences and policy at the Central European University in Budapest.

Southwood was also a contributing member of the Oxford Round Table, an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of contemporary issues.

A portrait of Sir Richard Southwood hangs at Merton College, Oxford.

==Family==
Sir Richard Southwood married, in 1955, Alison Langley (&quot;née&quot; Harden) who he met at Rothamsted; Sir Richard and Lady Southwood had two sons and six grandchildren.

==Honours==
* Knight Bachelor, United Kingdom (1984)
* Grand Officer of the Order of Merit, Portugal (April 27, 1993)
*British Naturalists&#x27; Association Peter Scott Memorial Award.

<doc id="591963" wikidata="Q715133" url="?curid=591963" title="Taekkyon">
<text>Taekkyon (; ), also spelled Taekkyeon, Taekgyeon, or Taekyun, is a traditional Korean martial art.

It is characterized by fluid, dynamic foot movement called &quot;pumbalki&quot;, or &quot;stepping-on-triangles&quot;. Taekkyon includes hands and feet techniques to unbalance, trip, or throw the opponent. Taekkyon has many leg and whole-body techniques with fully integrated armwork. A taekkyon practitioner is called a &quot;taekkyon-kkun&quot;.

Since the twentieth century, taekkyon has come to be seen as a living link to Korea&#x27;s past. As such, it has provided historical references for modern Korean martial arts and is often considered as the oldest martial discipline of Korea. It was almost wiped out during the Japanese occupation, before being rediscovered after the Korean War. It influenced the name and conceptualization of taekwondo.

Taekkyon was the first martial art listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. It is also the 76th Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea.

== History ==

Historical records regarding taekkyon are scant and ambiguous. The term is described as a martial art, and probably is descended from earlier dynasties&#x27; Subak or as a folk game. The earliest written source of the term appears during the reign of King Jeongjo (1776–1800) of the Joseon dynasty, in the book &quot;Jaemulbo&quot; (also &quot;Manmulbo&quot;), which included an entry about a 2nd-century Book of Han reference of contests of unarmed combat. In this entry, author Lee Sung-Ji extended a 3rd-century annotation of this reference to say that such competitions are like the taekkyon of his time:

:&quot;Byeon: Byeon is hand to hand combat (Subak), competing in a martial game, (Lee Sung-Ji extension starts here) like today&#x27;s taekkyon.&quot;

The word taekkyon is written in Hangul, which denotes its connection with the common people while the rest is written in Hanja.

Song Deok-gi who was the main source of the taekkyon revival after the occupation, wrote in the preface of his book: &quot;It cannot be said for sure when and how taekkyon came into existence, but until the end of the Korean kingdom, certain people did taekkyon together.&quot;

Taekkyon was documented for the first time in the West as a living martial art by anthropologist Stewart Culin in his book &quot;Korean Games&quot;, written in 1895. In the 1921 book &quot;Haedong Jukji&quot; (&quot;East Sea Annals&quot;) by Choe Yeong-nyeon, taekkyon is called &quot;flying leg technique&quot;. Taekkyon was widely practiced during the Joseon period. Two versions existed at the time: one for combat application used by militaries, the other as a game, very popular among lower classes alongside ssireum (Korean wrestling). Both combat sports were often seen at festivals, attended by all social classes. For example, during the Dan-O-Festival, a tournament called &quot;Gyeoll-yeon-taekkyon&quot; was held. Players who beat five opponents consecutively could take a rest and re-enter the tournament again later.

Taekkyon&#x27;s popularity suffered as Neo-Confucianism became widespread among the elite and it underwent a long period of decline. At the dawn of the 20th century, it was only practiced around the capital city of Hanyang (Seoul), in the district of Jongro. The subsequent Japanese occupation prohibited gatherings of people and indigenous fighting techniques, which nearly made the art extinct.

After the Korean War there was only one surviving master: Song Deok-gi who was part of the last generation that received a traditional education under the tutelage of Master Im Ho. He had maintained his practice in secret throughout the Japanese occupation. The style he practiced was called (high-village) after his village of Sajik. Song was critical in the preservation of taekkyon due to his link to pre-war teachings. After a martial arts demonstration given for then-president Syngman Rhee&#x27;s birthday, he was revealed to the public on 26 March 1958 and became known as the &quot;Last Taekkyon Master of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;.

On June 1, 1983, owing to the efforts of Song&#x27;s pupil Shin Han-seung, taekkyon was classified as an Important Intangible Cultural Asset by the Korean government. It is one of two Korean martial arts classified as such. Song Deok-gi and Shin Han-seung were subsequently given living national treasure status by the South Korean government. Since then, taekkyon has enjoyed a renaissance with the establishment of university clubs, the opening of new schools, and active promotional efforts from the government and associations alike. The first contemporary taekkyon competition took place in Busan on June 30, 1985. Afterwards, other schools were established, dividing the taekkyon scene between the followers of Song&#x27;s teaching (current leaders of the Widae Taekkyon Preservation Association), and the followers of Shin, who are more focused on a sport approach and bringing the art to the global stage.

In November 2011, taekkyon was recognized by UNESCO and placed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List, honored as the first martial art on the list.

== Techniques ==
Taekkyon utilizes a wide variety of techniques including kicks, hands, knee, elbow strikes, pressure point attacks, throws, joint locks, headbutts and grapples. The whole body is used in each movement. Although taekkyon primarily utilizes kicking, punching, and arm strikes thrown from a mobile stance and does not provide a framework for groundfighting, it does incorporate a variety of different throws, takedowns, and grappling techniques to complement its striking focus. The main purpose of taekkyon is to catch the opponent off-guard by using the whole weight of the body and catching the opponent&#x27;s attack off-balance before returning it against him.

The basic &quot;pumbalki&quot; footwork is geometric and at the core of all advanced movement. The movements of taekkyon are fluid with the practitioners constantly moving. One of its most striking characteristics is the motion called &quot;ogumsil&quot; or &quot;neung-cheong&quot;: It is a constant bending and stretching of the knees, giving taekkyon a dance-like appearance. This motion is also used in the Korean mask dance Talchum which gives them a similar flow. The art is like a dance in which the fighter constantly changes stance from left to right by stepping forward and backwards with arms up and ready to guard, blending arm movements with leg. Taekkyon does not make use of abrupt knee motions. The principles and methods used to extend the kick put more emphasis on grace and alignment for whole-body strength, as with the arm motions.

There are evolving forms in taekkyon. One form can be performed many different ways with its variations over the basic ten-year training period. The curriculum is adjustable within the traditional system. Masters may create their own personalized approach for teaching the basic taekkyon system.

=== &quot;Pumbalki&quot; (footwork) ===
The most unique feature of taekkyon is its triangular footwork called &quot;pumbalki&quot; or &quot;pum balbki&quot; (품밟기) which looks like a dance. The meaning of pumbalkki is &quot;to step the &quot;pum&quot;&quot;. &quot;Pum&quot; is the hanja 品, which means &quot;goods&quot; or &quot;level&quot; but it is used for its shape rather than the meaning as pumbalki has a triangular form as well. Footwork is smooth and rhythmic and enables rapid shifting of the center of gravity. It has the effect of strengthening the waist and lower part of the body as well as harmonizing attack and defense.

The steps in pumbalki are roughly in the shape of an equilateral triangle (△). It is practiced in place, but in competition it involves continually advancing or retreating.

=== &quot;Hwalgaejit&quot; (deceptive arm movements) ===
&quot;Hwalgaejit&quot; looks like the movement of a bird&#x27;s wings. Coming from the root &quot;Hwalgae&quot;, meaning &quot;deceptive arm and leg movements resembling the movements of butterfly wings,&quot; the shoulders are expanded naturally and must flow harmoniously with the footwork. While improving the body&#x27;s reflexes, responsiveness and balance, it also helps distract the opponent&#x27;s attention before the counterattack. It is mainly used defensively to block or catch an opponent blow. &quot;Hwalgejit&quot; transfers power from the body to the arms in order to enhance power for quick action.

In a similar way, &quot;Hwaljegi&quot; refers to deceptive leg movements designed to deflect, jam, and break the opponent&#x27;s legs. Naturally, this depends on the application and not harming the opponent is preferable to harming them- but it remains in the repertoire.

=== &quot;Baljil&quot; (kicks) ===

Taekkyon has been so renowned for its kicking techniques that ancient chronicles referred to it with poetic names such as &quot;one-hundred godlike flying leg skills&quot; (&quot;baek gisintong bigaksul&quot;), &quot;leg art&quot; (&quot;gak sul&quot;), or &quot;flying leg skills&quot; (&quot;bi gak sul&quot;). Modern taekkyon schools teach a great variety of kicks, low, medium, and high, as well as jumps. Sweeps with straight forward low kicks using the ball of the foot and the heel and flowing crescent-like high kicks. There are many kicks that move the leg outward from the middle, which is called &quot;gyeot chigi&quot;, and inward from the outside using the side of the heels and the side of the feet. The art also uses tricks like inward trips, wall-jumping, fake-outs, tempo, and slide-stepping.

=== &quot;Sonjil&quot; (strikes) ===
Renowned for the variety of its kicks since the ancient ages, taekkyon uses a lot of strikes. They target all areas of the body and use every part of the arm: forearm, elbow, hand edge, back of the hand, fingertips. Techniques must be used in coordination with the pumbalki so that the springing power can be transferred to the upper limbs. The palm or fist are most often used to strike.

Though hand techniques had been used for self-defense until the Widae style, the three modern schools only teach it at an advanced level as part of &quot;yetbeop taekkyon&quot;.

=== &quot;Taejil&quot; (throws) ===
Taekkyon uses techniques for throwing the opponent either forward or backward. Once the opponent is unbalanced, the user can follow with either a throw or a trip. The important thing is to use the opponent&#x27;s own power to counterattack.

=== &quot;Ttanjuk&quot; (joint locks) ===
These techniques are for locking and twisting an opponent&#x27;s articulations. Counter an opponent&#x27;s attack by locking a joint and follow with a hand or leg attack.

== Competitive taekkyon ==

Taekkyon bouts have evolved into a modern sport and tournaments are held by the three modern schools across Korea and it is also an authorized discipline in Korea National Championships. When taekkyon is practiced in competition, it uses a limited subset of techniques, focusing on grappling and kicking only. Points are scored by throwing (or tripping) the opponent to the ground, pushing them out of the ring, or kicks to the head. There are no hand strikes or headbutts, and purposefully injuring your opponent is prohibited. The head kicks are often quite sharp, but usually not full force, and fighters may not attempt to wear the opponent down with body blows as in boxing or Muay Thai. Matches are sometimes decided by the best of three falls—the first fighter to score two points wins. However, different modern associations employ slightly different rules.

The first taekkyon competition was held by the Korea Taekkyon Federation at the Busan Gudeok Stadium on June 30, 1985. Song Deok-ki, who was 93 years old, demonstrated &quot;mack-boigi&quot;, and Shin Han-seung, who was 58 years old, demonstrated &quot;bonddae-boigi&quot;. In the subsequent competition, Shin was the referee and Song was the coach of the Seoul team. All three representatives of modern taekkyon, Lee Yong-bok, Jung Kyung-hwa and Do Ki-hyun, as well as Song and Shin, attended at this competition.

Since then the Korea Taekkyon Federation which stipulates the rules for taekkyon competitions has been promoted to a regular member of the Korean Sports &amp; Olympic Committee, which is the Olympic Committee of the Republic of Korea. In 2022 taekkyon was added as an event at the Korean National Sports Festival and to the Korea Sports for All Festival in 2023, which are Korea&#x27;s largest sports festivals. The Korea Taekkyon Federation also has the authority to hold the ‘Presidential National Taekkyon Competition’ and the ‘Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism National Taekkyon Competition’, which are the most authoritative competitions recognized by the Korean government. Only people who belong to the KTF can participate in these competitions.

== Organizations ==

=== Korea Taekkyon Federation ===

The Korea Taekkyon Federation (KTF), sometimes called &quot;Daehan Taekkyon&quot;, is based in Seoul Olympic Park and was established in 1991. It was led by Lee Yong-bok until 2015. Originally an 8th Dan in Taekwondo, he taught himself taekkyon with a brief stint studying under Song Deok-gi and Shin Han-seung. The KTF is a member of Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee (KSOC) since 2007, and it is the only taekkyon organization recognized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korean government. About 80% of taekkyon trainees in Korea belong to the KTF.

The KTF currently plays the role of national federation and international federation simultaneously. Therefore, the ‘World Martial Arts Masterships Taekkyon Competition’ is also organized by the KTF. The national Sports Instructor Courses, recognized by the Korean government, are also operated by the KTF.

This federation is the biggest and the most developed of all the taekkyon associations in Korea and abroad. With the support of the KSOC, the KTF has produced videos of taekkyon in four different languages. The videos contain taekkyon rules, referee rules, and standard training courses.

Taekkyon is the only sport that uses hanbok, traditional Korean clothes, as its uniform, and all participants, including athletes, referees, and coaches, wear hanbok. Through this, taekkyon also plays a role of exposing Korean traditional clothes to the public.

=== Widae Taekkyon Preservation Society ===
The Widae Taekkyeon Preservation Society, also called World Wide Taekkyon Organization (WWTO) or simply &quot;Widae Taekkyeon&quot; is based in Seoul and Los Angeles. Led by Lee Jun-seo and Ko Yong-woo, the two most senior students of Song Deok-gi. This association was established by Song Deok-gi and Lee Jun-seo in 1983 and does not teach the sport science innovations brought to the art in the mid-1980s.

=== Korea Traditional Taekgyeon Association ===
The Korea Traditional Taekgyeon Association (KTTA) is headquartered in Chungju, therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;Chungju Taekkyon&quot;. The KTTA is led by Jeong Kyung-hwa (1954-) who was given the title of &quot;living national treasure of the second generation&quot; by the Korean Government in 1995. He was the main pupil of Shin Han-seung. The KTTA was responsible for the recognition of taekkyon as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

=== Kyulyun Taekyyun Association ===
The Kyulyun Taekyyun Association (KTK), based in Seoul, was established in 2000. The KTK is led by Do Ki-hyun who mainly learned from Song Deok-gi after starting his training under Shin Han-Seung. The school is famous for organizing the Taekyun Battle, one of the most prestigious tournaments of Korea, every year since 2004.

==Historical records on taekkyon and street fighting==

Medieval records mention that several street fighting games and techniques existed in Korea at the time, up until the twentieth century. Due to the elite&#x27;s scorn and contempt for martial activities, taekkyon came to be perceived as a fighting method for thugs and sometimes confused with such disciplines: Sibak (시박), Pyeonssaum (편싸움), Nalparam (날파람), Nanjanbaksi (난잔박시), Taegyeok (태격). Some barehand techniques for street fighting are currently taught as part of the curriculum of the three modern schools as part of the &quot;Yetbeop Taekkyon&quot; or &quot;Old style Taekkyon&quot;.

== Taekkyon and taekwondo==
There is a common myth about taekkyon being depicted as a kicking game as well as an &quot;ancient version of taekwondo&quot; in the public eye. This is mainly due to the spread of taekwondo as the national martial sport of Korea after the Korean War. Since then, taekkyon has been known to the general public mainly through taekwondo&#x27;s association and rendition based on incomplete information via bits and pieces of records emphasizing its kicking techniques. Even though the taekwondo establishment claims an ancient lineage through taekkyon, and even partially modeled its name on it, the two disciplines don&#x27;t have much in common. In fact, taekkyon associations do not acknowledge having any relationship to taekwondo, and explicitly deny any link.

== Taekkyon in popular culture ==

<doc id="591969" wikidata="Q455715" url="?curid=591969" title="Rhythms of Resistance">
<text>Rhythms of Resistance, sometimes abbreviated to RoR, is a network of percussion bands that play at demonstrations and direct actions that fall within the broad definition of &#x27;anti-capitalist&#x27;. Since RoR London was formed in 2000, similar groups have arisen around the world.

The name &quot;Rhythms of Resistance&quot; refers to the origins of African music that were introduced with slaves, sailors and traders from East Africa to Latin America and specifically Brazil, and is specifically taken from the book title &quot;Rhythms of Resistance: African Musical Heritage in Brazil Cover&quot; by Peter Fryer.

While not all such bands use the Rhythms of Resistance name, they generally share the same principles:

Rhythms of Resistance is a transnational, anti-hierarchical, anti-capitalist, anti-sexist and anti-racist network of various groups that fight together for social and ecological justice worldwide. Percussion is used as a basis for actions to demonstrate in a peaceful and playful way. This achieves a similar effect to that of the &quot;Clown Army&quot; at demonstrations.

The RoR network consists of different bands that connect under the RoR umbrella and work and act decentralized. In addition, there is shared exchange, shared participation and collaboration at a collective level. This is facilitated by the identical use of tunes (melodies) and hand signals (signs), so that it is easy to play along in groups from other cities and different groups can play together spontaneously. In addition, the simple system of tunes, which can be internalized using mnemonics, enables a low-threshold introduction to drumming, even without any special prior musical knowledge.

The RoR bands are often referred to as the &quot;samba bands&quot;, because they use the same instruments. The self-designation ist &quot;acitivist percussion band&quot;. RoR has similarities to the Afro Bloc parading drum bands that emerged in the mid 1970s in Salvador da Bahia in Brazil. Bands such as Ilê Aiyê and Olodum formed as a political expression of black awareness, resisting economic exclusion. Coming out of some impoverished urban communities, Afro blocs became a mobilising focus on picket lines and marches.

Rhythms of Resistance formed as part of the UK Earth First action against the International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting in Prague in September 2000. A Pink and Silver carnival bloc, focused around a fifty-five piece band, detached itself from a march of 67,000 and outmaneuvered police resources defending the IMF annual summit. The protests also included a black bloc and a group from the Italian Ya Basta movement, and led to the shutting down of the summit.

Following this event, similar groups formed elsewhere making use of the same tactics. The RoR Amsterdam band formed in for the Rising Tide Actions against the Cop6 United Nations Climate Change Conference in November 2000 and joined together with ten drummers from Rhythms of Resistance to form a sixty-five piece band. Rhythms of Resistance groups can now be found across Europe, Middle East and in North America.

Instruments and clothing for performances are often made using the do-it-yourself principle.

<doc id="591972" wikidata="Q183080" url="?curid=591972" title="Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property">
<text>The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, signed in Paris, France, on 20 March 1883, is one of the first intellectual property treaties. It established a Union for the protection of industrial property. The convention is still in force as of 2024. The substantive provisions of the Convention fall into three main categories: national treatment, priority right and common rules.

== Contents ==

=== National treatment ===
According to Articles 2 and 3 of this treaty, juristic and natural persons who are either national of or domiciled in a state party to the Convention shall, as regards the protection of industrial property, enjoy in all the other countries of the Union, the advantages that their respective laws grant to nationals.

In other words, when an applicant files an application for a patent or a trademark in a foreign country member of the Union, the application receives the same treatment as if it came from a national of this foreign country. Furthermore, if the intellectual property right is granted (e.g. if the applicant becomes owners of a patent or of a registered trademark), the owner benefits from the same protections and the same legal remedy against any infringement as if the owner was a national owner of this right.

=== Priority right ===
The &quot;&quot;Convention priority right&quot;, also called &quot;Paris Convention priority right&quot; or &quot;Union priority right&quot;&quot;, was also established by Article 4 of the Paris Convention, and is generally regarded as one of the cornerstones of the Paris Convention. It provides that an applicant from one contracting State shall be able to use its first filing date (in one of the contracting States) as the effective filing date in another contracting State, provided that the applicant, or the applicant&#x27;s successor in title, files a subsequent application within 6 months (for industrial designs and trademarks) or 12 months (for patents and utility models) from the first filing.

===Temporary protection for goods shown at some international exhibitions===
Article 11(1) of the Paris Convention requires that the Countries of the Union &quot;grant temporary protection to patentable inventions, utility models, industrial designs, and trademarks, in respect of goods exhibited at official or officially recognized international exhibitions held in the territory of any of them&quot;.

If a patent or trademark registration is applied for during the temporary period of protection, the priority date of the application may be counted &quot;from the date of introduction of the goods into the exhibition&quot; rather than from the date of filing of the application, if the temporary protection referred to in Article 11(1) has been implemented in such a manner in national law. There are, however, other means for the Countries of the Union to implement in their national law the temporary protection provided for in Article 11 of the Paris Convention:

===Mutual independence of patents and trademarks in the different Countries of the Union===
According to Articles 4bis and 6 (for patents and trademarks respectively), for foreigners, the application for a patent or the registration of a trademark shall be determined by the member state in accordance with their national law and not by the decision of the country of origin or any other countries. Patent applications and trademark registrations are independent among contracting countries.

== History ==
After a diplomatic conference in Paris in 1880, the convention was signed on 20 March 1883 by 11 countries: Belgium, Brazil, France, Guatemala, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, El Salvador, Kingdom of Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. Guatemala, El Salvador and Serbia denounced and reapplied the convention via accession.

The Treaty was revised at Brussels, Belgium, on 14 December 1900, at Washington, United States, on 2 June 1911, at The Hague, Netherlands, on 6 November 1925, at London, on 2 June 1934, at Lisbon, Portugal, on 31 October 1958, and at Stockholm, Sweden, on 14 July 1967. It was amended on 28 September 1979.

== Contracting parties ==

As of 14 December 2024, the convention has 180 contracting member countries.

== Administration ==
The Paris Convention is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) based in Geneva, Switzerland.

<text>Michael Amott (born 28 July 1969) is a Swedish guitarist, founding member of the metal bands Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars and Carnage, as well as a former member of Carcass. He is the older brother of Christopher Amott. 

Amott was ranked No. 74 out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World.

== Biography ==
Amott was born in Halmstad, Sweden, to a British father and Swedish mother. Soon after his birth the family moved to England where Amott lived the first five years of his life, after which they moved back to Sweden.

Amott began playing guitar as a young teenager, learning to play by copying hardcore punk and heavy metal out of his record collection. Amott soon went to a new level with his playing and became influenced by players such as Tony Iommi, Frank Marino, Michael Schenker, Kerry King, Dave Mustaine, Ritchie Blackmore, Glenn Tipton, Adrian Smith, and Uli Jon Roth. He has stated in guitar magazines that he has a preference for pentatonics.
Amott co-formed the death metal band Carnage in 1988 with singer Johan Liiva, and released two widely traded cassette demos, gaining instant underground interest. Plagued by constant lineup changes, Carnage eventually recorded their only album &quot;Dark Recollections&quot; with Amott as the sole original member, but by the time the album came out on Necrosis records in 1990, the band was broken up.

Soon afterwards, Amott was recruited by Carcass in 1990, and released the seminal album &quot;Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious&quot; in 1991. The band would go on to release their highest selling album, &quot;Heartwork&quot; (Columbia/Sony), in 1993, helping to define what is now known as melodic death metal.

Amott left Carcass in 1993, and decided to form a classic rock influenced band, Spiritual Beggars. The band released their debut album &quot;Spiritual Beggars&quot; in 1994, which led to a European record deal with Music for Nations, who released &quot;Another Way to Shine&quot; in 1996.

Still heavily into extreme metal, Amott formed a new melodic death metal project in the same vein as Carcass, whose &quot;Heartwork&quot; album was now considered a death metal masterpiece. Amott contacted original Carnage vocalist Johan Liiva, as well as his younger brother Christopher Amott, who was attending music school at the time, and put together Arch Enemy. Featuring then session drummer Daniel Erlandsson, the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Black Earth&quot; was originally intended to be a one-off project, but the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;&quot;Bury Me An Angel&quot; received unexpected airplay on Japan&#x27;s MTV Rocks! program, and in 1997 Arch Enemy was signed by major Japanese label Toy&#x27;s Factory, and invited to tour Japan. Amott decided to put a full band together, recruiting drummer Peter Wildoer (Darkane), and bassist Martin Bengtsson.

After the Japanese tour, Amott returned to Spiritual Beggars and released &quot;Mantra III&quot; early in 1998, now featuring Per Wiberg on keyboards. In April the same year, Arch Enemy returned with &quot;Stigmata&quot;, their first album released outside Japan, now on Century Media records. The album would prove to be a critical success, and Arch Enemy toured for the better part of the year. Later the same year Amott also contributed guitars to the Candlemass album &quot;Dactylis Glomerata&quot;.

Arch Enemy returned in 1999 with &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Burning Japan Live 1999&quot; which would prove to be Johan Liiva&#x27;s last recording with the band. Amott went on to release &quot;Ad Astra&quot; with Spiritual Beggars in 2000, then returned to Arch Enemy, and recruited amateur German vocalist Angela Gossow to replace Liiva in 2000. Arch Enemy released &quot;Wages of Sin&quot; in 2001, and propelled by the new frontwoman, the band achieved new worldwide success. Arch Enemy toured worldwide in support of &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;, and Amott did not return to his Spiritual Beggars project until late 2002, releasing &quot;On Fire&quot;, again on Music for Nations.
In 2003, Arch Enemy released &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot;, again on Century Media, and for the first time, Arch Enemy received US MTV airplay with the video for &quot;We Will Rise&quot;&quot;. The band would reach new heights in popularity worldwide, and toured constantly until the release of 2005s &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot;. Amott returned once again to Spiritual Beggars in 2005, releasing the album &quot;Demons&quot;.

He has also performed guest guitar solos on the following recordings:
*The Haunted – &quot;One Kill Wonder&quot; (&quot;Bloodletting&quot;)
*Kreator – &quot;Enemy of God &quot;(&quot;Murder Fantasies&quot;)
*Destruction – &quot;Thrash Anthems II&quot; (&quot;The Ritual&quot;)

In 2006, Amott made his voice acting debut when he appeared on the Adult Swim show Metalocalypse. In the episode &quot;Snakes &#x27;n Barrels&quot;, he voiced scientist Dr. Amomolith Chesterfield and Snakes &#x27;n Barrels bassist Antonio Tony DiMarco Thunderbottom, who would end up getting his memory erased during the first song of their reunion show. Amott returned for more voice acting in the second season of Metalocalypse in the episode &quot;Snakes n&#x27; Barrels II&quot; (Part 1 and 2).

In 2007, Arch Enemy released &quot;Rise of the Tyrant&quot; on Century Media and embarked on a world tour dubbed &quot;World Tyranny&quot;.

In 2008, Amott joined the re-united Carcass and toured with them extensively in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, South Africa and Japan until the summer of 2010.

Today, Amott is busy touring the world with Arch Enemy on the band&#x27;s current &quot;Will to Power&quot; touring cycle. Amott has also sporadically returned to Spiritual Beggars for the &quot;Return To Zero&quot; (2010), &quot;Earth Blues&quot; (2013) and &quot;Sunrise to Sundown&quot; albums and tours.

== Personal life ==
Amott has been a vegetarian since the age of 14. He is a self-taught guitar player. He dated former band member Angela Gossow (at one point being engaged to marry her in 2003), but the two are no longer together after thirteen years and still remain friends.

== Guitar style ==

Amott&#x27;s lead playing takes most obviously after Michael Schenker, though he also acknowledges Uli Jon Roth, Frank Marino, Ritchie Blackmore and Tony Iommi as influences on his playing style. Amott&#x27;s playing makes heavy use of the wah pedal as a filter to shape his guitar&#x27;s tone. Some major influences in his music have been Tony Iommi, Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth and Dave Mustaine.

<doc id="591980" wikidata="Q1462095" url="?curid=591980" title="Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Organization">
<text>The Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization ( (SLK) communicatively, , and Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer juridically, ) is an independent auxiliary defence organization in Sweden. The organisation is part of the Swedish Total Defence (&quot;Totalförsvaret&quot;), the national defence strategy of Sweden.

The organisation was created in 1924 as a Swedish version of the Finnish equivalent organisation Lotta Svärd (created in 1918), which subsequently inspired other Scandinavian and the Baltic states to create their own organisations based on the same principles. These are collectively called &quot;Lotta movements&quot; as the majority of these organisations have adopted the name Lotta as the general designation for organisation members.

== Organisation ==

The organization currently consists of approximately 5,000 women of all ages throughout Sweden. Svenska Lottakåren&#x27;s purpose is to recruit and educate women for tasks in the Swedish total defence, and to conduct comprehensive defence training. Svenska Lottakåren works in both the Armed Forces and in Civilian Emergency Preparedness. The organization is politically neutral, and is one of the country&#x27;s largest female networks.

Members are called &quot;lotta&quot; (singular) or &quot;lottor&quot; (plural).

== History ==
=== Origin ===

Svenska Lottakåren was created in 1924 with the Finnish women&#x27;s auxiliary organization, Lotta Svärd (founded in 1920), as a direct role model. The name Lotta comes from a poem by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, about a fictional woman named Lotta Svärd, who took care of wounded soldiers during the Finnish War.

The organisation was founded by a Swedish woman named Tyra Wadner, whom also became the organization&#x27;s first chairperson, and was originally an auxiliary aid unit for the Swedish &quot;landstorm&quot; militia, then named &quot;Sveriges Landstormskvinnor&quot; (Sweden&#x27;s Landstorm Women).

The organisation&#x27;s original mission was non-militant and primarily aimed at collecting money for the &quot;landstorm&quot; militia. However, by the late 1930s it became apparent that the organisation was needed for militant missions during wartime, however not of combatant nature. In 1936 rules were laid down that regulated the organisation&#x27;s activities in peacetime and wartime.

In peacetime, the activities would be concentrated in four areas:
*Collection of funds for the &quot;landstorm&quot; militia
*Provide service at &quot;landstorm&quot; militia exercises
*Training of their own members
*Information work to &quot;raise the motherland and homeland patriotism feeling and strengthen the nation&#x27;s defence&quot;.

During the war, Svenska Lottakåren instead had to undertake various forms of assistance for defence in the homeland, especially during mobilization. Members were divided into army, navy and airfields.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, the organization received many new duties. Due to limited manpower it was decided to let organisation members perform service duties of non-combat nature in Sweden&#x27;s army, navy and air force branches. It was during this period that members of the organisation started being called lottor, as their original name &quot;Landstormskvinnor&quot; did not fit their new roles. This soon became official as the Swedish &quot;landstorm&quot; militia was scrapped and replaced with the Swedish home guard in 1942, turning the organisation independent. The new organisation name became &quot;Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer&quot; (&quot;The national federation of Sweden&#x27;s Lotta corps&quot;).

The war also rapidly increased the number of organisation members and by the end of the war the organization had more than 110,000 members, which meant that about five percent of Sweden&#x27;s women over 15 years were part of the organisation.

=== Postwar ===
Post World War II, SLK continued to perform many non-combatant roles tasks and roles in the Swedish Armed Forces-organization.

In 1989 the Swedish military started allowing women into all positions within the Swedish armed forces. This meant that the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization was no longer the only true option for women to get an active role in the defence of Sweden. An equivalent change in Denmark the same year had led to the dissolution of their &quot;Lotta movement&quot; &quot;Lottekorps&quot;. However in Sweden the organisation would remain as they still held important roles in the Swedish defence, as well as their cultural value.

In 2008 the organisation updated their graphical profile and changed their communicative name into &quot;Svenska Lottakåren&quot; (&quot;The Swedish Lotta Corps&quot;). The old name &quot;Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer&quot; was however kept as the official juridical name.

== Awards and decorations ==
Members and non-members of the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization which have benefited the organization can be awarded different awards and decorations, for example the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization Royal Medal of Merit in gold and silver (awarded since 1943) and the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization Medal of Merit in gold (awarded since 1967) and silver (awarded since 1944).

<text>Karadeniz Ereğli (or Ereğli) is a city in Zonguldak Province of Turkey on the Black Sea shore. It is the seat of Ereğli District. Its population is 122,282 (2022). The mayor of the city is Halil Posbıyık. Mehmet Yapıcı is the District Governor of Ereğli.

==History==

Karadeniz Ereğli was originally a Greek city in ancient times known as &quot;Heraclea Pontica&quot; after the Greek mythical hero Heracles. The Turkish name Karadeniz Ereğli or colloquially Karadeniz Ereğlisi means &#x27;Ereğli at the Black Sea&#x27;, which distinguishes it from other places called Ereğli such as Konya Ereğlisi and Marmara Ereğlisi.

It was founded as a Megarian colony, which soon subjugated the native Mariandynians and extended its power over a considerable territory. It was the birthplace of Heraclides Ponticus. According to Greek mythology, the cave guarded by the three-headed dog Cerberus is located near the town. For his final quest, Heracles is tasked with entering the cave and capturing Cerberus.

The prosperity of the city, rudely shaken by the Galatians and the Bithynians, was utterly destroyed in the Mithridatic Wars. Then, Heraclea Pontica was part of the (Eastern) Roman Empire for more than 1000 years.
The Turks ravaged the area after the Battle of Mantzikert in 1071. David Komnenos, brother of the ruler of Trebizond Alexios I of Trebizond, took Heraclea Pontica in 1205 and made it capital of his domain, called Paphlagonia; he lost it in 1214 to Theodore I Laskaris, who made it a major frontier bulwark. The Genoese had a colony there after 1261. When the Turks conquered Paphlagonia in 1360, the Genoese bought the city from the weakening Byzantine Empire. Heraclea developed as a trading centre of the Genoese, who settled there in large numbers. A ruined citadel on a height overlooking the town is a remnant of this period. The Italian name of the city was Pontarachia. The Genoese held the city until the Ottomans captured it after 1453.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Karadeniz Ereğli was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

==Facts==
Modern Ereğli is the home of Erdemir, an important steel plant of Turkey. It has a large natural harbour, located in the lee of Baba Burnu and therefore one of the few geographically attractive places for a harbour on the western Black Sea coast of Turkey. Ereğli is well developed due to the presence of the steel plant and fishing is a major commercial activity in the city. Because of its Black Sea beach, Ereğli is a popular tourist destination locally. The city does not have an airport (Erdemir has a small private field) or rail station, but can be reached by automobile or bus from Ankara, Istanbul and other places.

In addition to its fishing and steel, Ereğli is also well known for its delicious Ottoman strawberry.

The discoverer of the northern Turkish coalfields, Uzun Mehmet, lived in the &quot;Kestaneci Köyü&quot; (&quot;Chestnut-seller Village&quot;) section of Ereğli.

The International Love, Peace, Friendship, Culture and Art Festival is held every year in Karadeniz Ereğli.

==Sports==
Ereğli is an active spot in women&#x27;s football. Karadeniz Ereğli Belediyespor is currently competing in National Women&#x27;s Football League. Furthermore, Karadeniz Ereğli Spor won Girls&#x27; U-15 Turkey Championship in 2011. Also, local men&#x27;s football clubs of Ereğli compete in amateur leagues.

In 2000s, Erdemirspor had several successful professional sport teams. Men&#x27;s volleyball team won three Turkish Men&#x27;s Volleyball League championship titles (2001-02, 2003-04, and 2004-05), but was withdrawn from the league in 2007. Men&#x27;s basketball team competed in Men&#x27;s Basketball Super League for 7 seasons (2004-06, 2008-13), until Erdemir disestablished the team in 2013. It also won two championship titles in the lower basketball league. Besides, women&#x27;s basketball team competed in the Woman&#x27;s Basketball League in 2000s.

Chess is also a popular sport in Ereğli. There are two chess clubs in the city, and Ereğli hosts around 10 local chess tournaments each year.

<text>Cassandra Latham-Jones is a British witch. She lives and works in the small community of St Buryan, Cornwall.

She is notable as being the first person in the UK to have registered her occupation as &quot;village witch&quot; with the Inland Revenue in the year 1996. Her services were especially required by hospital patients. Within one year she was having so many requests for her services that she became a self-employed witch and was no longer financially supported by the government.

She was previously a committee member of the Pagan Federation as vice president overseeing campaigning.

In the late 1980s Latham was a student at the experimental Dartington College of Arts, where she completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theatre. Before enrolling in this program she had served as a nurse, caring for the builder of the Minack Theatre, Rowena Cade in the last years of her life. 
Cassandra&#x27;s business partner Laetitia utilises Aromatherapy, Reflexology, Indian Head Massage and Reiki. She also has a certificate as a sexual abuse and Crisis and Trauma counsellor specialising in assisting former members of religious cults.

<text>Ereğli Demir ve Çelik Fabrikaları T.A.Ş. is a Turkish steel producer. The name is a contraction of the Turkish language &quot;Ereğli Demir ve Çelik Fabrikaları&quot;, which means &quot;Ereğli Iron and Steel Factories&quot;. Erdemir occupies the 43rd place among the largest steel companies in the world and is also involved in coal in Turkey.

==History==
Erdemir, which began production in 1965, has a production capacity of 8.5 million tons/year of crude steel (2020 value). It is the largest iron and steel company in Turkey and was the only flat steel producer till January 2009. It produces plates, hot and cold-rolled sheet and tinplate.

Its main plant is located on an area of approximately at Karadeniz Eregli, Zonguldak on the shore of the Black Sea. Erdemir operates a large seaport, the Port of Erdemir, to import and export materials.

Erdemir has Port of Erdemir also acquired the steel plant at İskenderun, Hatay Province in southern Turkey.

Turkish Armed Forces Pension Fund (OYAK) acquired a 49.29% stake in Erdemir on 4 October 2005 for $2.77 billion in a televised auction, in which it outbid several major steel companies. The fund acquired 46.12% from the Turkish Privatization Administration (OIB) and it was also obliged to purchase an additional 3.17% stake from a Turkish bank.

See history of Erdemir Group since 1954.

== Pollution ==
Erdemir burns coal in Turkey. As an integrated steelworks, emissions are higher than steel produced at electric arc furnaces. Climate Trace estimates the plant emitted almost 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, more greenhouse gas than any other steelmaker in the country except İsdemir. However the company says they are moving towards net zero emissions.

== List of 50 Projects ==
The Turkish chamber of Civil engineers lists Erdemir as one of the fifty civil engineering feats in Turkey, a list of remarkable engineering projects realized after the declaration of the Turkish republic.

<text>Bolu Province () is a province in north-western Turkey, between the capital, Ankara, and the largest city in the country, Istanbul. Its area is 8,313 km,2, and its population is 320,824 (2022). The capital city of the province is Bolu.

==Geography==
The province is drained by the Bolu River (&quot;Boli Su&quot;) and the Koca River.

The forests, lakes, and mountains are home to wildlife, including three deer species. Parts of the province are vulnerable to earthquakes.

== Protected areas ==
The province has the Yedigöller National Park.

There is also another area consisting of a lake and its surroundings that is under protection by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as a &#x27;nature park&#x27; that is called Gölcük. There is a structure on the shore of the lake named the State Guesthouse of the Ministry of Forestry. Near the nature park is an artificial lake; the lake is to the south of the city of Bolu.

==History==
It is not known when Bolu was first established. Some archaeological findings that date back about 100,000 years suggest the region was inhabited then.

The area now in Bolu Province was in eastern Bithynia and southwestern Paphlagonia. The town of Bithynium, from which the area takes its name, is the modern Bolu. The area was called Bithynia during the Hellenistic period. The Romans named it Claudiopolis, and it was called Bolu by the Turks. By approximately 375 BCE, Bithynia had gained its independence from Persia under Artaxerxes II, and King Bas subsequently defeated Alexander&#x27;s attempt to take it. The Bithynian region, with parts of Paphlagonia remained its own kingdom until 88 BCE, when it briefly came under Mithridates VI and the Kingdom of Pontus. With Roman&#x27;s help, the last Bithynian king, Nicomedes IV, regained his throne, but on his death bequeathed the kingdom to Rome. This led to the Third Mithridatic War and the fall of Pontus, after which the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as a single province, merging Paphlagonia with Bithynia. Under the falling Byzantine Empire, the Bolu area was divided from western Bithynia at the Sakarya River, with western Bithynia keeping the name. The Sakarya River remains the southern and western boundary of the province.

The Byzantine Empire briefly lost the Bolu area to the Seljuk Turks after the 1071 Battle of Manzikert but recovered it under Alexios I Komnenos. After the end of the Komnenos dynasty, the Turks gradually reclaimed the Bolu area back. In approximately 1240, the Seljuk Turks took the eastern part of the Bolu area (i.e., the Paphlagonian part) from the Byzantine Empire and incorporated it into the Sultanate of Rum. Due to their assistance in taking it and Sinop, the Chobanids were given that territory and adjacent areas to the north and east to govern. That eastern area fell to the Isfendiyarids in 1292 and was controlled by them until 1461, after which it was incorporated into the rest of the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed II.

By 1265, the western part of the Bolu area was again acquired by the Seljuk Turks, but it fell to Orhan and the Ottoman Empire in the early to mid-1300s. The two areas were reunited in 1461, under Mehmed II. In the 1864 Ottoman Empire administrative reorganization, Bolu was made into an independent sanjak, although it was geographically part of the Kastamonu Vilayet.

==Administrative divisions==
Bolu province is divided into nine districts, four sub-districts, thirteen municipalities, and 491 villages.

<text>A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the algorithms should be used and includes details about data structures and representations, at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program.

Cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application-level data transport. A cryptographic protocol usually incorporates at least some of these aspects:

* Key agreement or establishment
* Entity authentication
* Symmetric encryption and message authentication  material construction
* Secured application-level data transport
* Non-repudiation methods
* Secret sharing methods
* Secure multi-party computation

For example, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that is used to secure web (HTTPS) connections. It has an entity authentication mechanism, based on the X.509 system; a key setup phase, where a symmetric encryption key is formed by employing public-key cryptography; and an application-level data transport function. These three aspects have important interconnections. Standard TLS does not have non-repudiation support.

There are other types of cryptographic protocols as well, and even the term itself has various readings; Cryptographic &quot;application&quot; protocols often use one or more underlying key agreement methods, which are also sometimes themselves referred to as &quot;cryptographic protocols&quot;. For instance, TLS employs what is known as the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, which although it is only a part of TLS &quot;per se&quot;, Diffie–Hellman may be seen as a complete cryptographic protocol in itself for other applications.

== Advanced cryptographic protocols ==
A wide variety of cryptographic protocols go beyond the traditional goals of data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to also secure a variety of other desired characteristics of computer-mediated collaboration. Blind signatures can be used for digital cash and digital credentials to prove that a person holds an attribute or right without revealing that person&#x27;s identity or the identities of parties that person transacted with. Secure digital timestamping can be used to prove that data (even if confidential) existed at a certain time. Secure multiparty computation can be used to compute answers (such as determining the highest bid in an auction) based on confidential data (such as private bids), so that when the protocol is complete the participants know only their own input and the answer. End-to-end auditable voting systems provide sets of desirable privacy and auditability properties for conducting e-voting. Undeniable signatures include interactive protocols that allow the signer to prove a forgery and limit who can verify the signature. Deniable encryption augments standard encryption by making it impossible for an attacker to mathematically prove the existence of a plain text message. Digital mixes create hard-to-trace communications.

== Formal verification ==
Cryptographic protocols can sometimes be verified formally on an abstract level. When it is done, there is a necessity to formalize the environment in which the protocol operates in order to identify threats. This is frequently done through the Dolev-Yao model.

Logics, concepts and calculi used for formal reasoning of security protocols:

* Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic (BAN logic)
* Dolev–Yao model
* π-calculus
* Protocol composition logic (PCL)
* Strand space

Research projects and tools used for formal verification of security protocols:

* Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) and follow-up project AVANTSSAR.
** Constraint Logic-based Attack Searcher (CL-AtSe)
** Open-Source Fixed-Point Model-Checker (OFMC)
** SAT-based Model-Checker (SATMC)
* Casper
* CryptoVerif
* Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA)
* Knowledge In Security protocolS (KISS)
* Maude-NRL Protocol Analyzer (Maude-NPA)
* ProVerif
* Scyther
* Tamarin Prover

=== Notion of abstract protocol ===

To formally verify a protocol it is often abstracted and modelled using Alice &amp; Bob notation. A simple example is the following:
:formula_1

This states that Alice formula_2 intends a message for Bob formula_3 consisting of a message formula_4 encrypted under shared key formula_5.

* Internet Key Exchange
* IPsec
* Kerberos
* Off-the-Record Messaging
* Point to Point Protocol
* Secure Shell (SSH)
* Signal Protocol
* Transport Layer Security
* ZRTP

<text>Bartın Province () is a small province in northern Turkey on the Black Sea, surrounding the city of Bartın. Its area is 2,330 km2, and its population is 203,351 (2022). It lies to the east of Zonguldak Province.

The town of Bartın contains a number of very old wooden houses in a style no longer existent in other places.

Bartın province includes the ancient port town of Amasra (Amastris). This town stands on two small fortified islands and contains many interesting old buildings and restaurants.

== Projects ==
They have built a tri-highway system that stretches from Bartın Center to Zonguldak to Amasra, replacing the old windy roads that went up and down the mountain sides. There is a new tunnel that cuts travel times in half. They also have paid for and have gotten funding to upkeep their UNESCO Heritage site in Amasra, namely the castles for better preservation. 

They are also in the mix of helping the second biggest port in Turkey for construction. This port is in Filyos, right on the edge of the Bartın border. 

== Food ==
The main seafood found in Bartın is the &quot;Mezgit.&quot; It is a relatively small fish that is eaten with a side of Amasra Salad. 

They also provide sea side restaurants near Amasra that feature an assortment of seafood dishes. 

== Sports ==
Bartın has a third tier side in the TFF 2nd League called, Bartınspor. 

==Districts==

Bartın Province subdivides into four districts (capital district in bold):
* Amasra
* Bartın
* Kurucaşile
* Ulus
