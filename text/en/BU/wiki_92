<text>Ingjald illråde or Ingjaldr hinn illráði (&quot;Ingold Illruler&quot; or &quot;Illready&quot;) was a semi-legendary Swedish king of the House of Ynglings, son and successor of King Anund, and the father and predecessor of King Olof Trätälja. As with many of the 5th-7th century Yngling Kings of Sweden, his historicity is contested. 

Ingjald is mentioned in medieval historiographical sources including the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot;, &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, &quot;Upplendinga Konungum&quot;, &quot;Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot; and &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;. The setting of &quot;Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot; is roughly the 7th century. Johannes Magnus in his 16th-century list of kings places Ingjald (&quot;Ingevallus, Ingellus&quot;) in AD 883. 

== &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; ==
Snorri Sturluson gave an extensive account on the life of Ingjald in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; which is part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

=== Youth ===
The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; relates that the viceroy of Fjärdhundraland was named Ingvar and he had two sons, Alf and Agnar, who were of the same age as Ingjald. Svipdag the Blind was the viceroy of Tiundaland, the province of Uppsala where the Tings and the Yule (Midwinter) sacrifices were held (see the Temple at Uppsala).

One midwinter, when Ingjald and Alf were six years old, many people had assembled at Uppsala for the sacrifices. Alf and Ingjald played, but Ingjald found that he was the weaker boy and became so angry that he almost started to cry (which was strange because people named Ingjald were known to be stronger than average). His foster-brother Gautvid led him to his foster-father Svipdag the Blind and told Svipdag about Ingjald&#x27;s lack of manliness and strength. Svipdag said that it was a shame and the next day he gave Ingjald a roasted wolf&#x27;s heart to eat. From that day, Ingjald became a very ferocious person and had a bad disposition and breath.

Anund arranged a marriage for his son Ingjald with Gauthild, the daughter of the Geatish king Algaut, who was the son of Gautrek the Mild and the grandson of Gaut. Gautrek consented as he believed that Ingjald had inherited his father&#x27;s disposition. Gauthild&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Närke.

=== The deceit ===
Snorri Sturluson relates that when his father Anund had died, Ingjald became the king of Sweden. The kings at Uppsala were the foremost among the kings of the various provinces since Odin ruled the country, and they were the supreme chiefs of the other kingdoms since the death of Agne and Sweden was divided between Erik and Alrik. The descendants of these two kings had spread, cleared land and settled new territories, until there were several petty kings.

In honour of his own ascendance to the throne, Ingjald invited the kings, the jarls and other important men to a grand feast in a newly built hall, just as large and sumptuous as the one in Uppsala. It was called the hall of the seven kings and had seven high seats. Algaut the Geatish king of West Götaland, King Ingvar of Fjädrundaland with his two sons Agnar and Alf, King Sporsnjall of Nerike and King Sigvat of Attundaland came, but not King Granmar of Södermanland. The kings filled all seven seats but one. All the prominent people of Sweden had seats, except for Ingjald&#x27;s own court whom he had sent to his old hall in Uppsala.

According to the custom of the time, for those who inherited kings and jarls, Ingjald rested at the footstool until the Bragebeaker was brought in. Then he was supposed to stand up, take the beaker and make solemn vows, after which he would ascend his father&#x27;s high seat. However, when the beaker was brought in, he took a bull&#x27;s horn and made the solemn vow that he would enlarge his own kingdom by half towards all the four-quarters, towards which he pointed his horn, or die.

When all the prominent guests were drunk, he ordered Svipdag&#x27;s sons, Gautvid and Hylvid, to arm themselves and their men and to leave the building. Outside, they set fire to the building which burnt down and those who tried to escape were killed.

Thus Ingjald made himself the sole ruler of the domains of the murdered kings.

=== Wars ===
Granmar won allies in his son-in-law the sea-king Hjörvard of the Ylfings and his father-in-law Högne the Geatish king of East Götaland. They successfully withstood Ingjald&#x27;s invasion where Ingjald realised that the men from the provinces he had conquered were not loyal to him. After a long standstill there was peace for &quot;as long as the three kings lived&quot;. However, one night Ingjald and his men surrounded a farm where Granmar and Hjörvard were at a feast and burnt the house down. He later disposed of five more kings, and he thus earned the name &quot;Illråde&quot; (ill-ruler) as he fulfilled his promise.

Snorri Sturluson tells that it was a common saying that Ingjald killed twelve kings by deceiving them that he only wished for peace, and that he thus earned his cognomen &quot;Illråde&quot; (&quot;ill-ruler&quot; or &quot;ill-adviser&quot;).

=== Downfall ===

Ingjald had two children, a son Olof Trätälja and a daughter Åsa. His daughter had inherited her father&#x27;s psychopathic disposition. She married King Guðröðr of Skåne. Before she murdered her husband she managed to make him kill his own brother Halfdan the Valiant, the father of the great Ivar Vidfamne.

In order to avenge his father, Ivar Vidfamne gathered a vast host and departed for Sweden, where he found Ingjald at Ræning. When Ingjald and his daughter realized that it was futile to resist, they set the hall on fire and succumbed in the flames.

== &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; ==
The citation from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; does not appear to describe Ingjald as an evil king. It calls his life a brave life &quot;frœknu fjörvi&quot;:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation (continuing after Anund):
== Archaeological Evidence ==
Rällinge is hill fort in Raä Helgarö 32:1, Helgarö parish, Södermanland that has small ramparts near Lake Mälaren that is thought to be a misinterpretation or incorrect spelling for the hill fort Ræning of the sagas. According to Nordic legends, Ræning was the place where Ingjald and his daughter Åsa had both met their ends at the hands of the semi-legendary Ivar Vidfamne. Throughout the last century thermoluminescence dating has found evidence of a burning that happened at the Rällinge hill fort from the supposed time of Ingjald&#x27;s demise (600-650 A.D.). Moreover, the dating of the fort burning and heating does not contradict assumptions about where and when Ingjald was burned to death.

<text>No. 11 or XI Squadron (sometimes featuring an &#x27;F&#x27; to represent its historic fighter role (No. 11(F) or XI(F) Squadron)), is &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest, dedicated fighter unit&quot; and continues the traditions established by the similarly numbered Royal Flying Corps squadron, established in 1915. After a history of equipment with numerous different aircraft types, the squadron most recently operated the Tornado F3 until 2005 when it was disbanded. It was reactivated in 2006 to operate the Typhoon F2, receiving its first aircraft (serial number ZJ931) on 9 October 2006.

==History==

===World War I===
No. 11 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Netheravon in Wiltshire on 14 February 1915 for &quot;fighting duties&quot;, receiving two seat pusher Vickers Gunbus fighters in June, and deploying to France on 25 July 1915. It was the first squadron solely equipped with fighters to deploy with the RFC, or with any flying service.

The squadron&#x27;s Gunbusses were soon pressed into service, with Captain Lionel Rees claiming the squadron&#x27;s first air-to-air victory on 28 July, forcing down a German observation aircraft. Second Lieutenant G. S. M. Insall was awarded a Victoria Cross for an action on 7 November 1915 in which he forced down and destroyed a German Aviatik observation aircraft. The Gunbus was already obsolete however, and was initially supplemented by a mixture of Bristol Scouts and Nieuport 16s until replaced by the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b of similar layout, but slightly higher performance, in June 1916. These in turn were replaced by Bristol Fighters in August 1917, these being used both for offensive patrols over German-held territory and for ground attack for the remainder of the war. The Squadron was disbanded at the end of 1919.

No. 11 Squadron numbered 19 flying aces in its ranks during the war. Among them were Victoria Cross winner Lionel Rees, as well as Andrew Edward McKeever, John Stanley Chick, Eugene Coler, Albert Ball VC, Frederick Libby, Ronald Maudit, John Quested, Herbert Sellars, Donald Beard, Stephen Price and Hugh Hay Thomas Frederick Stephenson.

The twin Eagles on the Squadron&#x27;s crest, awarded in May 1937, represent the two-seated fighters operated in the First World War.

===Between the Wars===
The Squadron reformed at RAF Andover in January 1923 as a day bomber squadron equipped with Airco DH.9As, soon moving to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk. In April 1924, these were replaced by the Fairey Fawn despite the fact that they offered little improvement in performance over the DH.9A, moving with them to RAF Netheravon in May that year. The unpopular Fawns were replaced by Hawker Horsleys in November 1926, in use until December 1928, when the squadron handed the Horsleys to 100 Squadron and was posted to Risalpur in India (now in Pakistan), flying Westland Wapitis in Army co-operation and carrying out punitive air raids against rebelling tribal forces. It replaced its Wapitis with Hawker Harts in February 1932, operations continuing as before. On 31 May 1935, an earthquake devastated the city of Quetta and the surrounding area. No. 11 Squadron, along with other RAF squadrons in the region, were used to aid the relief effort following the disaster. The squadron received Blenheim I monoplane bombers in July 1939, moving to Singapore the next month, just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

===World War II===

In April 1940 the squadron moved to India, and was briefly based at Karachi before it was ordered to transfer to Aden due to the increasing likelihood of war with Italy. The first of the squadron&#x27;s Blenheims reached Aden on 19 June 1940, nine days after Italy declared war on Britain, and flew its first combat mission of the war on 19 June. The squadron was heavily engaged in the early months of the Eastern Africa campaign, attacking Italian targets in Italian East Africa. In December 1940, the squadron was ordered to move to Egypt to support the upcoming British offensive in the Western Desert, Operation Compass, with the squadron being based at Helwan, near Cairo, with a forward detachment at Fuka to support the offensive.

In January 1941 the squadron was ordered to reinforce the Royal Air Force squadrons in Greece, fighting in the Greek Campaign against the Italians, partly re-equipping with newer Blenheim IVs from 39 Squadron before leaving for Greece, arriving at Larissa on 28 January. On the night of 28 February/1 March 1941, Larissa was hit by a powerful earthquake, badly damaging both the airfield and the town. Personnel of the Larissa-based squadrons spent the rest of the night rescuing people trapped in collapsed buildings. In March, 11 Squadron joined the newly-established &#x27;E&#x27; (Eastern) Wing for operations over Thessaliniki. On 6 April 1941, Germany launched an invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. 11 Squadron&#x27;s Blenheims were employed on attacks on columns of German troops in Yugoslavia, but by 16 April, the squadron was ordered to withdraw from Almyros to Acharnes to avoid the German advance. The few surviving aircraft and crews were evacuated to Crete and then to Egypt. and from there on to Aqir, Palestine where the squadron rebuilt its strength, becoming operational again on 28 May 1941. 

After reforming, the squadron served in the Syrian Campaign against the Vichy French, attacking airfields by day and night. On 22 June 1941, the squadron&#x27;s aircraft bombed and damaged the . In August that year the squadron moved to Habbaniya in Iraq, and on 26 August, took part in the Anglo-Soviet operation to secure the Persian oilfields for the Allies, although it only dropped leaflets. After returning to Egypt the squadron took part in Operation Crusader.

Redeployed to Colombo, Ceylon in early 1942, the squadron was involved in attacks on Japanese shipping. During 1943, the Squadron re-equipped with Hurricanes and moved to Burma in the ground attack role, supporting the Fourteenth Army.

By January 1943, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel, or Australians serving in the RAF, made up almost 90% of the aircrews in the squadron (even though it was not officially an RAAF &quot;Article XV squadron&quot;). At the time, the Australian personnel included the commanding officer, Wing Commander Harley Stumm.

11 Squadron was one of the few RAF squadrons to fight against Italian, German, Vichy French and Japanese forces.

===Since 1945===

The Squadron formed part of the occupation forces in Japan from August 1945 to February 1948, when it disbanded. Reforming in Germany during October 1949, they flew Mosquitos, Vampires and Venoms. The Squadron again disbanded in 1957, but reformed in January 1959 with Meteor night fighters. Javelins replaced the Meteors one year later and the Squadron was based at RAF Geilenkirchen, in West Germany, equipped with this type until another disbandment in 1966.

Reforming in early 1967, No. 11 Squadron spent the next 21 years flying Lightnings, until May 1988. By that time it was one of the last two squadrons equipped with this aircraft and was based at RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire.

From August 1988 the squadron operated the twin seat Panavia Tornado F3 from RAF Leeming. In February 2003 it was announced that some of No. 11 Squadron&#x27;s Tornado F3s had been modified to carry the ALARM missile (and unofficially designated as Tornado EF3s) to widen their capabilities to include suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD). Following the publication of the Future Capabilities study on 21 July 2004, XI(F) squadron disbanded in October 2005.

The RAF announced that 11 Squadron would be the second front line squadron to re-equip with the Typhoon but would now be based at RAF Coningsby. The Squadron stood up at Coningsby on 29 March 2007, dropping the (F) designation in recognition of its new tasking as the Royal Air Force&#x27;s lead Typhoon multi-role squadron. In March 2011, 11 Squadron (assisted by some 29(R) Squadron personnel and additional aircraft supplied by 29(R) and 3(F) Squadrons) deployed to Gioia Del Colle, Bari, Italy, to help police the no-fly zone imposed by Resolution 1973 over Libya as part of Operation Ellamy.

In 2013 the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean again, this time RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, as part of 121 EAW providing air defence of Cyprus under the auspices of Operation Luminous.

XI(F) Squadron resumed the use of its &#x27;(F)&#x27; Fighter status during its centenary year, with celebrations taking place on 7 and 8 May 2015 in the form of a formal dinner with the Squadron Association, and a parade complete with flypast.

During February 2018, the squadron participated in &quot;Exercise Red Flag 18-1&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest and most complex air combat exercise run by the US Air Force. For the duration of the exercise the squadron&#x27;s Typhoons operated from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

During November 2023, the squadron participated in Exercise Ferocious Falcon V, a Qatari led exercise.

<text>John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin (6 February 1893 – 24 January 1957) was a British army officer, Conservative Party politician and minister in Winston Churchill&#x27;s war government.

==Background==
Llewellin was the son of William Llewellin, of Upton House, Dorset, and Frances Mary, daughter of L. D. Wigan. He was educated at Eton.

==Military career==
Llewellin was commissioned into the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1914 and reached the rank of major during the First World War, winning the Military Cross in 1917. He remained in the Territorial Army after the war and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel commanding the Dorset Heavy Brigade in 1932.

He was promoted colonel in 1936 and retired in 1938. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1926, promoted to a Commander (CBE) in 1939, and then was made a Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in 1953.

==Political career==
Llewellin was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge in Middlesex in 1929. He held a number of ministerial posts in the Coalition government, eventually serving as President of the Board of Trade for two weeks in 1942. He subsequently became Minister of Aircraft Production until replaced by Sir Stafford Cripps in November 1942. Later, Llewellin served on the Combined Policy Committee set up by the British and United States governments under the Quebec Agreement of 1943 to oversee the construction of the atomic bomb.

In December 1943, Llewellin&#x27;s seat on the committee was assumed by Sir Ronald Campbell and Llewellin became Minister of Food, the position he held until the Churchill government fell to the Labour Party of Clement Attlee in July 1945. Llewellin lost his seat in the election and was raised to the peerage as Baron Llewellin, of Upton in the County of Dorset. After the war he served as Governor General of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland between 1953 and his death in January 1957.

==Personal life==
Lord Lewellin died in January 1957, aged 63. The barony became extinct with his death.

<text>The 3rd Belorussian Front () was a Front of the Red Army during the Second World War.

The 3rd Belorussian Front was created on 24 April 1944 from forces previously assigned to the Western Front. Over 381 days in combat, the 3rd Belorussian Front suffered 166,838 killed, 9,292 missing, and 667,297 wounded, sick, and frostbitten personnel while advancing from the region some 50 kilometers southeast of Vitebsk in Russia to Königsberg in East Prussia.

Operations the 3rd Belorussian Front took part in include the Belorussian Offensive Operation, the Baltic Offensive Operation, and the East Prussian Offensive Operation. Although costly, the advance of the 3rd Belorussian Front was in great part victorious, with one of the few defeats occurring during the Gumbinnen Operation in October 1944.

3rd Belorussian Front was formally disbanded on 15 August 1945.

== Commanders ==
* Colonel General Ivan Chernyakhovsky [promoted to full General on 26 June 1944] (April 1944 – February 1945)
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky (February–April 1945)
* General Hovhannes Bagramyan (April–August 1945)

<text>The supraoptic nucleus (SON) is a nucleus of magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus of the mammalian brain. The nucleus is situated at the base of the brain, adjacent to the optic chiasm. In humans, the SON contains about 3,000 neurons.

==Function==
The cell bodies produce the peptide hormone vasopressin, which is also known as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), and the peptide hormone oxytocin. Both of these peptides are released from the posterior pituitary. ADH travels via the bloodstream to its target cells in the papillary ducts in the kidneys, enhancing water reabsorption. Oxytocin travels via the bloodstream to act at the mammary glands and the uterus.

In the cell bodies, the hormones are packaged in large, membrane-bound vesicles that are transported down the axons to the nerve endings. The secretory granules are also stored in packets along the axon called Herring bodies.

Similar magnocellular neurons are also found in the paraventricular nucleus.

===Signaling===
Each neuron in the nucleus has one long axon that projects to the posterior pituitary gland, where it gives rise to about 10,000 neurosecretory nerve terminals. The magnocellular neurons are electrically excitable: In response to afferent stimuli from other neurons, they generate action potentials, which propagate down the axons. When an action potential invades a neurosecretory terminal, the terminal is depolarised, and calcium enters the terminal through voltage-gated channels. The calcium entry triggers the secretion of some of the vesicles by a process known as exocytosis. The vesicle contents are released into the extracellular space, from where they diffuse into the bloodstream.

===Regulation of supraoptic neurons===
Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is released in response to solute concentration in the blood, decreased blood volume, or blood pressure.

Some other inputs come from the brainstem, including from some of the noradrenergic neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract and the ventrolateral medulla. However, many of the direct inputs to the supraoptic nucleus come from neurons just outside the nucleus (the &quot;perinuclear zone&quot;).

Of the afferent inputs to the supraoptic nucleus, most contain either the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA or the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, but these transmitters often co-exist with various peptides. Other afferent neurotransmitters include noradrenaline (from the brainstem), dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.

===The supraoptic nucleus as a &quot;model system&quot;===
The supraoptic nucleus is an important &quot;model system&quot; in neuroscience. There are many reasons for this: Some technical advantages of working on the supraoptic nucleus are that the cell bodies are relatively large, the cells make exceptionally large amounts of their secretory products, and the nucleus is relatively homogeneous and easy to separate from other brain regions. The gene expression and electrical activity of supraoptic neurons has been studied extensively, in many physiological and experimental conditions. 

====Morphological plasticity in the supraoptic nucleus====
Anatomical studies using electron microscopy have shown that the morphology of the supraoptic nucleus is remarkably adaptable.

For example, during lactation there are large changes in the size and shape of the oxytocin neurons, in the numbers and types of synapses that these neurons receive, and in the structural relationships between neurons and glial cells in the nucleus. These changes arise during parturition, and are thought to be important adaptations that prepare the oxytocin neurons for a sustained high demand for oxytocin. Oxytocin is essential for milk let-down in response to suckling.

These studies showed that the brain is much more &quot;plastic&quot; in its anatomy than previously recognized, and led to great interest in the interactions between glial cells and neurons in general.

===Stimulus-secretion coupling===
In response to, for instance, a rise in the plasma sodium concentration, vasopressin neurons also discharge action potentials in bursts, but these bursts are much longer and are less intense than the bursts displayed by oxytocin neurons, and the bursts in vasopressin cells are not synchronised.

It seemed strange that the vasopressin cells should fire in bursts. As the activity of the vasopressin cells is not synchronised, the overall level of vasopressin secretion into the blood is continuous, not pulsatile. Richard Dyball and his co-workers speculated that this pattern of activity, called &quot;phasic firing&quot;, might be particularly effective for causing vasopressin secretion. They showed this to be the case by studying vasopressin secretion from the isolated posterior pituitary gland in vitro. They found that vasopressin secretion could be evoked by electrical stimulus pulses applied to the gland, and that much more hormone was released by a phasic pattern of stimulation than by a continuous pattern of stimulation.

These experiments led to interest in &quot;stimulus-secretion coupling&quot; - the relationship between electrical activity and secretion. Supraoptic neurons are unusual because of the large amounts of peptide that they secrete, and because they secrete the peptides into the blood. However, many neurons in the brain, and especially in the hypothalamus, synthesize peptides. It is now thought that bursts of electrical activity might be generally important for releasing large amounts of peptide from peptide-secreting neurons.

===Dendritic secretion===
Supraoptic neurons have typically 1-3 large dendrites, most of which projecting ventrally to form a mat of process at the base of the nucleus, called the &quot;ventral glial lamina&quot;. The dendrites receive most of the synaptic terminals from afferent neurons that regulate the supraoptic neurons, but neuronal dendrites are often actively involved in information processing, rather than being simply passive receivers of information. The dendrites of supraoptic neurons contain large numbers of neurosecretory vesicles that contain oxytocin and vasopressin, and they can be released from the dendrites by exocytosis. The oxytocin and vasopressin that is released at the posterior pituitary gland enters the blood, and cannot re-enter the brain because the blood–brain barrier does not allow oxytocin and vasopressin through, but the oxytocin and vasopressin that is released from dendrites acts within the brain. Oxytocin neurons themselves express oxytocin receptors, and vasopressin neurons express vasopressin receptors, so dendritically-released peptides &quot;autoregulate&quot; the supraoptic neurons. Francoise Moos and Phillipe Richard first showed that the autoregulatory action of oxytocin is important for the milk-ejection reflex.

These peptides have relatively long half-lives in the brain (about 20 minutes in the CSF), and they are released in large amounts in the supraoptic nucleus, and so they are available to diffuse through the extracellular spaces of the brain to act at distant targets. Oxytocin and vasopressin receptors are present in many other brain regions, including the amygdala, brainstem, and septum, as well as most nuclei in the hypothalamus.

Because so much vasopressin and oxytocin are released at this site, studies of the supraoptic nucleus have made an important contribution to understanding how release from dendrites is regulated, and in understanding its physiological significance. Studies have demonstrated that secretin helps to facilitate dendritic oxytocin release in the SON, and that secretin administration into the SON enhances social recognition in rodents. This enhanced social capability appears to be working through secretin&#x27;s effects on oxytocin neurons in the SON, as blocking oxytocin receptors in this region blocks social recognition.

===Co-existing peptides===
Vasopressin neurons and oxytocin neurons make many other neuroactive substances in addition to vasopressin and oxytocin, though most are present only in small quantities. However, some of these other substances are known to be important. Dynorphin produced by vasopressin neurons is involved in regulating the phasic discharge patterning of vasopressin neurons, and nitric oxide produced by both neuronal types is a negative-feedback regulator of cell activity. Oxytocin neurons also make dynorphin; in these neurons, dynorphin acts at the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary as a negative feedback inhibitor of oxytocin secretion. Oxytocin neurons also make large amounts of cholecystokinin as well as the cocaine and amphetamine regulatory transcript (CART).

<text>Wondelgem () is a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent located in the province of East Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1977. In 1885, 1900 and 1920, parts of the original municipality were already annexed to Ghent. On 1 January 1977, the municipality of Wondelgem was merged into Ghent.

== History ==
In the 9th century the Carolingian emperors named Lander Van Camp and Robbe Van Camp owned a large estate in Wondelgem. Ghent has a total population of about 230,000, of which about 17,601, people live in Wondelgem.

<doc id="608078" wikidata="Q844860" url="?curid=608078" title="Green imperial pigeon">
<text>The green imperial pigeon (Ducula aenea) is a large forest pigeon. The large range extends from Nepal, southern India and Sri Lanka eastwards to southern China, Indonesia and the Philippines.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the green imperial pigeon in his six volume &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. He used the French name &quot;Le pigeon ramier des Moluques&quot; and the Latin &quot;Palumbus moluccensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the green imperial pigeon which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Columba aenea&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. Brisson believed his specimen had come from the Maluku Islands but the species does not occur there and in 1918 the type locality was designated as the island of Flores in Indonesia. The specific name &quot;aenea&quot; is from the Latin &quot;aeneus&quot; meaning &quot;of a bronze colour&quot; or &quot;coppery&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Ducula&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836.

Eleven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. a. sylvatica&quot; (Tickell, 1833) – Indian green imperial pigeon – north India and Nepal to south China to Thailand, and Indochina
* &quot;D. a. pusilla&quot; (Blyth, 1849) – south India, Sri Lanka
* &quot;D. a. andamanica&quot; Abdulali, 1964 – Andaman Islands
* &quot;D. a. consobrina&quot; (Salvadori, 1887) – islands of West Sumatra except Enggano Island
* &quot;D. a. polia&quot; (Oberholser, 1917) – Sunda green imperial pigeon – Malay Peninsula to Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands
* &quot;D. a. palawanensis&quot; (Blasius, W, 1888) Banggi Island (north Borneo) to Palawan and nearby islands (southwest Philippines)
* &quot;D. a. fugaensis&quot; (Hachisuka, 1930) – north Philippines (Calayan, Camiguin and Fuga Island)
* &quot;D. a. nuchalis&quot; (Cabanis, 1882) – Maroon-naped imperial pigeon – north Luzon (north Philippines)
* &quot;D. a. aenea&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Nominate subspecies – Philippines (other than northern Luzon and Palawan)
* &quot;D. a. intermedia&quot; (Meyer, AB &amp; Wiglesworth, 1894) – Talaud imperial pigeon – Talaud Islands and Sangihe Islands
* &quot;D. a. paulina&quot; (Bonaparte, 1854) – Chestnut-naped imperial pigeon – Sulawesi, Togian, Banggai and Sula Islands

The subspecies &quot;D. a. oenothorax&quot; is sometimes treated as a distinct species, the Enggano imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula oenothorax&quot;). The Nicobar imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula nicobarica&quot;) was formerly treated as conspecific.

==Description==
The green imperial pigeon is a large, plump pigeon, in length. Its back, wings and tail are metallic green. The head and underparts are white, apart from maroon undertail coverts. Sexes are similar. The bird&#x27;s call is deep and resonant, and is often the first indication of the presence of this treetop species.

==Distribution and habitat==

This is a forest species which is a widespread resident breeding bird in tropical southern Asia from Nepal and India east to Indonesia. It has several subspecies, including the distinctive Celebes form, chestnut-naped imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula aenea paulina&quot;).

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is an arboreal dove, feeding on plant material in the tree canopy. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It builds a stick nest in a tree and lays a single white egg. The birds are not very gregarious, but will form small flocks.

Founded in 1962, the club played in the Northern Irish Football League from 1990 until its closure in 2005. They won the North West Senior Cup on six occasions and competed in the UEFA Intertoto Cup twice, in 1998 and 2003. Omagh Town was dissolved on 7 June 2005, owing to financial problems.

==History==
Omagh Town Football and Athletic Club was formed in August 1962 by Aines McGeehan, who wanted to start a team for young players from the Derry Road area of the town of Omagh. The team was called Omagh Celtic Football Club and started off with maroon shirts with blue shorts. The team (both Catholic and Protestant) played at Quarry Field Mullaghmena in Omagh.

In 1969, the club changed its name to Omagh Town Football and Athletic Club and also changed their accommodation to the Military Holm for three years, moving to The Showgrounds afterwards. Following 1974 the kit also changed again, this time to white shirts and black shorts. This combination would change several more time before the club finally settled on a combination of red, black, and white.

In 1990, Omagh Town moved to St Julian&#x27;s Road, a site that was previously a council dump. Omagh leased the land and developed a football stadium. The stadium had a natural grass pitch, with a capacity of 5000 with 30 VIP places, 250 covered seats, 3220 covered standing places and 1500 uncovered standing places.

Supporters of Omagh Town called the club &quot;The Town&quot;. The club also supported darts, women&#x27;s football and poolmembers. In total the club had about 470 members, of which 180 were youth members. Support for the club derived mainly from the towns of Omagh, Castlederg, Dromore and Ballygawley. Omagh Town&#x27;s main rivalry was with north-west derby rivals Coleraine as well as with Glentoran.

The club were elected to senior football (the Irish League) for the first time in the 1990–91 season, and would remain in the top flight for the next five years. In 1994–95, a change in makeup of the league, dropping the number of teams in the top flight to 8, caused Omagh to be relegated after finishing 9th. The results and points accumulated over two seasons were taken into account. Roy McCreadie&#x27;s departure had caused problems, Paul Kee was left in charge. McCreadie returned and Town were promoted again, coming in as runners-up to Ballymena in the first division.

After losing in the 1997–98 Irish cup semi-final with one of the best squads assembled, money worries forced the departure of the bulk of that side. Indeed, the addition of a couple of key players could have seen Omagh challenge for the following seasons premiership. Instead, a weakened squad struggled and were relegated at the end of the 1998–99 season. However, a tremendous 1999–2000 campaign in the first division saw Omagh under Roy McCreadie promoted as champions, Eamon Kavanagh collecting the cup at St Julian&#x27;s Road despite a loss to Limavady. Omagh would remain in the Premier Division for the next two years finishing 9th and 10th, respectively. Roy McCreadie&#x27;s departure left a void Town could not fill. Frankie Wilson and Eamon Kavanagh were caretaker managers for a time but rather than give them the job, Former Derry City star Johnny Speak took over. He failed to settle in the role and although guiding Town to another Irish cup semi-final (another loss) he was replaced by Paul Kee and John Cunningham.

Since the 2000–01 season Omagh Town had been in the Premier Division, but continued to suffer from a lack of support and poor attendances. Behind the scenes there had been numerous talks of takeovers and rescue plans for several years, none really materialised to any degree. In 2004, links with the local soccer school were formalised and several key members of that group and members of the business and political sectors got involved. The influx of interest had little effect though and after relegation at the end of the 2004–05 season the future looked bleak.

On 7 June 2005, the club announced, hastily it may be argued, that it had folded after failing to overcome financial problems. Omagh was already struggling financially before the team was relegated from the Irish Premier League in April. The club said the drop from the top flight and the recent closure of its social club were the two major factors behind the decision to fold.

In 2024, Loughgall footballer Caolan McAleer announced plans to relaunch the club, initially competing in underage football structures in the area, with ambitions of taking the club back to its former glory.

<text>Ivar Vidfamne (or &quot;Ívarr inn víðfaðmi&quot;; English exonym &quot;Ivar Widefathom&quot;; Danish &quot;Ivar Vidfadme&quot; – in Norwegian and Danish the form &quot;Ivar Vidfavne&quot; is sometimes used as an alternative form) was a semi-legendary king of Denmark, who originated in Scania (present day Sweden). He apparently died 700 CE, in Karelia, at a place called &quot;Karjálabotnar&quot; (Finnish &quot;Karjalanpohja&quot;), which may have been the modern (; ; ), in Lakhdenpokhsky District () of Russia.

12th and 13th century sources like &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, attributed to Ivar Vidfamne kingship of a wider empire that included parts of Norway, Saxony and England. However, no such figure is mentioned in medieval Saxon or English sources regarding the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries, if not the major Saxon warlord, enemy of the soon to become French emperor of the Romans Charlemagne, King Widukind.

== Ivar in the sagas ==
The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and &quot;Sögubrot&quot; make clear that his homeland was Scania. The sagas say that the Danish lands were divided into two kingdoms at the time, namely Scania and Zealand. Scania was ruled by a set of brothers, Guðröðr and Halfdan the Valiant, sons of a Gothic princess called Hervor (or Hild). Hervor&#x27;s husband was Harald the Old, son of Valdar, son of Roar (Hroðgar) of the house of Skjöldung (Scylding). While Guðröðr married Åsa, daughter of the Swedish king Ingjald Illruler, Halfdan&#x27;s queen was Moald Digra, an aunt of the Anglo-Saxon aristocrat Kinrik (Cynric). According to &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; and &quot;Njáls saga&quot; he had a son Ivar, and the same paternity is stated in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.

However, Queen Åsa was not content with the state of things, and therefore incited Guðröðr to kill his brother. Later, she murdered her own husband. The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; implies that Ivar had to flee Scania after the murder of his father. After the demise of Guðröðr, he however returned home, while Åsa had to flee to her father in Sweden. Ivar hastily gathered an army and approached Sweden to exact revenge on the murderous queen. King Ingjald was at a feast in Raening with his daughter when he heard that Ivar&#x27;s army was in the neighbourhood. Ingjald and Åsa then committed suicide by burning themselves and their drunk retainers in the feast hall. The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and &quot;Af Upplendinga konungum&quot; tell that Ivar conquered Svearike after Ingjald&#x27;s suicide, and later returned to take Denmark. Apart from the Danish lands, he conquered &quot;a great deal of Saxland, all the East Country (Austrríki), and a fifth part of England&quot;.
 
In that way Ivar conquered much of Scandinavia and parts of north Germany and England (sometimes specified as Northumbria), earning the cognomen Vidfamne (Wide-fathoming). Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated Värmland under its king Olof Trätälja. According to &quot;Hversu&quot;, &quot;Njal&#x27;s saga&quot;, the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot; and &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, Ivar had a daughter named Auðr the Deep-Minded. &quot;Sögubrot&quot; depicts Ivar in the first place as king of Sweden. It relates that he gave Auðr in marriage to king Hrœrekr Ringslinger of Zealand, in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Hrœrek&#x27;s brother Helgi the Sharp. Hrœrekr and Auðr had the son Harald Wartooth. Through cunning intrigues, Ivar made Hrœrekr kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Hrœrekr. However, Auðr arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Auðr went to Garðaríki with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king Ráðbarðr, with Harald&#x27;s consent but not Ivar&#x27;s. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand.

When Ivar learnt that Auðr had married without his permission, he marshaled a great leidang from Denmark and Sweden and led the fleet to Gardariki to attack Ráðbarðr. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Raðbarð&#x27;s kingdom, Karelia (&quot;Karjálabotnar&quot;), he had a strange dream and asked his foster father Hord to interpret it. A discussion ensued that ended in Hord likening the megalomaniac Ivar to the Midgard Serpent. The furious Ivar threw himself overboard in order to get at Hord, who was standing at the shore, and was never seen again. Hord also disappeared in the waves, and it is implied that he was no else than Odin in disguise. After Ivar&#x27;s demise the chiefs of his fleet convened and agreed that they had no feud with Ráðbarðr, and sailed back to their own lands. Harald Wartooth then returned to Zealand and Scania to assume power over the Danish lands. He subsequently conquered back the territories held by his illustrious grandfather.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; does not mention any daughter named Auðr. Instead it mentions an Alfhild in the same genealogical position. Ivar gave her to Valdar whom Ivar made subking of Denmark, and she gave birth to Harald Wartooth and Randver, father of Sigurd Ring. In the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot;, dated to the 12th century, Ivar, Auðr, Hrœrekr and Harald appear. Raðbarðr also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them. Strangely, the comprehensive Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus does not mention Ivar Vidfamne, and rather makes Harald Wartooth the son of a Halfdan, himself the son of a Scanian chief called Borkar.

==Interpretations==
The archaeologist Birger Nerman (1925) argued for the historicity of Ivar and a comprehensive but loosely structured Baltic realm in the late 7th century. This idea has not been pursued by later archaeologists and historians who regard his historical existence as uncertain. The story of Guðröðr being murdered by his queen Åsa seems to replicate another story in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, about the Vestfold king Gudrød the Hunter who met a similar fate at the hands of his queen Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder.

According to some sagas, Ivar Vidfamne was the great-great-great-grandfather of the historical 9th century Viking leader Ivar the Boneless. Reflecting on this purported lineage, historian Kirsten Møller has hypothesised that Ivar Vidfamne may have been a completely fictitious figure, created around the time of Ivar the Boneless. That is, the dissemination of a figure such as Ivar Vidfamne, ruling over a vast empire more than a century earlier, would serve to justify the dynastic and territorial ambitions of Ivar the Boneless and his family.

<doc id="608094" wikidata="Q444192" url="?curid=608094" title="Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus">
<text>The paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN, PVA, or PVH) is a nucleus in the hypothalamus, that lies next to the third ventricle. Many of its neurons project to the posterior pituitary where they secrete oxytocin, and a smaller amount of vasopressin. Other secretions are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). CRH and TRH are secreted into the hypophyseal portal system, and target different neurons in the anterior pituitary. Dysfunctions of the PVN can cause hypersomnia in mice. In humans, the dysfunction of the PVN and the other nuclei around it can lead to drowsiness for up to 20 hours per day. The PVN is thought to mediate many diverse functions through different hormones, including osmoregulation, appetite, wakefulness, and the response of the body to stress.

==Location==
The paraventricular nucleus lies adjacent to the third ventricle. It lies within the periventricular zone and is not to be confused with the periventricular nucleus, which occupies a more medial position, beneath the third ventricle. The PVN is highly vascularised and is protected by the blood–brain barrier, although its neuroendocrine cells extend to sites (in the median eminence and in the posterior pituitary) beyond the blood–brain barrier. PVN is accounting for only about 1% of the brain volume.In the rat, the PVN consists of approximately 100,000 neurons located in a volume of about 0.5 cubic millimetre.

==Neurons==
The PVN contains magnocellular neurosecretory cells whose axons extend into the posterior pituitary, parvocellular neurosecretory cells that project to the median eminence, ultimately signalling to the anterior pituitary, and several populations of other cells that project to many different brain regions including parvocellular preautonomic cells that project to the brainstem and spinal cord.

===Magnocellular neurosecretory neurons===
The magnocellular cells in the PVN elaborate and secrete two peptide hormones: oxytocin and vasopressin.

These hormones are packaged into large vesicles, which are then transported down the unmyelinated axons of the cells and released from neurosecretory nerve terminals residing in the posterior pituitary gland.

Similar magnocellular neurons are found in the supraoptic nucleus which also secrete vasopressin and a smaller amount of oxytocin.

===Parvocellular neurosecretory neurons===

The axons of the parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN project to the median eminence, a neurohemal organ at the base of the brain, where their neurosecretory nerve terminals release their hormones at the primary capillary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system. The median eminence contains fiber terminals from many hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons, secreting different neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, including vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), dopamine (DA) and somatostatin (growth hormone release inhibiting hormone, GIH) into blood vessels in the hypophyseal portal system. The blood vessels carry the peptides to the anterior pituitary gland, where they regulate the secretion of hormones into the systemic circulation. The parvocellular neurosecretory cells include those that make:
* Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which regulates ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland
* Vasopressin, which also regulates ACTH secretion (vasopressin and CRH act synergistically to stimulate ACTH secretion)
* Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which regulates TSH and prolactin secretion

===Centrally-projecting neurons===
As well as neuroendocrine neurons, the PVN contains interneurons and populations of neurons that project centrally (i.e., to other brain regions). The centrally-projecting neurons include
* Parvocellular oxytocin cells, which project mainly to the brainstem and spinal cord. These neurons are thought to have a role in gastric reflexes and penile erection,
* Parvocellular vasopressin cells, which project to many points in the hypothalamus and limbic system, as well as to the brainstem and spinal cord (these are involved in blood pressure and temperature regulation), and brown fat thermogenesis.
* Parvocellular CRH neurons, which are thought to be involved in stress-related behaviors.

==Afferent inputs==

The PVN receives afferent inputs from many brain regions and different parts of the body, by hormonal control.

Among these, inputs from neurons in structures adjacent to the anterior wall of the third ventricle (the &quot;AV3V region&quot;) carry information about the electrolyte composition of the blood, and about circulating concentrations of such hormones as angiotensin and relaxin, to regulate the magnocellular neurons.

Inputs from the brainstem (the nucleus of the solitary tract) and the ventrolateral medulla carry information from the heart and stomach. Inputs from the hippocampus to the CRH neurones are important regulators of stress responses.

Inputs from neuropeptide Y-containing neurons in the arcuate nucleus coordinate metabolic regulation (via TRH secretion) with regulation of energy intake. Specifically, the projections from the arcuate nucleus seem to exert their effect on appetite via MC4R-expressing oxytocinergic cells of the PVN.

Inputs from suprachiasmatic nucleus about levels of lighting (circadian rhythms).

Inputs from glucose sensors within the brain stimulate release of vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone from parvocellular neurosecretory cells.

<doc id="608100" wikidata="Q2906212" url="?curid=608100" title="Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom">
<text>Laws prohibiting blasphemy and blasphemous libel in the United Kingdom date back to the medieval times as common law and in some special cases as enacted legislation. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were formally abolished in England and Wales in 2008 and Scotland in 2024. Equivalent laws remain in Northern Ireland.

==England and Wales==
The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. See also Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006.

===Ecclesiastical offences===

The offence of blasphemy was originally part of canon law. In 1378, at the command of Pope Gregory XI, persecution of John Wycliffe and the Lollards was undertaken. However, the only punishment available to the bishops at the time was excommunication. The clergy, dissatisfied with this, forged an act of Parliament, without the assent of the Lords or Commons, enabling the arrest and imprisonment of heretics. In the following year an attempt was made by Parliament to repeal the act, which prompted a series of prosecutions, and the repeal failed. Not satisfied with their new powers, further powers were sought and granted under King Henry IV in 1400. These new powers allowed the bishops to arrest and imprison all preachers of heresy, all schoolmasters infected with heresy, and all owners and writers of heretical books. On refusal to abjure (solemnly renounce) or relapse after abjuration, the heretic could be handed over to civil officers, to be taken to a high place before the people and there be burnt, so that their punishment might strike fear in the hearts and minds of others. In April, 1399, William Sawyer was convicted of heresy and put to penance by his bishop. He was again arrested on 12 February 1400, as a relapsed heretic and was convicted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Sawyer was burnt on 2 March, eight days before the power to inflict such punishment was granted. There is a long list of those burnt, or hanged and burnt, between 1414 and 1506. In the 17th century, blasphemy was declared a common law offence by the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, punishable by the common law courts.

In 1656, the Quaker James Naylor was sentenced by the Second Protectorate Parliament to flogging, to be pilloried, branded on the forehead and the piercing of his tongue by a red-hot poker, and thereafter kept in prison on hard labour indefinitely. In sentencing Naylor, the judge, Lord Commissioner Whitelock, makes the distinction between heresy and blasphemy.

===Common law offences===
From the 16th century to the mid-19th century, blasphemy against Christianity was held as an offence against common law. When formulating his new Church of England&#x27;s doctrines in the 1530s, Henry VIII made it an offence to say or print any opinion that contradicted the Six Articles (1539). Blasphemy was also used as a legal instrument to persecute atheists, Unitarians, and others. Ever since 1838, blasphemy was considered to be only a crime against beliefs of the Church of England.

All blasphemies against God, including denying his being or providence, all contumelious reproaches of Jesus Christ, all profane scoffing at the Holy Scriptures, and exposing any part thereof to contempt or ridicule, were punishable by the temporal courts with death, imprisonment, corporal punishment and fine. In 1656, two weavers, William Bond and Thomas Hibbord were indicted in Wiltshire for atheistic statements. In May of the same year, Alexander Agnew, known as &quot;Jock of Broad Scotland&quot;, was convicted and hanged for blasphemy in Dumfries.

&quot;Taylor&#x27;s Case&quot; in 1676 was the first reported case of the common law offence of blasphemy. It is unclear whether or not there were any unreported earlier cases. Lord Sumner said &quot;Taylor&#x27;s case is the foundation stone of this part of the law&quot;.

The report by Ventris contains the following passage:

In &quot;Rex v Woolston&quot;, &quot;the Court declared they would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christianity in general was not an offence punishable in the Temporal Courts at common law: it having been settled so to be in &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Case&quot; in 1 Vent. 293. 3 Keb 607, 621 and in the case of &quot;The King v Hall&quot;, ante, 416. They desired it might be taken notice of, that they laid their stress upon the word general, and did not intend to include disputes between learned men on particular controverted points.&quot;

In 1841, Edward Moxon was found guilty of the publication of a blasphemous libel (Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mab&quot;), the prosecution having been instituted by Henry Hetherington, who had previously been condemned to four months imprisonment for a similar offence, and wished to test the law under which he was punished. In the case of &quot;Cowan v Milbourn&quot; (1867) the defendant had broken his contract to let a lecture-room to the plaintiff, on discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that the character of Christ is defective, and his teaching misleading, and that the Bible is no more inspired than any other book, and the Court of Exchequer Chamber held that the publication of such doctrine was blasphemy, and the contract therefore illegal. On that occasion, the court reaffirmed the dictum of Lord Chief Justice Hale, that Christianity is part of the laws of England.

The commissioners on criminal law (sixth report) remarked that although the law forbade all denial of the being and providence of God or the Christian religion, it is only when irreligion assumes the form of an insult to God and man that the interference of the criminal law took place.

The dictum &quot;if the decencies of controversy are observed, even the fundamentals of religion may be attacked without the writer being guilty of blasphemy&quot; was followed in &quot;R v Boulter&quot; (1908) 72 JP 188.

In the case of &quot;Bowman v Secular Society&quot; [1917] AC 406, Lord Sumner, echoing Hale&#x27;s remarks in &quot;Taylor&quot;, summarized the position using the Latin phrase, &quot;deorum injuriae diis curae&quot;, &quot;offences to the gods are dealt with by the gods&quot;: blasphemy is an offence against the (Christian) state, and is prohibited because it tends to subvert (Christian) society; offence to God as such is outside the reach of the law.

The last person in Britain to be sent to prison for blasphemy was John William Gott on 9 December 1921. He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets entitled &quot;Rib Ticklers, or Questions for Parsons&quot; and &quot;God and Gott&quot;. In these pamphlets Gott satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem () comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months&#x27; hard labour despite suffering from an incurable illness, and died shortly after he was released. The case became the subject of public outrage.

In a 1949 speech, Lord Denning placed the blasphemy laws in the past, saying that &quot;The reason for this law was because it was thought that a denial of Christianity was liable to shake the fabric of society, which was itself founded upon Christian religion. There is no such danger to society now and the offence of blasphemy is a dead letter&quot;.

In 1977, however, the case &quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot; (involving the periodical &quot;Gay News&quot; publishing James Kirkup&#x27;s poem &quot;The Love that Dares to Speak its Name&quot;) demonstrated that the offence of blasphemous libel, long thought to be dormant, was still in force. During the House of Lords appeal Lord Scarman said that &quot;I do not subscribe to the view that the common-law offence of blasphemous libel serves no useful purpose in modern law. ... The offence belongs to a group of criminal offences designed to safeguard the internal tranquillity of the kingdom.&quot;

The following cases, in particular, were approved by the House of Lords in &quot;Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd&quot;:
* &quot;R v Hetherington&quot; (1841) 4 St Tr (NS) 563, (1841) 5 JP 496, (1841) 4 Jur 529
* &quot;Shore v Wilson&quot; (1842) 9 Cl &amp; F 524
* &quot;R v Ramsay and Foote&quot; (1883) 15 Cox 231, (1883) 48 LT 733
* &quot;Bowman v Secular Society Ltd&quot; [1917] AC 406, 33 TLR 376, 86 LJ Ch 117

Lord Scarman said that in his judgement the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in article 214 of &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Digest of the Criminal Law&quot;, Ninth Edition, 1950, which reads:

The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the courts to interpret the law in a way that is compatible with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The offence of blasphemous libel is believed by some to be contrary to the freedom of speech provisions in the Convention. However, just before the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, a claim that the blasphemy law is inconsistent with article 10 of the Convention (providing for freedom of expression) was rejected in the case of &quot;Wingrove v UK&quot; (1997); a case brought by solicitor Mark Stephens. The Court decided that it was within the state&#x27;s margin of appreciation for a restriction on free speech.

When the BBC decided to broadcast &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot; in January 2005, they received over 63,000 complaints by offended Christian viewers who objected to the show&#x27;s portrayal of Christian icons (including one scene depicting Jesus professing to be &quot;a bit gay&quot;). The fundamentalist group Christian Voice sought a private blasphemy prosecution against the BBC, but the charges were rejected by City of Westminster magistrates&#x27; court. Christian Voice applied to have this ruling overturned by the High Court, but the application was rejected, the court finding that the common law blasphemy offences specifically did not apply to stage productions (section 2(4) of the Theatres Act 1968) and broadcasts (section 6 of the Broadcasting Act 1990).

====Religion to which the offences relate====
In &quot;R v Gathercole&quot; (1838), the defendant was convicted of criminal libel for publishing an attack on a Roman Catholic nunnery. Alderson B., in his direction to the jury, said that &quot;a person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is therefore a part of the constitution of the country. In the like manner, and for the same reason, any general attack on Christianity is the subject of a criminal prosecution, because Christianity is the established religion of the country.&quot;

In &quot;Bowman v Secular Society Ltd&quot; (1917), Lord Sumner said that this was a &quot;strange dictum&quot; because insulting a Jew&#x27;s religion was no less likely to provoke a fight than insulting an episcopalian&#x27;s religion.

The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. In 1985, the Law Commission said that the effect of this was that the church was no longer &quot;the form established by law&quot; nor &quot;part of the constitution&quot; of the Principality of Wales, within the meaning of those expressions in the dictum from &quot;R v Gathercole&quot; set out above. They said that, at that date, there was no authority as to the effect of this, if any, on the law of blasphemy in Wales.

In &quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot; (as &quot;Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd&quot; [1979] when it reached the Law Lords), Lord Scarman said that the offence did not protect the religious beliefs and feelings of non-Christians. He said it was &quot;shackled by the chains of history&quot; in this respect.

In &quot;R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury&quot; (1991), a divisional court held that the offences prohibited attacks only on the Christian religion, and did not prohibit attacks on the Islamic religion.

It was also held that the failure of these offences to prohibit attacks on non-Christian religions did not violate article 9 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (which relates to freedom of religion).

====Mode of trial====
At the time of their abolition, blasphemy and blasphemous libel were indictable-only offences.

====Sentence and orders on conviction====
The death penalty for blasphemy was abolished by the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677 (29 Cha. 2. c. 9).

In &quot;R v Woolston&quot;, the defendant was sentenced to a fine of £25 for each of his four discourses (i.e. £100 altogether) and to imprisonment for the term of one year. He was also required to enter into a recognizance for his good behaviour during his life, himself in the sum of £3,000 and by others in the sum of £2,000. (As to recognizances, see also binding over).

====Number of prosecutions====
Before 1883, prosecutions were &quot;much more common&quot;. In the years 1883 to 1922 there were five prosecutions. There was an unsuccessful private prosecution in 1971. The next successful prosecution was in 1977.

====Individual prosecutions, arrests and failures to prosecute====
In England the last prominent 19th-century prosecution for blasphemy was the case of &quot;R v Ramsey and Foote&quot;, when the editor, publisher and printer of &quot;The Freethinker&quot; were sentenced to imprisonment.

In 1908, police court proceedings were taken against Harry Boulter for blasphemy uttered at a meeting at Highbury Corner, Hyde Park. An orator with links to the Rationalist movement he was jailed for a month in June 1909 and in November 1911 he was sentenced to three months for repeating the offence.

In February 1925, the Glasgow-based radical Guy Aldred was arrested in Hyde Park and charged with blasphemy and sedition.

In 1988, British author Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; was published. A number of Muslims considered the book to blaspheme against Islam, and Iranian clerical leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for Rushdie&#x27;s death, &quot;along with all the editors and publishers aware of its contents&quot;. Consequently, the government was petitioned for Rushdie to be prosecuted for blasphemy. No charges were laid because, as a House of Lords select committee stated, the law only protects the Christian beliefs as held by the Church of England. The Rushdie case stimulated debate on this topic, with some arguing the same protection should be extended to all religions, while others claimed the UK&#x27;s ancient blasphemy laws were an anachronism and should be abolished. Despite much discussion surrounding the controversy, the law was not amended.

Michael Newman, a secondary school science teacher and an atheist, was arrested under England&#x27;s blasphemy law for selling Wingrove&#x27;s blasphemous video &quot;Visions of Ecstasy&quot; in February 1992 in Birmingham. He was forced to resign from his school position due to protests from Christian parents. As a result, he became a subject of discussion in the media, including an appearance on Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;Comment&quot; programme in England.

== Reform ==

=== Proposals to amend the law and protests ===
The Law Commission published a report in 1985 on &quot;Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship&quot;. The report noted that &quot;there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute&quot;. The authors added that &quot;it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit.&quot; The Commission concluded &quot;that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement&quot;. A minority report sought to create a replacement offence such that citizens should not purposely &quot;insult or outrage the religious feelings of others&quot;.

In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of the poem &quot;The Love that Dares to Speak its Name&quot; by James Kirkup took place on the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square and failed to lead to any prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It suggested Jesus was a homosexual. An earlier reading in 1977 had led to prosecution. Outraged Christians tried to drown out the 2002 reading. &quot;We have won an important victory for free speech and the right to protest&quot;, declared human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. &quot;No one was arrested. The police didn&#x27;t even take our names and addresses. The blasphemy law is now a dead letter. If the authorities are not prepared to enforce the law, they should abolish it&quot;. A trial would have involved all those who read and published the poem, including several of Britain&#x27;s leading writers, academics and MPs. After the event, Tatchell said &quot;The blasphemy law gives the Christian religion privileged protection against criticism and dissent. No other institution enjoys such sweeping powers to suppress the expression of opinions and ideas.&quot;

On 15 May 2002 the House of Lords appointed a select committee &quot;to consider and report on the law relating to religious offenses&quot;. The committee&#x27;s first report was published in April 2003; it summarised the state of the law in this area, and found that the present law on blasphemy was unlikely to result in successful prosecution. The committee found no consensus on whether a new law against blasphemy was required, but concluded that any law should apply to all faiths. Home Secretary David Blunkett responded with plans to criminalise incitement to religious hatred, which became the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, and he suggested the blasphemy law might be repealed once the new law was in force.

=== Abolition ===
In January 2008, a spokesman for prime minister Gordon Brown announced that the government would consider supporting the abolition of the blasphemy laws during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The government consulted the Church of England and other churches before reaching a decision. The move followed a letter written to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; at the instigation of MP Evan Harris and the National Secular Society and was signed by leading figures including Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, who urged that the laws be abandoned. Evan Harris and Lord Avebury shared the National Secular Society&#x27;s 2009 Person of the Year award for their work to abolish the offence of blasphemous libel.

On 5 March 2008, an amendment was passed to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales. The peers also voted for the laws to be abandoned during March. The Act received royal assent on 8 May 2008, and the relevant section came into force on 8 July 2008.

===Statutory offences===
The Sacrament Act 1547 (1 Edw. 6. c. 1) set a punishment of imprisonment for reviling the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. It was repealed by the First Statute of Repeal (1 Mar. Sess. 2. c. 2) in 1553 and revived again in 1558.

The interregnum Parliament in 1650, &quot;holding it to be [its] duty, by all good ways and means to propagate the Gospel in this Commonwealth, to advance Religion in all Sincerity, Godliness, and Honesty&quot; passed &quot;An Act against several Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions, derogatory to the honor of God, and destructive to humane Society&quot;, known as the Blasphemy Act of 1650 and intended to punish those &quot;who should abuse and turn into Licentiousness, the liberty given in matters of Conscience&quot;. All acts of Interregnum period were considered void after the English Restoration due to their lack of royal assent.

Profane cursing and swearing was made punishable by the Profane Oaths Act 1745, which directed that the offender be brought before a justice of the peace, and fined an amount that depended on his social rank. It was repealed by section 13 of the Criminal Law Act 1967.

Those denying the Trinity were deprived of the benefit of the Toleration Act 1688. The Blasphemy Act 1697 enacted that if any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, should by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, deny that the members of the Holy Trinity were God, or should assert that there is more than one god, or deny the Christian religion to be true, or the Holy Scriptures to be of divine authority, he should, upon the first offence, be rendered incapable of holding any office or place of trust, and for the second incapable of bringing any action, of being guardian or executor, or of taking a legacy or deed of gift, and should suffer three years imprisonment without bail.

The Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 (53 Geo. 3. c. 160) excepted from these enactments &quot;persons denying as therein mentioned respecting the Holy Trinity&quot;.

===Relationship between the common law and statutory offences===
A person offending under the Blasphemy Act 1697 was also indictable at common law. In &quot;Rex v Carlile&quot;, Mr Justice Best said:

==Scotland==
By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment for blasphemy was death, a penalty last imposed on Thomas Aikenhead in Edinburgh in 1697. By the Leasing-making (Scotland) Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. 47), amended by the Leasing-making, etc. (Scotland) Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 5), blasphemy was made punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. The last prosecution for blasphemy in Scotland was in 1843 when bookseller Thomas Paterson was sentenced at Edinburgh High Court to fifteen months in prison for selling profane placards,

According to the 18th–19th century legal writer David Hume (nephew of the philosopher), Scots law distinguished between blasphemy, which was uttered in passion generally in the heat of the moment, and other offences which involved the propagation of ideas contrary to religion. It is blasphemy, Hume wrote

The Human Rights Act 1998 applies in Scotland as well as England and Wales, and therefore poses similar challenges to the existing Scottish blasphemy laws as those described above. Additionally, some legal commentators believe that, owing to the long time since successful prosecution, blasphemy in Scotland is no longer a crime, although blasphemous conduct might still be tried as a breach of the peace.

In 2005, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service considered a complaint under the blasphemy law regarding the BBC transmission of &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, but did not proceed with charges.

On 24 April 2020, the Scottish Government published a new bill that seeks to reform hate crime legislation to provide better protection against race, sex, age and religious discrimination, and would also decriminalise blasphemy. Humanists UK, which campaigns against blasphemy laws, welcomed the bill. The Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 received royal assent on 23 April 2021 and abolished the common law offence of blasphemy from 1 April 2024.

==Northern Ireland==
Blasphemy and blasphemous libel continue to be offences under the common law of Northern Ireland. On 5 November 2009, in the House of Lords, an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill was moved, which would have abolished these offences in Northern Ireland, but following a brief debate, the amendment was withdrawn.

In March 2019, Northern Ireland Humanists, part of Humanists UK, launched a campaign to abolish blasphemy laws in Northern Ireland, following on from the referendum result in Ireland and other recent international efforts to repeal blasphemy laws.

<text>Auguste René Caillié (; 19 November 1799 – 17 May 1838) was a French explorer and the first European to return alive from the town of Timbuktu. Caillié had been preceded at Timbuktu by a British officer, Major Gordon Laing, who was murdered in September 1826 on leaving the city. Caillié was therefore the first to return alive.

Caillié was born in western France in a village near the port of Rochefort. His parents were poor and died while he was still young. At the age of 16 he left home and signed up as a member of the crew on a French naval vessel sailing to Saint-Louis on the coast of modern Senegal in western Africa. He stayed there for several months and then crossed the Atlantic to Guadeloupe on a merchantman. He made a second visit to West Africa two years later when he accompanied a British expedition across the Ferlo Desert to Bakel on the Senegal River.

Caillié returned to Saint-Louis in 1824 with a strong desire to become an explorer and visit Timbuktu. In order to avoid some of the difficulties experienced by the earlier expeditions, he planned to travel alone disguised as a Muslim. He persuaded the French governor in Saint-Louis to help finance a stay of 8 months with the nomadic people in the Brakna Region of southern Mauritania where he learned Arabic and the customs of Islam. He failed to obtain further funding from either the French or the British governments, but encouraged by the prize of 9,000 francs offered by the Société de Géographie in Paris for the first person to return with a description of Timbuktu, he decided to fund the journey himself. He worked for a few months in the British colony of Sierra Leone to save some money, then travelled by ship to Boké on the Rio Nuñez in modern Guinea. From there in April 1827 he set off across West Africa. He arrived in Timbuktu a year later and stayed there for two weeks before heading across the Sahara Desert to Tangier in Morocco.

On his return to France, he was awarded the prize of 9,000 francs by the Société de Géographie and, helped by the scholar Edme-François Jomard, published an account of his journey. In 1830, he was awarded the Gold Medal by the Société de Géographie.

Caillié married and settled near his birthplace. He suffered from poor health and died of tuberculosis aged 38.

==Early life==
René Caillié was born on 19 November 1799 in Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon, a village in the department of Deux-Sèvres in western France. His father, François Caillé, had worked as a baker but four months before René was born he was accused of petty theft and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour in a penal colony at Rochefort. He died there in 1808, at the age of 46. René&#x27;s mother, Élizabeth née Lépine, died three years later in 1811 at the age of 38. After her death, René and his 18-year-old sister, Céleste, were cared for by their maternal grandmother.

==First trips to Africa==
In the introduction to his &quot;Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo&quot;, Caillié described how as a teenager he had been fascinated by books on travel and exploration: 
... and as soon as I could read and write, I was put to learn a trade, to which I soon took a dislike, owing to the reading of voyages and travels, which occupied all my leisure moments. The &quot;History of Robinson Crusoe&quot;, in particular, inflamed my young imagination : I was impatient to encounter adventures like him; nay, I already felt an ambition to signalize myself by some important discovery springing up in my heart.
Caillié left home at the age of 16 with 60 francs that he had inherited from his grandmother. He made his way to the port of Rochefort, from Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon on the River Charente. There he signed up as a crew member on the &quot;Loire&quot;, a French naval storeship that was to accompany the frigate &quot;Méduse&quot; and two other vessels on a voyage to reclaim the French colony of Saint-Louis from the British under the terms of the 1814 and 1815 Paris Treaties. The four ships left their anchorage near the Île d&#x27;Aix at the mouth of the Charente River in June 1816. The &quot;Méduse&quot; went ahead of the &quot;Loire&quot; and was wrecked on the Bank of Arguin off the coast of present-day Mauritania. A few survivors were picked up by the other vessels. The shipwreck received a large amount of publicity and was the subject of a famous oil painting, &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, by Théodore Géricault. When the three remaining French ships arrived at Saint-Louis they found that the British governor was not ready to hand over the colony so the ships continued southwards and moored off the island of Gorée, near Dakar. Caillié spent some months in Dakar, then only a village, before returning by ship to Saint-Louis. There he learned that an English expedition led by Major William Gray was preparing to leave from the Gambia to explore the interior of the continent. Caillié wished to offer his services and set off along the coast with two companions. He intended to cover the on foot but found the oppressive heat and lack of water exhausting. He abandoned his plan at Dakar and instead obtained a free passage on a merchantman across the Atlantic to Guadeloupe.

Caillié found employment for six months in Guadeloupe. While there he read Mungo Park&#x27;s account of his exploration of the Middle Niger in present-day Mali. Park had been the first European to reach the Niger River and visit the towns of Ségou, Sansanding and Bamako. An account of his first trip had been published in French in 1799. Park made a second expedition beginning in 1805 but was drowned in descending the rapids on the Niger, near Bussa, in present-day Nigeria. An account of the second trip had been published in English in 1815.

Caillié returned to Bordeaux in France and then travelled to Senegal where he arrived at end of 1818. He made a journey into the interior to the pre-colonial state of Bundu to carry supplies for a British expedition but he fell ill with fever and was obliged to return to France.

In 1824 he returned to Senegal for the third time with the desire to visit the African interior. The Paris-based Société de Géographie was offering a 9,000-franc reward to the first European to see and return alive from Timbuktu, believing it to be a rich and wondrous city. He spent eight months with the Brakna Moors living north of the Senegal River, learning Arabic and being taught, as a convert, the laws and customs of Islam. He laid his project of reaching Timbuktu before the governor of Senegal, but receiving no encouragement went to Sierra Leone where the British authorities made him superintendent of an indigo plantation. Having saved £80 he joined a Mandingo caravan going inland. He was dressed as a Muslim, and gave out that he was an Arab from Egypt who had been carried off by the French to Senegal and was desirous of regaining his own country.

==Journey to Timbuktu==

Starting from Kakondy near Boké on the Rio Nuñez on 19 April 1827, Caillié travelled east along the hills of Fouta Djallon, passing the head streams of the Senegal River and crossing the Upper Niger at Kurussa (now Kouroussa).

Caillié reached Kankan in present-day Guinea on 17 June 1827 travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts. He stayed there for a month. The town was an important commercial centre with a market held three times a week. Instead of having a surrounding mud wall, the town was defended by quickset hedges. Caillié was advised not to travel north along the Milo River as the town of Kankan was fighting for control of the Bouré gold producing area around Siguiri and the Tinkisso River. Instead Caillié left the town heading east in the direction of Minignan in the Ivory Coast. He wished to visit Djenné but wanted to avoid the town of Ségou on the Niger River as Ségou was at war with Djenné. He also feared that he might be recognised as a Christian in Ségou as Mungo Park had visited the town in 1796.

Continuing eastwards he reached the Kong highlands, where at the village of Tiémé in present-day Ivory Coast, he was detained for five months (3 August 18279 January 1828) by illness. Resuming his journey in January 1828 he went north-east and reached the city of Djenné, where he stayed 11–23 March. Djenné lies north of the Bani River to which it is connected by a narrow channel that is only navigable in the wet season. Caillié confused the Bani with the Niger River (which he referred to as the Dhioliba). The Bani joins the Niger downstream from Djenné at Mopti (Caillié&#x27;s Isaca). From Djenné he continued his journey to Timbuktu on a boat transporting merchandise and 20 slaves. After two days they arrived at the village of Kouna where the cargo was transferred to a larger vessel. The boat crossed Lac Débo and then followed the more easterly and smaller branch of the river, the Bara-Issa. At the busy port of Sa they were joined by 30 or 40 other vessels also heading for Timbuktu as travelling in a flotilla provided some degree of protection against bandits. He arrived in Timbuktu on 20 April 1828.

In 1550 Leo Africanus described the inhabitants of Timbuktu as being very rich with a king that possessed large quantities of gold. The perception of Timbuktu as a very wealthy city had been fuelled by various accounts published in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Caillié recorded his first impression of the town: &quot;I had formed a totally different idea of the grandeur and wealth of Timbuktu. The city presented, at first view, nothing but a mass of ill looking houses, built of earth.&quot; He compared it unfavorably with Djenne:

... afterwards I took a turn round the city. I found it neither so large nor so populous as I had expected. Its commerce is not so considerable as fame has reported. There was not as at Jenné [Djenné] a concourse of strangers from all parts of the Soudan. I saw in the streets of Timbuctoo only the camels, which had arrived from Cabra [Kabara] laden with the merchandise of the flotilla, a few groups of the inhabitants sitting on mats, conversing together, and Moors lying asleep in the shade before their doors. In a word everything had a dull appearance.


After spending a fortnight in Timbuktu, Caillié left the city on 4 May 1828 accompanying a caravan of 600 camels heading north across the Sahara Desert. After six days the caravan reached Araouane, a village north of Timbuktu that acted as an entrepôt in the trans-Sahara trade. When the caravan left Araouane on 19 May it included 1,400 camels and 400 men. It was transporting slaves, gold, ivory, gum, ostrich feathers, clothing and cloth. Caillie reached Fez on 12 August. From Tangier he returned by frigate to Toulon in France.

Caillié had been preceded at Timbuktu by a British officer, Major Gordon Laing, who was murdered in September 1826 on leaving the city. Caillié was the first to return alive. He became a Knight of the Legion of Honour by decree on 10 December 1828. He was awarded the prize of 9,000 francs offered by the Société de Géographie to the first traveller to gain exact information of Timbuktu, and in 1830 along with Laing was awarded the society&#x27;s gold medal, a pension, and other distinctions. It was at the public expense that his &quot;Journal d&#x27;un voyage à Temboctou et à Jenné dans l&#x27;Afrique Centrale, etc.&quot; (edited by Edme-François Jomard) was published in three volumes in 1830.

The next European to visit Timbuktu was the German explorer Heinrich Barth who arrived in 1853. When describing the Djinguereber Mosque Barth wrote:

It was here especially that I convinced myself, not only of the trustworthy character of Caillié&#x27;s report in general, of which I had already had an opportunity of judging, but also the accuracy with which, under very unfavourable circumstances in which he was placed, he has described the various objects that fell under his observation.

However, Barth criticised Caillié&#x27;s picture of Timbuktu showing detached houses &quot;while, in reality, the streets are entirely shut in, as the dwellings form continuous and uninterrupted rows.&quot; No European visited Djenné until April 1893 when French troops under the command of Louis Archinard occupied the town.

==Death and legacy==
Caillié died of tuberculosis on 17 May 1838, at La Gripperie-Saint-Symphorien, in the department of Charente-Maritime where he owned the manor L&#x27;Abadaire.

Caillié is remarkable for his approach to exploration. In a period when large-scale expeditions supported by soldiers and employing black porters were the norm, Caillié spent years learning Arabic, studying the customs and Islamic religion before setting off with a companion and later on his own, travelling and living as the natives did. His opinion of Timbuktu was very different from that of Laing, who described it as a wondrous city. Caillié stated that it was a small, unimportant and poor town with no hint of the fabled reputation that had preceded it.

<doc id="608115" wikidata="Q211221" url="?curid=608115" title="Star of Bethlehem">
<text>The Star of Bethlehem, or Christmas Star, appears in the nativity story of the Gospel of Matthew chapter 2 where &quot;wise men from the East&quot; (Magi) are inspired by the star to travel to Jerusalem. There, they meet King Herod of Judea, and ask him:
Herod calls together his scribes and priests who, quoting a verse from the Book of Micah, interpret it as a prophecy that the Jewish Messiah would be born in Bethlehem to the south of Jerusalem. Secretly intending to find and kill the Messiah in order to preserve his own kingship, Herod invites the wise men to return to him on their way home.

The star leads them to Jesus&#x27; Bethlehem birthplace, where they worship him and give him gifts. The wise men are then given a divine warning not to return to Herod, so they return home by a different route.

Many Christians believe the star was a miraculous sign. Some theologians claimed that the star fulfilled a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link the star to unusual celestial events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn or Jupiter and Venus, a comet, or a supernova. Some modern scholars do not consider the story to be describing a historical event, but rather a pious fiction added later to the main gospel account.

The subject is a favorite at planetarium shows during the Christmas season. However, most ancient sources and Church tradition generally indicate that the wise men visited Bethlehem sometime after Jesus&#x27; birth. The visit is traditionally celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in Western Christianity.

The account in the Gospel of Matthew describes Jesus with the broader Greek word , which can mean either &quot;infant&quot; or &quot;child&quot; rather than the more specific word for infant, . This possibly implies that some time has passed since the birth. However, the word is also used in the Gospel of Luke specifically concerning Jesus&#x27; birth and his later presentation at the temple. Herod I has all male Hebrew babies in the area up to age two killed in the Massacre of the Innocents.

==Matthew&#x27;s narrative==

The Gospel of Matthew tells how the Magi (often translated as &quot;wise men&quot;, but more accurately astrologers) arrive at the court of Herod in Jerusalem and tell the king of a star which signifies the birth of the King of the Jews:

Herod is &quot;troubled&quot;, not because of the appearance of the star, but because the Magi have told him that a &quot;king of the Jews&quot; had been born, which he understands to refer to the Messiah, a leader of the Jewish people whose coming was believed to be foretold in scripture. He asks his advisors where the Messiah would be born. They answer Bethlehem, birthplace of King David, and quote the prophet Micah. The king passes this information along to the Magi.

In a dream, they are warned not to return to Jerusalem, so they leave for their own country by another route. When Herod realizes he has been tricked, he orders the execution of all male children in Bethlehem &quot;two years old and younger,&quot; based on the age the child could be in regard to the information the magi had given him concerning the time the star first appeared.

Joseph, warned in a dream, takes his family to Egypt for their safety. The gospel links the escape to a verse from scripture, which it interprets as a prophecy: &quot;Out of Egypt I called my son.&quot; This was a reference to the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses, so the quote suggests that Matthew saw the life of Jesus as recapitulating the story of the Jewish people, with Judea representing Egypt and Herod standing in for pharaoh.

After Herod dies, Joseph and his family return from Egypt, and settle in Nazareth in Galilee. This is also said to be a fulfillment of a prophecy (&quot;He will be called a Nazorean,&quot; (NRSV) which could be attributed to Judges 13:5 regarding the birth of Samson and the Nazirite vow. The word &quot;Nazareth&quot; is related to the word which means &quot;sprout&quot;, and which some Bible commentators think refers to Isaiah 11:1: &quot;There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow out of his roots.&quot;

==Explanations==

===Pious fiction===
Scholars who see the gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew&#x27;s account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew is the only one of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. Some scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth, and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives were later additions to the gospels intended to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy.

According to Bart D. Ehrman, the Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already lives in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.

===Fulfillment of prophecy===
The ancients believed that astronomical phenomena were connected to terrestrial events. Miracles were routinely associated with the birth of important people, including the Hebrew patriarchs, as well as Greek and Roman heroes.

The Star of Bethlehem is traditionally linked to the Star Prophecy in the Book of Numbers:
Although possibly intended to refer to a time that was long past, since the kingdom of Moab had long ceased to exist by the time the Gospels were being written, this passage had become widely seen as a reference to the coming of a Messiah. It was, for example, cited by Josephus, who believed it referred to Emperor Vespasian. Origen, one of the most influential early Christian theologians, connected this prophecy with the Star of Bethlehem:
Origen suggested that the Magi may have decided to travel to Jerusalem when they &quot;conjectured that the man whose appearance had been foretold along with that of the star, had actually come into the world&quot;.

The Magi are sometimes called &quot;kings&quot; because of the belief that they fulfill prophecies in Isaiah and Psalms concerning a journey to Jerusalem by gentile kings. Isaiah mentions gifts of gold and incense. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament probably used by Matthew, these gifts are given as gold and frankincense, similar to Matthew&#x27;s &quot;gold, frankincense, and myrrh.&quot; The gift of myrrh symbolizes mortality, according to Origen.

While Origen argued for a naturalistic explanation, John Chrysostom viewed the star as purely miraculous: &quot;How then, tell me, did the star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and shed, unless it left that height and came down, and stood over the very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting when he said, &quot;Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.&quot;

===Astronomical object===

Although the word &quot;magi&quot; (Greek ) is usually translated as &quot;wise men,&quot; in this context it probably means &#x27;astronomer&#x27;/&#x27;astrologer&#x27;. The involvement of astrologers in the story of the birth of Jesus was problematic for the early Church, because they condemned astrology as demonic; a widely cited explanation was that of Tertullian, who suggested that astrology was allowed &#x27;only until the time of the Gospel&#x27;.

====Planetary conjunction====
In 1614, German astronomer Johannes Kepler determined that a series of three conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Professor Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation. 

In 3–2 BC, there was a series of seven conjunctions, including three between Jupiter and Regulus and a strikingly close conjunction between Jupiter and Venus near Regulus on June 17, 2 BC. &quot;The fusion of two planets would have been a rare and awe-inspiring event&quot;, according to Roger Sinnott. Another Venus–Jupiter conjunction occurred earlier in August, 3 BC. While these events occurred after the generally accepted date of 4 BC for the death of Herod, they did occur during the reign of Caesar Augustus (who is referenced in the Gospel of Luke), and early Christian historians Eusebius and Clement of Alexandria calculated the birth of Jesus to 3-2 BC. Since the conjunction would have been seen in the west at sunset it could not have led the magi south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.

====Double occultation on Saturday (Sabbath) April 17, 6 BC ====
Astronomer Michael R. Molnar argues that the &quot;star in the east&quot; refers to an astronomical event with astrological significance in the context of ancient Greek astrology. He suggests a link between the Star of Bethlehem and a double occultation of Jupiter by the Moon on March 20 and April 17 of 6 BC in Aries, particularly the second occultation on April 17. Occultations of planets by the Moon are quite common, but Firmicus Maternus, an astrologer to Roman Emperor Constantine, wrote that an occultation of Jupiter in Aries was a sign of the birth of a divine king. He argues that Aries rather than Pisces was the zodiac symbol for Judea, a fact that would affect previous interpretations of astrological material. Molnar&#x27;s theory was debated by scientists, theologians, and historians during a colloquium on the Star of Bethlehem at the Netherlands&#x27; University of Groningen in October 2014. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich supports Molnar&#x27;s explanation but noted technical questions. &quot;The gospel story is one in which King Herod was taken by surprise,&quot; said Gingerich. &quot;So it wasn&#x27;t that there was suddenly a brilliant new star sitting there that anybody could have seen [but] something more subtle.&quot; Astronomer David A. Weintraub says, &quot;If Matthew&#x27;s wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn&#x27;t guide them; it only told them when to set out.&quot;

There is an explanation given that the events were quite close to the Sun and would not have been visible to the naked eye.

====Regulus, Jupiter, and Venus====

Attorney Frederick Larson examined the biblical account in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 2 and found the following nine qualities of Bethlehem&#x27;s Star: It signified birth, it signified kingship, it was related to the Jewish nation, and it rose &quot;in the East&quot;; King Herod had not been aware of it; it appeared at an exact time; it endured over time; and, according to Matthew, it was in front of the Magi when they traveled south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and then stopped over Bethlehem.

Using the Starry Night astronomy software, and an article written by astronomer Craig Chester based on the work of archeologist and historian Ernest L. Martin, Larson thinks all nine characteristics of the Star of Bethlehem are found in events that took place in the skies of 3–2 BC. Highlights include a triple conjunction of Jupiter, called the king planet, with the fixed star Regulus, called the king star, starting in September 3 BC. Larson believes that may be the time of Jesus&#x27; conception.

By June of 2 BC, nine months later, the human gestation period, Jupiter had continued moving in its orbit around the Sun and appeared in close conjunction with Venus in June of 2 BC. In Hebrew Jupiter is called , meaning &quot;righteousness&quot;, a term also used for the Messiah, and suggested that because the planet Venus represents love and fertility, so Chester had suggested astrologers would have viewed the close conjunction of Jupiter and Venus as indicating a coming new king of Israel, and Herod would have taken them seriously. Astronomer Dave Reneke independently found the June 2 BC planetary conjunction, and noted it would have appeared as a &quot;bright beacon of light&quot;. According to Chester, the disks of Jupiter and Venus would have appeared to touch and there has not been as close a Venus-Jupiter conjunction since then.

Jupiter next continued to move and then stopped in its apparent retrograde motion on December 25 of 2 BC over the town of Bethlehem. Since planets in their orbits have a &quot;stationary point&quot;, a planet moves eastward through the stars but, &quot;As it approaches the opposite point in the sky from the sun, it appears to slow, come to a full stop, and move backward (westward) through the sky for some weeks. Again it slows, stops, and resumes its eastward course,&quot; said Chester. The date of December 25 that Jupiter appeared to stop while in retrograde took place in the season of Hanukkah, and is the date later chosen to celebrate Christmas.

====Heliacal rising====

The Magi told Herod that they saw the star &quot;in the East,&quot; or according to some translations, &quot;at its rising&quot;, which may imply the routine appearance of a constellation, or an asterism. One theory interprets the phrase in Matthew 2:2, &quot;in the east,&quot; as an astrological term concerning a &quot;heliacal rising.&quot; This translation was proposed by Edersheim and Heinrich Voigt, among others. The view was rejected by the philologist Franz Boll (1867–1924). Two modern translators of ancient astrological texts insist that the text does not use the technical terms for either a heliacal or an acronycal rising of a star. However, one concedes that Matthew may have used layman&#x27;s terms for a rising.

====Comet====
Other writers highly suggest that the star was a comet. Halley&#x27;s Comet was visible in 12 BC and another object, possibly a comet or nova, was seen by Chinese and Korean stargazers in about 5 BC. This object was observed for over seventy days, possibly with no movement recorded. Ancient writers described comets as &quot;hanging over&quot; specific cities, just as the Star of Bethlehem was said to have &quot;stood over&quot; the &quot;place&quot; where Jesus was (the town of Bethlehem). However, this is generally thought unlikely as in ancient times comets were generally seen as bad omens. The comet explanation has been recently promoted by Colin Nicholl. His theory involves a hypothetical comet which could have appeared in 6 BC.

====Supernova====
Physicist Frank Tipler has proposed that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy. Although it is difficult to detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernova remnants have been detected in Andromeda.

Another theory is the more likely supernova of February 23 4 BC, which is now known as PSR 1913+16 or the Hulse-Taylor Pulsar. It is said to have appeared in the constellation of Aquila, near the intersection of the winter colure and the equator of date. The nova was &quot;recorded in China, Korea, and Palestine&quot; (probably meaning the Biblical account).

A nova or comet was recorded in China in 4 BC. &quot;In the reign of Ai-ti, in the third year of the Chien-p&#x27;ing period. In the third month, day , there was a rising at Hoku&quot; (Han Shu, The History of the Former Han Dynasty). The date is equivalent to April 24, 4 BC. This identifies the date when it was first observed in China. It was also recorded in Korea: &quot;In the fifty-fourth year of Hyokkose Wang, in the spring, second month, day , a appeared at Hoku&quot; (Samguk Sagi, The Historical Record of the Three Kingdoms). The Korean text may have been corrupted because Ho (1962) points out that &quot;the day did not fall in the second month that year but on the first month&quot; (February 23) and on the third month (April 24). The original must have read &quot;day , first month&quot; (February 23) or &quot;day , third month&quot; (April 24). The latter would coincide with the date in the Chinese records although professor Ho suggests the date was &quot;probably February 23, 4 BC.&quot;

==Relating the star historically to Jesus&#x27; birth==

If the story of the Star of Bethlehem described an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. Some scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover rather than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod&#x27;s court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus&#x27; birth was in 3–2 BC.
The Gospel of Luke says the census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria. Tipler suggests this took place in AD 6, nine years after the death of Herod, and that the family of Jesus left Bethlehem shortly after the birth. Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error on the part of the author of the Gospel of Luke, concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.

However, there is some debate among Bible translators about the correct reading of Luke 2:2 (). Instead of translating the registration as taking place &quot;when&quot; Quirinius was governor of Syria, some versions translate it as &quot;before&quot; or use &quot;before&quot; as an alternative, which Harold Hoehner, F.F. Bruce, Ben Witherington and others have suggested may be the correct translation. While not in agreement, Emil Schürer also acknowledged that such a translation can be justified grammatically. According to Josephus, the tax census conducted by the Roman senator Quirinius particularly irritated the Jews, and was one of the causes of the Zealot movement of armed resistance to Rome. From this perspective, Luke may have been trying to differentiate the census at the time of Jesus&#x27; birth from the tax census mentioned in Acts 5:37 that took place under Quirinius at a later time. One ancient writer identified the census at Jesus&#x27; birth, not with taxes, but with a universal pledge of allegiance to the emperor.

Jack Finegan noted some early writers&#x27; reckoning of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later for the birth of Jesus, including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places the death of Herod in 1 BC, and says if Jesus was born two years or less before Herod the Great died, the birth of Jesus would have been in 3 or 2 BC. Finegan also notes the Alogi reckoned Jesus&#x27;s birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.

==Religious interpretations==

===Catholicism===
The Catholic Church has no say on the Star of Bethlehem, except that it led the Magi to Jesus. Various theologians have speculated on the star&#x27;s nature: star, angel, light, person, bird, illusion, hallucination, natural phenomenon, etc.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Star of Bethlehem is interpreted as a miraculous event of symbolic and pedagogical significance, regardless of whether it coincides with a natural phenomenon; a sign sent by God to lead the Magi to the Christ Child. This is illustrated in the Troparion of the Nativity:

In Orthodox Christian iconography, the Star of Bethlehem is often depicted not as golden, but as a dark aureola, a semicircle at the top of the icon, indicating the Uncreated Light of Divine grace, with a ray pointing to &quot;the place where the young child lay&quot; (Matthew 2:9). Sometimes the faint image of an angel is drawn inside the aureola.

Simon the Athonite founded the monastery of Simonopetra on Mount Athos after seeing a star he identified with the Star of Bethlehem.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
LDS members believe that the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world over. In the 1830 Book of Mormon, which they believe contains writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear as a sign that Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the fulfillment of this prophecy.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Members of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the &quot;star&quot; was a vision or sign created by Satan, rather than a sign from God. This is because it led the pagan astrologers first to Jerusalem where King Herod consequently found out about the birth of the &quot;king of the Jews&quot;, with the result that he attempted to have Jesus killed.

===Seventh-day Adventist===
In her 1898 book, &quot;The Desire of Ages&quot;, Ellen White states &quot;That star was a distant company of shining angels, but of this the wise men were ignorant.&quot;

==Depiction in art==

Paintings and other pictures of the Adoration of the Magi may include a depiction of the star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the tapestry of the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel.

The colourful star lantern known as a is a cherished and ubiquitous symbol of Christmas for Filipinos, its design and light recalling the star. In its basic form, the has five points and two &quot;tails&quot; that evoke rays of light pointing the way to the baby Jesus, and candles inside the lanterns have been superseded by electric illumination.

In the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, a silver star with 14 undulating rays marks the location traditionally claimed to be that of Jesus&#x27; birth.

In European textiles a common eight-pointed star design is known as the Holy Star of Bethlehem. The design has been used in stone, metal, wood-work and embroidery in the Middle East since antiquity and is one of the oldest patterns in patterns in Palestinian tatreez. In 2019 US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was sworn in wearing a thobe that featured the design. On Vogue Arabia&#x27;s November 2023 cover the star took a central position in the celebration of Palestinian embroidery. The design also features on Christmas sweaters.

<text>Jesper Harding (November 5, 1799 – August 21, 1865) was an American publisher in Philadelphia.

==Early life==
Harding was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1799, a son of George Harding and Mary (née Hudd) Harding. His father was one of four brothers who emigrated from England to Canada and then to Philadelphia where he became a ship&#x27;s carpenter and acquired significant property.

==Career==
After being educated in the local schools, Harding learned the printing trade from the publisher Enos Bronson. After first starting his career in the office of the United States Gazette he started his own business in 1815 at the age of 16. Eleven years later, in November 1829, he purchased the &quot;Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot; newspaper from John Norvell and John R. Walker. About the same time he began printing Bibles and became the largest publisher of Bibles in the U.S.

Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson, Harding attempted to simultaneously support Jackson while also defending the directors of the Bank of the United States, which Jackson fiercely opposed. Harding later switched support (and his newspaper&#x27;s editorial stance) to the anti-Jackson faction within the Democratic-Republican Party and in 1836 supported the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison for president. After this, Harding&#x27;s newspaper became an advocate for the cause of the Whig party, until it was weakened by internal divisions in 1852.

Harding also manufactured paper at a manufacturing plant in Trenton, New Jersey, in what was the largest paper mill in the United States, along with a large iron works in Trenton. Harding merged the &quot;Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot; with the &quot;Daily Courier&quot; in 1839, and for a while the paper was known as &quot;The Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier&quot;. In 1845, it was called &quot;The Pennsylvania Inquirer and National Gazette&quot;. Harding retired from publishing in 1859, succeeded by his son William White Harding, who changed the paper&#x27;s name to the present &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in 1860.

At the time of his death he was Collector of United States Internal Revenue for the First District.

==Personal life==
Harding was married to Maria Wilson (1798–1862), a daughter of Dr. Wilson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Together, they were the parents of six children, including:

* George Harding (1827–1902), who became a patent lawyer and argued several cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and who married Charlotte Ludlow Kenner (1839–1890).
* William White Harding (1830–1889), who succeeded his father as publisher of the paper who married Catharine Badger Hart (1838–1924).
* James Barclay Harding (1830–1865), who married Georgiana Maria Gallagher (1838–1905).

His wife died on June 2, 1862. Harding died on August 21, 1865, at the residence of his eldest son in Chestnut Hill. In his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was referred to as &quot;one of the oldest and best known publishers in the United States.&quot;

===Descendants===
Through his son William, he was a grandfather of Jessie Harding Morris (1865–1952), wife of Alfred Hennen Morris, and J. Horace Harding, was a financier and married Dorothea Barney, a daughter of Charles D. Barney and granddaughter of Civil War financier Jay Cooke.

<text>Carl Dean Wilson (December 21, 1946 – February 6, 1998) was an American musician who co-founded the Beach Boys. He was their lead guitarist, the youngest sibling of bandmates Brian and Dennis, and the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader in the early to mid-1970s. He was also the band&#x27;s musical director on stage from 1965 until his death.

Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures, Wilson&#x27;s initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing singer, but he performed lead vocals on several of their later hits, including &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (1966), &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966), &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; (1969), and &quot;Kokomo&quot; (1988). Unlike other members of the band, he often played alongside the studio musicians employed during the group&#x27;s critical and commercial peak in the mid-1960s. After Brian&#x27;s reduced involvement with the group, Carl produced the bulk of their albums between &quot;20/20&quot; (1969) and &quot;Holland&quot; (1973). Concurrently, he spent several years challenging his draft status as a conscientious objector.

During the 1980s, Wilson attempted to launch a solo career, releasing the albums &quot;Carl Wilson&quot; (1981) and &quot;Youngblood&quot; (1983). In the 1990s, he recorded material with Gerry Beckley and Robert Lamm, later released for the posthumous album &quot;Like a Brother&quot; (2000). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys in 1988. Wilson was also a member of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, a religious corporation. He died in 1998, aged 51, of lung cancer.

==Biography==
=== Early years and success ===

Carl Dean Wilson was born the youngest of the three Wilson boys in Hawthorne, California, the youngest son of Audree Neva (née Korthof) and Murry Gage Wilson. As young children, he and his brothers suffered frequent verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their father. From his pre-teens he practiced harmony vocals under the guidance of his brother Brian, who often sang in the family music room with his mother and brothers. Inspired by country star Spade Cooley, at the age of 12, Carl asked his parents to buy him a guitar, for which he took some lessons. In 1982, Carl remembered from this time: &quot;The kid across the street, David Marks, was taking guitar lessons from John Maus, so I started, too. David and I were about 12 and John was only three years older, but we thought he was a shit-hot guitarist. John and his sister Judy did fraternity gigs together as a duo. Later John moved to England and became one of the Walker Brothers. ... He showed me some fingerpicking techniques and strumming stuff that I still use. When I play a solo, he&#x27;s still there.&quot; While Brian perfected the band&#x27;s vocal style and keyboard base, Carl&#x27;s Chuck Berry-esque guitar became an early Beach Boys trademark. While in high school, Carl also studied saxophone.

Turning 15 as the group&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;, broke locally in Los Angeles, Carl&#x27;s father and manager, Murry (who had sold his business to support his sons&#x27; band), bought him a Fender Jaguar guitar. Carl developed as a musician and singer through the band&#x27;s early recordings, and the early &quot;surf lick&quot; sound heard in &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; was recorded in 1964 when Carl was 17. Also in 1964, Carl contributed his first co-writing credit on a Beach Boys single with the guitar riff and solo in &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; co-written with Mike Love and Brian Wilson. By the end of 1964, he was diversifying, favoring the 12-string Rickenbacker that was also notably used by Roger McGuinn in establishing the sound of the Byrds and by George Harrison of The Beatles during this era. Dave Marsh, in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (1976), stated that Pete Townshend of The Who expanded on both R&amp;B and rock &quot;influenced heavily by Beach Boy Carl Wilson&quot;.

Carl&#x27;s lead vocals in the band&#x27;s first three years were infrequent. Although all members of the band played on their early recordings, Brian began to employ experienced session musicians to play on the group&#x27;s instrumental tracks by 1965 to assist with the complex material, but the band was not eliminated from recording the instrumental tracks and still continued to play on certain songs on each album. Unlike the other members of the band, Carl often played alongside session musicians and also recorded his individual guitar leads during the Beach Boys&#x27; vocal sessions, with his guitar plugged directly into the soundboard. His playing can be heard on the introduction to &quot;California Girls&quot;, throughout the 1965 album &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; and on &quot;That&#x27;s Not Me&quot; from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

After Brian&#x27;s retirement from touring in 1965, Carl became the musical director of the band onstage. Contracts at that time stipulated that promoters hire &quot;Carl Wilson plus four other musicians&quot;. Following his lead vocal performance on &quot;God Only Knows&quot; in 1966, Carl was increasingly lead vocalist for the band, a role previously dominated by Mike Love and Brian. He sang leads on the singles &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Starting with the album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, Brian requested that Carl become more involved in the Beach Boys&#x27; records.

===1970s===
In 1969, the Beach Boys&#x27; rendition of &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; was the first track produced solely by Carl Wilson. By then, he had effectively become the band&#x27;s in-studio leader, producing the bulk of the albums during the early 1970s. Though Carl had written surf instrumentals for the band in the early days, he did not hit his stride as a songwriter until the 1971 album &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, for which he composed &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; and &quot;Feel Flows&quot;, with lyrics by the band&#x27;s then-manager Jack Rieley. Carl considered &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; his first real song. After producing the majority of &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot; (1972) and &quot;Holland&quot; (1973), Carl&#x27;s leadership role diminished somewhat, due to Brian&#x27;s brief public reemergence and because of Carl&#x27;s own substance abuse problems.

For &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; (1979), Carl contributed four songs, among them &quot;Good Timin&#x27;&quot;, co-written with Brian five years earlier, which became a Top 40 American hit. Carl&#x27;s main writing partner in the late 1970s was Geoffrey Cushing-Murray, but for &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; (1980) he wrote with Randy Bachman of the band Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Carl told Michael Feeney Callan, writer-director of the RTÉ 1993 documentary &quot;The Beach Boys Today&quot; (a celebration of the Beach Boys&#x27; 30th anniversary), that Bachman was his favorite writing partner, accordingly: &quot;Basically because he rocked, and I love to rock&quot;.

As a producer and vocalist, Carl&#x27;s work was not confined to the Beach Boys. During the 1970s, he also produced records for other artists, such as Ricci Martin (son of Dean Martin) and South African group the Flames, two members of which later temporarily joined the Beach Boys&#x27; line-up. He lent backing vocals to many works, including Chicago&#x27;s hits &quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot; and &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; (with Al Jardine and brother Dennis), Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; (with Bruce Johnston), David Lee Roth&#x27;s hit cover of &quot;California Girls&quot;, Warren Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Desperados Under the Eaves&quot;, and the Carnie/Wendy Wilson holiday track &quot;Hey Santa!&quot; Carl also recorded a duet with Olivia Newton-John, titled &quot;You Were Great, How Was I?&quot;, for her studio album, &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; (1985). It was not released as a single.

Carl befriended and gave guitar lessons to Alex Chilton when The Box Tops toured with the Beach Boys.

===Solo career===
By the early 1980s, the Beach Boys were in disarray; the band had split into camps. Frustrated with the band&#x27;s sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse, Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981. He quickly recorded and released a solo album, &quot;Carl Wilson&quot;, composed largely of rock n&#x27; roll songs co-written with Myrna Smith-Schilling, a former backing vocalist for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, and wife of Wilson&#x27;s then-manager Jerry Schilling. The album briefly charted, and its second single, &quot;Heaven&quot;, reached the top 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson also undertook a solo tour to promote the album, becoming the first member of the Beach Boys to break ranks. Initially, Wilson and his band played clubs like The Bottom Line in New York City and the Roxy in Los Angeles. Thereafter, he joined the Doobie Brothers as the opening act for their 1981 summer tour.

Wilson recorded a second solo album, &quot;Youngblood&quot;, in a similar vein, but by the time of its release in 1983 he had rejoined the Beach Boys. Although &quot;Youngblood&quot; did not chart, a single, the John Hall-penned &quot;What You Do To Me&quot;, peaked at number 72, making Wilson the second Beach Boy to land a solo single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Additionally, the song cracked the top 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson frequently performed that song and &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; (from the same album), as well as &quot;Heaven&quot; from the 1981 album, at Beach Boys&#x27; concerts in the 1980s. &quot;Heaven&quot; was always announced as a tribute to brother Dennis, who drowned in December 1983.

===Later years===

The Beach Boys&#x27; 1985 eponymous album prominently featured Wilson&#x27;s lead vocals and songwriting, highlighted by his &quot;It&#x27;s Gettin&#x27; Late&quot; (another top 20 Adult Contemporary hit) and the &quot;Heaven&quot;-like &quot;Where I Belong&quot;.

In 1988, the Beach Boys scored their biggest chart success in more than 20 years with the US Number 1 song &quot;Kokomo&quot;, co-written by Mike Love, John Phillips, Scott McKenzie, and Terry Melcher, on which Carl sang lead in the chorus. After this, Love increasingly dominated the band&#x27;s recorded output and became the driving force behind the album &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot; (1992), the first and only Beach Boys album with no input from Brian in any form. In 1992, Carl told Michael Feeney Callan his hope was to record new material by Brian. &quot;Speaking for myself&quot;, he told Callan, &quot;I only want to record inspired music&quot;.

Carl continued recording through the 1990s and participated in the Don Was-led recordings of Brian&#x27;s &quot;Soul Searchin and &quot;You&#x27;re Still a Mystery&quot;, songs conceived as the basis of a canceled Brian Wilson/Beach Boys album. He also recorded the album &quot;Like a Brother&quot; with Robert Lamm and Gerry Beckley, while continuing to tour with the Beach Boys until the last months of his life.

===Death===
Wilson became ill at his vacation home in Hawaii in early 1997. He was diagnosed with lung cancer, and was started on chemotherapy. He had been smoking cigarettes since his early teens. Despite his illness and treatments, he continued to play and sing with the Beach Boys throughout their entire summer tour until its completion in the autumn of 1997.

Wilson died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, surrounded by his family, on February 6, 1998. His death occurred just two months after the death of his mother, Audree Wilson. He was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Posthumous releases==
The Beckley–Lamm–Wilson album, &quot;Like a Brother&quot;, was finally released in 2000, and Carl&#x27;s late recordings continue to appear. Brian&#x27;s album &quot;Gettin&#x27; in Over My Head&quot; (2004) features Carl&#x27;s vocal from the unreleased Beach Boys song &quot;Soul Searchin&#x27;&quot;, with new backing vocals recorded by Brian. The original Beach Boys version, sourced from a canceled attempt at a new Beach Boys album in late 1995, was eventually released in the &quot;Made in California&quot; (2013) box set, along with another 1995 track titled &quot;You&#x27;re Still a Mystery&quot;, which features Carl in the vocal blend. In 2010, bandmate Al Jardine released his first solo album, &quot;A Postcard From California&quot;, which includes a similarly reconstructed track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight The Sea&quot;, featuring one of the last vocals Carl recorded. Carl can also be heard on the continual stream of Beach Boys archival releases, most notably as a central voice in the November 2011 release of &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;.

It was announced that Wilson&#x27;s voice would be heard on a track from the reunited Beach Boys, on the album &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; (2012), but this never materialized. Instead, the scheduled song, &quot;Waves of Love&quot;, featured on the 2012 re-release of Jardine&#x27;s &quot;A Postcard from California&quot;. During The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour, a segment of the show was dedicated to the memories of Dennis and Carl. The band harmonized with isolated vocal tracks of Carl performing &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and of Dennis singing &quot;Forever&quot;, as the band&#x27;s crew projected images of the individual Wilson brothers on a large screen behind the band onstage.

==Personal life and beliefs==
Wilson declared himself a conscientious objector and refused the draft to join the American military during the Vietnam War. By 1988, Wilson had become an ordained minister in the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.

Wilson was married twice: first to Annie Hinsche, sister of frequent Beach Boys sideman Billy Hinsche, then in 1987 to Dean Martin&#x27;s daughter Gina (born December 20, 1956). With Annie, he had two sons. It was during the breakup of his and Annie&#x27;s marriage that Carl wrote &quot;Angel Come Home&quot;, which, according to co-writer Geoffrey Cushing-Murray, was about Wilson&#x27;s grief over separating from his wife during the incessant touring of the Beach Boys. Gina accompanied him during all subsequent tours and the marriage lasted until his death.

Wilson had an Irish Setter named Shannon, whose death inspired the emotional 1976 hit song &quot;Shannon&quot; by Henry Gross.

<text>Karl Hans Albrecht (; 20 February 1920 – 16 July 2014) was a German entrepreneur who founded the discount supermarket chain Aldi with his brother Theo. He was the richest person in Germany for many years. In February 2014, he was ranked the 21st-richest person in the world by Hurun Report.

== Biography ==

Karl and Theo Albrecht were born and raised in a Catholic family in modest circumstances in Essen, Germany. Their father, Karl Sr., worked as a miner and later as a baker&#x27;s assistant, while their mother Anna (née Siepmann) ran a small grocery store in the workers&#x27; quarter of , a suburb of Essen. Theo completed an apprenticeship in his mother&#x27;s store, while Karl worked in a delicatessen shop. Karl served in the Wehrmacht during World War II and was wounded on the Eastern Front. After the war, the brothers jointly took over their mother&#x27;s business and founded Albrecht KG.

In 1960, the brothers faced a disagreement over whether to stock cigarettes in their stores. While Theo advocated for selling cigarettes, Karl expressed concerns that they would attract shoplifters. As a result, they decided to divide their stores into two parts: Theo retained all stores north of the Ruhr, while Karl retained those south of the Ruhr. This division led to the opening of the first Aldi (short for Albrecht Discount) in 1962, and the two groups became known as Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd, respectively.
In 1994, Karl Albrecht removed himself from the daily operations of Aldi Süd and took the position of chairman of the board until 2002. At the beginning of 2002, he also relinquished this position, thereby completely ceding control of the firm. As of 2010s, the business is no longer run by any of Karl Albrecht&#x27;s family members.

===Personal life===
Karl Albrecht was a very reclusive man who had not taken part in public life for several years prior to his death. As a result, little is known about him. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that he had two children, neither of whom was employed by Aldi. He reportedly lived in Essen, as did his brother Theo until the latter&#x27;s death. Golf was one of his hobbies, and Albrecht played the sport on his own golf course, the Öschberghof, which he built in 1976. He also raised orchids.

== Fortune ==

In 2014, Albrecht was listed as one of the richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of . &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed him as the third richest man in the world in 2004. In 2012, with an estimated net worth in 2011 of , the magazine ranked him tenth on its list of billionaires – making him the oldest billionaire in the Top 20 list. Upon his death, Albrecht was named the richest person in Germany, and the fourth-richest in Europe.

<doc id="608129" wikidata="Q3298857" url="?curid=608129" title="Polzeath">
<text>Polzeath (; , meaning &quot;dry creek&quot;) is a small seaside resort village in the civil parish of St Minver in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is approximately north west of Wadebridge on the Atlantic coast.

Polzeath has a sandy beach and is popular with holiday-makers and surfers. The beach is wide and extends from the seafront at low water; however, most of the sand is submerged at high water. At exceptionally high spring tides the sea floods the car park at the top of the beach.

Polzeath beach is patrolled by lifeguards during the summer and is described on the RNLI website as &quot;a wide, flat beach with some shelter from winds, it sees good quality surf and is quite often extremely crowded&quot;.

Dolphins may sometimes be spotted in the bay and the coastline north of Polzeath is a good area for seeing many types of birds, particularly on migration but also including occasional puffins nesting on the offshore islands.

The main street runs along the seafront and has a parade of shops catering for holidaymakers and residents. There are pubs, cafés, restaurants, a caravan site and several camping sites in the immediate area. The road rises up steep hills at both ends of the seafront, towards the village of Trebetherick to the southwest and New Polzeath to the northeast.

The South West Coast Path runs from Daymer Bay in the South through Polzeath and up to Pentire Head in the North.

==Geography==
The catchment surrounding Polzeath is approximately 40,900 hectares and is drained by several streams. The Polzeath Brook stream rises near St Minver to the east, and with several tributaries drains farmland before flowing through the middle of the Valley Caravan Park campsite and into the sea across Polzeath beach. The Trenant Stream is 900m long and also crosses the beach, this time entering from the north-east corner. There is also a small stream 1.5 kilometres long, which flows onto Pentireglaze beach (also known as &quot;Baby Bay&quot;) which is at the northern end of Polzeath beach but is separated from it at high tide by Slipper Point.

Shilla Mill at the edge of Polzeath, stands at the confluence of the streams. Built around 1590, it ceased working as a mill in 1885 and was converted into a house.

==History==
In 1911 a Methodist chapel was built on the road towards Trebetherick at Chapel Corner. The original building was demolished in 1932 when the village street was widened and a new chapel was opened on 15 April 1933. Since 2006 the chapel has been called the Tubestation and is an active church with services every Sunday. The rest of the week it is a surfers cafe.

Until 1934 the main street through the village crossed the stream by means of a ford and a footbridge was provided for pedestrians although this was sometimes washed away by winter storms. For vehicles the road surface stopped short of the ford and cars splashed through the water on a sandy area occasionally causing vehicles to become stuck in the sand. In 1934 the current road bridge was built with a low wall separating the road from the sandy beach.

During World War II the beach would, alongside other beaches in Cornwall, have barbed wire on it in preparation for a German naval invasion.

The winter storms of 2014 changed the topography of the beach creating a sand bar up to 1m high located at approximately the high tide mark, a feature that was not previously recorded. This was gradually washed away so that by 2019 the beach had returned to the even slope visible in pictures up to 2014.

==Economy==
Tourism developed in the 19th and 20th centuries to be the most significant part of the local economy. UK prime minister David Cameron and his wife holidayed there between 2010 and 2015. The beach is a favourite destination for wealthy teenagers from independent schools who often engage in anti-social behaviour. In July 2022, police imposed a two-day 10pm curfew after drunken late-night beach parties of around 200 teenagers consistently got out of hand. Residents found broken prosecco bottles littering the beach, bonfires on the beach that were made from benches, fences and shed doors stolen from local houses and emergency life-saving equipment was vandalised. Local resident Andy Stewart, a former police officer, said the teenagers were often children of million-pound second home owners in the nearby village of Rock. He said, “They don’t realise there is excessive drinking, cocaine, nitrous oxide, underage sex and big fires.” Stewart has refused to identify the schools where many of the teenagers study, though he has been in contact with their senior staff. In 2023 a CCTV camera system was installed to watch the beach, along with rechargeable floodlights.

Bathing water quality is measured at Polzeath by the Environment Agency with measurements being taken between May and September each year. The quality was rated as &quot;excellent&quot; in 2020 based on measurements taken between 2016 and 2019.

==Literary associations==

Polzeath was a favourite haunt of the poet laureate, Sir John Betjeman, and is celebrated in some of his verse. Another poet, Laurence Binyon, wrote the Remembrance Day ode &quot;&quot; in 1914 while sitting on Pentire Head, Polzeath (or &quot;Polseath&quot; as it was called), during World War I.

In the first of Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Famous Five&quot; novels, the eponymous children express disappointment that their holiday will not be spent at Polzeath as usual.

The cartoonist Posy Simmonds created a fictitious place in Cornwall called &quot;Tresoddit&quot;. When the BBC made the short film &quot;Tresoddit for Easter&quot; in 1991, it was filmed in and around Polzeath.

The BBC adaptation of Winston Graham&#x27;s Poldark series of books filmed some scenes at Pentireglaze. In his book &quot;Poldark&#x27;s Cornwall&quot; Graham described this as &quot;an area which could hardly have changed in a century&quot;.

<doc id="608135" wikidata="Q1853321" url="?curid=608135" title="Dutch-language literature">
<text>Dutch-language literature () comprises all writings of literary merit written through the ages in the Dutch language, a language which currently has around 23 million native speakers. Dutch-language literature is the product of the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, the Netherlands Antilles and of formerly Dutch-speaking regions, such as French Flanders, South Africa, and Indonesia. The Dutch East Indies, as Indonesia was called under Dutch colonization, spawned a separate subsection in Dutch-language literature. Conversely, Dutch-language literature sometimes was and is produced by people originally from abroad who came to live in Dutch-speaking regions, such as Anne Frank and Kader Abdolah. In its earliest stages, Dutch-language literature is defined as those pieces of literary merit written in one of the Dutch dialects of the Low Countries. Before the 17th century, there was no unified standard language; the dialects that are considered Dutch evolved from Old Frankish. A separate Afrikaans literature started to emerge during the 19th century, and it shares the same literary roots as contemporary Dutch, as Afrikaans evolved from 17th-century Dutch. The term Dutch literature may either indicate in a narrow sense literature from the Netherlands, or alternatively Dutch-language literature (as it is understood in this article).

Until the end of the 11th century, Dutch literature, like literature elsewhere in Europe, was almost entirely oral and in the form of poetry. In the 12th and 13th century, writers starting writing chivalric romances and hagiographies for noblemen. From the 13th century, literature became more didactic and developed a proto-national character, as it was written for the bourgeoisie. With the close of the 13th century a change appeared in Dutch literature. The Flemish and Hollandic towns began to prosper and a new sort of literary expression began. Around 1440, literary guilds called &quot;rederijkerskamers&quot; (&quot;Chambers of Rhetoric&quot;) arose which were usually middle-class in tone. Of these chambers, the earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle plays for the people. Anna Bijns (c. 1494–1575) is an important figure who wrote in modern Dutch. The Reformation appeared in Dutch literature in a collection of Psalm translations in 1540 and in a 1566 New Testament translation in Dutch. The greatest of all Dutch writers is widely considered to be the playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679).

During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Low Countries had gone through major political upheaval. The most prominent writers were Willem Bilderdijk (1756–1831), Hiëronymus van Alphen (1746–1803), and Rhijnvis Feith (1753–1824). Piet Paaltjens (ps. of François Haverschmidt, 1835–1894) represents in Dutch the Romantic vein exemplified by Heine. A new movement called &quot;Tachtigers&quot; or &quot;Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty&quot;, after the decade in which it arose. One of the most important historical writers of the 20th century was Johan Huizinga, who is known abroad and translated in different languages and included in several great books lists. During the 1920s, a new group of writers who distanced themselves from the ornate style of the Movement of 1880 arose, led by Nescio (J.H.F. Grönloh, 1882–1961). During WW II, influential writers included Anne Frank (whose diary was published posthumously) died in a German concentration camp, as did crime fiction writer, journalist and poet Jan Campert. Writers who had lived through the atrocities of the Second World War reflected in their works on the changed perception of reality. Obviously many looked back on their experiences the way Anne Frank had done in her Diary, this was the case with &quot;Het bittere kruid&quot; (The bitter herb) of Marga Minco, and &quot;Kinderjaren&quot; (Childhood) of Jona Oberski. The renewal, which in literary history would be described as &quot;ontluisterend realisme&quot; (shocking realism), is mainly associated with three authors: Gerard Reve, W.F. Hermans and Anna Blaman. Reve and Hermans are often cited together with Harry Mulisch as the &quot;Big Three&quot; of Dutch postwar literature.

==Old Dutch texts (500–1150)==

Around 500 AD, Old Frankish evolved to Old Dutch, a West Germanic language that was spoken by the Franks and to a lesser extent by people living in the regions conquered by the Franks. Until the end of the 11th century, Dutch literature - like literature elsewhere in Europe - was almost entirely oral and in the form of poetry, as this helped troubadours remembering and reciting their texts. Scientific and religious texts were written in Latin and as a consequence most texts written in the Netherlands were written in Latin rather than Old Dutch. Extant Dutch texts from this period are rare.

In the earliest stages of the Dutch language, a considerable degree of mutual intelligibility with most other West Germanic dialects was present, and some fragments and authors can be claimed by both Dutch and German literature. Examples include the 10th-century &quot;Wachtendonck Psalms&quot;, a West Low Franconian translation of some of the Psalms on the threshold of what is considered Dutch, and the 12th-century County of Loon poet Henric van Veldeke (1150 – after 1184).

===The Leiden Willeram===
The &quot;Leiden Willeram&quot; is the name given to a manuscript containing a Low Franconian version of the Old High German commentary on Song of Solomon by the German abbot Williram of Ebersberg (ultimately by Isidore of Seville). Until recently, based on its orthography and phonology the text of this manuscript was believed by most scholars to be Middle Franconian, that is Old High German, with some Limburgic or otherwise Franconian admixtures. But in 1974, the German philologist Willy Sanders proved in his study &quot;Der Leidener Willeram&quot; that the text actually represents an imperfect attempt by a scribe from the northwestern coastal area of the Low Countries to translate the East Franconian original into his local vernacular. The text contains many Old Dutch words not known in Old High German, as well as mistranslated words caused by the scribe&#x27;s unfamiliarity with some Old High German words in the original he translated, and a confused orthography heavily influenced by the Old High German original. For instance, the grapheme &lt;z&gt; is used after the High German tradition where it represents Germanic &quot;t&quot; shifted to . Sanders also proved that the manuscript, now in the University Library of Leiden University, was written at the end of the 11th century in the Abbey of Egmond in modern North Holland, whence the manuscript&#x27;s other name &quot;Egmond Willeram&quot;.

===Hebban olla vogala===
The oldest known poetry was written by a West-Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England, around 1100: &quot;hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu wat unbidan we nu&quot; (&quot;All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for&quot;). According to professor Luc de Grauwe the text could equally well be Old English, more specifically Old Kentish, though there is no consensus on this hypothesis. At that time, Old (West) Dutch and Old English were very similar.

===The Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible===
Another important source for Old Dutch is the so-called Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible (Dutch: &quot;Rijnlandse Rijmbijbel&quot; and German: &quot;Rheinische Reimbibel&quot;). This is a verse translation of biblical histories, attested only in a series of fragments, which was composed in a mixed dialect containing Low German, Old Dutch and High German (Rhine-Franconian) elements. It was likely composed in north-west Germany in the early 12th century, possibly in Werden Abbey, near Essen.

==Middle Dutch literature (1150–1500)==
In the 12th and 13th century, writers starting writing chivalric romances and hagiographies (i.e. stories about the lives of saints) for paying noblemen. From the 13th century, literature became more didactic and developed a proto-national character. The primary audience was no longer the nobility, but the bourgeoisie. The growing importance of the Southern Low Countries resulted in most works being written in Brabant, Flanders and Limburg.

In the first stages of Dutch literature, poetry was the predominant form of literary expression. It was both in the Low Countries and the rest of Europe that courtly romance and poetry were popular literary genres during the Middle Ages. One &quot;Minnesanger&quot; was the aforementioned Van Veldeke, the first Dutch-language writer known by name, who also wrote epic poetry and hagiographies. The chivalric romance was a popular genre as well, often featuring King Arthur or Charlemagne as protagonist.

As the political and cultural emphasis at the time lay in the southern provinces, most of the works handed down from the early Middle Ages were written in southern Low Franconian dialects such as Limburgish, Flemish and Brabantic. The first Dutch language writer known by name is Van Veldeke, who wrote courtly love poetry, and epics.

Beatrice of Nazareth (1200–1268) was the first known prose writer in the Dutch language, the author of the &quot;Seven Ways of Holy Love&quot;. The Brussels friar Jan van Ruusbroec (better known in English as the Blessed John of Ruysbroeck, 1293/4–1381) followed Beatrice in taking prose out of the economic and political realms and using it for literary purposes. He wrote sermons filled with mystic thought.

A number of the surviving Dutch language epic works, especially the courtly romances, were copies from or expansions of earlier German or French efforts, but there are examples of truly original works (such as the anonymous &quot;Karel ende Elegast&quot;) and even Dutch-language works that formed the basis for version in other languages (such as the morality play &quot;Elckerlijc&quot; that formed the basis for &quot;Everyman&quot;). Another genre popular in the Middle Ages was the fable, and the most elaborate fable produced by Dutch literature was an expanded adaptation of the Reynard the Fox tale, &quot;Vanden vos Reynaerde&quot; (&quot;Of Reynard the Fox&quot;), written around 1250 by a person only identified as Willem.

Until the 13th century, the Middle Dutch language output mainly serviced the aristocratic and monastic orders, recording the traditions of chivalry and of religion, but scarcely addressed the bulk of the population. With the close of the 13th century a change appeared in Dutch literature. The Flemish and Hollandic towns began to prosper and to assert their commercial supremacy over the North Sea, and these cities won privileges amounting almost to political independence. With this liberty there arose a new sort of literary expression.

The most important exponent of this new development was Jacob van Maerlant (~1235–~1300), a Flemish scholar who worked in Holland for part of his career. His key works are &quot;Der Naturen Bloeme&quot; (&quot;The Flower of Nature&quot;, c. 1263), a collection of moral and satirical addresses to all classes of society, and &quot;De Spieghel Historiael&quot; (&quot;The Mirror of History&quot;, c. 1284). Jacob van Maerlant straddles the cultural divide between the northern and southern provinces. Up until now, the northern provinces had produced little of worth, and this would largely remain the case until the fall of Antwerp during the Eighty Years&#x27; War shifted focus to Amsterdam. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;father of Dutch poetry&quot;, &quot;a title he merits for productivity if for no other reason.&quot;

Around 1440, literary guilds called &quot;rederijkerskamers&quot; (&quot;Chambers of Rhetoric&quot;) arose. These guilds, whose members called themselves &quot;Rederijkers&quot; or &quot;Rhetoricians&quot;, were in almost all cases middle-class in tone, and opposed to aristocratic ideas and tendencies in thought. Of these chambers, the earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle plays for the people. Soon their influence grew until no festival or procession could take place in a town unless the Chamber patronized it. The Chambers&#x27; plays very rarely dealt with historical or even Biblical personages, but entirely with allegorical and moral abstractions and were didactic in nature. The most notable examples of Rederijker theatre include &quot;Mariken van Nieumeghen&quot; (&quot;Mary of Nijmegen&quot;) and &quot;Elckerlijc&quot; (which was translated into English as &quot;Everyman&quot;).

At the close of the early period, Anna Bijns (c. 1494–1575) stands as a transitional figure. Bijns was an Antwerp schoolmistress and lay nun whose main targets were the faith and character of Luther. In her first volume of poetry (1528) the Lutherans are scarcely mentioned and focus lies on her personal experience of faith, but in that of 1538 one finds sharp words for the Lutherans on every page. With the writings of Bijns, the period of Middle Dutch closes and the modern Dutch begins (see also History of the Dutch language).

==Renaissance and the Golden Age (1550–1670)==
The first ripples of the Reformation appeared in Dutch literature in a collection of Psalm translations printed at Antwerp in 1540 under the title of &quot;Souter-Liedekens&quot; (&quot;Psalter Songs&quot;). For the Protestant , Jan Utenhove printed a volume of Psalms in 1566 and made the first attempt at a New Testament translation in Dutch. Very different in tone were the battle songs sung by the Reformers, the Gueux songs. The famous songbook of 1588, &quot;Een Geusen Lied Boecxken&quot; (&quot;A Gueux Songbook&quot;), was full of heroic sentiment.

Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde (1538–1598) was one of the leading spirits in the war of Dutch independence and an intimate friend of William I, Prince of Orange. The lyrics to &quot;Wilhelmus van Nassouwe&quot;, the current Dutch national anthem and an apology of the Prince&#x27;s actions composed around 1568, are ascribed to Marnix. His chief work was 1569&#x27;s &quot;Biëncorf der Heilige Roomsche Kercke&quot; (Beehive of the Holy Roman Church), a satire of the Roman Catholic church. Marnix occupied the last years of his life in preparing a Dutch version of the Bible, translated directly from the original; at his death only Genesis was completed. In 1619 the Synod of Dort placed the unfinished work in the hands of four theologians, who completed it. This translation formed the starting point for the &quot;Statenvertaling&quot; or &quot;States&#x27; Translation&quot;, a full Bible translation into Dutch ordered by the Synod. In order to be intelligible to all Dutchmen, the Statenvertaling included elements of all main Dutch dialects and so became the cornerstone of modern standard Dutch.

Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert (1522–1590) was the Low Countries&#x27; first truly humanist writer. In 1586 he produced his original masterpiece, the &quot;Zedekunst&quot; (&quot;Art of Ethics&quot;), a philosophical treatise in prose. Coornhert&#x27;s humanism unites the Bible, Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius in one grand system of ethics.

By this time, the religious and political upheaval in the Low Countries had resulted in the 1581 Act of Abjuration, deposing their king, Philip II of Spain and the subsequent eighty years&#x27; struggle to confirm that declaration. As a result, the southern provinces, some of which had supported the declaration, were separated from the northern provinces as they remained under Spanish rule. Ultimately, this would result in the present-day states of Belgium (south) and the Netherlands (north). After Antwerp had fallen into Spanish hands in 1585, Amsterdam became the centre of all literary enterprise as all intelligentsia fled towards the north. This meant both a cultural renaissance in the north and a sharp decline in the south at the same time, regarding the level of Dutch literature practised. The north received a cultural and intellectual boost whereas in the south, Dutch was largely replaced by French as the language of culture and administration.

In Amsterdam, a circle of poets and playwrights formed around Maecenas-like figure Roemer Visscher (1547–1620), which would eventually be known as the Muiderkring (&quot;Circle of Muiden&quot;) after the residence of its most prominent member, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (1581–1647), writer of pastoral and lyric poetry and history. From 1628 to 1642 he wrote his masterpiece, the &quot;Nederduytsche Historiën&quot; (&quot;History of the Netherlands&quot;). Hooft was a purist in style, modelling himself (in prose) after Tacitus. He is considered one of the greatest historians, not merely of the Low Countries, but of Europe. His influence in standardising the language of his country is considered enormous, as many writers conformed themselves to the stylistic and grammatical model Hooft devised. Other members of his Circle included Visscher&#x27;s daughter Tesselschade (1594–1649, lyric poetry) and Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero (1585–1618, romantic plays and comedies), whose best-known piece is &quot;De Spaansche Brabanber Jerolimo&quot; (&quot;Jerolimo, the Spanish Brabanter&quot;), a satire upon the refugees from the south. A versatile poet loosely associated with the Circle of Muiden was the diplomat Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687), perhaps best known for his witty epigrams. Huygens&#x27; style was bright and vivacious and he was a consummate artist in metrical form.

The greatest of all Dutch writers is widely considered to be the playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), who mainly wrote historical and biblical tragedies. In 1625 he published what seemed an innocent study from the antique, his tragedy of &quot;Palamedes, or Murdered Innocence&quot;, but which was a thinly veiled tribute to Johan van Oldebarnevelt, the Republic&#x27;s Grand Pensionary, who had been executed in 1618 by order of stadtholder Maurice of Nassau. Vondel became in a week the most famous writer in the Netherlands and for the next twelve years, until the accession of stadtholder Frederick Henry, had to maintain a hand-to-hand combat with the Calvinists of Dordrecht. In 1637 Vondel wrote of his most popular works on the occasion of the opening of a new Amsterdam theatre: &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot;, a play on a local historical figure loosely modeled on material from the &quot;Aeneid&quot; that is still staged to this day. In 1654 Vondel brought out what most consider the best of all his works, the tragedy of &quot;Lucifer&quot;, from which it is said Milton drew inspiration. Vondel is considered the typical example of Dutch creativity and imagination at their highest development.

A similar school to that in Amsterdam arose in Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland, led by Jacob Cats (1577–1660). In Cats the genuine Dutch habit of thought, the utilitarian and didactic spirit reached its zenith of fluency and popularity. During early middle life he produced the most important of his writings, his didactic poems, the &quot;Maechdenplicht&quot; (&quot;Duty of Maidens&quot;) and the &quot;Sinne- en Minnebeelden&quot; (&quot;Images of Allegory and Love&quot;). In 1624 he moved from Middelburg to Dordrecht, where he soon after published his ethical work called &quot;Houwelick&quot; (&quot;Marriage&quot;); and this was followed by an entire series of moral pieces. Cats is considered somewhat dull and prosaic by some, yet his popularity with the middle classes in the Netherlands has always been immense.

As with contemporary English literature, the predominant forms of literature produced in this era were poetry and drama, Coornhert (philosophy) and Hooft (history) being the main exceptions. In another prose genre, Johan van Heemskerk (1597–1656) was the leading man of a new vogue blown over from France: the romance. In 1637 he produced his &quot;Batavische Arcadia&quot; (&quot;Batavian Arcadia&quot;), the first original Dutch romance, in its day extremely popular and widely imitated. Another exponent of this genre was Nikolaes Heinsius the Younger, whose &quot;Mirandor&quot; (1695) resembles but precedes Lesage&#x27;s &quot;Gil Blas&quot;.

The period from 1600 to 1650 was the blossoming time in Dutch literature. During this period the names of greatest genius were first made known to the public and the vigour and grace of literary expression reached their highest development. It happened, however, that three men of particularly commanding talent survived to an extreme old age, and under the shadow of Vondel, Cats and Huygens sprang up a new generation which sustained the great tradition until around 1670, when decline set in sharply.

==1670–1795==
After the great division of the Low Countries into the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands formalised in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), &quot;Dutch literature&quot; almost exclusively meant &quot;Republican literature&quot;, as the Dutch language fell into disfavour with the southern rulers. A notable exception was the Dunkirk writer Michiel de Swaen (1654–1707), who wrote comedies, moralities and biblical poetry. During his lifetime (1678) the Spanish lost Dunkirk to the French and so De Swaen is also the first French-Flemish writer of importance.

The playwrights of the time followed the French model of Corneille and others, led by Andries Pels (d. 1681). A well-known poet of this period was Jan Luyken (1649–1712). A writer who revived especially an interest in literature was Justus van Effen (1684–1735). He was born at Utrecht and was influenced by Huguenot émigrés who had fled for the Republic after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Van Effen wrote in French for a great part of his literary career but, influenced by a visit to London where the &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; were on the rise, from 1731 began to publish his &quot;Hollandsche Spectator&quot; (&quot;Dutch Spectator&quot;) magazine, which his death in 1735 soon brought to a close. Still, what he composed during the last four years of his life is considered by many to constitute the most valuable legacy to Dutch literature that the middle of the 18th century left behind.

The year 1777 is considered a turning point in the history of letters in the Netherlands. It was in that year that Elizabeth “Betje” Wolff (1738–1804), a widow lady in Amsterdam, persuaded her friend Agatha “Aagje” Deken (1741–1804), a poor but intelligent governess, to throw up her situation and live with her. For nearly thirty years these women continued together, writing in combination. In 1782 the ladies, inspired partly by Goethe, published their first novel, &quot;Sara Burgerhart&quot;, which was enthusiastically received. Two further, less successful novels appeared before Wolff and Deken had to flee France, their country of residence, due to persecution by the Directory.

The last years of the 18th century were marked by a general revival of intellectual force. The romantic movement in Germany made itself deeply felt in all branches of Dutch literature and German lyricism took the place hitherto held by French classicism, in spite of the country falling to French expansionism (see also History of the Netherlands).

==The 19th century==
During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Low Countries had gone through major political upheaval. The Spanish Netherlands had first become the Austrian Netherlands before being annexed by France in 1795. The Republic saw a revolution inspired and backed by France that led to the Batavian Republic and Kingdom of Holland vassal states before actual French annexation in 1810. After Napoleon&#x27;s downfall in the Southern Netherlands village of Waterloo, the northern and southern provinces were briefly united as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This period lasted until 1830 only, when the southern provinces seceded to form Belgium. It had little influence in literature, and in the new state of Belgium, the status of the Dutch language remained largely unchanged as all governmental and educational affairs were conducted in French.

Against this backdrop, the most prominent writer was Willem Bilderdijk (1756–1831), a highly intellectual and intelligent but also eccentric man who lived a busy, eventful life, writing great quantities of verse. Bilderdijk had no time for the emerging new romantic style of poetry, but its fervour found its way into the Netherlands nevertheless, first of all in the person of Hiëronymus van Alphen (1746–1803), who today is best remembered for the verses he wrote for children. Van Alphen was an exponent of the more sentimental school along with Rhijnvis Feith (1753–1824), whose romances are steeped in Weltschmerz.

In Hendrik Tollens (1780–1856) some the power of Bilderdijk and the sweetness of Feith were combined. Tollens wrote nationalistic romances and lyrics celebrating the great deeds of Dutch history and today is best known for his poem &quot;Wien Neêrlands Bloed&quot; (&quot;To Those in Whom Dutch Blood Flows&quot;), which was the Dutch national anthem until it was superseded in 1932 by Marnix&#x27; &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. A poet of considerable talent, whose powers were awakened by personal intercourse with Tollens and his followers, was A. C. W. Staring (1767–1840). His poems are a blend of romanticism and rationalism.

The Dutch language of the north resisted the pressure of German from the outside and from within broke through its long stagnation and enriched itself, as a medium for literary expression, with a multitude of fresh and colloquial forms. At the same time, no very great genius arose in the Netherlands in any branch of literature. For the thirty or forty years preceding 1880 the course of literature in the Netherlands was smooth and even sluggish. The Dutch writers had slipped into a conventionality of treatment and a strict limitation of form from which even the most striking talents among them could scarcely escape.

Poetry and a large part of prose was dominated by the so-called school of ministers, as the leading writers all were or had been Calvinist ministers. As a result, many of their products emphasized Biblical and bourgeois domestic values. A prime example is Nicolaas Beets (1814–1903), who wrote large quantities of sermons and poetry under his own name but is chiefly remembered today for the humorous prose sketches of Dutch life in &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; (1839), which he wrote during his student days under the pseudonym of Hildebrand.

A poet of power and promise was lost in the early death of P.A. de Genestet (1829–1861). His narrative poem &quot;De Sint-Nicolaasavond&quot; (&quot;Eve of Sinterklaas&quot;) appeared in 1849. Although he left no large contemporary impression, Piet Paaltjens (ps. of François Haverschmidt, 1835–1894) is considered one of the very few readable nineteenth-century poets, representing in Dutch the pure Romantic vein exemplified by Heine.

Under the influence of romantic nationalism, writers in Belgium began to reconsider their Flemish heritage and move for a recognition of the Dutch language. Charles De Coster laid the foundations for a native Belgian literature by recounting the Flemish past in historic romances but wrote his works in French. Hendrik Conscience (1812–1883) was the first to write about Flemish subjects in the Dutch language and so is considered the father of modern Flemish literature. In Flemish poetry, Guido Gezelle (1830–1899) is an important figure. An ordained journalist-cum-ethnologist, Gezelle celebrated his faith and his Flemish roots using an archaic vocabulary based on Medieval Flemish, somewhat to the detriment of readability. See also the article on Flemish literature.

After the restoration in 1815 to the Dutch state of the Dutch East Indies, works of literature continued to be produced there. With the rise of social consciousness regarding the administration of the colonies and the treatment of their inhabitants, an influential voice rose from the Indies in the form of Multatuli (ps. of Eduard Douwes Dekker, 1820–1887), whose &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; (1860) is a scathing indictment of colonial mismanagement and one of the few nineteenth-century prose works still widely considered readable today.

The principles of the 1830–1880 period were summed up in Conrad Busken-Huet (1826–1886), leading critic of the day; he had been during all those years the fearless and trusty watch-dog of Dutch letters as he understood them. He lived just long enough to become aware that a revolution was approaching, not to comprehend its character; but his accomplished fidelity to literary principle and his wide knowledge have been honoured even by the most bitter of the younger school.

In November 1881 Jacques Perk (born 1860) died. He was no sooner dead, however, than his posthumous poems, and in particular a cycle of sonnets called &quot;Mathilde&quot;, were published (1882) and awakened extraordinary emotion. Perk had rejected all the formulas of rhetorical poetry, and had broken up the conventional rhythms. There had been heard no music like his in the Netherlands for two hundred years. A group of young men collected around his name and were joined by the poet-novelist-dramatist Marcellus Emants (1848–1923). Emants had written a symbolical poem called &quot;Lilith&quot; in 1879 that had been stigmatised as audacious and meaningless; encouraged by the admiration of his juniors, Emants published in 1881 a treatise in which the first open attack was made on the old school.

The next appearance was that of Willem Kloos (1857–1938), who had been the editor and intimate friend of Perk, and who now led the new movement. His violent attacks on recognized authority in aesthetics created a considerable scandal. For some time the new poets and critics found a great difficulty in being heard, but in 1884 they founded a review, &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot; (&quot;The New Guide&quot;), which was able to offer a direct challenge to the old guard&#x27;s periodicals. The new movement was called &quot;Tachtigers&quot; or &quot;Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty&quot;, after the decade in which it arose. The &quot;Tachtigers&quot; insisted that style must match content, and that intimate and visceral emotions can only be expressed using an intimate and visceral writing style. Prime influences of the &quot;Tachtigers&quot; were U.K. poets such as Shelley and the French naturalists.

Leading representatives of the &quot;Tachtigers&quot; are:
*Willem Kloos
*Albert Verwey
*Frederik van Eeden
*Marcellus Emants
*Lodewijk van Deyssel
*Herman Gorter

Around the same time, Louis Couperus (1863–1923) made his appearance. His boyhood years were spent in Java, and he had preserved in all his nature a certain tropical magnificence. His first literary efforts were lyrics in the &quot;Tachtigers&quot; style, but Couperus proved far more important and durable as a novelist. In 1891 he published &quot;Noodlot&quot;, which was translated into English as &quot;Footsteps of Fate&quot; and which was greatly admired by Oscar Wilde. Couperus continued to pour out one important novel after another until his death in 1923. Another talent for prose was revealed by Frederik van Eeden (1860–1932) in &quot;De kleine Johannes&quot; (&quot;Little Johnny&quot;, 1887) and in &quot;Van de koele meren des doods&quot; (&quot;From the Cold Pools of Death&quot;, 1901), a melancholy novel.

After 1887 the condition of modern Dutch literature remained comparatively stationary, and within the last decade of the 19th century was definitely declining. In 1889 a new poet, Herman Gorter (1864–1927) made his appearance with an epic poem called &quot;Mei&quot; (&quot;May&quot;), eccentric both in prosody and in treatment. He held his own without any marked advance towards lucidity or variety. Since the recognition of Gorter, however, no really remarkable talent made itself prominent in Dutch poetry except P.C. Boutens (1870–1943), whose &quot;Verzen&quot; (&quot;Verses&quot;) in 1898 were received with great respect.

Kloos collected his poems in 1894. The others, with the exception of Couperus, showed symptoms of sinking into silence. The entire school, now that the struggle for recognition was over, rested on its triumphs and soon limited itself to a repetition of its old experiments.

The leading dramatist at the close of the century was Herman Heijermans (1864–1924), a writer of strong realistic and socialistic tendencies who single-handedly brought Dutch theatre into the modern time. His fishermen&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Op Hoop van Zegen&quot; (&quot;Trusting Our Fate in the Hands of God&quot;), which is still staged, remains his most popular play.

==The 20th century==

In common with the rest of Europe, the Netherlands of the nineteenth century effectively remained unchanged until World War I (1914–1918). Belgium was invaded by the German Empire; the Netherlands faced severe economic difficulties owing to its policy of neutrality and consequent political isolation, wedged as it was between the two warring sides.

Both the Belgian and Dutch societies emerged from the war pillarised, meaning that each of the main religious and ideological movements (Protestant, Catholic, Socialist and Liberal) stood independent of the rest, each operating its own newspapers, magazines, schools, broadcasting organizations and so on in a form of self-imposed, non-racial segregation. This in turn affected literary movements, as writers gathered around the literary magazines of each of the four &quot;pillars&quot; (limited to three in Belgium, as Protestantism never took root there).

One of the most important historical writers of the 20th century was Johan Huizinga, who is known abroad and translated in different languages and included in several great books lists. His written works were influenced by the literary figures of the early 20th century.

===New Objectivity and the Forum Group (1925–1940)===
During the 1920s, a new group of writers who distanced themselves from the ornate style of the Movement of 1880 arose, claiming it to be too self-centered and distanced from real life. Their movement was called &quot;Nieuwe Zakelijkheid&quot;, or New Objectivity. An isolated forerunner is the figure of Nescio (J.H.F. Grönloh, 1882–1961), who published his few short stories in the 1910s. A prime example of New Objectivity is F. Bordewijk (1884–1965), whose short story &quot;Bint&quot; (1931) and terse writing epitomise the style.

An offshoot of the New Objectivity movement centered on the &quot;Forum&quot; magazine, which appeared in the years 1932–1935 and was edited by the leading Dutch literary critic Menno ter Braak (1902–1940) and the novelist Edgar du Perron (1899–1940). Writers associated at one point or other with this modernist magazine include Belgian writers Willem Elsschot and Marnix Gijsen and Dutch writers J. Slauerhoff, Simon Vestdijk and Jan Greshoff.

===Second World War and Occupation (1940–1945)===
The Second World War marked an abrupt change in the Dutch literary landscape. Casualties of the start of the German occupation included Du Perron (heart attack), Ter Braak (suicide) and Marsman (drowned while trying to escape to the United Kingdom); many other writers were forced into hiding or rounded up in Nazi concentration camps, such as Vestdijk. Many writers ceased publishing as a consequence of refusing to join the German-installed Kultuurkamer (Chamber of Culture), which intended to regulate cultural life in the Netherlands. Jewish-born writer Josef Cohen escaped prosecution by converting to Christianity; aspiring writer Anne Frank (whose diary was published posthumously) died in a German concentration camp, as did crime fiction writer, journalist and poet Jan Campert, who was arrested for aiding Jews and died in 1943 in Neuengamme. His poem &quot;De achttien dooden&quot; (&quot;The eighteen dead&quot;), written from the point of view of a captured resistance member awaiting his execution, has become the most famous example of war-related Dutch literature.

===Modern times (1945–present)===

Writers who had lived through the atrocities of the Second World War reflected in their works on the changed perception of reality. Obviously many looked back on their experiences the way Anne Frank had done in her Diary, this was the case with &quot;Het bittere kruid&quot; (The bitter herb) of Marga Minco, and &quot;Kinderjaren&quot; (Childhood) of Jona Oberski. The renewal, which in literary history would be described as &quot;ontluisterend realisme&quot; (shocking realism), is mainly associated with three authors: Gerard Reve, W.F. Hermans and Anna Blaman. Idealism seems to have disappeared from their prose, now marked by the description of raw reality, inhumanity, with great attention to physicality and sexuality. An obvious example is &quot;De Avonden&quot; (The evenings) of Gerard Reve, analysing the disillusionment of an adolescent during the &quot;wederopbouw&quot;, the period of rebuilding after the destruction of World War II. In Flanders, Louis Paul Boon and Hugo Claus were the main representatives of this new literary trend.

<text>The suprachiasmatic nucleus or nuclei (SCN) is a small region of the brain in the hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm. It is responsible for regulating sleep cycles in animals. Reception of light inputs from photosensitive retinal ganglion cells allow it to coordinate the subordinate cellular clocks of the body and entrain to the environment. The neuronal and hormonal activities it generates regulate many different body functions in an approximately 24-hour cycle.

The SCN also interacts with many other regions of the brain. It contains several cell types, neurotransmitters and peptides, including vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide.

Disruptions or damage to the SCN has been associated with different mood disorders and sleep disorders, suggesting the significance of the SCN in regulating circadian timing

==Neuroanatomy==
The SCN is situated in the anterior part of the hypothalamus immediately dorsal, or &quot;superior&quot; (hence supra) to the optic chiasm bilateral to (on either side of) the third ventricle. It consists of two nuclei composed of approximately 10,000 neurons.

The morphology of the SCN is species dependent. Distribution of different cell phenotypes across specific SCN regions, such as the concentration of VP-IR neurons, can cause the shape of the SCN to change.

The nucleus can be divided into ventrolateral and dorsolateral portions, also known as the core and shell, respectively. These regions differ in their expression of the clock genes, the core expresses them in response to stimuli whereas the shell expresses them constitutively.

In terms of projections, the core receives innervation via three main pathways, the retinohypothalamic tract, geniculohypothalamic tract, and projections from some raphe nuclei. The dorsomedial SCN is mainly innervated by the core and also by other hypothalamic areas. Lastly, its output is mainly to the subparaventricular zone and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus which both mediate the influence SCN exerts over circadian regulation of the body.

The most abundant peptides found within the SCN are arginine-vasopressin (AVP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and peptide histidine-isoleucine (PHI). Each of these peptides are localized in different regions. Neurons with AVP are found dorsomedially, whereas VIP-containing and PHI-containing neurons are found ventrolaterally.

==Circadian clock==

Different organisms such as bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, show genetically based near-24-hour rhythms. Although all of these clocks appear to be based on a similar type of genetic feedback loop, the specific genes involved are thought to have evolved independently in each kingdom. Many aspects of mammalian behavior and physiology show circadian rhythmicity, including sleep, physical activity, alertness, hormone levels, body temperature, immune function, and digestive activity. Early experiments on the function of the SCN involved lesioning the SCN in hamsters. SCN lesioned hamsters lost their daily activity rhythms. Further, when the SCN of a hamster was transplanted into an SCN lesioned hamster, the hamster adopted the rhythms of the hamster from which the SCN was transplanted. Together, these experiments suggest that the SCN is sufficient for generating circadian rhythms in hamsters.

Later studies have shown that skeletal, muscle, liver, and lung tissues in rats generate 24-hour rhythms, which dampen over time when isolated in a dish, where the SCN maintains its rhythms. Together, these data suggest a model whereby the SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators,&quot; which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.

The SCN receives input from specialized photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract. Neurons in the &quot;ventrolateral SCN&quot; (vlSCN) have the ability for light-induced gene expression. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in the retina have a direct connection to the ventrolateral SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract. When the retina receives light, the vlSCN relays this information throughout the SCN allowing &quot;entrainment&quot;, synchronization, of the person&#x27;s or animal&#x27;s daily rhythms to the 24-hour cycle in nature. The importance of entraining organisms, including humans, to exogenous cues such as the light/dark cycle, is reflected by several circadian rhythm sleep disorders, where this process does not function normally.

Neurons in the &quot;dorsomedial SCN&quot; (dmSCN) are believed to have an endogenous 24-hour rhythm that can persist under constant darkness (in humans averaging about 24 hours 11 min). A GABAergic mechanism is involved in the coupling of the ventral and dorsal regions of the SCN.

==Circadian rhythms of endothermic (warm-blooded) and ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates==
Information about the direct neuronal regulation of metabolic processes and circadian rhythm-controlled behaviors is not well known among either endothermic or ectothermic vertebrates, although extensive research has been done on the SCN in model animals such as the mammalian mouse and ectothermic reptiles, particularly lizards. The SCN is known to be involved not only in photoreception through innervation from the retinohypothalamic tract, but also in thermoregulation of vertebrates capable of homeothermy as well as regulating locomotion and other behavioral outputs of the circadian clock within ectothermic vertebrates. The behavioral differences between both classes of vertebrates when compared to the respective structures and properties of the SCN as well as various other nuclei proximate to the hypothalamus provide insight into how these behaviors are the consequence of differing circadian regulation. Ultimately, many neuroethological studies must be done to completely ascertain the direct and indirect roles of the SCN on circadian-regulated behaviors of vertebrates.

===The SCN of endotherms and ectotherms===

In general, external temperature does not influence endothermic animal circadian rhythm because of the ability of these animals to keep their internal body temperature constant through homeostatic thermoregulation; however, peripheral oscillators (see Circadian rhythm) in mammals are sensitive to temperature pulses and will experience resetting of the circadian clock phase and associated genetic expression, suggesting how peripheral circadian oscillators may be separate entities from one another despite having a master oscillator within the SCN. Furthermore, when individual neurons of the SCN from a mouse were treated with heat pulses, a similar resetting of oscillators was observed, but when an intact SCN was treated with the same heat pulse treatment the SCN was resistant to temperature change by exhibiting an unaltered circadian oscillating phase. In ectothermic animals, particularly the ruin lizard, &quot;Podarcis siculus&quot;, temperature has been shown to affect the circadian oscillators within the SCN. This reflects a potential evolutionary relationship among endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates as ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to affect their circadian rhythms and behavior while endotherms have an evolved SCN that is resistant to external temperature fluctuations and uses photoreception as a means for entraining the circadian oscillators within their SCN. In addition, the differences of the SCN between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates suggest that the neuronal organization of the temperature-resistant SCN in endotherms is responsible for driving thermoregulatory behaviors in those animals differently from those of ectotherms, since they rely on external temperature for engaging in certain behaviors.

===Behaviors controlled by the SCN of vertebrates===

Significant research has been conducted on the genes responsible for controlling circadian rhythm, in particular within the SCN. Knowledge of the gene expression of &quot;Clock&quot; (&quot;Clk&quot;) and &quot;Period2&quot; (&quot;Per2&quot;), two of the many genes responsible for regulating circadian rhythm within the individual cells of the SCN, has allowed for a greater understanding of how genetic expression influences the regulation of circadian rhythm-controlled behaviors. Studies on thermoregulation of ruin lizards and mice have informed some connections between the neural and genetic components of both vertebrates when experiencing induced hypothermic conditions. Certain findings have reflected how evolution of SCN both structurally and genetically has resulted in the engagement of characteristic and stereotyped thermoregulatory behavior in both classes of vertebrates.

*Mice: Among vertebrates, it is known that mammals are endotherms that are capable of homeostatic thermoregulation. It has been shown that mice display thermosensitivity within the SCN. However, the regulation of body temperature in hypothermic mice is more sensitive to the amount of light in their environment. Even while fasted, mice in darkened conditions and experiencing hypothermia maintained a stable internal body temperature. In light conditions, mice showed a drop in body temperature under the same fasting and hypothermic conditions. Through analyzing genetic expression of &quot;Clock&quot; genes in wild-type and knockout strains, as well as analyzing the activity of neurons within the SCN and connections to proximate nuclei of the hypothalamus in the aforementioned conditions, it has been shown that the SCN is the center of control for circadian body temperature rhythm. This circadian control, thus, includes both direct and indirect influence of many of the thermoregulatory behaviors that mammals engage in to maintain homeostasis.
*Ruin lizards: Several studies have been conducted on the genes expressed in circadian oscillating cells of the SCN during various light and dark conditions, as well as effects from inducing mild hypothermia in reptiles. In terms of structure, the SCNs of lizards have a closer resemblance to those of mice, possessing a dorsomedial portion and a ventrolateral core. However, genetic expression of the circadian-related &quot;Per2&quot; gene in lizards is similar to that in reptiles and birds, despite the fact that birds have been known to have a distinct SCN structure consisting of a lateral and medial portion. Studying the lizard SCN because of the lizard&#x27;s small body size and ectothermy is invaluable to understanding how this class of vertebrates modifies its behavior within the dynamics of circadian rhythm, but it has not yet been determined whether the systems of cold-blooded vertebrates were slowed as a result of decreased activity in the SCN or showed decreases in metabolic activity as a result of hypothermia.

==Other signals from the retina==

The SCN is one of many nuclei that receive nerve signals directly from the retina.

Some of the others are the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the superior colliculus, the basal optic system, and the pretectum:
* The &quot;LGN&quot; passes information about color, contrast, shape, and movement on to the visual cortex and itself signals to the SCN.
* The &quot;superior colliculus&quot; controls the movement and orientation of the eye.
* The basal optic system also controls eye movements.
* The &quot;pretectum&quot; controls the size of the pupil.

==Genetic Basis of SCN Function==
The SCN is the central circadian pacemaker of mammals, serving as the coordinator of mammalian circadian rhythms. Neurons in an intact SCN show coordinated circadian rhythms in electrical activity. Neurons isolated from the SCN have been shown to produce and sustain circadian rhythms &quot;in vitro&quot;, suggesting that each individual neuron of the SCN can function as an independent circadian oscillator at the cellular level. Each cell of the SCN synchronizes its oscillations to the cells around it, resulting in a network of mutually reinforced and precise oscillations constituting the SCN master clock.

=== Mammals ===
The SCN functions as a circadian biological clock in vertebrates including teleosts, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In mammals, the rhythms produced by the SCN are driven by a transcription-translation negative feedback loop (TTFL) composed of interacting positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops. Within the nucleus of an SCN cell, the genes &quot;Clock&quot; and &quot;Bmal1 (mop3)&quot; encode the BHLH-PAS transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 (MOP3), respectively. CLOCK and BMAL1 are positive activators that form CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers. These heterodimers then bind to E-boxes upstream of multiple genes, including &quot;per&quot; and &quot;cry&quot;, to enhance and promote their transcription and eventual translation. In mammals, there are three known homologs for the &quot;period&quot; gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, namely &quot;per1&quot;, &quot;per2&quot;, and &quot;per3&quot;.

As &quot;per&quot; and &quot;cry&quot; are transcribed and translated into PER and CRY, the proteins accumulate and form heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The heterodimers are phosphorylated at a rate that determines the length of the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) and then translocate back into the nucleus where the phosphorylated PER-CRY heterodimers act on CLOCK and/or BMAL1 to inhibit their activity. Although the role of phosphorylation in the TTFL mechanism is known, the specific kinetics are yet to be elucidated. As a result, PER and CRY function as negative repressors and inhibit the transcription of &quot;per&quot; and &quot;cry&quot;. Over time, the PER-CRY heterodimers degrade and the cycle begins again with a period of about 24.5 hours. The integral genes involved, termed “clock genes,&quot; are highly conserved throughout both SCN-bearing vertebrates like mice, rats, and birds as well as in non-SCN bearing animals such as &quot;Drosophila&quot;.

==Electrophysiology==
Neurons in the SCN fire action potentials in a 24-hour rhythm, even under constant conditions. At mid-day, the firing rate reaches a maximum, and, during the night, it falls again. Rhythmic expression of circadian regulatory genes in the SCN requires depolarization in the SCN neurons via calcium and cAMP. Thus, depolarization of SCN neurons via cAMP and calcium contributes to the magnitude of the rhythmic gene expression in the SCN.

Further, the SCN synchronizes nerve impulses which spread to various parasympathetic and sympathetic nuclei. The sympathetic nuclei drive glucocorticoid output from the adrenal gland which activates Per1 in the body cells, thus resetting the circadian cycle of cells in the body. Without the SCN, rhythms in body cells dampen over time, which may be due to lack of synchrony between cells.

Many SCN neurons are sensitive to light stimulation via the retina. The photic response is likely linked to effects of light on circadian rhythms. In addition, application of melatonin in live rats and isolated SCN cells can decrease the firing rate of these neurons. Variances in light input due to jet lag, seasonal changes, and constant light conditions all change the firing rhythm in SCN neurons demonstrating the relationship between light and SCN neuronal functioning.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder ===
Irregular sleep-wake rhythm (ISWR) disorder is thought to be caused by structural damage to the SCN, decreased responsiveness of the circadian clock to light and other stimuli, and decreased exposure to light. People who tend to stay indoors and limit their exposure to light experience decreased nocturnal melatonin production. The decrease in melatonin production at night corresponds with greater expression of SCN-generated wakefulness during night, causing irregular sleep patterns.

=== Major depressive disorder ===
Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with altered circadian rhythms. Patients with MDD have weaker rhythms that express clock genes in the brain. When SCN rhythms were disturbed, anxiety-like behavior, weight gain, helplessness, and despair were reported in a study conducted with mice. Abnormal glucocorticoid levels occurred in mice with no &quot;Bmal1&quot; expression in the SCN.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
The functional disruption of the SCN can be observed in early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Changes in the SCN and melatonin secretion are major factors that cause circadian rhythm disturbances. These disturbances cause the normal physiology of sleep to change, such as the biological clock and body temperature during rest. Patients with AD experience insomnia, hypersomnia, and other sleep disorders as a result of the degeneration of the SCN and changes in critical neurotransmitter concentrations.

==History==
The idea that the SCN is the main sleep cycle regulator in mammals was proposed by Robert Moore, who conducted experiments using radioactive amino acids to find where the termination of the retinohypothalamic projection occurs in rodents. Early lesioning experiments in mouse, guinea pig, cat, and opossum established how removal of the SCN results in ablation of circadian rhythm in mammals.

<text>Titadyn 30 AG (often referred to as Titadine) is a type of compressed dynamite used in mining and manufactured in southern France by Titanite S.A. The explosive comes in the form of salmon-coloured tubes of a range of diameters, from 50 to 120 mm. Titadine is very powerful and fast-burning, with an energy rating of 4650 J/g and a speed of detonation of over 6,000 m/s.

It was used in bomb attacks by the separatist group ETA in Spain. In September 1999 a combined group of ETA members and Breton separatists raided a factory at Plevin, Brittany, stealing over eight tonnes of Titadyn, some of which was subsequently sold to the Islamist resistance group Hamas, according to Spain&#x27;s &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper. Another raid took place in March 2001 when an explosives factory near Grenoble in France was targeted and 1.6 tonnes of Titadyn was stolen. Much of it was later recovered by Spanish police in raids, or was used by ETA in car bomb attacks in Spanish cities.

<doc id="608181" wikidata="Q647144" url="?curid=608181" title="Brood parasitism">
<text>Brood parasitism is a subclass of parasitism and phenomenon and behavioural pattern of animals that rely on others to raise their young. The strategy appears among birds, insects and fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own, usually using egg mimicry, with eggs that resemble the host&#x27;s. The strategy involves a form of aggressive mimicry called Kirbyan mimicry.

The evolutionary strategy relieves the parasitic parents from the investment of rearing young. This benefit comes at the cost of provoking an evolutionary arms race between parasite and host as they coevolve: many hosts have developed strong defenses against brood parasitism, such as recognizing and ejecting parasitic eggs, or abandoning parasitized nests and starting over. It is less obvious why most hosts do care for parasite nestlings, given that for example cuckoo chicks differ markedly from host chicks in size and appearance. One explanation, the mafia hypothesis, proposes that parasitic adults retaliate by destroying host nests where rejection has occurred; there is experimental evidence to support this. Intraspecific brood parasitism also occurs, as in many duck species. Here there is no visible difference between host and parasite eggs, which may be why the parasite eggs are so readily accepted. In eider ducks, the first and second eggs in a nest are especially subject to predation, perhaps explaining why they are often laid in another eider nest.

== Evolutionary strategy ==

Brood parasitism is an evolutionary strategy that relieves the parasitic parents from the investment of rearing young or building nests for the young by getting the host to raise their young for them. This enables the parasitic parents to spend more time on other activities such as foraging and producing further offspring.

=== Adaptations for parasitism ===

Among specialist avian brood parasites, mimetic eggs are a nearly universal adaptation. The generalist brown-headed cowbird may have evolved an egg coloration mimicking a number of their hosts. Size may also be important for the incubation and survival of parasitic species; it may be beneficial for parasitic eggs to be similar in size to the eggs of the host species.

The eggshells of brood parasites are often thicker than those of the hosts. For example, two studies of cuckoos parasiting great reed warblers reported thickness ratios of 1.02 : 0.87 and 1.04 : 0.81. The function of this thick eggshell is debated. One hypothesis, the puncture resistance hypothesis, states that the thicker eggshells serve to prevent hosts from breaking the eggshell, thus killing the embryo inside. This is supported by a study in which marsh warblers damaged their own eggs more often when attempting to break cuckoo eggs, but incurred less damage when trying to puncture great reed warbler eggs put in the nest by researchers. Another hypothesis is the laying damage hypothesis, which postulates that the eggshells are adapted to damage the eggs of the host when the former is being laid, and prevent the parasite&#x27;s eggs from being damaged when the host lays its eggs. In support of this hypothesis, eggs of the shiny cowbird parasitizing the house wren and the chalk-browed mockingbird and the brown-headed cowbird parasitizing the house wren and the red-winged blackbird damaged the host&#x27;s eggs when dropped, and sustained little damage when host eggs were dropped on them.

Most avian brood parasites have very short egg incubation periods and rapid nestling growth. In many brood parasites, such as cuckoos and honeyguides, this short egg incubation period is due to internal incubation periods up to 24 hours longer in cuckoos than hosts. Some non-parasitic cuckoos also have longer internal incubation periods, suggesting that this longer internal incubation period was not an adaptation following brood parasitism, but predisposed birds to become brood parasites. This is likely facilitated by a heavier yolk in the egg providing more nutrients. Being larger than the hosts on hatching is a further adaptation to being a brood parasite.

=== Evolutionary arms race ===

Bird parasites mitigate the risk of egg loss by distributing eggs amongst a number of different hosts. As such behaviours damage the host, they often result in an evolutionary arms race between parasite and host as they coevolve.
Some host species have strong rejection defenses, forcing the parasitic species to evolve excellent mimicry. In other species, hosts do not defend against parasites, and the parasitic mimicry is poor.

Intraspecific brood parasitism among coots significantly increases the reproductive fitness of the parasite, but only about half of the eggs laid parasitically in other coot nests survive. This implies that coots have somewhat effective anti-parasitism strategies. Similarly, the parasitic offspring of bearded reedlings, compared to offspring in non-parasitic nests, tend to develop much more slowly and often do not reach full maturity.

Given that the cost to the host of egg removal by the parasite is unrecoverable, the best strategy for hosts is to avoid parasitism in the first place. This can take several forms, including selecting nest sites which are difficult to parasitize, starting incubation early so they are already sitting on the nests when parasites visit them early in the morning, and aggressively defending their territory.

Once a parasitic egg has arrived in a host&#x27;s nest, the next most optimal defense is to eject the parasitic egg. This requires the host to distinguish which eggs are not theirs, by identifying pattern differences or changes in the number of eggs. Eggs may be ejected by grasping, if the host has a large enough beak, or by puncturing. When the parasitic eggs are mimetic, hosts may mistake one of their own eggs for a parasite&#x27;s. A host might also damage its own eggs while trying to eject a parasite&#x27;s egg.

Among hosts that do not eject parasitic eggs, some abandon parasitized nests and start over again. However, at high enough parasitism frequencies, this becomes maladaptive as the new nest will most likely also be parasitized. Some host species modify their nests to exclude the parasitic egg, either by weaving over the egg or by rebuilding a new nest over the existing one. For instance, American coots may kick the parasites&#x27; eggs out, or build a new nest beside the brood nests where the parasites&#x27; chicks starve to death. In the western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler, a small host, small dummy parasitic eggs were always ejected, whilst with large dummy parasitic eggs, nest desertion was more frequent.

=== Mafia hypothesis ===

There is a question as to why the majority of the hosts of brood parasites care for the nestlings of their parasites. Not only do these brood parasites usually differ significantly in size and appearance, but it is also highly probable that they reduce the reproductive success of their hosts. The &quot;mafia hypothesis&quot; proposes that when a brood parasite discovers that its egg has been rejected, it destroys the host&#x27;s nest and injures or kills the nestlings. The threat of such a response may encourage compliant behavior from the host. Mafia-like behavior occurs in the brown-headed cowbird of North America, and the great spotted cuckoo of Europe. The great spotted cuckoo lays most of its eggs in the nests of the European magpie. It repeatedly visits nests it has parasitised, a precondition for the mafia hypothesis. In experiments, nests from which the parasite&#x27;s egg has been removed are destroyed by the cuckoo, supporting the hypothesis. An alternative explanation is that the destruction encourages the magpie host to build a new nest, giving the cuckoo another opportunity for parasitism. Similarly, the brown-headed cowbird parasitises the prothonotary warbler. In other experiments, 56% of egg-ejected nests were predated upon, against 6% of non-ejected nests. 85% of parasitized nests rebuilt by hosts were destroyed. Hosts that ejected parasite eggs produced 60% fewer young than those that accepted the cowbird eggs.

=== Similarity hypothesis ===

Common cuckoo females have been proposed to select hosts with similar egg characteristics to her own. The hypothesis suggests that the female monitors a population of potential hosts and chooses nests from within this group. Study of museum nest collections shows a similarity between cuckoo eggs and typical eggs of the host species. A low percentage of parasitized nests were shown to contain cuckoo eggs not corresponding to the specific host egg morph. In these mismatched nests a high percent of the cuckoo eggs were shown to correlate to the egg morph of another host species with similar nesting sites. This has been pointed to as evidence for selection by similarity. The hypothesis has been criticised for providing no mechanism for choosing nests, nor identifying cues by which they might be recognised.

=== Hosts raise offspring ===

Sometimes hosts are completely unaware that they are caring for a bird that is not their own. This most commonly occurs because the host cannot differentiate the parasitic eggs from their own. It may also occur when hosts temporarily leave the nest after laying the eggs. The parasites lay their own eggs into these nests so their nestlings share the food provided by the host. It may occur in other situations. For example, female eiders prefer to lay eggs in the nests with one or two existing eggs of others because the first egg is the most vulnerable to predators. The presence of others&#x27; eggs reduces the probability that a predator will attack her egg when a female leaves the nest after laying the first egg.

Sometimes, the parasitic offspring kills the host nest-mates during competition for resources. For example, parasitic cowbird chicks kill the host nest-mates if food intake for each of them is low, but not if the food intake is adequate.

== Taxonomic range ==

=== Birds ===

==== Intraspecific ====

In many socially monogamous bird species, there are extra-pair matings resulting in males outside the pair bond siring offspring and used by males to escape from the parental investment in raising their offspring. In duck species such as the goldeneye, this form of cuckoldry is taken a step further, as females often lay their eggs in the nests of other individuals. Intraspecific brood parasitism has been recorded in 234 bird species, including 74 Anseriformes, 66 Passeriformes, 32 Galliformes, 19 Charadriiformes, 8 Gruiformes, 6 Podicipediformes, and small numbers of species in other orders.

==== Interspecific ====


Interspecific brood-parasites include the indigobirds, whydahs, and honeyguides in Africa, cowbirds, Old World cuckoos, black-headed ducks, and some New World cuckoos in the Americas. Seven independent origins of obligate interspecific brood parasitism in birds have been proposed. While there is still some controversy over when and how many origins of interspecific brood parasitism have occurred, recent phylogenetic analyses suggest two origins in Passeriformes (once in New World cowbirds: Icteridae, and once in African Finches: Viduidae); three origins in Old World and New World cuckoos (once in Cuculinae, Phaenicophaeinae, and in Neomorphinae-Crotophaginae); a single origin in Old World honeyguides (Indicatoridae); and in a single species of waterfowl, the black-headed duck (&quot;Heteronetta atricapilla&quot;).

Most avian brood parasites are specialists which parasitize only a single host species or a small group of closely related host species, but four out of the five parasitic cowbirds (all except the screaming cowbird) are generalists which parasitize a wide variety of hosts; the brown-headed cowbird has 221 known hosts. They usually lay only one egg per nest, although in some cases, particularly the cowbirds, several females may use the same host nest.

The common cuckoo presents an interesting case in which the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, including the reed warbler and dunnock, but individual females specialize in a single species. Genes regulating egg coloration appear to be passed down exclusively along the maternal line, allowing females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of the species they specialize in. Females generally parasitize nests of the species which raised them. Male common cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, which maintains sufficient gene flow among the different maternal lines to prevent speciation.

The mechanisms of host selection by female cuckoos are somewhat unclear, though several hypotheses have been suggested in attempt to explain the choice. These include genetic inheritance of host preference, host imprinting on young birds, returning to place of birth and subsequently choosing a host randomly (&quot;natal philopatry&quot;), choice based on preferred nest site (nest-site hypothesis), and choice based on preferred habitat (habitat-selection hypothesis). Of these hypotheses the nest-site selection and habitat selection have been most supported by experimental analysis.

=== Fish ===

==== Mouthbrooding parasites ====
A mochokid catfish of Lake Tanganyika, &quot;Synodontis multipunctatus&quot;, is a brood parasite of several mouthbrooding cichlid fish. The catfish eggs are incubated in the host&#x27;s mouth, and—in the manner of cuckoos—hatch before the host&#x27;s own eggs. The young catfish eat the host fry inside the host&#x27;s mouth, effectively taking up virtually the whole of the host&#x27;s parental investment.

==== Nest parasites ====

A cyprinid minnow, &quot;Pungtungia herzi&quot; is a brood parasite of the percichthyid freshwater perch &quot;Siniperca kawamebari&quot;, which live in the south of the Japanese islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku, and in South Korea. Host males guard territories against intruders during the breeding season, creating a patch of reeds as a spawning site or &quot;nest&quot;. Females (one or more per site) visit the site to lay eggs, which the male then defends. The parasite&#x27;s eggs are smaller and stickier than the host&#x27;s. 65.5% of host sites were parasitised in a study area.

=== Insects ===

==== Kleptoparasites ====

There are many different types of cuckoo bees, all of which lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees, but they are normally described as kleptoparasites (Greek: klepto-, to steal), rather than as brood parasites, because the immature stages are almost never fed directly by the adult hosts. Instead, they simply take food gathered by their hosts. Examples of cuckoo bees are &quot;Coelioxys rufitarsis&quot;, &quot;Melecta separata&quot;, &quot;Nomada&quot; and &quot;Epeoloides&quot;.

Kleptoparasitism in insects is not restricted to bees; several lineages of wasp including most of the Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites. The cuckoo wasps lay their eggs in the nests of other wasps, such as those of the potters and mud daubers. Some species of beetle are kleptoparasites, as well. &quot;Meloe americanus&quot; larvae are known to enter bee nests and feed on the provisions reserved for the bee larva.

==== True brood parasites ====
True brood parasitism is rare among insects. Cuckoo bumblebees (the subgenus &quot;Psithyrus&quot;) are among the few insects which, like cuckoos and cowbirds, are fed by adult hosts. Their queens kill and replace the existing queen of a colony of the host species, and then use the host workers to feed their brood.

One of only four true brood-parasitic wasps is &quot;Polistes semenowi&quot;.. This paper wasp has lost the ability to build its own nest, and relies on its host, &quot;P. dominula&quot;, to raise its brood. The adult host feeds the parasite larvae directly, unlike typical kleptoparasitic insects. Such insect social parasites are often closely related to their hosts, an observation known as Emery&#x27;s rule.

Host insects are sometimes tricked into bringing offspring of another species into their own nests, as with the parasitic butterfly, &quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot;, and the host ant &quot;Myrmica schencki&quot;. The butterfly larvae release chemicals that confuse the host ant into believing that the &quot;P. rebeli&quot; larvae are actually ant larvae. Thus, the &quot;M. schencki&quot; ants bring back the &quot;P. rebeli&quot; larvae to their nests and feed them, much like the chicks of cuckoos and other brood-parasitic birds. This is also the case for the parasitic butterfly, &quot;Niphanda fusca&quot;, and its host ant &quot;Camponotus japonicus&quot;. The butterfly releases cuticular hydrocarbons that mimic those of the host male ant. The ant then brings the third instar larvae back into its own nest and raises them until pupation.

<text>Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik (, – 24 December 1970) was a Soviet politician who served as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 19 March 1946 until 15 March 1953. Though the titular Soviet head of state, Shvernik had less power than Joseph Stalin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

==Biography==
Shvernik was born in 1888 in St. Petersburg in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity. His father was a retired sergeant major, who worked in factories in St Petersburg. Reputedly, he was descended from Old Believers. Shvernik&#x27;s mother was a weaver. He worked in factories as a turner, and joined the Bolsheviks in 1905. After the February Revolution in 1917, he was elected chairman of the soviet in a pipe factory in Samara, and chairman of the Samara city soviet. During the Russian Civil War, he was a political commissar in the Red Army. In 1921–23, he worked in the trade unions.

In 1923, he was appointed to the staff of Rabkrin, which was headed by Joseph Stalin, whom Shvernik loyally supported during the power struggles of the 1920s. During 1923, he was in charge of combatting the sale of moonshine vodka and cocaine, and gambling. In November 1925, at the height of the conflict between Stalin and Grigory Zinoviev, he was appointed by the Central Committee to take over as Secretary of the Leningrad provincial committee, which was Zinoviev&#x27;s power base.

Shvernik was a full member of the Central Committee from December 1925 until he died 45 years later. In April 1926, he was appointed to the Secretariat, one of a team of four secretaries led by Stalin, in place of Grigory Yevdokimov, a Zinoviev supporter.

While the Central Committee and Central Control Commission were in joint session, in October 1927, debating whether to expel the leading oppositionists, including Leon Trotsky and Zinoviev, Shvernik displayed his loyalty to Stalin.

In December 1927, when there were sudden food shortages in the cities because the peasants were holding back their produce in anticipation of rising prices, Shvernik was dispatched to the Urals, as regional party secretary. He continued to support Stalin loyally through the rapid industrialisation of the soviet economy, which was opposed by almost the entire leadership of the trade unions. He was recalled to Moscow in 1929, and imposed as chairman of the Metallurgist Trade Union. From July 1930 to March 1944, he was first secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and a member of the Orgburo.

Shvernik presided over the 1931 Menshevik Trial, in which fourteen Russian economists came up for trial on charges of treason. In February 1937, he was a member of the commission that investigated Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov, the two most prominent former oppositionists still living the USSR, and voted that they should be expelled from the Central Committee, arrested, and shot.

During the Second World War, Shvernik was responsible for evacuating Soviet industry away from the advancing Wehrmacht. He was Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities from 1938 to 1946. He was Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR from 1944 to 1946. In 1946 he became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, succeeding Mikhail Kalinin. He only became a member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee (then named the Presidium of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee) in 1952 but was demoted in 1953 when the body was reduced in size.

Reputedly, Shvernik was so distressed by Stalin&#x27;s death, in March 1953, that he was the only prominent party leader seen crying at the dictator&#x27;s funeral. Within days, he had been demoted back to his old status as a &#x27;candidate&#x27; member of the Presidium, and Shvernik was removed as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and replaced by Kliment Voroshilov on 15 March 1953. He returned to his work as the chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. In December 1953, he was named as a member of the panel of judges who sentenced the former chief of police, Lavrentiy Beria and six others to death.

Despite his years of loyalty to Stalin, Shvernik was one of the most senior Old Bolsheviks to back Nikita Khrushchev after he had delivered the &quot;Secret Speech&quot; which denounced Stalin&#x27;s crimes. Appointed Chairman of the Central Control Commission in 1956, he oversaw the &#x27;rehabilitation&#x27; of scores of people wrongly convicted during the Stalin years. In July 1957, Shvernik again became a full member of the Presidium, after a stretch of more than 16 years as a &#x27;candidate&#x27; member. He remained on the body until he retired in 1966.

Shvernik died on 24 December 1970 at Moscow at the age 82 and his ashes were placed in an urn in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

<text>β-Carboline (9&quot;H&quot;-pyrido[3,4-&quot;b&quot;]indole) represents the basic chemical structure for more than one hundred alkaloids and synthetic compounds. The effects of these substances depend on their respective substituent. Natural β-carbolines primarily influence brain functions but can also exhibit antioxidant effects. Synthetically designed β-carboline derivatives have recently been shown to have neuroprotective, cognitive enhancing and anti-cancer properties.

==Pharmacology==
The pharmacological effects of specific β-carbolines are dependent on their substituents. For example, the natural β-carboline harmine has substituents on position 7 and 1. Thereby, it acts as a selective inhibitor of the DYRK1A protein kinase, a protein necessary for neurodevelopment. It also exhibits various antidepressant-like effects in rats by interacting with serotonin receptor 2A. Furthermore, it increases levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat hippocampus. A decreased BDNF level has been associated with major depression in humans. The antidepressant effect of harmine might also be due to its function as a MAO-A inhibitor by reducing the breakdown of serotonin and noradrenaline.

A synthetic derivative, 9-methyl-β-carboline, has shown neuroprotective effects including increased expression of neurotrophic factors and enhanced respiratory chain activity. This derivative has also been shown to enhance cognitive function, increase dopaminergic neuron count and facilitate synaptic and dendritic proliferation. It also exhibited therapeutic effects in animal models for Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other neurodegenerative processes.

However, β-carbolines with substituents in position 3 reduce the effect of benzodiazepine on GABA-A receptors and can therefore have convulsive, anxiogenic and memory enhancing effects. Moreover, 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline blocks the sleep-promoting effect of flurazepam in rodents and – by itself – can decrease sleep in a dose-dependent manner. Another derivative, methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate, stimulates learning and memory at low doses but can promote anxiety and convulsions at high doses. With modification in position 9 similar positive effects have been observed for learning and memory without promotion of anxiety or convulsion.

β-carboline derivatives also enhance the production of the antibiotic reveromycin A in soil-dwelling &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species. Specifically, expression of biosynthetic genes is facilitated by binding of the β-carboline to a large ATP-binding regulator of the LuxR family.

Also Lactobacillus spp. secretes a β-carboline (1-acetyl-β-carboline) preventing the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans to change to a more virulent growth form (yeast-to-filament transition). Thereby, β-carboline reverses imbalances in the microbiome composition causing pathologies ranging from vaginal candidiasis to fungal sepsis.

Since β-carbolines also interact with various cancer-related molecules such as DNA, enzymes (GPX4, kinases, etc.) and proteins (ABCG2/BRCP1, etc.), they are also discussed as potential anticancer agents.

=== Explorative human studies for the medical use of β-carbolines ===
The extract of the liana &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; has been used by the tribes of the Amazon as an entheogen and was described as a hallucinogen in the middle of the 19th century. In early 20th century, European pharmacists identified harmine as the active substance. This discovery stimulated the interest to further investigate its potential as a medicine. For example, Louis Lewin, a prominent pharmacologist, demonstrated a dramatic benefit in neurological impairments after injections of &quot;B. caapi&quot; in patients with postencephalitic Parkinsonism. By 1930, it was generally agreed that hypokinesia, drooling, mood, and sometimes rigidity improved by treatment with harmine. Altogether, 25 studies had been published in the 1920s and 1930s about patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and postencephalitic Parkinsonism. The pharmacological effects of harmine have been attributed mainly to its central monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory properties. In-vivo and rodent studies have shown that extracts of &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; and also &quot;Peganum harmala&quot; lead to striatal dopamine release. Furthermore, harmine supports the survival of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-treated mice. Since harmine also antagonizes &quot;N&quot;-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, some researchers speculatively attributed the rapid improvement in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease to these antiglutamatergic effects. However, the advent of synthetic anticholinergic drugs at that time led to the total abandonment of harmine.

== Structure ==
β-Carbolines belong to the group of indole alkaloids and consist of a pyridine ring that is fused to an indole skeleton. The structure of β-carboline is similar to that of tryptamine, with the ethylamine chain re-connected to the indole ring via an extra carbon atom, to produce a three-ringed structure. The biosynthesis of β-carbolines is believed to follow this route from analogous tryptamines. Different levels of saturation are possible in the third ring which is indicated here in the structural formula by coloring the optionally double bonds red and blue:

==Examples of β-carbolines==
Some of the more important β-carbolines are tabulated by structure below. Their structures may contain the aforementioned bonds marked by red or blue.

==Natural occurrence==

β-Carboline alkaloids are widespread in prokaryotes, plants and animals. Some β-carbolines, notably tetrahydro-β-carbolines, may be formed naturally in plants and the human body with tryptophan, serotonin and tryptamine as precursors.

* Altogether, eight plant families are known to express 64 different kinds of β-carboline alkaloids. For example, the β-carbolines harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine are components of the liana &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; and play a pivotal role in the pharmacology of the indigenous psychedelic drug ayahuasca. Moreover, the seeds of &quot;Peganum harmala&quot; (Syrian Rue) contain between 0.16% and 5.9% β-carboline alkaloids (by dry weight).
* A specific group of β-carboline derivatives, termed eudistomins, were extracted from ascidians (marine tunicates of the family &quot;Ascidiacea&quot;) such as &quot;Ritterella sigillinoides&quot;, &quot;Lissoclinum fragile&quot; or &quot;Pseudodistoma aureum&quot;. 
* Nostocarboline was isolated from a freshwater cyanobacterium.
* The fully aromatic β-carbolines also occur in many foodstuffs, however in lower concentrations. The highest amounts have been detected in brewed coffee, raisins, well-done fish and meats. Smoking is another source of fully aromatic β-carbolines, with levels up to thousands of μg per smoker each day.
* β-Carbolines have also been found in the cuticle of scorpions, causing their skin to fluoresce upon exposed to ultraviolet light at certain wavelengths (e.g. blacklight).

<text>Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.

== Overview ==

The Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website frequentation or IP addresses). Other algorithms are designed for finding association rules in data having no transactions (Winepi and Minepi), or having no timestamps (DNA sequencing). Each transaction is seen as a set of items (an &quot;itemset&quot;). Given a threshold formula_1, the Apriori algorithm identifies the item sets which are subsets of at least formula_1 transactions in the database.

Apriori uses a &quot;bottom up&quot; approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as &quot;candidate generation&quot;), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.

Apriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length formula_3 from item sets of length formula_4. Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent formula_3-length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.

The pseudo code for the algorithm is given below for a transaction database formula_6, and a support threshold of formula_7. Usual set theoretic notation is employed, though note that formula_6 is a multiset. formula_9 is the candidate set for level formula_3. At each step, the algorithm is assumed to generate the candidate sets from the large item sets of the preceding level, heeding the downward closure lemma. formula_11 accesses a field of the data structure that represents candidate set formula_12, which is initially assumed to be zero. Many details are omitted below, usually the most important part of the implementation is the data structure used for storing the candidate sets, and counting their frequencies.

Consider the following database, where each row is a transaction and each cell is an individual item of the transaction:

The association rules that can be determined from this database are the following: 
# 100% of sets with α also contain β
# 50% of sets with α, β also have ε
# 50% of sets with α, β also have θ

we can also illustrate this through a variety of examples.

=== Example 2 ===

Assume that a large supermarket tracks sales data by stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each item: each item, such as &quot;butter&quot; or &quot;bread&quot;, is identified by a numerical SKU. The supermarket has a database of transactions where each transaction is a set of SKUs that were bought together.

Let the database of transactions consist of following itemsets:

We will use Apriori to determine the frequent item sets of this database. To do this, we will say that an item set is frequent if it appears in at least 3 transactions of the database: the value 3 is the &quot;support threshold&quot;.

The first step of Apriori is to count up the number of occurrences, called the support, of each member item separately. By scanning the database for the first time, we obtain the following result

All the itemsets of size 1 have a support of at least 3, so they are all frequent.

The next step is to generate a list of all pairs of the frequent items.

For example, regarding the pair {1,2}: the first table of Example 2 shows items 1 and 2 appearing together in three of the itemsets; therefore, we say item {1,2} has support of three.

The pairs {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4} all meet or exceed the minimum support of 3, so they are frequent. The pairs {1,3} and {1,4} are not. Now, because {1,3} and {1,4} are not frequent, any larger set which contains {1,3} or {1,4} cannot be frequent. In this way, we can &quot;prune&quot; sets: we will now look for frequent triples in the database, but we can already exclude all the triples that contain one of these two pairs:

in the example, there are no frequent triplets. {2,3,4} is below the minimal threshold, and the other triplets were excluded because they were super sets of pairs that were already below the threshold.

We have thus determined the frequent sets of items in the database, and illustrated how some items were not counted because one of their subsets was already known to be below the threshold.
== Limitations ==

Apriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (The algorithm attempts to load up the candidate set, with as many as possible subsets before each scan of the database). Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only after all formula_13 of its proper subsets.

The algorithm scans the database too many times, which reduces the overall performance. Due to this, the algorithm assumes that the database is permanently in the memory. 

Also, both the time and space complexity of this algorithm are very high: formula_14, thus exponential, where formula_15 is the horizontal width (the total number of items) present in the database.

Later algorithms such as Max-Miner try to identify the maximal frequent item sets without enumerating their subsets, and perform &quot;jumps&quot; in the search space rather than a purely bottom-up approach.

<text>A war of aggression, sometimes also war of [[conquest]], is a military conflict waged without the justification of self-defense, usually for territorial gain and subjugation, in contrast with the concept of a just war.

Wars without international legality (i.e. not out of self-defense nor sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council) can be considered wars of aggression; however, this alone usually does not constitute the definition of a war of aggression; certain wars may be unlawful but not aggressive (a war to settle a boundary dispute where the initiator has a reasonable claim, and limited aims, is one example).

In the judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which followed World War II, &quot;War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&quot;
Article 39 of the United Nations Charter provides that the UN Security Council shall determine the existence of any act of aggression and &quot;shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;.The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court refers to the crime of aggression as one of the &quot;most serious crimes of concern to the international community&quot;, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, the Rome Statute stipulates that the ICC may not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted. At the Kampala Review Conference on 11 June 2010, a total of 111 State Parties to the Court agreed by consensus to adopt a resolution accepting the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime. The relevant amendments to the Statute entered into force on July 17, 2018 after being ratified by 35 States Parties.

Possibly the first trial for waging aggressive war is that of the Sicilian king Conradin in 1268.

==Definitions==

The origin of the concept, the author Peter Maguire argues, emerged from the debate on Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919: &quot;Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.&quot; Maguire argues:

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria had a significant negative effect on the moral strength and influence of the League of Nations. As critics had predicted, the League was powerless if a strong nation decided to pursue an aggressive policy against other countries, allowing a country such as Japan to commit blatant aggression without serious consequences. Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were also aware of this, and ultimately both followed Japan&#x27;s example in aggression against their neighbors: in the case of Italy, against Ethiopia (1935–1937) and Albania (1939); and Germany, against Czechoslovakia (1938–1939) and Poland (1939).

In November 1935, the League of Nations condemned Italy&#x27;s aggression in Ethiopia and imposed economic sanctions. The prominent jurist Hans Kelsen argued that in the Ethiopian case, the League had &quot;at least made certain efforts to fulfill its duty in the cases of illegal aggression undertaken by member states against other member states.&quot;

===The Convention for the Definition of Aggression===
Two Conventions for the Definition of Aggression were signed in London on 3 and 4 July 1933. The first was signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey and Yugoslavia, and came into effect on 17 February 1934, when it was ratified by all of them but Turkey. The second was signed by Afghanistan (ratified 20 October 1933), Estonia (4 December), Latvia (4 December), Persia (16 November), Poland (16 October), Romania (16 October), the Soviet Union (16 October) and Turkey, which ratified both treaties on 23 March 1934. Finland acceded to the second convention on 31 January 1934. The second convention was the first to be registered with the League of Nations Treaty Series on 29 March 1934, while the first was registered on 26 April. As Lithuania refused to sign any treaty including Poland, it signed the definition of aggression in a separate pact with the Soviet Union on 5 July 1933, also in London, and exchanged ratifications on 14 December. It was registered in the Treaty Series on 16 April 1934.

The signatories of both treaties were also signatories of the Kellogg–Briand Pact prohibiting aggression, and were seeking an agreed definition of the latter. Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia were members of the Little Entente, and their signatures alarmed Bulgaria, since the definition of aggression clearly covered its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. Both treaties base their definition on the &quot;Politis Report&quot; of the Committee of Security Questions made 24 March 1933 to the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, in answer to a proposal of the Soviet delegation. The Greek politician Nikolaos Politis was behind the inclusion of &quot;support for armed bands&quot; as a form of aggression. Ratifications for both treaties were deposited in Moscow, as the convention was primarily the work of Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet signatory. The convention defined an act of aggression as follows:
* Declaration of war upon another State.
* Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another State.
* Attack by its land, naval or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another State.
* Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State.
* Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to take, in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.

The League prerogative under that convention to expel a League member found guilty of aggression was used by the League Assembly only once, against the Soviet government itself, on December 14, 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Finland.

===The Nuremberg Principles===

In 1945, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal defined three categories of crimes, including &quot;crimes against peace&quot;. This definition was first used by Finland to prosecute the political leadership in the war-responsibility trials in Finland. The principles were later known as the Nuremberg Principles.

In 1950, the Nuremberg Tribunal defined Crimes against Peace, in Principle VI, specifically Principle VI(a), submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, as:
See: &quot;Nuremberg Trials:&quot; &quot;The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939.&quot;

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting World War II. One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or – it seems – the enforcement of the criminal law of &quot;jus cogens&quot;. It has made formal declaration of war uncommon after 1945.

Reading the Tribunal&#x27;s final judgment in court, British alternate judge Norman Birkett said:

Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of &quot;substituting power for principle&quot; at Nuremberg: &quot;I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled. Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.&quot;

===The United Nations Charter===
The relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations mentioned in the RSICC article 5.2 were framed to include the Nuremberg Principles. The specific principle is &quot;Principle VI.a&quot; &quot;Crimes against peace&quot;, which was based on the provisions of the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal that was issued in 1945 and formed the basis for the post World War II war crime trials. The Charter&#x27;s provisions based on the Nuremberg Principle VI.a are:

===The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)===
The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 2, 1947, included a clear definition of aggression. Article 9 stated:

In addition to other acts which the Organ of Consultation may characterize as aggression, the following shall be considered as such:
===Further discussions on defining aggression===
The discussions on definition of aggression under the UN began in 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War. As the western governments, headed by Washington, were in favor of defining the governments of North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China as aggressor states, the Soviet government proposed to formulate a new UN resolution defining aggression and based on the 1933 convention. As a result, on November 17, 1950, the General Assembly passed resolution 378, which referred the issue to be defined by the International Law Commission. The commission deliberated over this issue in its 1951 session and due to large disagreements among its members, decided &quot;that the only practical course was to aim at a general and abstract definition (of aggression)&quot;. However, a tentative definition of aggression was adopted by the commission on June 4, 1951, which stated:

Aggression is the use of force by a State or Government against another State or Government, in any manner, whatever the weapons used and whether openly or otherwise, for any reason or for any purpose other than individual or collective self-defence or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation by a competent organ of the United Nations.
===General Assembly Resolution 3314===

On December 14, 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 3314, which defined the crime of aggression. This definition is not binding as such under international law, though it may reflect customary international law.

This definition makes a distinction between &quot;aggression&quot; (which &quot;gives rise to international responsibility&quot;) and &quot;war of aggression&quot; (which is &quot;a crime against international peace&quot;). Acts of aggression are defined as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one&#x27;s own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition&#x27;s distinction between an &quot;act&quot; of aggression and a &quot;war&quot; of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are notably vague, as it is unclear what level of &quot;involvement&quot; would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the Sierra Leone Civil War and the Yugoslav Wars, were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition&#x27;s adoption, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition. Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.

While this Definition of Aggression has often been cited by opponents of conflicts such as the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, it has no binding force in international law. The doctrine of &quot;Nulla poena sine lege&quot; means that, in the absence of binding international law on the subject of aggression, no penalty exists for committing acts in contravention of the definition. It is only recently that heads of state have been indicted over acts committed in wartime, in the cases of Slobodan Milošević of Serbia and Charles Taylor of Liberia. However, both were charged with war crimes, i.e., violations of the laws of war, rather than with the broader offence of &quot;a crime against international peace&quot; as envisaged by the Definition of Aggression.

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The United Nations Charter empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the United Nations Security Council but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it &quot;in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression&quot;. The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argue that the Definition of Aggression has had &quot;no visible impact&quot; on the deliberations of the Security Council.

===Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court===
The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists the crime of aggression as one of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute states that &quot;The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.&quot; The Assembly of States Parties of the ICC adopted such a definition in 2010 at the Review Conference in Kampala, Uganda.

<doc id="608209" wikidata="Q216072" url="?curid=608209" title="Xunzi (philosopher)">
<text>Xunzi (; ), born Xun Kuang, was a Chinese philosopher of Confucianism during the late Warring States period. After his predecessors Confucius and Mencius, Xunzi is often ranked as the third great Confucian philosopher of antiquity. By his time, Confucianism had suffered considerable criticism from Taoist and Mohist thinkers, and Xunzi is traditionally regarded as a synthesizer of these traditions with earlier Confucian thought. The result was a thorough and cohesive revision of Confucianism, which was crucial to the philosophy&#x27;s ability to flourish in the Han dynasty and throughout the later history of East Asia. His works were compiled in the eponymous &quot;Xunzi&quot;, and survive in excellent condition. Unlike other ancient compilations, his authorship of these texts is generally secure, though it is likely that Western Han dynasty historian Liu Xiang organized them into their present form centuries after Xunzi&#x27;s death.

Born in the state of Zhao, Xunzi studied at the prestigious Jixia Academy, where he learned about every major philosophical tradition of his time. After his graduation, Xunzi traveled to Chu where he mastered poetry, and then returned to Qi as a highly regarded teacher at the academy. His students Han Fei and Li Si each had important political and academic careers, though some of their Legalist sentiments were at odds with his philosophy. Other students such as , Zhang Cang and authored important editions and commentaries on the Confucian classics. Later in his life, Xunzi served in the court of Lord Chunshen and died sometime after Lord Chunshen&#x27;s death. The constant warfare of his time informed his work profoundly, as did his interactions with leaders and witnessing the downfall of various states.

Xunzi&#x27;s writings respond to dozens of other thinkers, whom he often directly names and criticizes. His well-known notion that &quot;Human nature is evil&quot; has led many commentators to place him opposite of Mencius, who believed human nature was intrinsically good. Though like Mencius, Xunzi believed that education and ritual were the key to self-cultivation and thus the method to circumvent one&#x27;s naturally foul nature. His definition of both concepts was loose, and he encouraged lifelong education and applied ritual to every aspect of life. Other important topics include the promotion of music and the careful application of names. Though he still cited the ancient sages, he differed from other Confucian philosophers by his insistence on emulating recent rulers rather than those of long ago.

Repeated oversimplifications and misunderstandings on Xunzi&#x27;s teachings, particularly his view on human nature, led to gradual dismissal and condemnation of his thought from the Tang dynasty onwards. By the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the 10th century, Mencius gradually upended Xunzi, particularly by the choice to include the &quot;Mencius&quot; in the Four Books. Since the 20th century, a reevaluation of Xunzi&#x27;s doctrine has taken place in East Asia, leading to recognition of his profound impact and relevance to both his times and present day.

==Sources and context==
Detailed information concerning Xunzi is largely nonexistent. Yet when compared to the scarcity of knowledge for many other ancient Chinese philosophers, there is meaningful and significant extant information on the life of Xunzi. The sinologist John H. Knoblock asserts that the sources available &quot;permit not only a reconstruction of the outlines of career but also an understanding of his intellectual development&quot;. Xunzi&#x27;s writings have survived in exceptionally good condition, and while they provide biographical details, the authenticity of this information is sometimes questionable. In addition to these, the main source for Xunzi&#x27;s life is Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; (; &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;), which includes a biography of Xunzi (&quot;SJ&quot;, 74.12–14) and mentions of him in the biographies of both Li Si (&quot;SJ&quot;, 78.15) and Lord of Chunshen (&quot;SJ&quot;, 87.1–2, 14). The Western Han dynasty historian Liu Xiang revised and expanded Sima Qian&#x27;s initial biography for the preface of the first edition of Xunzi&#x27;s writings. Some minor references to Xunzi also exist in Ying Shao&#x27;s paraphrase of Liu Xiang&#x27;s preface, as well as brief mentions in the &quot;Han Feizi&quot;, &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; and &quot;Yantie Lun&quot;.

The Warring States period (), an era of immense disunity and warfare, had been raging for over a hundred years by the time of Xunzi&#x27;s birth in the late 4th century BCE. Yet this time also saw considerable innovations in Chinese philosophy, referred to as the Hundred Schools of Thought. The primary schools were Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, Mohism, the School of Names, and the Yin–Yang School. Xunzi was a philosopher in the tradition of Confucianism, begun by Confucius who lived over two centuries before him.

==Life and career==
===Youth and time in Qi (c. 310–284)===

Xunzi was born as Xun Kuang (), probably around 310 BCE but certainly before 279 BCE. In his time, he was probably known as Xun Qing (), meaning &#x27;Minister Xun&#x27;, or &#x27;Chamberlain Xun&#x27;, after his later position. Some texts give his surname as Sun (孫) instead of Xun, though this may have been to avoid naming taboo during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han (73–48 BCE), whose given name was Xun. He is best known by his honorary title Xunzi () translated to &#x27;Master Xun&#x27;, with &quot;zi&quot; being a common epithet for important philosophers. His birthplace was Zhao, a state in the modern-day Shanxi Province of north-central China. It is possible Xunzi was descended from the Xun family, an elite clan that had diminished following the Partition of Jin, though this is only speculation. The Eastern Han dynasty historian Ying Shao records that in his youth Xunzi was a &quot;flowering talent&quot; in matters of scholarship and academics. Essentially nothing else is known of Xunzi&#x27;s background or upbringing, and thus any attempts to connect his philosophy with either topic are futile.

Sometime between age 13 and 15 (297 and 295 BCE), Xunzi traveled to the north eastern state of Qi. There he attended the Jixia Academy, which was the most important philosophical center in Ancient China, established by King Xuan. At the academy, Xunzi would have learned about all the major philosophical schools of his time, and been in the presence of scholars such as Zou Yan, Tian Pian, and Chunyu Kun. Xunzi would have learned the art of &quot;shuo&quot; (), a formal argument of persuasion that philosophical authorities of the time used to advise rulers. After his academy study, Xunzi unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Lord Mengchang against continuing the extreme policies of Qi, though the historicity of this event is not certain. After the exchange, which is later recounted in his writings, Xunzi likely left Qi between 286 and 284 BCE.

===Stay in Chu and return to Qi (c. 283–265)===
Xunzi traveled to the southern state of Chu by 283 BCE, where he probably became acquainted with the nascent forms of the &quot;fu&quot; poetry style, particularly because of the poet&#x27;s Qu Yuan residency there. Xunzi achieved considerable skill in the art, and his now-lost book of poems was well-regarded for many centuries. Chu was under especially frequent attacks from the Qin state, events which Xunzi would later recount in a conversation with Li Si. The solidity of Chu decreased so rapidly that Xunzi left around 275 BCE, returning to the more stable Qi state. He was warmly welcomed back in Qi, and held in very high-regard as an intellectual. The &quot;Shiji&quot; records that King Xiang of Qi had Xunzi sacrifice wine three times, a task that was reserved for the most respected scholar available. The eminence at which he was held suggests that Xunzi became the head of the Jixia Academy, but he is known to have taught there regardless. It was at this time that Xunzi composed much of his most important philosophical works, namely the chapters &quot;Of Honor and Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Of Kings and the Lords-Protector&quot;, &quot;Discourse on Nature&quot;, &quot;Discourse on Music&quot;, and &quot;Man&#x27;s Nature is Evil&quot;.

In his time, Xunzi was called &quot;the most revered of teachers&quot; (&quot;zui wei laoshi&quot;; ). His most famous pupils were Han Fei and Li Si, each who would have important political and academic careers. Xunzi&#x27;s association with Li Si, the future Chancellor (or Prime Minister) of the Qin dynasty would later tarnish his reputation. Other students of his included , Zhang Cang and , all of whom authored important editions and commentaries on the Confucian classics. The timeline for his academy teaching is unclear, though he seemed to have considered other posts after being slandered. He left Qi in around 265 BCE, around the time when King Jian succeeded Xiang.

===Travels and later career (c. 265 – after 238)===
Xunzi&#x27;s writings suggest that after leaving Qi he visited Qin, possibly from 265 BCE to 260 BCE. He aimed to convert the state&#x27;s leaders to follow his philosophy of leadership, a task which proved difficult because of the strong hold that Shang Yang&#x27;s Legalist sentiments had there. In a conversation with the Qin official Fan Sui, Xunzi praised much of the state&#x27;s achievements, officials and governmental organizations. Still, Xunzi found issues with the state, primarily its lack of Confucian scholars and the fear it inspires, which Xunzi claimed would result in the surrounding states uniting up against. Xunzi then met with King Zhaoxiang, arguing that Qin&#x27;s lack of Confucian scholars and educational encouragement would be detrimental to the state&#x27;s future. The king was unconvinced by Xunzi&#x27;s persuasion, and did not offer him a post in his court.

In around 260 BCE, Xunzi returned to his native Zhao, where he debated military affairs with Lord Linwu () in the court of King Xiaocheng of Zhao. He remained in Zhao until BCE.

In 240 BCE Lord Chunshen, the prime minister of Chu, invited him to take a position as Magistrate of Lanling (), which he initially refused and then accepted. However, Lord Chunshen was assassinated In 238 BCE by a court rival and Xunzi subsequently lost his position. He retired, remained in Lanling, a region in what is today&#x27;s southern Shandong province, for the rest of his life and was buried there. The year of his death is unknown, though if he lived to see the ministership of his student Li Si, as recounted, he would have lived into his nineties, dying shortly after 219 BCE.

==Philosophy==
===Human nature – &quot;xing&quot;===
The best known and most cited section of the &quot;Xunzi&quot; is chapter 23, &quot;Human Nature is Evil&quot;. Human nature, known as &quot;xing&quot; (), was a topic which Confucius commented on somewhat ambiguously, leaving much room for later philosophers to expand upon. Xunzi does not appear to know about Shang Yang, but can be compared with him. While Shang Yang believed that people were selfish, Xunzi believed that humanity&#x27;s inborn tendencies were evil and that ethical norms had been invented to rectify people. His variety of Confucianism therefore has a darker, more pessimistic flavor than the optimistic Confucianism of Mencius, who tended to view humans as innately good. Like most Confucians, however, he believed that people could be refined through education and ritual.
Both Mencius and Xunzi believed in human nature and both believed it was possible to become better, but some people refused it. Mencius saw Xing as more related to an ideal state and Xunzi saw it more as a starting state.

Even though Mencius had already died when the book was written, the chapter is written like a conversation between the two philosophers. Xunzi&#x27;s ideas about becoming a good person were more complex than Mencius&#x27;s. He believed that people needed to change their nature, not just give up on it. Some people thought Xunzi&#x27;s ideas were strange, but new discoveries suggest that it might have actually been Mencius who had unusual ideas about human nature.

The chapter is called &quot;Human Nature is Evil,&quot; but that&#x27;s not the whole story. Xunzi thought that people could improve themselves by learning good habits and manners, which he called &quot;artifice.&quot; (偽) He believed that people needed to transform their nature to become good. This could be done by learning from a teacher and following rituals and morals.

Even though some people doubt if the chapter is real, it&#x27;s an important part of Xunzi&#x27;s philosophy. People still talk about it today and think about the differences between Xunzi and Mencius&#x27;s ideas about human nature and how to become a better person.

Xunzi only stated that the &quot;heart&quot; can observe reason, that is, it can distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, but it is not the source of value. So where does the standard come from? According to Xunzi&#x27;s theory of evil human nature, morality will ultimately become a tool of external value used to maintain social stability and appeal to authoritarianism. Mencius&#x27; theory of good human nature, on the other hand, states that humans are inherently good and we have an internal value foundation (the Four Beginnings).

===Music – &quot;yue&quot;===
Music is discussed throughout the &quot;Xunzi&quot;, particularly in chapter 20, the &quot;Discourse on Music&quot; (&quot;Yuelun&quot;; ). Much of the Xunzi&#x27;s sentiments on music are directed towards Mozi, who largely disparaged music. Mozi held that music provides no basic needs and is a waste of resources and money. Xunzi presents a comprehensive argument in opposition, stating that certain music provides joy, which is indeed essential to human wellbeing. Music and joy are respectively translated as &quot;yue&quot; and &quot;le&quot;, and their connection in Xunzi&#x27;s time may explain why both words share the same Chinese character: . Xunzi also points out the use of music for social harmony:

Many commentators have noted the similarities between the reasons for Xunzi&#x27;s promotion of music and those of ancient Greek philosophers.

===Gentleman – &quot;junzi&quot;===
Ultimately, he refused to admit theories of state and administration apart from ritual and self-cultivation, arguing for the gentleman, rather than the measurements promoted by the Legalists, as the wellspring of objective criterion. His ideal gentleman (&quot;junzi&quot;) king and government, aided by a class of learned Confucian scholars, are similar to that of Mencius, but without the tolerance of feudalism since he rejected hereditary titles and believed that an individual&#x27;s status in the social hierarchy should be determined only by their own merit.

<text>The sarabande (from ) is a dance in triple metre, or the music written for such a dance.

==History==
The Sarabande evolved from a Spanish dance with Arab influences, danced by a lively double line of couples with castanets. A dance called &quot;zarabanda&quot; is first mentioned in 1539 in Central America in the poem &quot;Vida y tiempo de Maricastaña&quot;, written in Panama by Fernando de Guzmán Mejía. In 1596, Alonso López, &quot;el Pinciano&quot;, traces its origins even to the cult of Dionysus. The dance seems to have been especially popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, initially in Spain and in the Spanish colonies.

The Jesuit priest Juan de Mariana thought it indecent, describing it in his &quot;Tratato contra los juegos públicos&quot; (Treatise Against Public Amusements, 1609) as &quot;a dance and song so loose in its words and so ugly in its motions that it is enough to excite bad emotions in even very decent people&quot;. A character in an entremés by Cervantes alluded to the dance&#x27;s notoriety by saying that hell was its &quot;birthplace and breeding place&quot; (in ). It was banned in Spain in 1583 but was nevertheless still performed and frequently cited in literature of the period (for instance, by Lope de Vega).

It spread to Italy in the 17th century, and to France, where it became a slow court dance.

The sarabande was used throughout much of classical music, especially in the baroque era: for example, the music of French baroque composer Jean-Marie Leclair (born 1697): Sonata for 2 violins in D major Op.12 no.3; and Buxtehude&#x27;s Trio Sonata in E minor Op.1/7 BuxWV 258, an extraordinary work with this sarabande style, most likely influencing later baroque composers such as Handel and Bach, who also have notable works using the same theme. 

Baroque musicians of the 18th century wrote suites of dance music in binary form that typically included a sarabande as the third of four movements. It was often paired with and followed by a jig or gigue. Bach sometimes gave the sarabande a privileged place in his music, where it is often the heart of his suites for cello or keyboard. And outside the context of dance suites, striking examples include the theme and the 13th and 25th variations from Bach&#x27;s Goldberg Variations; and the final movements of both the St. John and St. Matthew Passions.

The anonymous harmonic sequence known as &quot;La Folia&quot; appears in pieces of various types, mainly dances, by dozens of composers from the time of Mudarra (1546) and Corelli through to the present day, custom perhaps influenced by its Spanish origin. The theme of the fourth-movement Sarabande of Handel&#x27;s Keyboard suite in D minor (HWV 437) for harpsichord, one of these many pieces, appears prominently in the film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.

The sarabande was revived in the 19th and early 20th centuries by the German composer Louis Spohr (in his &quot;Salonstücke&quot;, Op. 135 of 1847), Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (in his &quot;Holberg Suite&quot; of 1884), French composers such as Debussy and Satie, and in England, in different styles, Vaughan Williams (in &quot;&quot;), Benjamin Britten (in the &quot;Simple Symphony&quot;), Herbert Howells (in &quot;Six Pieces for Organ: Saraband for the Morning of Easter&quot;), and Carlos Chávez in the ballet &quot;La hija de Cólquide&quot;.

The sarabande inspired the title of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s last film &quot;Saraband&quot; (2003). The film uses the sarabande from Bach&#x27;s Fifth Cello Suite, which Bergman also used in &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1971).

<text>Moses Louis Annenberg (February 11, 1877 – July 20, 1942) was an American newspaper publisher who owned the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. He also owned General News Bureau, a wire service that reported the results of horse races.

An immigrant who rose from a newspaper boy to newspaper owner, he was the father of &quot;TV Guide&quot; creator Walter Annenberg.

==Early life==
Moses Louis Annenberg was born in Kalwischken, Province of Prussia (German Empire) in 1877 to a Orthodox Jewish family. He left Germany and immigrated to Chicago in 1900.

==Career==
After starting out as a newspaper boy hawking papers on the street, Annenberg rose through the ranks, first as a newspaper salesman at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, later for the Hearst Corporation, which owned the &quot;Chicago American, the Chicago Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;, rising to circulation manager. Annenberg bought the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; in 1922 and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in 1936. He also owned &quot;The New York Morning Telegraph&quot;, a broadsheet that was focused on entertainment and horse racing.

In the fall of 1934, Annenberg purchased the defunct &quot;Miami Beach Tribune&quot;, moved operations to Miami, and relaunched it as a tabloid called the &quot;Miami Tribune&quot;. In an asset swap involving cash, Annenberg sold it to John S. Knight, owner of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, for $600,000 and the &quot;Massillon Independent&quot;, a profitable newspaper based in Massillon, Ohio. The last edition was published on December 1, 1937, and then the &quot;Miami Tribune&quot; was absorbed by the &quot;Herald&quot;.

The assets of his publishing company, the Cecelia Corporation (named after his wife) became the foundation of Triangle Publications, which was created in 1947 by his son Walter to hold his and his sisters&#x27; inherited assets.

==Tax evasion case==
During the Roosevelt administration, he was indicted for tax evasion on August 11, 1939, for income tax evasion for the years 1932–1936, totaling $3,258,809.97 in income taxes evaded. On April 4, 1940, Annenberg pleaded guilty to the 1936 income tax evasion count in the indictment that charged him with evading $1.2 million in taxes ($ million today).

Judge James Herbert Wilkerson, the same judge who previously sentenced Al Capone, sentenced Annenberg to three years in prison and a fine of $8.0 million ($ million today) &quot;the largest single tax fraud penalty in history&quot; at the time.

==Personal life==
Annenberg married Sadie Cecillia Freedman (1879–1965). They had one son, the publisher and philanthropist Walter Annenberg, and seven daughters; Diana Annenberg (1900–1905), Esther Annenberg Simon Levee (1901–1992), Janet Annenberg Kahn Neff Hooker (1904–1997), Enid Annenberg Haupt (1906–2005), Lita Annenberg Hazen (1909–1985), Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall (1911–2005), and Harriet Beatrice Annenberg Ames Aronson (1914–1976).

==Death==
Annenberg was released from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary prison on June 3, 1942, and died at the Mayo Clinic on July 20, 1942, after having surgery for a brain tumor. His Ranch A in eastern Wyoming is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Lane Seminary, sometimes called Cincinnati Lane Seminary, and later renamed Lane Theological Seminary, was a Presbyterian theological college that operated from 1829 to 1932 in Walnut Hills, Ohio, today a neighborhood in Cincinnati. Its campus was bounded by today&#x27;s Gilbert, Yale, Park, and Chapel Streets.

Its board intended it to be &quot;a great &quot;central theological institution&quot; at Cincinnati — soon to become the great Andover or Princeton of the West.&quot; However, the founding and first years of Lane were difficult and contentious, culminating in a mass student exodus over the issue of slavery, or more specifically whether students were permitted to discuss the topic publicly, the first major academic freedom incident in America. There was strong pro-slavery sentiment in Cincinnati, and the trustees immediately prohibited further discussion of the topic, to avoid repercussions. With the city being on the border of the South, a lot of fugitive slaves and freedmen went through Cincinnati, including James Bradley, who would participate in the pivotal Lane slavery debates in the 1830s. Their competition for jobs had led to the anti-abolitionist Cincinnati riots of 1829 and would soon produce the Cincinnati riots of 1836.

==Inauguration==

&quot;The founding of Lane Seminary was accomplished after years of sometimes disparate efforts on the part of a large number of people.&quot; The Presbyterian tradition was to have educated clergy, and there was no seminary serving the vast and increasingly populated lands west of the Allegheny Mountains. As early as 1825, the denomination was on record as saying such a seminary was needed. In 1829 there were only 8,000 ministers to serve a population of 12,000,000, two thousand more churches than ministers, and only 200 ministers per year being trained. While there were local efforts to have the new seminary in Cincinnati, the Presbyterian General Assembly decided in 1827 to locate it in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The western synods refused to accept this, finding it too far away.

In the summer of 1828 Ebenezer Lane, a New Orleans businessman, &quot;made known his interest in setting up a theological seminary near Cincinnati based on the manual labor system.&quot; He and his brother Lane pledged $4,000 for the new school, on condition that it be in Cincinnati and follow the manual labor model. After this, their connection with the Seminary was minimal; Ebenezer was not even happy that it carried his name. The land was donated by Kemper Seminary. &quot;Walnut Hill was a pretty little village, quite distant from Cincinnati, the first stopping-place for the stage on the Madisonville or some other northern Ohio route.&quot; &quot;The location of Lane Seminary is in the midst of a most beautiful landscape. There is just enough, and just the right admixture of hills and dale, forest and field, to give it the effect we love in gazing upon a calm and quiet scene of beauty,&quot; wrote a visiting minister in 1842.

A board was set up in October 1828, and the Ohio General Assembly issued a charter on February 11, 1829, specifying that the manual labor system would be &quot;the fundamental principle&quot; of the Seminary. The Rev. George C. Beckwith was appointed to a professorship in April, accepted in August, and he arrived in Cincinnati in the following November. He &quot;had 3 or 4 students during the winter.&quot; In July, 1830, Beckwith visited the Oneida Institute and wrote back to Cincinnati that manual labor worked well and that the farmers and mechanics of the neighborhood approved of it. He resigned in August 1830. &quot;At that time [1830], the seminary consisted of some woods and one foundation for a building.&quot;

In January, 1831, George Washington Gale, president of the Oneida Institute, recommended a steward to supervise the Seminary farm; in February the trustees made the appointment. But in the winter of 1830–31, &quot;Lane Seminary was in a state of suspended animation. There were no teachers and apparently only two students, Amos Dresser and Horace Bushnell, who had come out from the Oneida Institute and had been given special permission by the trustees to occupy rooms in the lonesome Seminary building.&quot; Bushnell, who on his arrival in 1830 &quot;found [at the embryonic Lane] no theology&quot;, slept &quot;on a study-table, with his books for a pillow&quot;.

In 1834, the manual labor department contained six printing presses, operated by 20 students, and had printed 150,000 copies of &quot;Webster&#x27;s spelling books&quot;, for a bookstore. 30 students were employed in cabinet making, and total enrollment before the mass walkout was about 100.

==The Oneida Institute and Lane==

By coincidence, the local efforts to set up a seminary fit with the desires of the Tappan philanthropists, Arthur and Lewis, to found a seminary in what was then the growing west of the new country.

The charismatic Theodore D. Weld had been one of the first Oneida students, first studying and working on George Washington Gale&#x27;s farm, then at Gale&#x27;s Oneida Institute of Science and Industry from its opening in 1827 through 1830. When he left Oneida, he was hired by the new Manual Labor Society, an institution created to employ Weld, its only employee ever. Funded by the same Tappan brothers that had funded Oneida, his charge was &quot;to find a site for a great national manual labor institution...where training for the western ministry could be provided for poor but earnest young men who had dedicated their lives to the home missionary cause in the &#x27;vast valley of the Mississippi&#x27;&quot;. Weld himself was seeking to continue his preparation for a career as a minister. As he put it in his report, &quot;though I can no longer publicly advocate it as the agent of your society, I hope soon to plead its cause in the humbler sphere of personal example, while pursuing my professional studies, in a rising institution at the west, in which manual labor is a DAILY REQUISITION.&quot;

&quot;Cincinnati was the logical location. Cincinnati was the focal center of population and commerce in the Ohio valley.&quot; In the pre-railroad era, Cincinnati was the most accessible city in what was then the west of the United States.

Weld stopped at Cincinnati twice on his manual labor lecture and scouting tour: in February and March 1832, and in the following September. On the earlier visit, when the campus was run by F. Y. Vail, who spent more time fundraising than teaching, he delivered several lectures and supported the call to famous revivalist Charles Grandison Finney to come west; Finney declined, though he did come three years later, as professor and later president of the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute. Weld&#x27;s second choice—and it was his choice, because the Tappans relied on his recommendations—was Lyman Beecher, father of Henry Ward Beecher, who would graduate from Lane, and Harriet Beecher Stowe; Lane had been trying to recruit him since February 1831. Lane, Weld concluded, would do as a manual labor theological school, if Beecher would come. &quot;Such an institution would undoubtedly attract many of Weld&#x27;s associates who had been disappointed in the failure to establish theological instruction at the Oneida Institute.&quot; Beecher did come, as president and as &quot;Chair of Systematic Theology&quot;, motivated by the promise of a $20,000 subvention for Lane from &quot;Tappan&quot;. Beecher, along with professor Thomas J. Biggs, future president of Cincinnati College, began as president December 26, 1832; this is when &quot;Lane actually began operation... Before that time, staff was slight and housing meager.&quot; The house the Beecher family lived in is now known as the Harriet Beecher Stowe House.

&quot;Lane was Oneida moved west.&quot; Early in June 1833, Weld, Robert L. Stanton, and &quot;six other young Finneyites&quot; arrived in Cincinnati, having completed their journey by river from Rochester and Oneida. &quot;They were promptly admitted to the seminary on the recommendation of two other &#x27;Oneidas&#x27; [Porter and Weed] already in attendance.&quot; However, although technically enrolled as a student, and having declined the chair of Sacred Rhetoric and Oratory, Weld was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of Lane; &quot;He...told the trustees what appointments to make.&quot; &quot;Many of the students considered him the real leader of Lane&quot;, their &quot;patron saint&quot;. &quot;In the estimation of the class, he was president. He took the lead of the whole institution. The young men had, many of them, been under his care, and they thought he was a god.&quot;

The tempo of the seminary was sharply stepped up, its real head now being on the ground. &quot;Weld is here &amp; we are glad,&quot; wrote Professor Biggs on July 2.

According to Beecher, &quot;among those students was an embodiment of a greater piety and talent than he had ever known to be collected in any other institution.&quot;

The self-assembling at Lane of men from very diverse places, called by a modern writer an invasion, was so colorful that multiple authors have described it. The earliest is from Weld himself; he is one of the &quot;two members&quot;:

A contemporary commentator points to the work on rafts as reflecting the students&#x27; experience with manual labor at Oneida.

A modern retelling of the same incident:


&quot;[T]he institution itself is second in importance to no other in the United States.&quot; Beecher &quot;assured us that he had more brains in this theological camp than could be found in any other in the United States.&quot;

Beecher, in his autobiography, takes a dig at Oberlin, while claiming that there were already &quot;colored students&quot; at Lane: &quot;It was with great difficulty, and only in the prospect of rich endowments and of securing a large class of students, that the principle of admission irrespective of color, already in practice at Lane, received from the trustees of Oberlin a cold and ambiguous sanction.&quot; What he says about Oberlin is roughly correct, but none of the black students at Oneida moved to Lane. The one black student currently known of at Lane, James Bradley, by his own description &quot;so ignorant, that I suppose it will take me two years to get up with the lowest class in the institution,&quot; despite Beecher&#x27;s regret felt it wiser not to attend a student gathering at Beecher&#x27;s home.

==The slavery debates==
Lane Seminary is known primarily for the debates held there over 18 evenings in February 1834; John Rankin was in attendance, as was Harriet Beecher Stowe, daughter of Lane&#x27;s president. They were nominally on the topic of colonization of freed slaves, on sending them to (not &quot;back to&quot;) Africa.

They were publicized nationally and influenced the nation&#x27;s thinking about slavery, creating support for abolition. A four-page report by H. B. Stanton appeared in March in both &quot;The Liberator&quot; and the &quot;New York Evangelist,&quot; and Garrison and Knapp, printers of &quot;The Liberator&quot; and most books on slavery in the U.S. in the early 1830s, issued it in pamphlet form. A seven-page response, under the title &quot;Education and slavery&quot;, appeared in the Cincinnati-based &quot;Western Monthly Magazine&quot;; Weld published a lengthy reply. The affair got further publicity late in 1834, when 51 of the Lane students — the vast majority — published a 28-page pamphlet, &quot;A statement of the reasons which induced the students of Lane Seminary, to dissolve their connection with that institution&quot; (Cincinnati, 1834).

===Background===
====The abolition–colonization controversy====
Part of &quot;the negro problem&quot;, as it was seen in the antebellum United States, was the question of what to do with former slaves who had become free. Since the eighteenth century, Quakers and others had preached the sinfulness of slave ownership, and the number of freedmen (and freed women) was rising and showed every sign that it would continue to grow. The freed slaves married and had children, so the number of free people of color (Blacks born free) was rising even faster. Some owners freed their slaves in their wills. Philanthropic societies and individuals raised or donated funds to purchase slaves&#x27; freedom; freedmen sometimes were able to purchase the freedom of family members. In some Northern cities there were more than a handful of escaped slaves.

The status of these free blacks was anything but comfortable. They were not citizens and in most states could not vote. They had no access to the courts or protection by the police. In no state could their children attend the public schools. They were subject to discriminatory treatment in everyday life.

The original &quot;remedy&quot; for this problem was to help them go &quot;back to Africa&quot;. The British had been doing this, in Sierra Leone, moving former American slaves there who had gained their freedom by escaping to British lines during the American Revolution, and who found Nova Scotia, where the British took many of them, too cold. The British also took to Sierra Leone slaves captured from slaving ships who were being smuggled illegally across the Atlantic to North America. A well-to-do African-American shipowner, Paul Cuffe, transported some former slaves to Sierra Leone.

However, sending former slaves to a British colony as a policy was politically unacceptable. The American Colonization Society was formed to help found a new, American colony of freed blacks. Although there was some talk of locating the colony in the American territories of the Midwest, or on the Pacific coast—a sort of reservation for Blacks—what was decided was to follow the English example and start an African colony. The closest available land was what became Liberia.

====The rejection of colonization====
The colonization project got off to a promising start, with various governmental and private donations and the participation of distinguished individuals: U.S. presidents Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison; Senator Henry Clay, who presided over its first meeting; as well as most of the future white abolitionists. The problem had been solved, and in an honorable way; the former slaves would fare better in Africa, it was argued, among other blacks.

The situation quickly started to unravel. First of all, the disease rates among the new colonists were the highest since accurate record-keeping began. Over 50% of them died of malaria and other diseases.

Particularly telling to Gerrit Smith, an abolitionist philanthropist, was that the American Colonization Society allowed the sale of alcohol (as well as guns and chewing tobacco) in the colonies that became Liberia. He commented on it in the Society&#x27;s &quot;African Repository&quot; magazine. Smith was for temperance, and according to him, the fact that blacks in Africa were allowed to import liquor from the United States revealed the true goals of many of the white members of the American Colonization Society: to get rid of the Blacks without having them up north.

===Weld organizes &quot;debates&quot;===
Lyman Beecher, head of the Seminary, was a colonizationist, and gave a speech on that topic to the Cincinnati Colonization Society on June 4, 1834. At Lane there was a &quot;colonization society&quot;, supporting the efforts of the American Colonization Society to send free blacks to Africa, to Liberia. How it came to be is not known, but it was there when the Oneida contingent and friends arrived. There had been similar groups at Western Reserve and other colleges.

Weld read William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s new abolitionist newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, begun in 1831, and his &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization&quot;, which appeared in 1832. These had a great influence at the other eastern Ohio college, Western Reserve College, leading to Beriah Green&#x27;s four published sermons, and his relocation under pressure to Gale&#x27;s school, Oneida. What Garrison desired, and he convinced Green, was &quot;immediatism&quot;: immediate, complete, and uncompensated freeing of all slaves.

Over a period of several months Weld convinced nearly all of the students individually of the superiority of the abolitionist view. To generate publicity for the abolitionist cause, Weld announced a series of &quot;debates&quot;. Weld &quot;had no intention of holding a debate on the pros and cons of antislavery.&quot; &quot;There was little opposition, little conflict, and consequently little debate.&quot; In his correspondence Weld informed friends that he was trying to get the anti-slavery (immediatist) argument and evidence out to as many people as possible. Nevertheless, what was announced was debates, on two points.

When the merits of the proposed solutions to slavery were debated over 18 days at the Seminary in February 1834, it was one of the first major public discussions of the topic, but it was more of an anti-slavery revival than a &quot;debate&quot;. No speaker appeared to defend either American slavery or the colonization project.

===The stated topics of the debates===
The two specific questions addressed were:

* &quot;Ought the people of the slaveholding states abolish slavery immediately?&quot;, and
* &quot;Are the doctrines, tendencies, and measures of the American Colonization Society, and the influence of its principal supporters, such as render it worthy of the patronage of the Christian public?&quot;

The debates were not transcribed, and there was no attempt afterwards, as there would be later with Pennsylvania Hall, to collect the texts which were written out — not all were — and make a booklet of them. However, Garrison promptly published a pamphlet, and there are excerpts in newspapers and books.

Each question was debated for two and a half hours a night for nine nights. Among the participants:

* Eleven had been born and brought up in slave states.
* Seven were sons of slaveowners.
* One had only recently ceased to be a slaveowner.
* One, Bradley, had been a slave and had bought his freedom.
* Ten had lived in slave states.
* One, Birney, had been an agent of the Colonization Society.

Arguments addressing the first question in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery included:

* Slaves long for freedom.
* When inspired with a promise of freedom, slaves will toil with incredible alacrity and faithfulness.
* No matter how kind their master is, slaves are dissatisfied and would rather be hired servants than slaves.
* Blacks are abundantly able to take care of and provide for themselves.
* Blacks would be kind and docile if immediately emancipated.

In response to the second question, the Reverend Samuel H. Cox, who had served as an agent for the Colonization Society, testified that his view of the Society&#x27;s plan changed when he realized that no blacks, despite the claims of those who ventured to speak for them, would ever consent to be removed from their native country and transplanted to a foreign land. He reasoned, therefore, that the plan could only be enacted by a &quot;national society of kidnappers&quot;.

===Participants===

====Notable people present====
&quot;The President, and the members of the faculty, with one exception [Biggs, an &quot;implacable foe&quot; of abolitionism], were present during parts of the discussion.&quot;
* Gamaliel Bailey, physician, lecturer on physiology at Lane, who went on to become an abolitionist newspaper editor.
* Harriet Beecher Stowe, at that time simply Harriet Beecher, daughter of Lane&#x27;s president; 18 years later published &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.
* Henry Ward Beecher, alumnus, minister, called, after his father Lyman, &quot;the most noted minister of the nineteenth century&quot;. Supported sending rifles (&quot;Beecher&#x27;s Bibles&quot;) to emigrants trying to make Kansas a free state.
* Lyman Beecher, president of Lane, father of Henry and Harriet.
* James G. Birney, attorney, former American Colonization Society Agent, author of a lengthy published break with or attack on the Society. &quot;His knowledge and pervasive influence informed the Lane Seminary debate, lifting it to the height of its subject.&quot;
* James Bradley (former slave), the only Black participant.
* Samuel Crothers (probable but unconfirmed)
* Amos Dresser, Lane student; would become famous for being publicly whipped in Nashville, Tennessee, for distributing abolitionist literature.
* Huntington Lyman
* Asa Mahan, minister, and the only Lane trustee who supported the students; resigned with the students and accompanied them to the Oberlin Collegiate Institute, becoming its first president.
* John Rankin (abolitionist), author of the first American anti-slavery book, and key figure on the Underground Railroad in Ohio. In 1835 Rankin published a pamphlet defending the students who debated.
* Henry Brewster Stanton, future abolitionist speaker and politician, and husband of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
* Calvin Ellis Stowe, Lane professor, future husband of Harriet Beecher.
* Theodore Dwight Weld, former Oneida student, anti-slavery activist.
* Hiram Wilson, former Oneida student; moved to Canada and ran Canadian terminus for the Underground Railroad.

===Speakers at the debates===

* &quot;Mr. Henry P. Thompson, a native and still a resident of Nicholasville, Kentucky, made the following statement at a public meeting in Lane Seminary, Ohio, in 1833 [1834]. He was at that time a slaveholder.&quot;

* &quot;Rev. Coleman S. Hodges, a resident of Western Virginia, gave the following testimony at the same meeting:&quot;

*&quot;Mr. Calvin H. Tate, of Missouri, whose father and brother were slaveholders, related the following at the same meeting. The plantation on which it occurred, was in the immediate neighborhood of his father&#x27;s.&quot;

* The most notable speaker at the debates was James Bradley, as he was the only Black participant and so far as is known the only Black in attendance. This is the first instance in the history of the United States that a Black man addressed a white audience:

===Sequela (the following events)===
The debates were closely followed by the national press and the religious community.

&quot;The trustees soon expressed a determination to prevent all further discussion of the comparative merits of the policy of the Colonization Society, and the doctrine of immediate emancipation, either in the recitation rooms, the rooms of the students, or at the public table; although no objection had previously been made to the free discussion of any subject whatever. During the vacation that followed, in the absence of a majority of the professors, this purpose was framed into a law, or rule, of the seminary, and obedience to it required from all.&quot;

The trustees laid down the doctrine that &quot;no associations or societies ought to be allowed in the seminary, except such as have for their immediate object, improvement in the prescribed course of 
studies.&quot; This was followed by an order in these words: &quot;Ordered that the students be required to discontinue those societies [the Anti-slavery and Colonization societies] in the seminary.&quot;

The event resulted in the dismissal of a professor, John Morgan, and the departure of a group of 40 students and a trustee. It was one of the first significant tests in the United States of academic freedom and the right of students to participate in free discussion. It also marked the first organized student body in American history. Several of those involved went on to play an important role in the abolitionist movement and the buildup to the American Civil War.

At the end of the debate, many of the participants concluded not only that slavery was a sin, but also that the policy of the American Colonization Society to send blacks to Africa was wrong. As a result, these students formed an antislavery society and began organizing activities and outreach work among the black population of Cincinnati. They intended to attain the emancipation of blacks, not by rebellion or force, but by &quot;approaching the minds of slave holders with the truth, in the spirit of the Gospel.&quot;

==After the debates==

===Activities in the black community===
&quot;We believe faith without works is dead,&quot; Weld wrote to Arthur Tappan in 1834. He, Augustus Wattles, and other students created a school out of three rooms, and raised hundreds of dollars to outfit a library and rent classrooms. Classes were run both days and evenings, and the school was soon at capacity. Inspired by Prudence Crandall&#x27;s example, he also set up a school for black women, and Arthur Tappan paid $1,000 () for four female teachers to relocate from New York to Cincinnati. As Lewis Tappan put it in his biography of his brother, &quot;[T]he anti-slavery students of Lane Seminary established evening-schools for the adults, and day-schools for the children of the three thousand colored of Cincinnati.&quot;

Weld continued to Tappan:

===The threat of violence===
Cincinnati was convulsed as never before. Rumors circulated during the summer of 1834 about mob violence against the Seminary; the threat of violence had caused Miami University of Ohio to ban the discussion of abolition. Cincinnati, largely pro-Southern, had already experienced the anti-black Cincinnati riot of 1829; and the huge anti-abolition riots in New York in July 1834, which specifically targeted the Tappans, were heavily reported in the Cincinnati newspapers. In 1835, after the whipping of Amos Dresser, a Lane student, in Nashville, newspapers of that city &quot;warn[ed] the leaders of that institution to be cautious how they proceed.&quot;

===Trustees ban the discussion of abolition===
As Cincinnati businessmen, the members of the school&#x27;s board of trustees were quite concerned about being associated with such a radical expression of abolitionism, which could have led to a physical attack on the Seminary. &quot;A riot was very [narrowly] averted, probably only because of Lane&#x27;s summer vacation.&quot;

President Beecher did not want to escalate the matter by overreacting, but when the press began to turn public opinion against the students that summer, he was fundraising in Boston. In his absence, the executive committee of the trustees issued a report ordering the abolishment of the school&#x27;s antislavery society, stating that &quot;no associations or Societies among the students ought to be allowed in the Seminary except such as have for their immediate object improvement in the prescribed course of studies.&quot; They also declared that they had the right to dismiss any student &quot;when they shall think it necessary to do so.&quot; They further adopted a rule to &quot;discourage...such discussions and conduct among the students as are calculated to divert their attention from their studies&quot;, meaning that students were not to discuss abolitionism even when dining (talking to students while they were eating was specifically prohibited in the Standing Rules enacted by the trustees on October 13, 1834.) The committee underlined their position by dismissing professor John Morgan for taking the side of the students. In October, without waiting for Beecher to return, the board ratified the committee&#x27;s resolutions.

On his return, Beecher and two professors issued a statement intended to assuage the anger of the students regarding the action of the trustees, but it was regarded by the students as a faculty endorsement of the trustees&#x27; action.

===The &quot;Lane Rebels&quot; resign===
On October 21, most of the students resigned, as did trustee Asa Mahan (another member of Finney&#x27;s contingent). (Technically, they requested dismissal from the school, which was granted.) In December they published a pamphlet of 28 pages, published anonymously but written by Weld, on &quot;the reasons which induced the students of Lane Seminary, to dissolve their connection with that institution.&quot; The pamphlet received national attention, as it was reprinted in full in &quot;The Liberator&quot;.

Hostile press reports turned this incorrectly into the expulsion of the students, &quot;in consequence of the dangerous principles they held in relation to slavery.&quot;

The Rebels were a loosely defined group, and different sources give different names and figures. The &quot;Statement&quot; had 51 signatures, but it adds that &quot;several of our brethren, who coincide with us in sentiment, are not able to affix their names to this document, in consequence of being several hundred miles from the Seminary.&quot; According to Lane, there were 40, including the entirety of Lane&#x27;s first class, the class of 1836 (which began in 1833). There were also prospective students who declined to enroll. Lawrence Lesick, author of the only book on the Lane Rebels, gives a figure of 75, but 19 more had left before the trustees took action, and only 8 students, out of 103, remained at Lane at the beginning of the next term. According to Oberlin, 32 of them enrolled, although some others who enrolled at the same time, though not students at Lane, are considered part of the Rebels. A few enrolled at other schools, such as Auburn Theological Seminary.

Weld and some other student leaders at Lane — William T. Allan, Weld&#x27;s collaborator and president of Lane&#x27;s new anti-slavery society; James A. Thome, a prominent speaker during the debates; and Henry B. Stanton — had been threatened with expulsion. Weld did not withdraw until the motion to expel him, which would have been nationally publicized, had been defeated.

===The &quot;seminary&quot; at Cumminsville===
About a dozen of the Lane Rebels, as they came to be called, established an informal seminary of their own in 1834–1835, in Cumminsville, Ohio. &quot;We went out, not knowing whither we went. The Lord&#x27;s hand was with us. Five miles from the seminary we found a deserted brick tavern, with many convenient rooms. Here we rallied. A gentleman of the vicinity offered us all necaessary fuel, a gentleman far off [Lewis Tappan] sent us a thousand dollars, and we set up a seminary of our own and became a law unto ourselves. George Whipple was competent in Hebrew, and William T. Allan in Greek. They were made professors in the intermediate state. It was desirable that we should remain near to Cincinnati for a season, as we were there teaching in evening schools for the colored people of that city.&quot;

At Cumminsville, &quot;the students continued their work in the black community. William T. Allan, Andrew Benton, Marius R. Robinson, Henry B. Stanton, and George Whipple taught in the Sabbath schools. John W. Alvord, Huntington Lyman, Henry B. Stanton, James A. Thome, and Samuel Wells gave lectures twice a week in the black community. The students also alternated in preaching at eight different churches, including two black churches. They helped support Augustus Wattles&#x27; teachers in schools, enlisted the cooperation of local black ministers, and kept Weld, now an anti-slavery agent, and Joshua Leavitt informed of local events.&quot;

This was the point at which the former Lane students came into contact with John J. Shipherd, founder of the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute, &quot;a college in name only&quot; that had been founded the previous year (1833). &quot;The former Lane students literally took possession of the embryo institution.&quot;

===The conditions of the Lane Rebels&#x27; enrollment at Oberlin===
The students negotiated with Shipherd the installation of Asa Mahan, the Lane trustee who resigned, as Oberlin&#x27;s president. Oberlin also agreed to hire Morgan, the discharged professor. The trustees would not have the power, as they did at Lane, to meddle in the affairs of professors and students. The most controversial condition insisted on by the Rebels was that Oberlin commit itself to accepting African-American students in general, and the very popular James Bradley in particular, equally. This was agreed to reluctantly, after a &quot;dramatic&quot; vote (4–4, tie broken by chair).

The Lane Rebels, with Weld at their head, could insist on these conditions because funding from the Tappans came with them. If the trustees did not agree they would lose this crucial funding, as well as Mahan, Finney, and Shipherd, who threatened to quit.

The conditions of the Rebels set limits, for the first time, on an American college&#x27;s authority over students and faculty. They also were part of the shift in American antislavery efforts from colonization to abolition; many of the Rebels would become part of Oberlin&#x27;s cadre of minister–abolitionists.
==The Seminary after 1834==
When the Rebels departed in October 1834, &quot;they left behind them but two seminarians in a theological department that had boasted forty, and only five scholars of the sixty formerly enrolled for the literary curriculum.&quot;

&quot;Of the several gloomy years that succeeded the abolition secession, I need only say, that the wonder is, that Lane did not perish. It had few students and little money.&quot;
 &quot;The institution was disgraced and wrecked; it 
never recovered from the experience.&quot;

In 1837 &quot;the seminary had no students&quot;, but Beecher went on a recruiting trip and persuaded some to enroll.

Following the slavery debates, Lane Seminary continued as a &quot;New School&quot; seminary, cooperating with Congregationalists and others in mission and education efforts and involved in social reform movements like abolition, temperance, and Sabbath legislation. The seminary admitted students from other denominations and pursued educational and evangelistic unity among Protestant churches in the West. In 1837 there were 41 students from 15 states, and 4 faculty: Beecher, Calvin Ellis Stowe, Thomas J. Biggs, and Baxter Dickinson.

After the Civil War, the New School and the Old School Presbyterians had reconciled, and Lane Seminary was reorganized along more conservative Presbyterian lines. In 1910, it became affiliated with the Presbyterian Seminary of the South, and the Seminary continued as a small but respected school, though financial pressures continued to increase. Following a brief period of growth in the 1920s, it became apparent that Lane could no longer survive as an independent school. In 1932 it suspended operations and transferred its library and other resources to McCormick Theological Seminary, in Chicago. While a permanent Board of Trustees for Lane Theological Seminary remained in service until the Seminary was legally merged out of existence in 2007, the faculty, library collections, and students were transferred to Chicago, and the last remnants of the Cincinnati campus, except for the house of president Lyman Beecher, were destroyed in 1956. A historical marker in front of an automobile dealership at 2820 Gilbert Ave. marks the site of the campus.

==Historical re-enactments==
The Lane Debates have been re-enacted in recent years by historians from Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and Oberlin College.

==Media==
A movie about the debates, &quot;Sons &amp; Daughters of Thunder&quot;, was released in December 2019. It is based on a play by Earlene Hawley and Curtis Heeter.

==Archival material==
Archival materials of Lane are located at the Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia.

==Students who enrolled at Lane==
24 of the 40 members of Lane&#x27;s first theological class were from the Oneida Institute. So far as is known, none of Oneida&#x27;s African-American students made the move. Those identified conclusively are the following. Those that left with the Lane Rebels (according to the table cited above) and enrolled at Oberlin are marked in bold.
*William T. Allan (1810–1882) did not study at Oneida. He met Weld when the latter stayed at his parents&#x27; house during his manual labor tour. He attended Centre College but moved to Lane, probably through Weld&#x27;s influence. He graduated from Oberlin in 1836.
*John Watson Alvord (1807–1880), was one of the five students Weld enrolled to travel Ohio lecturing against slavery. Studied at Oneida; graduated from Oberlin; pastor in Connecticut and Massachusetts; superintendent of the schools of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, 1866–1870.
*George Bristol
*Charles P. Bush; Michigan politician

*Russell Jesse Judd
*John J. Miter
*Joseph Hitchcock Payne
*Ezra Abell Poole
*Samuel Fuller Porter
*Charles Stewart Renshaw

*Asa A. Stone, †1835 Stone published two lengthy letters reporting on Southern slavery. 
*Sereno Wright Streeter (1810–1880) graduated from Oberlin and was ordained in 1836. After much organizing work and several ministerial positions, he was professor at Otterbein College from 1857 to 1860.
*James A. Thome, of Kentucky
*Calvin Waterbury
*Augustus Wattles
*Edward Weed. &quot;There was a town gathering at Chillicothe on the same day of last week, when Mr. Weed arrived in town on some business; and being known as an abolitionist, some indignities were offered to him—such as shaving his horse, removing the wheels of his wagon, &amp;c.; that Mr. Weed soon after left town, was followed by the mob, his wagon broken to pieces, his horse killed, and at length &quot;himself suspended to a tree by a rope of bark,&quot; until he was dead.&quot; (italics in original)
*Theodore Dwight Weld
*Samuel T. Wells, described as &quot;student monitor-general&quot; on Lane&#x27;s farm
*George Whipple &quot;abandoned his school in Kentucky to study theology and teach elementary courses at the seminary&quot;. Later he taught at Oberlin.

<text>Goma-2 was a type of high explosive manufactured for industrial use (chiefly mining) by Unión Española de Explosivos S.A.

It was a gelatinous, nitroglycol-based explosive widely used within Spain and exported abroad.
It was used by ETA in the 1980s and 1990s.

There were two variants of Goma-2: Goma-2 EC and Goma-2 ECO. As of 2017, the manufacturer MAXAM Corp. S. L. has reformulated the Goma-type ammonia gelatine dynamites which are marketed worldwide under the new Riodin trade name.

Goma-2 explosive was a mixture of several chemicals:
*Ammonium nitrate - 60–70%
*Nitroglycol - 26–34%
*Nitrocellulose - 0.5–2%
*Dibutyl phthalate - 1–3%
*Fuels - 1–3%

As with other commercial blasting explosives, detonators were needed to initiate a detonation (usually a blasting cap # 8).

==Terrorist use==
Goma-2 ECO was the explosive that was used in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Terrorist Jamal Ahmidan, also known as El Chino, bought the explosive illegally from a mine in northern Spain. It was also planned by the same cell that carried out the Madrid bombings to use the explosive to derail a high-speed train. In 1973, about 80 kilograms of the explosive was used by ETA in Operation Ogro to assassinate Luis Carrero Blanco. The explosion was so powerful it threw Blanco&#x27;s car over a five story building.

<text>Uncle Fester is the pen name of Steve Preisler, author of such controversial books as &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot; and &quot;Silent Death&quot;.

==Biography==
Preisler gained underground fame after publishing his first book &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot; in the early 1980s. He says that he got the nickname &quot;Uncle Fester&quot; from his college years, since he was very well known for producing explosives, and blowing things up, like the character in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

Preisler is an industrial chemist working in an electroplating factory he calls &quot;the rat hole.&quot; In his spare time, he writes books. Preisler graduated in 1981 from Marquette University with a Chemistry &amp; Biology degree. Two years later, he was arrested for methamphetamine possession and was sentenced to probation. He was arrested again in 1984 for methamphetamine charges, and put in the Waupun Correctional Institution. He says that the arrest was over a few grams of methamphetamine, but the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) brought back credit card information saying that he had been buying large quantities of ephedrine, which is a precursor for methamphetamine.

Outraged, Fester borrowed a typewriter from a fellow inmate, and began writing the manuscript for &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot;. Loompanics Unlimited published the book, and it was an instant success. &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot; is now in its eighth edition. It was one of Loompanics&#x27; best sellers. The book has information on how to produce crystal methamphetamine through six different methods. It also has data on how to synthesize MDMA or MDA, and how to synthesize methcathinone by oxidation of ephedrine. It also contains syntheses for precursor materials such as phenylacetone, ephedrine, methylamine, and alkyl nitrites. Previous editions of &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot; have had some criticism: see for example Eleusis v. Fester for discussion between Fester and the past MDMA clandestine chemist Eleusis/Zwitterion.

===Books===
Uncle Fester has since written six other books:

* &quot;Home Workshop Explosives&quot; details how the underground chemist can easily manufacture explosives. It describes manufacture of nitroglycerin as well as syntheses for RDX, ammonium nitrate, acetone peroxide blasting caps, nitroglycol, mannitol hexanitrate or nitromannitol, and PETN. It also has information on how to purify glycerin, how to synthesize nitric acid with minimal equipment, and how to make a fuel-air explosive (commonly known as an FAE). One reviewer of &quot;Home Workshop Explosives&quot; (David Harber, author of &quot;Guerrilla&#x27;s Arsenal&quot;) notes that although the chemistry is solid, the chapter on detonation systems &quot;borders on insanity.&quot;
* &quot;Silent Death&quot; describes routes for manufacturing nerve gases (such as tabun and sarin gas), botulinum (botulin toxin), ricin, phosgene, arsine, and other poisons.
* &quot;Vest Busters&quot;, Fester&#x27;s smallest book, describes easy methods for manufacturing steel bullets using a lathe and methods of coating them with Teflon. Both velocity and the strength of a bullet&#x27;s core are the two most significant factors in determining whether a bullet has armor-piercing capabilities. However, coating a bullet with Teflon has no effect on armor penetration, and that Fester&#x27;s statement that &quot;Coating a bullet with Teflon would raise it one level higher&quot; is false. As well, hard armor would render handguns a moot point against the plate anyhow. 
* &quot;Practical LSD Manufacture&quot; is one of Fester&#x27;s more famous books. It deals with how one could manufacture a large quantity of LSD. This book is filled up with most of the hard-to-understand information on LSD syntheses that is currently available. The book has production information for the drug TMA-2 and plenty of information about how to isolate lysergic acid from morning glory seeds and other plant material. This work is not without its criticisms: the use of more outdated syntheses from the 1950s and 1960s, lacking the synthesis using POCl3 as a dehydrating reagent in the condensation between diethylamine and lysergic acid; the speculation about &quot;Method X&quot; is erroneous, as propionic anhydride is used in the synthesis of fentanyl analogues; and there is some confusion over stereoisomers by Fester. These criticisms are addressed in the third edition of the book.
* &quot;Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Psychedelic &amp; Amphetamine Manufacture&quot;, an &#x27;add-on&#x27; for &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot;, provides a more advanced method of synthesizing methamphetamine using what is called &quot;The Fester Formula,&quot; which describes how to manufacture methamphetamine through an electric synthesis. The book also covers many alternative methods for manufacturing phenylacetone and methylamine. One chapter of the book, &quot;A Convenient Tabletop MDA Synthesis,&quot; describes an alternative method for synthesizing MDA in a small area such as a dorm room using raney nickel which is extremely dangerous.
* &quot;Bloody Brazilian Knife Fightin&#x27; Techniques&quot;, his newest book, covers methods for common fighting techniques from Brazil. Here Fester talks about some of his adventures in Brazil with some Brazilian friends and how he learned some lethal techniques in knife fighting. In an interview with Fox News it was described as a &quot;flop&quot;, and Preisler said, &quot;If it&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s not selling. Never go outside of your genre&quot;.

Preisler was arrested at his home in Green Bay on July 14, 2023. He was charged on July 17. Two years after his interview with Vice TV, where he showed how to cook meth, just without finishing the cook. 

==Documentary==
Preisler was the object of the 40-minute documentary film &quot;Friction&quot;, by Robert Ellman, made at a cost of approximately $300,000, whose premiere on Czech Television was cancelled after the September 11 attacks rendered the topic &quot;politically incorrect&quot;.

Preisler was also featured in season 3 episode 2 of VICE&#x27;s &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s Pharmacopeia&quot;, which covered the production process, history, and several users&#x27; experience of methamphetamine.

<text>Link TV, originally WorldLink TV, was a non-commercial American satellite television network providing what it described as &quot;diverse perspectives on world and national issues.&quot; It was carried nationally on DirecTV (ch. 375) until January 2023 and on Dish Network (ch. 9410) until November 1, 2023. Link TV was launched as a daily, 24-hour non-commercial network on December 15, 1999. It received no money from the satellite providers, but relies instead on contributions from viewers and foundations.

Link TV broadcast a mix of documentaries, global and national news, music of diverse cultures, and programs promoting citizen action. The network also aired English language news from Al Jazeera English, Deutsche Welle, NHK and France 24, as well as various documentaries and world music videos. Select Link TV programs were streamed on the Internet, via the channel&#x27;s website.

The network also produced &quot;&quot;, a program of translated news reports from the Middle East.

==History==
Direct satellite broadcasters were mandated to set aside 4% of its channel space for noncommercial educational and informational programming. ITVS, Internews Network and Internews Interactive joined in forming Link Media Inc. to program a channel, WorldLink TV, for this mandate. WorldLink TV was one of the nine channels select to meet the mandate for DirecTV.

In October 2012, Link TV announced that it was merging with KCET, an independent public television station in Los Angeles, to form a new nonprofit entity, to be called KCETLink. The entity was headquartered at KCET&#x27;s Burbank facilities. In 2018, KCETLink merged with the KOCE-TV Foundation to form the Public Media Group of Southern California.

The channel was removed from the DirecTV lineup on January 15, 2023, as Link TV has chosen not to renew its yearly public interest contract with the satellite provider. On November 1, 2023, due to financial issues, Link TV ceased broadcasting on satellite television, with the website recommending viewers to watch licensed programs on the websites and channels of their original broadcasters while the Public Media Group seeks alternative methods to continue operations. 

== Production and projects ==
In 2010, Link TV announced the launch of ViewChange.org, an online video platform funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation that aims to raise awareness of global development issues. It applies Semantic Web technology to video, in order to automatically create links to related content from other online sources.

In conjunction with the New York City Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, LinkTV broadcast a &quot;Youth Producing Change&quot; program which showcases the works of youth from all over the world. They also support efforts to fund groups such as imMEDIAte Justice Productions which help youth create their own film works.

Production facilities for Link TV are in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Burbank, California.

<doc id="608253" wikidata="Q125168" url="?curid=608253" title="Marshal of the Soviet Union">
<text>Marshal of the Soviet Union (, ) was the second-highest military rank of the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin wore the uniform and insignia of Marshal after World War II.

The rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union was created in 1935 and abolished in 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved. Forty-one people held this rank. The equivalent naval rank was until 1955 admiral of the fleet and from 1955 Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union.

==History of the rank==

The military rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union was established by a decree of the Soviet Cabinet, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (&quot;Sovnarkom&quot;), on 22 September 1935. On 20 November, the rank was conferred on five people: People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence and veteran Bolshevik Kliment Voroshilov, chief of the General Staff of the Red Army Alexander Yegorov, and three senior commanders, Vasily Blyukher, Semyon Budyonny, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky.

Of these, Blyukher, Tukhachevsky, and Yegorov were executed during Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of 1937–38. On 7 May 1940, three new marshals were appointed: the new People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence, Semyon Timoshenko, Boris Shaposhnikov, and Grigory Kulik.

During World War II, Kulik was demoted for incompetence, and the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union was given to a number of military commanders who earned it on merit. These included Georgy Zhukov, Ivan Konev and Konstantin Rokossovsky to name a few. In 1943, Stalin himself was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union, and in 1945, he was joined by his intelligence and police chief Lavrentiy Beria. These non-military marshals were joined in 1947 by politician Nikolai Bulganin.

Two Marshals were executed in postwar purges: Kulik in 1950 and Beria in 1953, following Stalin&#x27;s death. Thereafter the rank was awarded only to professional soldiers, with the exception of Leonid Brezhnev, who made himself a marshal in 1976, and Dmitry Ustinov, who was prominent in the arms industry and was appointed Minister of Defence in July 1976. The last Marshal of the Soviet Union was Dmitry Yazov, appointed in 1990, who was imprisoned after the failed coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev committed suicide in 1991 during the fall of the Soviet Union.

The Marshals fell into three generational groups.

* Those who had gained their reputations during the Russian Civil War. These included both those who were purged in 1937–38 (Blyukher, Tukhachevsky, and Yegorov), and those who held high commands in the early years of World War II (Budyonny, Kulik, Shaposhnikov, Timoshenko and Voroshilov). All of the latter except Shaposhnikov and Timoshenko proved out-of-step with modern warfare and were removed from commanding positions.
* Those who built their reputations during World War II and assumed high commands in the latter part of the war. These included Zhukov, Vasilevsky, Konev, Rokossovsky, Malinovsky, Tolbukhin, Govorov, and Meretskov.
* Those who assumed high command during the Cold War era. All were officers in World War II, but their higher commands were held in the Warsaw Pact or as Soviet defence ministers. These included Sokolovsky, Grechko, Yakubovsky, Kulikov, Ogarkov, Akhromeyev, and Yazov.

All marshals in the third category had been officers in World War II, except Ustinov, who had been People&#x27;s Commissar for Armaments. Even Yazov, who was 20 when the war ended, had been a platoon commander. Brezhnev was not a professional soldier, but was still commissioned as a political commissar in the war.

Of the 35 Marshals who were career soldiers, the majority were of Russian origin. Timoshenko (Tymoshenko), Kulik (Kulyk), Grechko (Hrechko), Yeremenko (Yeryomenko), Moskalenko, Batitsky (Batytsʹkyy) and Koshevoy (Koshovyy) were of Ukrainian origin, while Sokolovsky (Sakaloŭski) and Yakubovsky (Jakuboŭski) had Belarusian origins. Rokossovsky (Rokossowski) was born in Congress Poland to a Polish family, while Malinovsky (Malinowsky) was born in Odessa (now in Ukraine) to a Polish father. Tukhachevsky also had Polish ancestry. Bagramyan (Baghramyan) was the sole marshal of Armenian origin.

The rank was abolished with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. It was succeeded in modern Russia by the rank of Marshal of the Russian Federation, which has been held by only one person, Igor Sergeyev, who was Russia&#x27;s defence minister from 1997 to 2001. There have been no living marshals since Yazov&#x27;s death in February 2020.

<text>Onyx is an American hardcore hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1988 by Fredro Starr, Suavé (also known as Sonny Seeza) and the late Big DS. Sticky Fingaz joined the group in 1991.

They are best known for their 1993 platinum hit single &quot;Slam&quot;, which &quot;The Source&quot; magazine described as a song that introduced the art of slam dancing into hip-hop. The group has released eight studio albums, three of which have charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart Top 25. Their debut album, &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;, has been certified platinum, won Best Rap Album at the Soul Train Music Awards and was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Best Rap Albums.

They have been quoted as describing their style as loud screaming, aggression, fighting with each other, stage diving, throwing water, rapping with grimy voices, and bald head fashion.

== History ==
Onyx was formed in 1988 by schoolmates Fredro Starr, Sonny Seeza, and Big DS. They decided to name the band after the onyx stone. The band began recording their first demos in the basement of B-Wiz with drum machine beats from an SP-12. In 1989, Onyx signed Jeffrey Harris as their manager, who helped them secure a contract with the label Profile Records. On April 25, 1990, the group released their first single, &quot;Ah, And We Do It Like This&quot;, to low sales. 

On July 13, 1991, while in a traffic jam at The Jones Beach GreekFest Festival, the band members met music producer Jam Master Jay, who agreed to give them two months to submit a demo to his record company. When the deadline came, Seeza and Big DS couldn&#x27;t make it to the studio to record the demo, so Jeffrey Harris, the manager of Onyx, asked Fredro to come to the studio with his cousin, Kirk Jones, who at the time was doing a solo career under the name Trop. Fredro and Jones recorded two records for the demo, &quot;Stik &#x27;N&#x27; Muve&quot; and &quot;Exercise&quot;. 

The demo was accepted by Jam Master Jay, who signed the band to his record label, Jam Master Jay Records. Jones subsequently joined the band with the stage name Sticky Fingaz. In 1991 the band lost all of its records when its music producer, B-Wiz, was killed while selling cocaine in Baltimore. Later that year, Onyx hired Chyskillz as its new music producer.

In 1993, Onyx released their debut album, entitled &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;. The album proved to be successful, receiving a platinum certification from the RIAA and peaked at #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the group&#x27;s highest debut at that point. In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot;. Three of the album&#x27;s songs reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts; &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, &quot;Slam&quot;, and &quot;Shiftee&quot;. Their breakout single, &quot;Slam&quot;, was aired on MTV and BET, causing the song to reach #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Slam&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA on August 10, 1993. In 1994, Big DS left the group to start a solo career, producing music under his own record label called Illyotic Music. 

In 1995 Onyx released its second album, &quot;All We Got Iz Us&quot;, and founded its own record label, Armee Records, distributed through MCA Records. Through its record label, the band produced music by Gang Green, All City, Panama P.I., and Choclatt. In April 1995 Marvel Music, a short-lived imprint of Marvel Comics, released a comic book based on the band called &quot;Onyx: Fight!&quot;. Written by Karl Bollers and drawn by Larry Lee, the comic depicted a post-apocalyptic New York City where Onyx forms an underground rebellion. 

In 1998 the band released their third album &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot;, which featured appearances from other bands, including X-1, DMX, 50 Cent, All City, Mr. Cheeks, Wu-Tang Clan, N.O.R.E., and Big Pun. Produced by Keith Horne, Self, and others, the album peaked at #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 500,000 units. Three of the album&#x27;s songs reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts; The Worst, Shut &#x27;Em Down, and React. &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot; was Onyx&#x27;s last album on the Def Jam Recordings label.

In 2001, Onyx released their fourth album, &quot;Bacdafucup Part II&quot;, through Koch Records. Produced by Davinci, DR Period, and others, the album included twelve new tracks, including &quot;Feel Me&quot;, which was recorded on the night of September 11, 2001, and was dedicated to the events that had happened that day. In 2003 Onyx released their fifth album, &quot;Triggernometry&quot;, consisting of ten new tracks, with eleven stories from the lives the group&#x27;s members in between the tracks. On May 22, 2003, former Onyx member Big DS died in a hospital in Queens, New York at the age of 31 after receiving chemotherapy for lymphatic cancer. 

Onyx released a sixteen-track collection of previously unreleased songs &quot;Cold Case Files&quot; through &quot;Iceman Music Group&quot; on August 19, 2008. The collection features underground singles, lost studio recordings from the group&#x27;s first three albums, and appearances from Method Man, deceased Onyx affiliate X1, and Gang Green. 

In 2009, Onyx was planning to release an album called &quot;Black Rock&quot;, but postponed its release due to the release of another rap album called &quot;Blakroc&quot;. The same year, Sonny Seeza left the band to begin a solo career. On October 31, 2012, after having returned from an overseas tour, Onyx released the first track of their upcoming album &quot;CUZO&quot; on YouTube. Despite announcing that the &quot;CUZO&quot; album would be released on September 5, 2013, it was never released. In August 2012, Onyx released their second compilation album, titled &quot;Cold Case Files Vol. 2&quot;.

Later that year, Def Jam released an eleven-track compilation of Onyx&#x27;s classic songs called &quot;ICON&quot;. On November 22, 2015, Snowgoons attempted to raise funds on Kickstarter for a new project called &quot;Onyx vs. M.O.P.&quot;, planned to be a new collaboration album that would have been released in spring of the next year. Because the project only received $10,000 out of its $30,000 goal, it was canceled on December 18, 2015.

<doc id="608261" wikidata="Q392179" url="?curid=608261" title="First Quebec Conference">
<text>The First Quebec Conference, codenamed Quadrant, was a highly secret military conference held during World War II by the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. It took place in Quebec City on August 17–24, 1943, at both the Citadelle and the Château Frontenac. The chief representatives were Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, hosted by the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

==Conference==
Although Churchill suggested that Mackenzie King be involved in all discussions, Roosevelt vetoed the idea owing to concern that future conferences would be burdened by all of the Allied nations demanding seats. As a result, Mackenzie King&#x27;s hospitality was almost purely for ceremonial purposes. Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, had been invited to join the conference, but he did not attend for military reasons.

The Allies agreed to begin discussions for the planning of the invasion of France, codenamed Operation Overlord, in a secret report by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. It was agreed that Overlord would commence on May 1, 1944, but this was subsequently disregarded, and a later date was finalised. However, Overlord was not the only option; for example, Operation Jupiter remained a strong possibility had the Germans proved too powerful on the French coast. In the Mediterranean (a theatre on which Churchill was very keen) they resolved to concentrate more force to remove Italy from the alliance of Axis powers and to occupy it along with Corsica. Churchill and Roosevelt made it clear that they would only accept unconditional surrender from Italy, with a complete and immediate cessation of fighting. News came through of the fall of Sicily to Allied forces, an invasion that had taken just 38 days. It was then decided that an invasion of Italy would begin on September 3, 1943. However, an armistice was signed that same day, which officially put Italy out of the war.

There were discussions about improving the coordination of efforts by the Americans, British, and Canadians to develop an atomic bomb. Churchill and Roosevelt, without Canadian input, signed the Quebec Agreement, stating that the nuclear technology would never be used against one another, that they would not use it against third parties without the consent of one another, but also that Tube Alloys would not be discussed with third parties. Canada, although not being represented at the particular meeting, played a key role in this agreement as it was a major source of uranium and heavy water, both essential in the atomic bomb.

It was decided that operations in the Balkans should be limited to supplying guerrillas, whereas operations against Japan would be intensified in order to exhaust Japanese resources, cut their communications lines, and secure forward bases from which the Japanese mainland could be attacked.

In addition to the strategic discussions, which were communicated to the Soviet Union and to Chiang Kai-shek in China, the conference also issued a joint statement on Palestine, intended to calm tensions as the British occupation was becoming increasingly untenable. The conference also condemned German atrocities in Poland.

In the Pacific theater the conference decided to bypass and isolate Rabaul rather than proceed with the original plan of taking Rabaul. This decision fulfilled General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s plan to neutralize the heavily fortified fortress of Rabaul in New Britain. MacArthur&#x27;s Operation Cartwheel led to the creation of a de facto prisoner-of-war camp of over 100,000 Japanese troops who were cut off from the rest of their forces.

It was clear that eliminating Italy from the war was the Allies&#x27; main priority; this was expected to be done by the end of 1943. Following this, the next hope was that Germany would be defeated by the fall of 1944, which would leave just Japan remaining among the Axis powers.

Following the conference, Churchill was on holiday at a fishing camp and then, on August 31, 1943, delivered a radio address before travelling by a special train that was going to Washington, D.C., to resume talks with Roosevelt.

==Misplaced portfolio==
Given the highly secret topic under discussion at the conference, security at the Château Frontenac and the Quebec Citadelle was important. Sgt. Maj. Émile Couture (then 25 years of age) of the Canadian Army was responsible for cleaning the offices at both of these locations after the Conference had ended. Couture found a leather portfolio with a gold inscription &quot;Churchill-Roosevelt, Quebec Conference, 1943.&quot; on the exterior and kept it as a souvenir not realizing that it contained nearly complete plans for Operation Overlord. That evening Couture discovered the contents of the portfolio and, realizing the extremely sensitive nature of those documents, hid the portfolio under his mattress until he could return the portfolio in the morning. Couture was investigated by Scotland Yard and the FBI to ensure none of the information had been leaked. At the Second Quebec Conference Couture was awarded the British Empire Medal for his silence though it was attributed for &quot;services rendered&quot;. Couture was interviewed on Radio-Canada&#x27;s radio program &quot;Appelez-moi Lise&quot; by Lise Payette in 1972 about this issue. Additional magazine interviews with Couture are on display at the permanent exhibit for both Quebec Conferences in the Quebec Citadelle after September 2019.

<doc id="608264" wikidata="Q235319" url="?curid=608264" title="Beijing Subway">
<text>The Beijing Subway is the rapid transit system of Beijing Municipality that consists of 29 lines including 24 rapid transit lines, two airport rail links, one maglev line and two light rail tram lines, and 523 stations. The rail network extends across 12 urban and suburban districts of Beijing and into one district of Langfang in neighboring Hebei province. Between December 2023 and December 2024, the Beijing Subway became the world&#x27;s longest metro system by route length, surpassing the Shanghai Metro. The system has since returned to being the world&#x27;s second longest, with new lines being opened by the Shanghai Metro. With 3.8484 billion trips delivered in 2018 (10.544 million trips per day) and single-day ridership record of 13.7538 million set on July 12, 2019, the Beijing Subway was the world&#x27;s busiest metro system in the years immediately prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Beijing Subway opened in 1971 and is the oldest metro system in mainland China and on the mainland of East Asia. Before the system began its rapid expansion in 2002, the subway had only two lines. The existing network still cannot adequately meet the city&#x27;s mass transit needs. Beijing Subway&#x27;s extensive expansion plans call for of lines serving a projected 18.5 million trips every day when Phase 2 Construction Plan finished (around 2025). The most recent expansion came into effect on December 15, 2024, with the openings of Line 3 and Line 12 and an extension of the Changping line.

==Fares==
===Fare schedules===
Single-ride fare
The Beijing Subway charges single-ride fare according to trip distance for all lines except the two airport express lines.

* For all lines except the two airport express lines, fares start at ¥3 for a trip up to 6 km in distance, with ¥1 added for the next 6 km, for every 10 km thereafter until the trip distance reaches 32 km, and for every 20 km beyond the first 32 km. A 40 km trip would cost ¥7.
* The Capital Airport Express has a fixed fare of ¥25 per ride. 
* The Daxing Airport Express is the only line to maintain class-based fares with ordinary class fare varying with distance from ¥10 to ¥35 and business class fare fixed at ¥50 per ride.

Same-station transfers are free on all subway lines except the two Airport Express lines, the Xijiao Line and the Yizhuang T1 Line, which require the purchase of a new fare when transferring to or from those lines.

Fare free riders
Children below in height ride for free when accompanied by a paying adult. Senior citizens over the age of 65, individuals with physical disabilities, retired revolutionary cadres, police and army veterans who had been wounded in action, military personnel and People&#x27;s Armed Police can ride the subway for free.

Unlimited-rides fare
Since January 20, 2019, riders can purchase unlimited rides fare tickets using the Yitongxing (亿通行) APP on smartphones, which generates a QR code with effective periods of one to seven days.



Previous fare schedules
On December 28, 2014, the Beijing Subway switched from a fixed-fare schedule to the current distance-based fare schedule for all lines except the Capital Airport Express. Prior to the December 28, 2014, fare increase, passengers paid a flat rate of RMB(¥) 2.00 (including unlimited fare-free transfers) for all lines except the Capital Airport Express, which cost ¥25, The flat fare was the lowest among metro systems in China. Before the flat fare schedule was introduced on October 7, 2007, fares ranged from ¥3 to ¥7, depending on the line and number of transfers.

===Fare collection===
Each station has two to fifteen ticket vending machines. Ticket vending machines on all lines can add credit to &quot;Yikatong&quot; cards. Single-ride tickets take the form of an RFID-enabled flexible plastic card.
Passengers must insert the ticket or scan the card at the gate both before entering and exiting the station. The subway&#x27;s fare collection gates accept single-ride tickets and the &quot;Yikatong&quot; fare card. Passengers can purchase tickets and add credit to &quot;Yikatong&quot; card at ticket counters or vending machines in every station. The &quot;Yikatong&quot;, also known as Beijing Municipal Administration &amp; Communication Card (BMAC), is an integrated circuit card that stores credit for the subway, urban and suburban buses and e-money for other purchases. The &quot;Yikatong&quot; card itself must be purchased at the ticket counter. To enter a station, the &quot;Yikatong&quot; card must have a minimum balance of ¥3.00. Upon exiting the system, single-ride tickets are inserted into the turnstile, which are reused by the system.
To prevent fraud, passengers are required to complete their journeys within four hours upon entering the subway. If the four-hour limit is exceeded, a surcharge of ¥3 is imposed. Each &quot;Yikatong&quot; card is allowed to be overdrawn once. The overdrawn amount is deducted when credits are added to the card.

&quot;Yikatong&quot; card users who spend more than ¥100 on subway fare in a calendar month will receive credits to their card the following month. After reaching ¥100 of spending in one calendar month, 20% of any further spending up to ¥150 will be credited. When spending exceeds ¥150, 50% of any further spending up to ¥250 will be credited. Once expenditures exceed ¥400, further spending won&#x27;t earn any more credits. The credits are designed to ease commuters&#x27; burdens of fare increases.

==Lines in operation==
Beijing Subway lines generally follow the checkerboard layout of the city. Most lines through the urban core (outlined by the Line 10 loop) run parallel or perpendicular to each other and intersect at right angles.


===Lines through the urban core===
The urban core of Beijing is roughly outlined by the Line 10 loop, which runs underneath or just beyond the 3rd Ring Road. Each of the following lines provides extensive service within the Line 10 loop. All have connections to seven or more lines. Lines 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 19 also run through the Line 2 loop, marking the old Ming-Qing era city of Beijing.

*Line 1: straight east–west line underneath Chang&#x27;an Avenue, bisecting the city through Tiananmen Square. Line 1 connects major commercial centres, Xidan, Wangfujing, Dongdan and the Beijing CBD.
*Line 2: the inner rectangular loop line that traces the Ming-era inner city wall which once surrounded the inner city, with stops at 11 of the wall&#x27;s former gates (ending in &quot;men&quot;), now busy intersections on the 2nd Ring Road, as well as the Beijing railway station.
*Line 3 runs from the eastern edge of the inner city to the northeast, through Sanlitun, Chaoyang Park and Chaoyang Station.
*Line 4: mainly north–south line running to the west of city centre with stops at the Summer Palace, Old Summer Palace, Peking and Renmin Universities, Zhongguancun, National Library, Beijing Zoo, Xidan, Taoranting and Beijing South railway station.
*Line 5: straight north–south line running to the east of the city centre. Line 5 passes the Temple of Earth, Yonghe Temple and the Temple of Heaven.

* Line 9: north–south line running to the west of Line 4 from the National Library through the Military Museum and Beijing West railway station to Guogongzhuang in the southwestern suburbs.
*Line 10, the outer loop line running beneath or just beyond the Third Ring Road. Apart from the Line 2 loop, which is entirely enclosed within the Line 10 loop, every other line through the urban core intersects with Line 10. In the north, Line 10 traces Beijing&#x27;s Yuan-era city wall. In the east, Line 10 passes through the Beijing CBD.
*Line 12 follows the northern section of the 3rd Ring Road and then further east into Chaoyang.
*Line 13 arcs across suburbs north of the city and transports commuters to Xizhimen and Dongzhimen, at the northwest and northeast corners of Line 2.
*Line 14: inverted-L shaped line that connects the southwest, southeast and northeast parts of the city. From in the southwest, Line 14 runs due west and enters the Line 10 loop at Xiju and passing through the Beijing South Railway Station, Yongdingmenwai, Puhuangyu, Fangzhuang and leaves the Line 10 loop at Shilihe before turning north at Beijing University of Technology and running south - north outside the Line 10 loop through the Beijing CBD, Chaoyang Park and Jiuxianqiao to Wangjing in the northeast.
*Line 16: line from the northwest suburbs of Haidian District north of the Baiwang Mountain that runs mostly north - south upon entering Line 10 into and , then continuing south through and , before entering and . It then turns west through before ending at in Fengtai District.

==Future expansion==
=== Phase II ===
According to the Phase 2 construction plan approved by the NDRC in 2015, the length of Beijing Subway will reach when the Phase 2 construction finished. By then, public transit will comprise 60% of all trips. Of those, the subway will comprise 62%. The adjustment of the Phase 2 construction plan was approved by the NDRC on December 5, 2019. Which altered and expanded some projects in the Phase 2 construction plan. Including adjusting alignments of Line 22 and Line 28 and additional projects such as the Daxing Airport Line north extension, the west section of Line 11 and transforming Line 13 into two lines, 13A and 13B.

=== Phase III (2022–2027) ===
According to the information released in July 2022, the &quot;Beijing Rail Transit Phase III Construction Plan&quot; includes 11 construction projects: Line 1 Branch, Line 7 Phase 3, Line 11 Phase 2, Line 15 Phase 2, Line 17 Phase 2 (Branch), Line 19 Phase 2, Line 20 Phase 1, Fangshan line (Line 25) Phase 3 (also known as Lijin Line), Line M101 Phase 1, Line S6 (New Town Link Line) Phase 1, and the connecting line between Yizhuang line, Line 5 and Line 10.

==Owner and operators==
The Beijing Subway is owned by the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government through the Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., LTD, (北京市基础设施投资有限公司 or BIIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Beijing State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (北京市人民政府国有资产监督管理委员会 or Beijing SASAC), the municipal government&#x27;s asset holding entity.

The Beijing Subway was originally developed and controlled by the Central Government. The subway&#x27;s construction and planning was headed by a special committee of the State Council. In February 1970, Premier Zhou Enlai handed management of the subway to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which formed the PLA Rail Engineering Corp Beijing Subway Management Bureau. In November 1975, by order of the State Council and Central Military Commission the bureau was placed under the authority of Beijing Municipal Transportation Department.

On April 20, 1981, the bureau became the Beijing Subway Company, which was a subsidiary of the Beijing Public Transportation Company.

In July 2001, the Beijing Municipal Government reorganized the subway company into the Beijing Subway Group Company Ltd., a wholly city-owned holding company, which assumed ownership of all of the subway&#x27;s assets. In November 2003, the assets of the Beijing Subway Group Company were transferred to the newly created BIIC.

The Beijing Subway has five operators: 
#The main operator is the wholly state-owned Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp. (北京市地铁运营有限公司 or Beijing Subway OpCo), which was formed in the reorganization of the original Beijing Subway Group Company in 2001, and operates 15 lines: Lines 1, 2, 5–10, 13, 15, Batong line, Changping line, Fangshan line, Yizhuang line and S1 line.
#The Beijing MTR Corp. (北京京港地铁有限公司 or Beijing MTR), a public–private joint venture formed in 2005 by and among Beijing Capital Group, a state company under Beijing SASAC (with 49% equity ownership), MTR Corporation of Hong Kong (49%), and BIIC (2%), and operates four lines: Lines 4, 14, 16 and Line 17 and Daxing line.
#The (北京市轨道交通运营管理有限公司 or BJMOA), a subsidiary of Beijing Metro Construction Administration Corporation Ltd. (北京市轨道交通建设管理有限公司 or BJMCA) also under Beijing SASAC, became the third company to obtain operation rights for the Beijing Subway in 2015. The BJMOA operates the Yanfang line, Daxing Airport Express, and Line 19. Its corporate parent, BJMCA, is a general contractor for Beijing Subway construction.
#The Beijing Public Transit Tramway Co., Ltd. (北京公交有轨电车有限公司), formed in 2017, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing Public Transport Corporation (北京公共交通控股（集团）有限公司 or BPTC) that operates the Xijiao line. Its corporate parent, BPTC, is the city&#x27;s main public bus operator.
#The (北京京城地铁有限公司), also branded as &quot;Capital Metro&quot; (京城地铁) in their official logo, operates the Capital Airport Express. Beijing City Metro Ltd. is a joint venture established on February 15, 2016, between Beijing Subway OpCo (51%) and BII Railway Transportation Technology Holdings Company Limited (49%)(京投轨道交通科技控股有限公司), a Hong Kong listed company (1522.HK) controlled by BIIC. On March 27, 2017, Beijing City Metro Ltd. acquired a 30-year right to operate the Capital Airport Express and sections of the Dongzhimen subway station.

==Rolling stock==

All subway train sets run on standard gauge rail, except the maglev trains on Line S1, which run on a maglev track. Beijing Subway operates Type B trains on most lines. However, due to increasing congestion on the network, high capacity Type A trains are increasingly being used. Additionally, Type D trains are being used in express subway lines.

Until 2003 nearly all trains were manufactured by the CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd., now a division of the CRRC. The newest Line 1 trains and those on Lines 4, 8, Batong, Changping and Daxing are made by CRRC Qingdao Sifang Co., Ltd. Line S1&#x27;s maglev trains were produced by CRRC Tangshan.

The Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp. Ltd., provides local assemblage, maintenance and repair services.

=== Automated lines ===
There will be 6 fully automated lines at the level of GoA4, including 4 lines in operation (the Yanfang line, Line 17 and Line 19 and the Daxing Airport Express) and 2 lines under construction (Line 3 and Line 12), using domestically developed communications-based train control systems.

==History==
===1953–1965: origins===
The subway was proposed in September 1953 by the city&#x27;s planning committee and experts from the Soviet Union. After the end of the Korean War, Chinese leaders turned their attention to domestic reconstruction. They were keen to expand Beijing&#x27;s mass transit capacity but also valued the subway as an asset for civil defense. They studied the use of the Moscow Metro to protect civilians, move troops and headquarter military command posts during the Battle of Moscow, and planned the Beijing Subway for both civilian and military use.

At that time, the Chinese lacked expertise in building subways and drew heavily on Soviet and East German technical assistance. In 1954, a delegation of Soviet engineers, including some who had built the Moscow Metro, was invited to plan the subway in Beijing. From 1953 to 1960, several thousand Chinese university students were sent to the Soviet Union to study subway construction. An early plan unveiled in 1957 called for one ring route and six other lines with 114 stations and of track. Two routes vied for the first to be built. One ran east–west from Wukesong to Hongmiao, underneath Changan Avenue. The other ran north–south from the Summer Palace to Zhongshan Park, via Xizhimen and Xisi. The former was chosen due to more favorable geological foundation and greater number of government bureaus served. The second route would not be built until construction on Line 4 began forty years later.

The original proposal called for deep subway tunnels that can better serve military functions. Between Gongzhufen and Muxidi, shafts as deep as were being dug. The world&#x27;s deepest subway station at the time in the Kyiv Metro was only deep. But Beijing&#x27;s high water table and high pressure head of ground water which complicated construction and posed risk of leakage, and along with the inconvenience of transporting passengers long distances from the surface, led the authorities to abandon the deep tunnel plan in May 1960 in favor of cut-and-cover shallow tunnels some below the surface.

The deterioration of relations between China and Soviet Union disrupted subway planning. Soviet experts began to leave in 1960, and were completely withdrawn by 1963. In 1961, the entire project was halted temporarily due to severe hardships caused by the Great Leap Forward. Eventually, planning work resumed. The route of the initial line was shifted westward to create an underground conduit to move personnel from the heart of the capital to the Western Hills. On February 4, 1965, Chairman Mao Zedong personally approved the project.

===1965–1981: the slow beginning===
Construction began on July 1, 1965, at a groundbreaking ceremony attended by several national leaders including Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and Beijing mayor Peng Zhen. The most controversial outcome of the initial subway line was the demolition of the Beijing&#x27;s historic inner city wall to make way for the subway. Construction plans for the subway from Fuxingmen to the Beijing Railway Station called for the removal of the wall, as well as the gates and archery towers at Hepingmen, Qianmen, and Chongwenmen. Leading architect Liang Sicheng argued for protecting the wall as a landmark of the ancient capital. Chairman Mao favored demolishing the wall over demolishing homes. In the end, Premier Zhou Enlai managed to preserve several walls and gates, such as the Qianmen gate and its arrow tower by slightly altering the course of the subway.

The initial line was completed and began trial operations in time to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic on October 1, 1969. It ran from Gucheng to the Beijing Railway Station and had 16 stations. This line forms parts of present-day Lines 1 and 2. It was the first subway to be built in China, and predates the metros of Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., but technical problems would plague the project for the next decade.


Initially, the subway hosted guest visits. On November 11, 1969, an electrical fire killed three people, injured over 100 and destroyed two cars. Premier Zhou Enlai placed the subway under the control of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in early 1970, but reliability problems persisted.

On January 15, 1971, the initial line began operation on a trial basis between the Beijing railway station and . Single ride fare was set at ¥0.10 and only members of the public with credential letters from their work units could purchase tickets. The line was in length, had 10 stations and operated more than 60 train trips per day with a minimum wait time of 14 minutes. On August 15, the initial line was extended to and had 13 stations over . On November 7, the line was extended again, to Gucheng Lu, and had 16 stations over . The number of trains per day rose to 100. Overall, the line delivered 8.28 million rides in 1971, averaging 28,000 riders per day.

From 1971 to 1975, the subway was shut down for 398 days for political reasons. On December 27, 1972, the riders no longer needed to present credential letters to purchase tickets. In 1972, the subway delivered 15 million rides and averaged 41,000 riders per day. In 1973, the line was extended to and reached in length with 17 stations and 132 train trips per day. The line delivered 11 million rides in 1973, averaging 54,000 riders per day.

Despite its return to civilian control in 1976, the subway remained prone to closures due to fires, flooding, and accidents. Annual ridership grew from 22.2 million in 1976 and 28.4 million in 1977 to 30.9 million in 1978, and 55.2 million in 1980.

===1981–2000: two lines for two decades===
On April 20, 1981, the Beijing Subway Company, then a subsidiary of the Beijing Public Transportation Company, was organized to take over subway operations. On September 15, 1981, the initial line passed its final inspections, and was handed over to the Beijing Subway Company, ending a decade of trial operations. It had 19 stations and ran from Fushouling in the Western Hills to the Beijing railway station. Investment in the project totaled ¥706 million. Annual ridership rose from 64.7 million in 1981 and 72.5 million in 1982 to 82 million in 1983.

On September 20, 1984, a second line was opened to the public. This horseshoe-shaped line was created from the eastern half of the initial line and corresponds to the southern half of the present-day Line 2. It ran from to with 16 stations. Ridership reached 105 million in 1985.

On December 28, 1987, the two existing lines were reconfigured into Lines 1, which ran from Pingguoyuan to Fuxingmen and Line 2, in its current loop, tracing the Ming city wall. Fares doubled to ¥0.20 for single-line rides and ¥0.30 for rides with transfers. Ridership reached 307 million in 1988. The subway was closed from June 3–4, 1989 during the suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. In 1990, the subway carried more than one million riders per day for the first time, as total ridership reached 381 million. After a fare hike to ¥0.50 in 1991, annual ridership declined slightly to 371 million.

On January 26, 1991, planning began on the eastward extension of Line 1 under Chang&#x27;an Avenue from Fuxingmen. The project was funded by a 19.2 billion yen low-interest development assistance loan from Japan. Construction began on the eastern extension on June 24, 1992, and the Xidan station opened on December 12, 1992. The remaining extension to was completed on September 28, 1999. National leaders Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Yu Zhengsheng and mayor Liu Qi were on hand to mark the occasion. The full-length of Line 1 became operational on June 28, 2000.

Despite little track expansion in the early 1990s, ridership grew rapidly to reach a record high of 558 million in 1995, but fell to 444 million the next year when fares rose from ¥0.50 to ¥2.00. After fares rose again to ¥3.00 in 2000, annual ridership fell to 434 million from 481 million in 1999.

===2001–2008: planning for the Olympics===
In the summer of 2001, the city won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and accelerated plans to expand the subway. From 2002 to 2008, the city planned to invest ¥63.8 billion (US$7.69 billion) in subway projects and build an ambitious subway network. The plan, termed &quot;three ring, four horizontal, five vertical and seven radial&quot; in 2007, consisted of 19 lines:
* Three ring lines: 2, 10 and 13
* Four horizontal lines: 1, 6, 7, 14 (West)
* Five vertical lines: 4, 5, 8, 9, 14 (East)
* Seven radial lines: Batong, Changping, Daxing, Fangshan, Shunyi (Line 15), Yizhuang, Line S1

Work on Line 5 had already begun on September 25, 2000. Land clearing for Lines 4 and 10 began in November 2003 and construction commenced by the end of the year. Most new subway construction projects were funded by loans from the Big Four state banks. Line 4 was funded by the Beijing MTR Corporation, a joint-venture with the Hong Kong MTR. To achieve plans for 19 lines and by 2015, the city planned to invest a total of ¥200 billion ($29.2 billion).

The next additions to the subway were surface commuter lines that linked to the north and east of the city. Line 13, a half loop that links the northern suburbs, first opened on the western half from Huilongguan to Xizhimen on September 28, 2002 and the entire line became operational on January 28, 2003. Batong line, built as an extension to Line 1 to Tongzhou District, was opened as a separate line on December 27, 2003. Work on these two lines had begun respectively in December 1999 and 2000. Ridership hit 607 million in 2004.

Line 5 came into operation on October 7, 2007. It was the city&#x27;s first north–south line, extending from in the south to in the north. On the same day, subway fares were reduced from between ¥3 and ¥7 per trip, depending on the line and number of transfers, to a single flat fare of ¥2 with unlimited transfers. The lower fare policy caused the Beijing Subway to run a deficit of ¥600 million in 2007, which was expected to widen to ¥1 billion in 2008. The Beijing municipal government covered these deficits to encourage mass transit use, and reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. On a total of 655 million rides delivered in 2007, the government&#x27;s subsidy averaged ¥0.92 per ride.

As part of the urban re-development for the 2008 Olympics, the subway system was significantly expanded.In the summer of 2008, in anticipation of the Summer Olympic Games, three new lines—Line 10 (Phase 1), Line 8 (Phase 1) and the Capital Airport Express—opened on July 19. The use of paper tickets, hand checked by clerks for 38 years, was discontinued and replaced by electronic tickets that are scanned by automatic fare collection machines upon entry and exit of the subway. Stations are outfitted with touch screen vending machines that sell single-ride tickets and multiple-ride &quot;Yikatong&quot; fare cards. The subway operated throughout the night from August 8–9, 2008 to accommodate the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games, and is extending evening operations of all lines by one to three hours (to 1-2 a.m.) through the duration of the Games. The subway set a daily ridership record of 4.92 million on August 22, 2008, the day of the Games&#x27; closing ceremony. In 2008, total ridership rose by 75% to 1.2 billion.

===2008–2015: rapid expansion===
After the Chinese government announced a ¥4 trillion economic stimulus package in November 2008, the Beijing urban planning commission further expedited subway building plans, especially for elevated lines to suburban districts that are cheaper to build. In December 2008, the commission moved completion dates of the Yizhuang and Daxing Lines to 2010 from 2012, finalized the route of the Fangshan Line, and unveiled the Changping and Xijiao Lines. 

Line 4 started operation on September 28, 2009, bringing subway service to much of western Beijing. It is managed by the MTR Corporation through a joint venture with the city. In 2009, the subway delivered 1.457 billion rides, 19.24% of mass transit trips in Beijing.
In 2010, Beijing&#x27;s worsening traffic congestion prompted city planners to move the construction of several lines from the 13th Five Year Plan to the 12th Five Year Plan. This meant Lines 8 (Phase III), , , , the Yanfang line, as well as additional lines to Changping District and Tiantongyuan were to begin construction before 2015. Previously, Lines 3, 12 and 16 were being planned for the more distant future. On December 30, 2010, five suburban lines: Lines 15 (Phase I from to except Wangjing East station), Changping, Fangshan (except Guogongzhuang station), Yizhuang (except Yizhuang railway station), and Daxing, commenced operation. The addition of of track, a nearly 50% increase, made the subway the fourth longest metro in the world. One year later, on December 31, 2011, the subway surpassed the New York City Subway to become the third longest metro in revenue track length with the extension of Line 8 north from the to , the opening of Line 9 in southwest Beijing from Beijing West railway station to (except , which opened on October 12, 2012), the extension of the Fangshan Line to Guogongzhuang, and the extension of Line 15 from to in central Shunyi. In the same year, the Beijing government unveiled an ambitious expansion plan envisioning the subway network to reach a track density of 0.51 km per km2 (0.82 mi per sq. mi.) inside the Fifth Ring Road where residents would on average have to walk to the nearest subway station. Ridership reached 2.18 billion in 2011.

In February 2012, the city government confirmed that Lines , , , and were under planning as part of Phase II expansion. Retroactively implying that the original three ring, four horizontal, five vertical and seven radial plan was part of Phase I expansion. Line 17 was planned to run north–south, parallel and to the east of Line 5, from Future Science Park North to Yizhuang Zhanqianqu South. Line 19 was planned to run north–south, from Mudanyuan to Xin&#x27;gong.

On December 30, 2012, Line 6 (Phase I from to ), the extension of Line 8 from south to (except ), the remainder of Line 9 (except Military Museum station) and the remainder of the Line 10 loop (except the - section and Jiaomen East station) entered service. The addition of of track increased the network length to and allowed the subway to overtake the Shanghai Metro, for several months, as the world&#x27;s longest metro. The subway delivered 2.46 billion rides in 2012.

On May 5, 2013, the Line 10 loop was completed with the opening of the Xiju-Shoujingmao section and the Jiaomen East Station. The loop line became the longest underground subway loop in the world. On the same day, the first section of Line 14 from to Xiju also entered operation, ahead of the opening of the Ninth China International Garden Expo in Fengtai District. The subway&#x27;s total length reached . On December 28, 2013, two sections were added to Line 8, which extended the line north to Zhuxinzhuang and south to Nanluoguxiang. In 2013, the subway delivered 3.209 billion rides, an increase of 30% from the year before.

On December 28, 2014, the subway network expanded by to 18 lines and with the opening of Line 7, the eastern extension of line 6 (from to ), the eastern section of line 14 (from to ), and the western extension of line 15 (from to ). At the same time, the ¥2 flat-rate fare was replaced with a variable-rate fare (a minimum of ¥3), to cover operation costs. In 2014, the subway delivered 3.387 billion rides, an increase of 5.68% from the year before. Average daily and weekday ridership also set new highs of 9.2786 million and 10.0876 million, respectively.

From 2007 to 2014, the cost of subway construction in Beijing rose sharply from ¥0.571 billion per km to ¥1.007 billion per km. The cost includes land acquisition, compensation to relocate residents and firms, actual construction costs and equipment purchase. In 2014, city budgeted ¥15.5 billion for subway construction, and the remainder of subway building costs was financed by the Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co. LTD, a city-owned investment firm.

In 2014, Beijing planning authorities assessed mass transit monorail lines for areas of the city in which subway construction or operation is difficult. Straddle beam monorail trains have lower transport capacity and operating speed () than conventional subways, but are quieter to operate, have smaller turning radius and better climbing capability, and cost only one-third to one-half of subways to build. According to the initial environmental assessment report by the Chinese Academy of Rail Sciences, the Yuquanlu Line was planned to have 21 stations over in western Beijing. The line was to begin construction in 2014 and would take two years to complete. The Dongsihuan Line (named for the Eastern Fourth Ring Road it was to follow) was planned to have 21 stations over .

In early 2015, plans for both monorail lines were shelved indefinitely, due to low capacity and resident opposition. The Yuquanlu Line remains on the city&#x27;s future transportation plan, and it will be built as a conventional underground subway line. The Dongsihuan Line was replaced by the East extension of Line 7.

On December 26, 2015, the subway network expanded to with the opening of the section of Line 14 from Beijing South railway station to (11 stations; ), Phase II of the Changping line from to (5 stations; ), Andelibeijie station on Line 8, and Datunlu East station on Line 15. Ridership in 2015 fell by 4% to 3.25 billion due to a fare increase from a flat fare back to a distance based fare.
===2015–present: Phase II projects===
With the near completion of the three ring, four horizontal, five vertical and seven radial subway network, work began on Phase II expansion projects. These new extensions and lines were expected to be operational in 2019–2021. The following lines were included in the approved Phase II construction plans:
*Line 3
*Line 12

On December 9, 2016, construction started on of new line with the southern extension of Batong Line, the southern extension of Changping line, the Pinggu line, phase one of the New Airport line, and Line 3 Phase I breaking ground. The northern section of Line 16 opened on December 31, 2016. Ridership reached a new high of 3.66 billion. On December 30, 2017, a one-station extension of Fangshan Line (Suzhuang – Yancun East), Yanfang line (Yancun Dong - Yanshan), Xijiao line (Bagou - Fragrant Hills) and S1 line (Shichang – Jin&#x27;anqiao) were opened. On December 30, 2018, the western extension of Line 6 (Jin&#x27;anqiao – Haidian Wuluju), the South section of Line 8 (Zhushikou – Yinghai), a one-station extension on Line 8 North section (Nanluoguxiang – National Art Museum), a one-station extension on Yizhuang line (Ciqu – Yizhuang Railway Station) were opened. On September 26, 2019, the Daxing Airport Express (Phase 1) (Caoqiao - Daxing Airport) was opened. On December 28, 2019, the eastern extension of Line 7 (Jiaohuachang-Huazhuang) and the southern extension of Batong line (Tuqiao-Huazhuang) were opened. A revision to the Phase II plans in 2019 added Line 11 (branch line for the 2022 Winter Olympics) and a project to split Line 13 to the construction schedule.

On January 24, 2020, the day after a lockdown was declared in the city of Wuhan to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the Beijing Subway began testing body temperature of passengers at the 55 subway stations including the three main railway stations and capital Airport. Temperature checks expanded to all subway stations by January 27.

On April 4, 2020, at 10:00am, Beijing Subway trains joined in China&#x27;s national mourning of lives lost in the COVID-19 pandemic, by stopping for three minutes and sounding their horns three times, as conductors and passengers stood in silence. To control the spread of COVID-19, certain Line 6 trains were outfitted with smart surveillance cameras that can detect passengers not wearing masks.

In May 2020, the Beijing Subway began to pilot a new style of wayfinding on Line 13 and Airport Express. However, since then the new designs were not rolled out to other lines or even new lines that opened afterward.

On December 31, 2020, the middle section of Line 16 (Xi Yuan-Ganjia Kou), the northern section of the Fangshan line (Guogongzhuang-Dongguantou Nan(S)), and the Yizhuang T1 line tram were opened.

On August 26, 2021, Line 7 and Batong line extended to station. On August 29, 2021, through operation of Line 1 and Batong line started. On December 31, 2021, the initial sections of Line 11 (Jin&#x27;anqiao - Shougang Park), Line 17 (Shilihe - Jiahuihu), Line 19 (Mudanyuan - Xingong); extensions of Capital Airport Express (Dongzhimen - Beixinqiao), Changping line (Xierqi - Qinghe Railway Station), Line S1 (Jin&#x27;anqiao - Pingguoyuan), Line 16 (Ganjiakou - Yuyuantan Park East Gate); and the central sections of Line 8 (Zhushikou - National Art Museum) and Line 14 (Beijing South Railway Station - Xiju) were opened. The opening of the central sections of Lines 8 and 14 along with the final section of Line S1 completed the three ring, four horizontal, five vertical and seven radial subway network plan (retroactively named Phase I expansion).

On July 30, 2022, stations Beitaipingzhuang, Ping&#x27;anli, Taipingqiao, Jingfengmen of Line 19 were opened. On December 31, 2022, the extension of Line 16 (Yuyuantan Park East Gate - Yushuzhuang) was opened.

On January 18, 2023, in the morning and evening peak hours of the workday, the cross-line operation of Fangshan Line and Line 9 began. On February 4, 2023, the extension of Changping Line (Qinghe Railway Station - Xitucheng) was opened.

On December 15, 2024, lines 3 and 12 were opened together with the remainder of the Changping line&#x27;s southern extension. By the end of 2024, all of Beijing&#x27;s 7 major railway stations and 2 international airports have been connected to the metro network.

===Ridership===


== Facilities ==

===Accessibility===

Each station is equipped with ramps, lifts, or elevators to facilitate wheelchair access. Newer model train cars now provide space to accommodate wheelchairs. Automated audio announcements for incoming trains are available in all lines. On all lines, station names are announced in Mandarin Chinese and English. Under subway regulations, riders with mobility limitations may obtain assistance from subway staff to enter and exit stations and trains, and visually impaired riders may bring assistance devices and guide dogs into the subway.

===Cellular network coverage===
Mobile phones can currently be used throughout the network. In 2014, Beijing Subway started upgrading cellular networks in the Beijing subway to 4G. In 2016, the entire subway network has 4G coverage. Since 2019, 5G coverage is being rolled out across the network.

=== Commercial facilities ===
In the 1990s a number of fast food and convenience stores operated in the Beijing Subway. In 2002, fourteen Wumart convenience stores opened in various Line 2 stations.

After witnessing the Daegu subway fire in February 2003, the Beijing Subway gradually removed the 80 newsstands and fast food restaurants across 39 stations in Line 1 and Line 2. The popular underground mall at Xidan station was closed. This is in contrast other systems in China which added more station commerce as they started to rapidly expand their networks. Since the implementation of this policy new lines did not have any station commerce upon opening.

Passengers consistently complained that the lack of station commerce in the Beijing Subway is inconvenient. In the early 2010s, Beijing Subway started reversing some of these policies. Vending machines selling drinks and snacks has gradually introduced inside stations since 2013. Later machines with of common items such as flowers, earphones, masks, etc. were also introduced. In 2013, China Resources Vanguard and FamilyMart expressed interest in opening convenience stores in the Beijing Subway but this never materialized.
The survey report on passenger satisfaction in subway services since 2018 shows that more than 70% of passengers want convenience stores in subway stations, especially for various hot and cold drinks, ready-to-eat food, and bento meals. In December 2020, &quot;the deployment of 130 convenient service facilities at subway stations&quot; was listed as a key project for the Beijing municipal government. On July 25, 2021, Beijing Subway selected three stations, Hepingli Beijie station of Line 5, Qingnian Lu station of Line 6, and Caishikou station of Line 7, to carry out a pilot program of opening convenience stores. Since December 2021, a rapid rollout of station commerce began on a large scale across the network with a variety of commercial establishments such as bookstores, pharmacies, flower shops and specialty vendors being constructed inside stations.

===Information hotline and app===
The Beijing Subway telephone hotline was initiated on the eve of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games to provide traveler information, receive complaints and suggestions, and file lost and found reports. The hotline combined the nine public service telephones of various subway departments. On December 29, 2013, the hotline number was switched from (010)-6834-5678 to (010)-96165 for abbreviated dialing. In December 2014, the hotline began offering fare information, as the subway switched to distance-based fare. The hotline has staffed service from 5 am to midnight and has automated service during unstaffed hours.

The Beijing Subway has an official mobile application and a number of third-party apps.

=== English station names ===
According to the related rules released in 2006, all the place names, common names and proper names of subway stations and bus stops should use uppercase Hanyu Pinyin. For example, Nanlishi Lu Station should be written as NANLISHILU Station. However, names of venues can use English translation, such as Military Museum.

According to the translation standard released in December 2017, station names of rail transit and public transport have to follow the laws.

Since December 2018, Beijing Subway has changed the format of names of the new subway stations every year. On the subway map of December 2018, the station names used Roman script, and it gave consideration to English writing habit and pronunciation. The format changed to verbatim in December 2019, where the positions (East, South, West and North) were written in Hanyu Pinyin and an English abbreviation was added to them.
Since December 31, 2021, Beijing Subway has started using new station name format. The Pinyin &quot;Zhan&quot; is used instead of English word &quot;Station&quot; on the light box at the subway entrance. This caused a strong disagreement. Citizens criticized it, making comments like &quot;Chinese do not need to read and foreigners cannot read it&quot;. Some of the landmark named stations uses Chinese name, Hanyu Pinyin and English translation. Station names ending with positions no longer add English abbreviation. Some of the stations that used English translation names (such as Shahe Univ. Park, Life Science Park and Liangxiang Univ. Town) changed to Hanyu Pinyin only (The new station names are Shahe Gaojiaoyuan, Shengming Kexueyuan and Liangxiang Daxuecheng).

==System upgrades==

===Capacity===

With new lines drawing more riders to the network, the subway has experienced severe overcrowding, especially during the rush hour. Since 2015, significant sections of Lines 1, 4 – Daxing, 5, 10, 13, Batong and Changping are officially over capacity during rush hour. By 2019, Lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 10 all have daily weekday ridership&#x27;s of over 1 million passengers a day each. In short term response, the subway upgraded electrical, signal and yard equipment to increase the frequency of trains to add additional capacity. Peak headways have been reduced to 1 min. 43 sec. on Line 4; 1 min. 45 sec. on Lines 1/Batong, 5, 9, and 10; 2 min. on Lines 2, 6, 13 and Changping; 2 min. and 35 sec. on Line 15; 3 min. 30 sec. on Line 8; and 15 min. on the Airport Express. The Beijing Subway is investigating the feasibility of reducing headways of Line 10 down to 1 min 40 seconds.

Lines 13 and Batong have converted 4-car to 6-car trains. Lines 6 and 7 have longer platforms that can accommodate 8-car type B trains, while lines 14, 16, 17 and 19 use higher capacity wide-body type A trains (all mentioned except Line 14 use eight-car trains). New lines that cross the city center such as Line 3 and Line 12, now under construction, will also adopt high capacity 8-car type A trains with a 70 percent increase in capacity over older lines using 6 car type B. When completed these lines are expected to greatly relieve overcrowding in the existing network. 

Despite these efforts, during the morning rush hour, conductors at line terminals and other busy stations must routinely restrict the number of passengers who can board each train to prevent the train from becoming too crowded for passengers waiting at other stations down the line. Some of these stations have built queuing lines outside the stations to manage the flow of waiting passengers. As of August 31, 2011, 25 stations mainly on Lines 1, 5, 13, and Batong have imposed such restrictions. By January 7, 2013, 41 stations on Lines 1, 2, 5, 13, Batong, and Changping had instituted passenger flow restrictions during the morning rush hour. The number of stations with passenger flow restrictions reached 110 in January 2019, affecting all lines except Lines 15, 16, Fangshan, Yanfang and S1. Lines 4, 5, 10 and 13 strategically run several empty train runs during rush hour bound for specific stations help clear busy station queues. Counter peak flow express trains started operating on Line 15, Changping and Batong to minimize line runtimes and allow the existing fleet size to serve more passengers during peak periods. Additionally, investigations are being carried out on Line 15 and Yizhuang for upgrading to 120 km/h operations.

===Transfers===

Interchange stations that permit transfers across two or more subway lines receive heavy traffic passenger flow. The older interchange stations are known for lengthy transfer corridors and slow transfers during peak hours. The average transfer distance at older interchange stations is The transfer between Lines 2 and 13 at Xizhimen once required 15 minutes to complete during rush hours. In 2011, this station was rebuilt to reduce the transfer distance to about long. There are plans to rebuild other interchange stations such as Dongzhimen.

In newer interchange stations, which are designed to permit more efficient transfers, the average transfer distance is . Many of the newer interchange stations including Guogongzhuang (Lines 9 and Fangshan), Nanluoguxiang (Lines 8 and 6), Zhuxinzhuang (Changping and Line 8), Beijing West railway station (Lines 9 and 7), National Library (Lines 9 and 4), Yancun East (Fangshan Line and Yanfang Line) feature cross platform transfers. Nevertheless, longer transfer corridors must still be used when the alignment of the lines do not permit cross-platform transfer.
The transfer corridors between Lines 1 and 9 at the Military Museum, which opened on December 23, 2013, are in one direction and just under in the other.

==Safety==

===Security check===

To ensure public safety during the 2008 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, the subway initiated a three-month heightened security program from June 29 to September 20, 2008. Riders were subject to searches of their persons and belongings at all stations by security inspectors using metal detectors, X-ray machines and sniffer dogs. Items banned from public transportation such as &quot;guns, ammunition, knives, explosives, flammable and radioactive materials, and toxic chemicals&quot; were subject to confiscation. The security program was reinstituted during the 2009 New Year Holiday and has since been made permanent through regulations enacted in February 2009.

===Accidents and incidents===
The subway was plagued by numerous accidents in its early years, including a fire in 1969 that killed six people and injured over 200. But its operations have improved dramatically and there have been few reported accidents in recent years. Most of the reported fatalities on the subway are the result of suicides. Authorities have responded by installing doors on platforms of newer lines.

==Subway culture==
===Logo===

The subway&#x27;s logo, a capital letter &quot;G&quot; encircling a capital letter &quot;D&quot; with the letter &quot;B&quot; silhouetted inside the letter D, was designed by Zhang Lide, a subway employee, and officially designated in April 1984. The letters B, G, and D form the pinyin abbreviation for 

===Subway Culture Park===

The Beijing Subway Culture Park, located near in Daxing District, opened in 2010 to commemorate the 40-year history of the Beijing Subway. The park was built using dirt and debris removed from the construction of the Daxing line and contains old rolling stock, sculpture, and informational displays. Admission to the park is free.

==Beijing Suburban Railway==

The Beijing Suburban Railway, a suburban commuter train service, is managed separately from the Beijing Subway. The two systems, although complementary, are not related to each other operationally. Beijing Suburban Railway is operated by the China Railway Beijing Group.

There are 4 suburban railway lines currently in operation: Line S2, Sub-Central line, Huairou–Miyun line and Tongmi line.

<doc id="608273" wikidata="Q500471" url="?curid=608273" title="Uncle Fester">
<text>Uncle Fester (Addams) is a member of the fictional Addams Family and has been played by numerous actors, beginning with Jackie Coogan in the television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1964–1966).

==Character==
Uncle Fester is a completely hairless, hunched, and barrel-shaped man with dark, sunken eyes and often a deranged smile. He always wears a heavy, full-length fur coat. Fester was derived from a character drawn by Charles Addams for a series of cartoons featuring a grotesque family, though Addams never gave the characters names. Nevertheless, the character is recognizable in a number of cartoons, both by his appearance (bald, stooping, sunken eyes) and eerie behavior (turning the shower to a special &quot;scalding&quot; setting, feeding his garden plants blood plasma, and releasing an eagle to attack the neighbor&#x27;s homing pigeons). While he is occasionally seen with the rest of the family, particularly on anthology covers, he is also seen on his own more often than the others. It is sometimes indicated that he lives in a small shack surrounded by a wrought-iron fence.

Fester has a strange ability to generate electricity. In the film &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, he loses his memory and regains it after being struck by lightning, leading to him gaining that power, though in other adaptations it is never stated how he got that power. He often demonstrates it by putting a light bulb in his mouth, which illuminates, accompanied by a loud, crackling noise. He claims to possess 110 volts of power in one episode of the sitcom, while in another episode he demonstrated his &quot;magnetic&quot; quality by levitating a metal paperweight up to his hand. In the 2022 Netflix series, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, he shoots lightning directly from his hands and uses it to revive a near-dead Thing. That ability is also believed to give him resistance to lightning, as well as blunt force trauma. When struck directly on the head by a fired cannonball, he appears only mildly dazed, while the cannonball bounces off his head.

Uncle Fester has severe migraines at times but appears to enjoy them. He relieves the migraines by placing his head in a large screw press and tightening it to levels that normal people would not be able to withstand. At times, he puts his head in the screw press simply for enjoyment.

Despite Uncle Fester&#x27;s menacing look and bizarre behavior, he is gentle and caring. He shows great respect for Gomez and Morticia, and always exhibits love and concern for his niece and nephews, despite their frequent naughtiness.

In the original 1960s sitcom, Fester is said to be Morticia&#x27;s maternal uncle (his name rhymes with that of Morticia&#x27;s mother, Hester). However, from the 1970s onward, he is Gomez&#x27;s brother. Despite being very close, he admits to sometimes “despising” Gomez and can be jealous of his relationship with Morticia, often trying to find love, with chaotic consequences. In all adaptations, he is either uncle or great-uncle to Wednesday and Pugsley. He is known as &quot;Tío Fétido&quot; in Spain, &quot;Tío Lucas&quot; in Spanish-speaking countries, and &quot;Fétide&quot; in France. In Brazil, he has two names: &quot;Tio Chico&quot; (original series and cartoon) and &quot;Tio Fester&quot; (Broadway musical and movies).

In the series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, Fester still possesses his electric powers and a great affection for his niece, but is portrayed as more roguish, appearing at Nevermore Academy looking for a place to hide out from the law, saying that he used to keep Gomez on his toes by dropping &quot;from the ceiling, with a dagger clutched between my teeth&quot;.

==Live action TV series==
In the 1960s television series, Fester (portrayed by Jackie Coogan) is an uncle to Morticia Addams. In one episode, he became perplexed when asked his last name, suggesting he has somehow forgotten it. In several episodes, Fester refers to the Addams lineage as if it were his own, possibly implying some degree of intertwined consanguinity in both their family lines, but the flashbacks in the episodes &quot;Morticia&#x27;s Romance, Parts 1 and 2,&quot; clearly establish him as Morticia&#x27;s uncle, brother of her mother, Hester Frump, a.k.a. Granny Frump (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton), whose maiden name was similarly unrevealed (indicating a third family, similar to the Addamses and the Frumps). In various episodes, he was a partner in typical sitcom schemes with Gomez, Morticia, or Grandmama Addams, indicating no real preference for any family member over others.

Fester&#x27;s known ancestry dates back to his Great-Grandfather Blob (not to be confused with Gomez&#x27;s Cousin Blob, a two-headed ghost), who received the gift of a sacred ruby after he had pried it from the head of a Hindu (to whom it was giving a terrible headache). The ruby remained in the family until Fester unthinkingly used his slingshot to hurl it at a yowling stray cat. &quot;Well, it was the only rock in the house!&quot; he said in his defense.

Per the 1960s sitcom, little is known of Fester&#x27;s childhood, save that his father (Morticia&#x27;s maternal grandfather) was an excruciatingly strict man who severely disciplined him, paddling him even when he was good and paying him to stay out of public (Fester considered this to be experienced in &quot;public relations&quot;). He refused to allow Fester to even touch a battleaxe (a treasured toy among people with the Addams&#x27;s macabre tastes) until he was eight. As an adult, Fester defended his father&#x27;s strictness, pointing to his own character as proof of its effectiveness: &quot;I didn&#x27;t become what I am by accident! I had an upbringing like no other!&quot; Sometime prior to Morticia&#x27;s marriage to Gomez, Fester worked as a newspaper columnist, writing advice for the lovelorn, but left that job because people kept suing him.

Fester has also offered contradictory information about his educational background. In the sitcom&#x27;s first episode, he notes that he never went to school (&quot;And look how [well] I turned out!&quot;), but he later claims to have failed recess three times. As an adult, Fester took correspondence courses in various subjects, and his educational endeavors occasionally formed an episode&#x27;s main plot. It may be from one such course that he obtained his fraternity paddle, which he once threatened to use on Wednesday in imitation of his father&#x27;s punishment style; however, like many an uncle, Fester proved to have more bark than bite in dealing with the children. When he suspects someone of maligning, cheating, or otherwise mistreating anyone in the family, Fester is ever ready with his blunderbuss &quot;Genevieve&quot;, eager to &quot;shoot &#x27;em in the back!&quot; However, he is far less eager in meeting a malefactor in a face-to-face duel; he was briefly enthusiastic about a pistol duel with an enemy until he asked, somewhat timidly, &quot;Does he get one too?...&quot;Loaded&quot;?&quot;

Another prized possession was his cannon, &quot;Old Reliable&quot;, which he normally kept in his bedroom. Fester maintained a treehouse in the Addams yard and frequently retreated to his closet to think. After receiving the gift of a motorcycle in the episode &quot;The Addams Family Meets a Beatnik&quot;, Fester often drove it through the living room, inevitably crashing in the conservatory (several episodes used identical recycled footage of this scenario). Fester also collects three-dollar bills.

The 1998 live-action series continues the tradition of having Fester (portrayed by Canadian actor Michael Roberds) as Gomez&#x27;s biological brother, yet between this version and the 1960s series, this is the only visible difference. In furtherance on the original series running gag of Uncle Fester being able to store electricity, one episode has Uncle Fester nearly abducted by aliens so as to be used to power their spaceship; the Aliens leave Uncle Fester behind-but only after &quot;cloning&quot; him for their spaceship journey home.

In the Netflix show &quot;Wednesday&quot;, Uncle Fester is played by Fred Armisen. He wanted to be like the versions of Fester played by Jackie Coogan and Christopher Lloyd rather than reinventing the character. Every morning, Armisen&#x27;s head was buzzed smooth, makeup and powder were applied to make him look paler, and dark circles were added around his eyes. The wardrobe covered much of Armisen, so little else needed to be done. Fester helped Wednesday on solving her mysteries of the town of Jericho and Nevermore Academy by revealing to Wednesday that the mystery monster she encountered was a Hyde. Because of his hobby with electricity, he can now project lightning from his own hands. It was also mentioned that Uncle Fester didn&#x27;t attend Nevermore, but snuck in to visit Gomez on occasion. Wednesday had to use Eugene Otinger&#x27;s bee house for Uncle Fester to hide out in after he robbed a bank and is advised by her not to eat any of Eugene&#x27;s bees.

In December 2023, it was announced that Netflix is developing a &quot;Wednesday&quot; spin-off series titled &quot;Fester&quot; that focuses on Uncle Fester.

==Animated TV series==
In the first animated series by Hanna-Barbera, Jackie Coogan reprised his role as Fester. He also voiced that same character on an episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;.

In the second animated series by Hanna-Barbera, Fester was voiced by Rip Taylor. In this series, Fester is perhaps the most loving of self-inflicted injury. He would allow other members (usually Lurch) to harm him any way they can, but his greatest fondness was blowing himself up. As a running gag, Fester would never believe Granny&#x27;s predictions until she predicts something that causes him great harm (or in his case, great joy). Fester also is very fond of the Addamses&#x27; next-door neighbor, Norman Normanmayer, a boring person controlling an underwear empire who hates Fester (and the whole Addams family) for his strangeness (on an occasion, Fester comes on a visit through the sewer pipes). Fester seems quite oblivious of the fact that Norman hates him and, possibly due to the Addams family nature, thinks that all the angry and aggressive outbreaks are a sign of affection. This Fester also introduces himself, through his self-made comic books, as &quot;Festerman&quot;, a gothic hero with a weakness to chimneys, who gives his flying cape to enemies upon request—so as to fall and would bring villains to their knees...simply by enjoying all the harm they would give him to the point of wearing them out. During this series, he is given a musical-type episode about the &quot;Fester Way&quot;, his own, strange way of life.

==Films==
In the 1991 film &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Fester (played by Christopher Lloyd) is the long-lost older brother of Gomez Addams. He was believed to have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for 25 years. A loan shark named Abigail Craven (portrayed by Elizabeth Wilson) conspires to steal the Addams fortune using her son Gordon, who displays an eerie resemblance to the missing Fester. On the night that the Addamses hold an annual séance to contact Fester&#x27;s spirit, Gordon shows up at their door, posing as Fester. Although he is baffled and horrified by the Addamses at first, Gordon begins to take a liking to the family and their strange ways, feeling more at home with them and increasingly conflicted over Abigail&#x27;s manipulations. He ultimately rebels against her and saves the family, but sustains a lightning strike while doing so. It is revealed that he actually &quot;is&quot; Fester; his disappearance left him suffering from amnesia, and Abigail duped him into believing he was her son until the lightning restored his memories. The strike also gives Fester the ability to conduct electricity and make a light bulb glow by putting it in his mouth. In Gomez&#x27;s childhood home movies, Fester is shown to be hairless as a child (although, as Gordon, he first appears with brown, curly hair, and is later shown shaving his head).

Fester, again played by Lloyd, appears in the 1993 sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. He becomes attracted to Debbie Jellinsky (portrayed by Joan Cusack), whom Gomez and Morticia have hired as a nanny to care for their children. Debbie marries Fester with the intent of killing him and inheriting his share of the Addams fortune, but he survives each attempt on his life. After she inadvertently electrocutes herself while trying to kill the entire family, Fester mourns her death. Some time later, Fester becomes attracted to Dementia (portrayed by Carol Hankins), a nanny whom Cousin Itt and his wife have hired to look after their baby.

Fester again appears in the direct-to-video film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;, portrayed by Patrick Thomas. He is portrayed as a mad scientist reminiscent of old Grade-B horror films. He creates a dog named &quot;Butcher&quot; as a birthday present for Pugsley—a dog that mutates into a hair-devouring brute whenever someone says &quot;good boy.&quot; In the end, Butcher attacks Cousin Itt—who is, understandably, quite nervous around him.

Fester is voiced by Nick Kroll in the 2019 animated adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and its sequel where he has a Gilbert Gottfried-type voice. In the first film, he is seen evacuating Gomez and Morticia when an angry mob crashed their wedding. He later shows up to help Gomez train Pugsley for the Saber Mazurka. In the second film, Uncle Fester was used in Wednesday&#x27;s experiment that involved injecting him with the DNA of her pet octopus Socrates.

==Musical==
In the musical, Uncle Fester was played by Kevin Chamberlin in the original broadway cast. Chamberlin received a Tony nomination for the role. He was later played by Brad Oscar, Blake Hammond, Russell Dykstra, and Shaun Rice. This incarnation of Fester serves as the musical&#x27;s narrator and is in love with the moon. The subject of love is apparently his &quot;specialty&quot;, and he is able to play the ukulele when he sings a love song to the moon. He also seems to communicate with the ancestors throughout the show more than the other characters.

==Video games==
Uncle Fester has appeared in several Addams Family video games as a playable character. He is the protagonist of &quot;Fester&#x27;s Quest&quot;, a NES game, and the main playable character in the &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; SNES game. He is also the main character in &quot;Electrifying&quot; arcade machine, where simulated &quot;electrical shocks&quot; are passed through the player as they hold on to two handles.

<doc id="608277" wikidata="Q895848" url="?curid=608277" title="LEO (website)">
<text>LEO (meaning &quot;Link Everything Online&quot;) is an Internet-based electronic dictionary and translation dictionary initiated by the computer science department of the Technical University of Munich in Germany. After a spin-out, the dictionaries have been run since 3 April 2006 by the limited liability company Leo GmbH, formed by the members of the original Leo team, and are partially funded by commercial advertising on the website. Its dictionaries can be consulted free online from any web browser or from LEO&#x27;s &quot;Lion&quot; downloadable user interface (GUI), which is free since version 3.0 (released 13 January 2009), to private users only, and no longer sold as shareware. Corporate users and research institutions are however required to purchase a license.

== Dictionaries ==
The website hosts eight free German language based bilingual dictionaries and forums for additional language queries. The dictionaries are characterized by providing translations in forms of hyperlinks to further dictionary queries, thereby facilitating back translations. The dictionaries are partly added to and corrected by large vocabulary donations of individuals or companies, partly through suggestions and discussions on the LEO language forums.

For any of the eight foreign languages, there&#x27;s at least one (in the cases of English and French two) qualified employee in charge (whose mother tongue is either German and who has studied the respective other idiom or vice versa). These employees oversee the above-mentioned donations and suggestions before integrating them in the dictionary. Thus, an entry can never be simply made by a registered user. These registered users, on the other hand, have the possibility to communicate in the eight different forums where native German speakers and the other native speakers collaborate alike, providing help with finding idiomatic equivalents for phrases or texts etc.

=== English–German ===
The English-German dictionary run by Leo since 1995 contains around 800,000 entries and receives an average of 11 million queries per weekday.

=== French–German ===
In 2004, a French–German dictionary was added to the site&#x27;s services and has about 257,000 entries. This one gets about 2.6 million queries each weekday.

=== Spanish–German ===
A Spanish–German dictionary with about 208,000 entries was introduced on 3 April 2006. It gets about 2 million queries each weekday.

=== Italian–German ===
An Italian-German was started on 3 April 2008. At the time of the public launch, the dictionary contained about 140,000 entries and received 77,000 queries on the first day. 

=== Chinese–German ===
The Chinese–German dictionary was started on the same date as the Italian–German dictionary, 3 April 2008. Queries can be entered by using Pinyin, or traditional or simplified characters. The dictionary started with about 65,000 entries and received about 93,000 queries on the first day. Today it contains about 195,000 entries and receives an average of 240,000 queries each weekday. Due to text encoding limitations, the Chinese dictionary cannot be used in the interface.

=== Russian–German ===
On 18 February 2009, LEO announced a forthcoming release of a German–Russian dictionary. The starter database has been provided in collaboration with ABBY Europe GmbH, the producers of the Lingvo dictionary brand.

The new dictionary became publicly available on 12 April 2010 after a couple of testing days. It started with 77,934 entries and received 38,800 queries on 13 April 2010. As the dictionary only went online in the evening it only received 3,607 queries on its first day.

Today it contains about 300,000 entries and receives an average of 370,000 queries each weekday.

=== Portuguese-German ===

A dictionary for the Portuguese language was announced in early 2011 and first launched in January 2013. As of September 2018, it contains more than 100,000 entries, receiving about 210,000 queries each weekday.

=== Polish-German ===

In 2013, a Polish-German dictionary was started which contains over 74,000 entries by November 2019 and receives almost 80,000 queries every weekday.

== History ==
The site grew out of a network of FTP software and archived data which was put together by students at Munich University of Technology and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich even before HTML and HTTP existed. The original aim was to create a single, huge archive by linking up archives run by the different research groups (hence its name LEO – &quot;Link Everything Online&quot;. The archive was sorted thematically and the different sections organised and kept up to date by archivists.

When the World Wide Web came into common use, HTTP access to the archive was at first added as an alternative to FTP. Students developed various services in their free time, in particular the dictionaries. Some services have been dropped in the course of the spin out.

==Name==
The name of the site is actually a backronym from the name Leo: the Bavarian coat of arms features a lion. Originally, the service was named ISAR (a backronym for Isar river, on the banks of which Munich is situated; here, ISAR stood for &quot;Informations Systeme und Archiv München&quot;, but it had to be renamed as there was another firm of the same name.

<text>Dou Wei (born October 14, 1969) is a Chinese musician, singer-songwriter, composer and music producer. He is a representative figure in Chinese rock music. Alongside rock singers He Yong and Zhang Chu, they were collectively known as the &quot;Prominent Three of Moyan Record Label&quot; in the 1990s.

==Music==
Dou Wei is a multi-instrumentalist and produces music across many genres. He first came to prominence as a member of the hard rock group Black Panther (Hei Bao, 黑豹). In the album &quot;Sunny Days&quot; and &quot;Mountain River&quot;, Dou Wei explored new frontiers in electronic and ambient music. From there on, Dou Wei&#x27;s music took the direction of ambience, folk and post-rock. His two last vocal albums, &quot;Acousma&quot; and &quot;Rainy Murmur&quot; with the E Band, drew influence from the UK post-rock group Bark Psychosis.

Since then Dou Wei&#x27;s music has become more improvisational, and he has consistently collaborated with others and formed the group &quot;Indefinite&quot;. His 2013 album &quot;Golden Curse&quot; (殃金咒) was described as &quot;a fifty-minute Buddhist metal freakout&quot;.
In 2014 he released the &quot;one track album&quot; &quot;Horoscope&quot;, with Zifeng on flute and Moxi Zishi.

==Personal life==
Dou Wei has two daughters: one named Dou Jingtong, born to his ex-wife, Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, and the other one, Dou Jiayuan (), born to his ex-wife, photographer Gao Yuan (). Both of his daughters are now singers.

On 10 May 2006, Dou was arrested for storming the office of &quot;The Beijing News&quot;&#x27; editorial department, destroying a computer keyboard and a DVD player, pouring water on editors in the office, and setting fire to a car&#x27;s boot parked in front of the newspaper&#x27;s office building. Dou claimed that his actions were a response to the newspaper&#x27;s negative reports about his relationship with Gao Yuan and his financial situation.

In March 2019, Dou was married to Chen Ran, a longtime fan two decades younger than him. Their daughter was born in 2016.

<doc id="608287" wikidata="Q28959" url="?curid=608287" title="Han Fei">
<text>Han Fei (233 BC), also known as Han Feizi, was a Chinese Legalist philosopher and statesman during the Warring States period. He was a prince of the state of Han.

Han Fei is often considered the greatest representative of Legalism for the &quot;Han Feizi&quot;, a later anthology of writings traditionally attributed to him, which synthesized the methods of his predecessors. Han Fei&#x27;s ideas are sometimes compared with those of Niccolò Machiavelli, author of &quot;The Prince&quot;. Zhuge Liang is said to have attached great importance to the Han Feizi.

Sima Qian recounts that Qin Shi Huang went to war with the state of Han to obtain an audience with Han Fei, but was ultimately convinced to imprison him, whereupon he commits suicide. After the early demise of the Qin dynasty, the school was officially vilified by the Han dynasty that succeeded it. Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, Han Fei&#x27;s political theory and the Legalist school continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of rule without laws was never to be realized.

Han Fei borrowed Shang Yang&#x27;s emphasis on laws, Shen Buhai&#x27;s emphasis on administrative technique, and Shen Dao&#x27;s ideas on authority and prophecy, emphasizing that the autocrat will be able to achieve firm control over the state with the mastering of his predecessors&#x27; methodologies: his position of &#x27;power&#x27; ( ), &#x27;technique&#x27; ( ), and &#x27;law&#x27; (&quot;fa&quot;). He stressed the importance of the concept of holding actual outcome accountable to speech ( &quot;xingming&quot;), coupled with the &quot;two handles&quot; system of punishment and reward, as well as &quot;wu wei&quot; (&#x27;non-exertion&#x27;).

== Names ==
Han Fei is also known respectfully as Hanzi (&#x27;Master Han&#x27;) or as Han Feizi (&#x27;Master Han Fei&#x27;). In Wade–Giles transcription, his same name is written Han Tzu, Han-tzu, Han Fei Tzu, or Han Fei-tzu. The same name—sometimes as &quot;Hanfeizi&quot; or &quot;Han-fei-tzu&quot;—is used to denote the later anthology traditionally attributed to him.

== Life ==
The exact year of Han Fei&#x27;s birth remains unknown, however, scholars have placed it at .

Unlike the other famed philosophers of the time, Han Fei was a member of the ruling aristocracy, having been born into the ruling family of Han during the end phase of the Warring States period. In this context, his works have been interpreted by some scholars as being directed to his cousin, the King of Han. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; say that Han Fei studied together with future Qin chancellor Li Si under the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang. It is said that because of his stutter, Han Fei could not properly present his ideas in court, but Sima regards him as having been very intelligent. His advice otherwise being ignored, but observing the slow decline of his Han state, he developed &quot;one of the most brilliant (writing) styles in ancient China.&quot;

Sima Qian&#x27;s biography of Han Fei is as follows: 
His works ultimately ended up in the hands of King Ying Zheng of Qin, who commented, &quot;If I can make friends with this person [Han Fei], I may die without regrets.&quot; and invited Han Fei to the Qin court. Han Fei presented the essay &quot;Preserving the Han&quot; to ask the king not to attack his homeland, but his ex-friend and rival Li Si used that essay to have Han Fei imprisoned on account of his likely loyalty to Han. Han Fei responded by writing another essay named &quot;In the first time of meeting Qin king&quot;, hoping to use his writing talent to win the king&#x27;s heart. Han Fei did win the king&#x27;s heart, but not before Li Si forced him to commit suicide by drinking poison. The Qin king afterward regretted Han Fei&#x27;s death.

==Summary of his legalism==
Xunzi formed the hypothesis that human nature is evil and virtueless, therefore suggesting that human infants must be brought to their virtuous form through social-class-oriented Confucian moral education. Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtueless and be steered by his own human nature to commit immoral acts. Han Fei&#x27;s education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy for the management of an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a loose and inefficient tool. Han agreed with his teacher&#x27;s theory of &quot;virtueless by birth&quot;, but as in previous Legalist philosophy, pragmatically proposed to steer people by their own interest-driven nature.

<text>Heinrich Eduard Heine (16 March 1821 – 21 October 1881) was a German mathematician.

Heine became known for results on special functions and in real analysis. In particular, he authored an important treatise on spherical harmonics and Legendre functions (&quot;Handbuch der Kugelfunctionen&quot;). He also investigated basic hypergeometric series. He introduced the Mehler–Heine formula.

==Biography==
Heinrich Eduard Heine was born on 16 March 1821 in Berlin, as the eighth child of banker Karl Heine and his wife Henriette Märtens. Eduard was initially home schooled, then studied at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium and Köllnische Gymnasium in Berlin. In 1838, after graduating from gymnasium, he enrolled at the University of Berlin, but transferred to the University of Göttingen to attend the mathematics lectures of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Moritz Stern. In 1840 Heine returned to Berlin, where he studied mathematics under Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, while also attending classes of Jakob Steiner and Johann Franz Encke. In 1842 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Berlin for a thesis on differential equations submitted with Enno Dirksen and Martin Ohm as advisors. Heine dedicated the doctoral thesis to his professor Gustav Dirichlet. Next he went to the University of Königsberg to participate in the mathematical seminar of Carl Gustav Jacobi, while also following mathematical physics classes of Franz Ernst Neumann. In Königsberg Heine got in contact with fellow students Gustav Kirchhoff and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.

In 1844 Heine went for a teaching position at the University of Bonn, passing his habilitation and starting as a privatdozent. He continued his research in mathematics in Bonn and, in 1848, was promoted to extraordinary professor. In 1850 he married Sophie Wolff, the daughter of a Berlin merchant; the couple had five children, four daughters and one son. In 1856 Heine moved as a full professor to the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1864 to 1865, he served as a rector of the university. In 1875, the University of Göttingen offered Heine a mathematics chair but he decided to reject the offer and remain in Halle. In 1877, at the centenary of Gauss&#x27;s birth, he was awarded the Gauss Medal for his research. Eduard Heine died on 21 October 1881 in Halle.

<text>The arms industry, also known as the defense (or defence) industry, military industry, or the arms trade, is a global industry which manufactures and sells weapons and other military technology to a variety of customers, including the armed forces of states and civilian individuals and organizations. Products of the arms industry include weapons, munitions, weapons platforms, communications systems, and other electronics, and related equipment. The arms industry also provides defense-related services, such as logistical and operational support. As a matter of policy, many governments of industrialized countries maintain or support a network of organizations, facilities, and resources to produce weapons and equipment for their military forces (and sometimes those of other countries). This is often referred to as a defense industrial base. Entities involved in arms production for military purposes vary widely, and include private sector commercial firms, state-owned enterprises and public sector organizations, and scientific and academic institutions. Such entities perform a wide variety of functions, including research and development, engineering, production, and servicing of military material, equipment, and facilities. The weapons they produce are often made, maintained, and stored in arsenals.

In 2024, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated global military expenditure at $2.443 trillion, the highest level ever recorded by SIPRI and the steepest year-on-year increase since 2009. SIPRI further found that the combined revenues of the top 100 largest defense companies totaled $632 billion in 2023, with the five largest companies by revenue being Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. SIPRI&#x27;s data also showed that, between 2019 and 2023, the five largest arms exporting nations were the United States, France, Russia, China and Germany (taken together, they supplied approximately 75% of the world&#x27;s arms exports during this period). In some regions of the world, there is a substantial legal trade in firearms for use by individuals (commonly cited purposes include self-defense and hunting/sporting). Illegal small arms trade occurs in many countries and regions affected by political instability. In 2017, the Small Arms Survey estimated that approximately one billion firearms were in global circulation; of those, 857 million (85%) were possessed by civilians, 133 million (13%) were possessed by national militaries, and 23 million (2%) belonged to law enforcement agencies. The Small Arms Survey also found that the number of firearms in circulation had increased significantly between 2006 and 2017, primarily due to increases in civilian possession.

==History==

During the early modern period, England, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands became self-sufficient in arms production, with diffusion and migration of skilled workers to more peripheral countries such as Portugal and Russia.

The modern arms industry emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as a product of the creation and expansion of the first large military–industrial companies. As smaller countries and even newly industrializing countries like Russia and Japan could no longer produce cutting-edge military equipment with their Indigenous capacity-based resources, they increasingly began to contract the manufacturers of military equipment, such as battleships, artillery pieces and rifles to foreign government military entities. In 1854, the British government awarded a contract to the Elswick Ordnance Company to supply the latest loading artillery pieces. This galvanized the private sector into weapons production, with the surplus increasingly exported to foreign countries. William Armstrong became one of the first international arms dealers, selling his systems to governments across the world from Brazil to Japan. In 1884, he opened a shipyard at Elswick to specialize in warship production – at the time, it was the only factory in the world that could build a battleship and arm it completely. The factory produced warships for foreign naval forces, including the Imperial Japanese Navy. Several Armstrong cruisers played an important role in defeating the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. In the American Civil War in 1861 the North had about ten times the manufacturing capacity of the economy of the Confederate States of America. This advantage over the South included the ability to produce (in relatively small numbers) breech-loading rifles for use against the muzzle-loading rifled muskets of the South. This began the transition to industrially produced mechanized weapons such as the Gatling gun.

This industrial innovation in the defense industry was adopted by Prussia in its 1864, 1866, and 1870–71 defeats of Denmark, Austria, and, France respectively. By this time the machine gun had begun entering arsenals. The first examples of its effectiveness were in 1899 during the Boer War and in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. However, Germany led the innovation of weapons and this advantage in the weapons of World War I nearly defeated the allies. 

In 1885, France decided to capitalize on this increasingly lucrative trade and repealed its ban on weapon exports. The regulatory framework for the period up to the First World War was characterized by a laissez-faire policy that placed little obstruction in the way of weapons exports. Due to the carnage of World War I, arms traders began to be regarded with odium as &quot;merchants of death&quot; and were accused of having instigated and perpetuated the war for earning their profits from weapons sales. An inquiry into these allegations in Britain failed to find evidence to support them. However, the sea change in attitude about war more generally meant that governments began to control and regulate the trade themselves. The volume of the arms trade greatly increased during the 20th century, and it began to be used as a political tool, especially during the Cold War when the United States and the USSR supplied weapons to their proxies across the world, particularly third world countries (see Nixon Doctrine).

==Sectors==

===Land-based weapons===

This category includes everything from light arms to heavy artillery, and the majority of producers are small. Many are located in third-world countries. International trade in handguns, machine guns, tanks, armored personnel carriers, and other relatively inexpensive weapons is substantial. There is relatively little regulation at the international level, and as a result, many weapons fall into the hands of organized crime, rebel forces, terrorists, or regimes under sanctions.

====Small arms====

The Control Arms Campaign, founded by Amnesty International, Oxfam, and the International Action Network on Small Arms, estimated in 2003 that there are over 639 million small arms in circulation and that over 1,135 companies based in more than 98 countries manufacture small arms as well as their various components and ammunition.

===Aerospace systems===
Encompassing military aircraft (both land-based and naval aviation), conventional missiles, and military satellites, this is the most technologically advanced sector of the market. It is also the least competitive from an economic standpoint, with a handful of companies dominating the entire market. The top clients and major producers are virtually all located in the western world and Russia, with the United States easily in the first place. Prominent aerospace firms include Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Saab AB, Dassault Aviation, Sukhoi, Mikoyan, EADS, Leonardo, Thales Group, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, RTX Corporation, and Boeing. There are also several multinational consortia mostly involved in the manufacturing of fighter jets, such as the Eurofighter. The largest military contract in history, signed in October 2001, involved the development of the Joint Strike Fighter.

=== Naval systems ===
Several of the world&#x27;s great powers maintain substantial naval forces to provide a global presence, with the largest nations possessing aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and advanced anti-air defense systems. The vast majority of military ships are conventionally powered, but some are nuclear-powered. There is also a large global market in second-hand naval vessels, generally purchased by developing countries from Western governments.

=== Cybersecurity ===
The cybersecurity industry is expected to be of increasing importance to defense, intelligence, and homeland security agencies.

==International arms transfers==

=== Over time ===

==== 2010–2014 ====
According to research institute SIPRI, the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010–14 was 16 percent higher than in 2005–2009. The five biggest exporters in 2010–2014 were the United States, Russia, China, Germany, and France, and the five biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, the United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan. The flow of arms to the Middle East increased by 87 percent between 2009–13 and 2014–18, while there was a decrease in flows to all other regions: Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and Europe.

==== 2014–2018 ====
SIPRI has identified 67 countries as exporters of major weapons in 2014–18. The top 5 exporters during the period were responsible for 75 percent of all arms exports. The composition of the five largest exporters of arms changed between 2014 and 2018 and remained unchanged compared to 2009–13, although their combined total exports of major arms were 10 percent higher. In 2014–18, significant increases in arms exports from the US, France and Germany were seen, while Chinese exports rose marginally and Russian exports decreased.

In 2014–18, 155 countries (about three-quarters of all countries) imported major weapons. The top 5 recipients accounted for 33 percent of the total arms imports during the period. The top five arms importers – Saudi Arabia, India, Egypt, Australia, and Algeria – accounted for 35 percent of total arms imports in 2014–18. Of these, Saudi Arabia and India were among the top five importers in both 2009–13 and 2014–18.

In 2014–18, the volume of major arms international transfers was 7.8 percent higher than in 2009–13 and 23 percent higher than that in 2004–08. The largest arms importer was Saudi Arabia, importing arms primarily from the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Between 2009–13 and 2014–18, the flow of arms to the Middle East increased by 87 percent. Also including India, Egypt, Australia, and Algeria, the top five importers received 35 percent of the total arms imports, during 2014–18. The five largest exporters were the United States, Russia, France, Germany and China.

==== Post-2018 ====

In 2019–23, the volume of major international arms transfers was 3.3 per cent lower than in 2014–18 and 3.3 per cent higher than in 2009–13. Imports of major arms by states in Europe increased by 94 per cent between 2014–18 and 2019–23, while the global volume of international arms transfers decreased marginally, by 3.3 per cent. The five largest arms importers in 2019–23 were India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Ukraine and Pakistan, while the five largest arms exporters were the United States, France, Russia, China and Germany.

=== World&#x27;s largest arms exporters ===

 The following are estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&#x27;s Arms Transfers Database. 


While Russian, Chinese and German arms exports fell from 2014-2018, US and French arms exports rose. The top 25 arms exporters accounted for 98 per cent of the world’s arms exports in 2019–23. States in North America and Europe together accounted for 87 per cent of all arms exports in the period. The five largest exporters in Western Europe supplied around one quarter of total global arms exports in 2019–23.

===World&#x27;s largest arms exporters since 1950===
SIPRI uses the &quot;trend-indicator values&quot; (TIV). These are based on the known unit production costs of weapons and represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

=== World&#x27;s largest arms importers ===

Arms import rankings fluctuate heavily as countries enter and exit wars. Accordingly, 5-year moving averages present a much more accurate picture of import volume, free from yearly fluctuations. 

In the period from 2019 to 2023, the top five arms importers together received 35 per cent of all arms imports. States in Asia and Oceania accounted for 37 per cent of all arms imports in 2019–23, followed by the Middle East (30 per cent), Europe (21 per cent), the Americas (5.7 per cent) and Africa (4.3 per cent).

=== List of major weapon manufacturers ===
This is a list of the world&#x27;s largest arms manufacturers and other military service companies who profit the most from the war economy, their origin is shown as well. The information is based on a list published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute for 2023.

==Arms control==

Arms control refers to international restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation, and usage of small arms, conventional weapons, and weapons of mass destruction. It is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy, which seeks to persuade governments to accept such limitations through agreements and treaties, although it may also be forced upon non-consenting governments.

===Notable international arms control treaties===

* Geneva Protocol on biological and chemical weapons during 1925
* Outer Space Treaty, signed and entered into force during 1967
* Biological Weapons Convention, signed in 1972, entered into force during 1975
* Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), 1987
* Chemical Weapons Convention, signed in 1993, entered into force during 1997
* Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel land mines, signed in 1997, entered into force during 1999
* New START Treaty, signed by Russia and the United States in April 2010, entered into force in February 2011
* Arms Trade Treaty, concluded in 2013, entered into force on 24 December 2014.

<text>USS &quot;Dentuda&quot; (SS-335) was a of the United States Navy in service from 1944 to 1946. Afterwards, she was used as a training ship until 1967. Two years later, she was sold for scrap.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Capidoli&quot;, she was renamed &quot;Dentuda&quot; on 24 September 1942, launched on 10 September 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. T. W. Hogan, wife of Commander Hogan; and commissioned on 30 December 1944, Commander John S. McCain, Jr., in command. Dentuda is the Spanish name for the shortfin mako. Her shakedown was extended by two months of experimental duty for the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. She sailed on 5 April 1945 for the Pacific, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 10 May. From 29 May to 29 July, she conducted her first war patrol in the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, damaging a large freighter, and on 18 June 1945 sinking two patrol craft: &quot;Reiko Maru&quot; and &quot;Heiwa Maru&quot;. &quot;Dentuda&quot; remained at Pearl Harbor until 3 January 1946, when she sailed for the West Coast. She arrived at San Francisco, California 5 days later.

Assigned to JTF 1 as a test vessel for Operation Crossroads, &quot;Dentuda&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 February, and on 22 May sailed for Bikini Atoll. She underwent both atomic weapons tests with her crew safely away from their submarine, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 September. On 7 October, she got underway for Mare Island Naval Shipyard, arriving 14 October. She was decommissioned on 11 December 1946 and stationed in the 12th Naval District for the training of members of the Naval Reserve. She was finally struck on 30 June 1967 and sold for scrap on 12 February 1969.

==Awards==
&quot;Dentuda&quot;″s single war patrol was designated as &quot;successful&quot;; and she received one battle star for her contribution to the success of the Okinawa operation.

<doc id="608301" wikidata="Q5684605" url="?curid=608301" title="Hawaiian literature">
<text>Hawaiian literature has its origins in Polynesian mythology. It was originally preserved and expanded solely through oral traditions, as the ancient Hawaiians never developed a writing system. Written literature in the Hawaiian language and literary works in other languages by authors residing in Hawaii did not appear until the nineteenth century, when the arrival of American missionaries introduced the English language, the Latin alphabet, and Western notions of composition to the kingdom.

The earliest compilations of traditional Hawaiian writing were made by John Papa ʻĪʻī, Samuel Kamakau, Kepelino Keauokalani, and David Malo. They were succeeded by King Kalākaua, Martha Beckwith, Abraham Fornander, and William Drake Westervelt, all of whom produced later collections retelling or adapting Hawaii&#x27;s oral histories.

Other noted authors whose works feature Hawaiian settings and themes, or who were temporarily resident in Hawaii, include Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jack London. Detective novelist Earl Derr Biggers is remembered chiefly for his books set in early twentieth century Honolulu, whose protagonist is Chinese-Hawaiian detective Charlie Chan.

Hawaiian literature in the latter half of the twentieth century was characterized by both rapid growth and an increasing emphasis on realism, sometimes influenced by the Second Hawaiian Renaissance and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

<text>John Nicolas Kordic (March 22, 1965 – August 8, 1992) was a Canadian ice hockey player in the National Hockey League.

==Hockey career==
Kordic played for the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Washington Capitals and Quebec Nordiques, for a total of seven seasons in the NHL. He won the Memorial Cup with the Portland Winter Hawks in 1983, the Calder Cup with the Sherbrooke Canadiens in 1985, and a Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1986. While playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs, he wore No. 27, formerly worn by Leaf players Darryl Sittler and Frank Mahovlich. Kordic was known as an enforcer on the ice.

In 1992, he moved back to Quebec after finishing the season with the Cape Breton Oilers, and had expressed hope that he could turn his life around if he could catch on with the Oilers and play in his hometown.

==Death==
On August 8, 1992, after overdosing on drugs and being involved in a struggle with police at Motel Maxim in L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette, Quebec, Kordic died of lung failure due to heart malfunction.

==Personal life==
At the time of Kordic&#x27;s death he was engaged to marry a former exotic dancer named Nancy Masse, who used to work at a Quebec club called Le Folichon, less than a kilometre from where he died. Kordic&#x27;s brother, Dan, played for the Philadelphia Flyers organization in the 1990s.

<doc id="608309" wikidata="Q2846602" url="?curid=608309" title="Andrew Fletcher (patriot)">
<text>Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (1655 – September 1716) was a Scottish writer and politician, remembered as an advocate for the non-incorporation of Scotland, and an opponent of the 1707 Act of Union between Scotland and England. Fletcher became an exile in 1683 after being accused of promoting insurrection. He was appointed the cavalry commander of the Monmouth Rebellion, but shortly after landing in England, he killed another leading figure. He again went into exile, this time as a fugitive and with his estates forfeit. He returned with William of Orange, becoming Commissioner of the old Parliament of Scotland.

Fletcher was a defender of the Darién scheme, although suspicious of the effect of conventional commerce on traditional virtues. He also deplored the effect of London&#x27;s relative size, which he said would inevitably draw an accelerating proportion of wealth and decision-making to the south-east corner of Britain.

==Early life and political career==
Andrew Fletcher was the son and heir of Sir Robert Fletcher (1625–1664), and grandson of Andrew Fletcher, Lord Innerpeffer, and was born at Saltoun in East Lothian. Educated by Gilbert Burnet, the future Bishop of Salisbury, who was then minister at Saltoun, he completed his education in mainland Europe. Fletcher was elected, as the Commissioner for Haddingtonshire, to the Scottish Parliament in 1678. At this time, Charles II&#x27;s representative in Scotland was John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale. The Duke had taxation powers in Scotland, and maintained a standing army there in the name of the King. Fletcher bitterly opposed the Duke, whose actions only strengthened Fletcher&#x27;s distrust of the royal government in Scotland, as well as all hereditary power. In 1681, Fletcher was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament as member for Haddingtonshire. The year before, Lauderdale had been replaced by the Duke of Albany. At this time, Fletcher was a member of the opposition Country Party in the Scottish Parliament, where he resolutely opposed any arbitrary actions on the part of the Church or state.

==Exile and return==
In 1683, after being charged with plotting against the King, Fletcher fled Scotland to join with English opponents of King Charles in the Netherlands where he gained the confidence of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, being given command of the cavalry for the Monmouth Rebellion. Fletcher wanted to strike at the country militia while they were being formed up, and appropriated a fine horse belonging to the leading local sympathizer, Thomas Dare, who was shot dead when he became threatening in the ensuing argument. Monmouth was forced to send Fletcher away. Monmouth&#x27;s forces failed to pursue a timely offensive strategy, and were defeated. After escaping from a Spanish prison, Fletcher fought in Hungary against the Turks before joining William of Orange, with whom he returned to Scotland in 1688, but his alliance with the Prince of Orange faded when it became clear William II - as he was in Scotland - was only interested in using the country to help fight foreign wars. His estates were restored to him and, increasingly, Fletcher defended his country&#x27;s claims over English interests as well as opposing royal power. In 1703, at a critical stage in the history of Scotland, Fletcher again became a member of the Scottish Parliament as member for Haddingtonshire. Now Queen Anne was on the throne and there was a campaign to join England and Scotland in a parliamentary union, thus closing the &quot;back door&quot; to England that Scotland represented.

== Darién Scheme and the Act of Union ==

Fletcher had been an strong supporter of the Darien scheme, a financial disaster at the worst possible time for a country which had suffered repeated bad harvests; he continued to defend the scheme against those who painted it as an act of folly. Hurt national pride had led to many Scots blaming the scheme&#x27;s failure on the hostility of England to it, and Fletcher and the Country party seized the opportunity to promote increased Scottish self-reliance. However, by practically ruining the Scottish elite the Darien scheme increased support for union with England, bolstered by offers of money to Scots who would support it. Fletcher continued to argue against an &quot;incorporating union&quot; and for a federal union to preserve Scotland&#x27;s nationhood. Although not successful in preventing the Act of Union passing in the Scottish parliament through these debates Fletcher gained recognition as an independent patriot. 
One of his most famous pieces of writings was his &quot;twelve limitations&quot;, intended to limit the power of the Crown to influence Scottish politics. His limitations were:

Although the limitations did not pass the house, something little short of them was passed, the Act of Security 1704 (c.3 (S)), which made provisions in case of the Queen&#x27;s death, with the conditions under which the successor to the throne of England was to be allowed to succeed to that of Scotland, which were to be, &quot;at least, freedom of navigation, free communication of trade, and liberty of the plantations to the kingdom and subjects of Scotland, established by the parliament of England.&quot; The same parliament passed an Peace and War Act 1703 (c. 6) (S)), which provided that after the Queen&#x27;s death, failing heirs of her body, no person at the same time being King or Queen of Scotland and England, would have the sole power of making war without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.

==Withdrawal from politics==
In 1707, the Act of Union was approved by the Scottish Parliament, officially uniting Scotland with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Fletcher turned from politics in despair and devoted the rest of his life to farming and agricultural development in Scotland. He died unmarried in Paris in September 1716. His last words were &#x27;Lord have mercy on my poor country that is so barbarously oppressed&#x27;.

==Reputation in his time==
He was reputed to have had the best private library in Scotland. Arthur L. Herman in &quot;How the Scots Invented the Modern World&quot; describes Fletcher as a genuine intellectual, but regards his vision for Scotland as retrograde. Alasdair MacIntyre has written, &quot;Almost alone among his contemporaries Fletcher understood the dilemma confronting Scotland as involving more radical alternatives than they were prepared to entertain.&quot; Thomas Jefferson thought well of him, writing, &quot;The political principles of that patriot were worthy of the purest periods of the British constitution. They are those which were in vigour at the epoch of the American emigration. Our ancestors brought them here, and they needed little strengthening to make us what we are.&quot;

==Works==
His chief works are &quot;A Discourse of Government relating to Militias&quot; (1698), in which he argued that the royal army in Scotland should be replaced by local militias, a position of civic republican virtue which was to return a half-century later and foreshadowed the thinking of Adam Ferguson in lauding martial virtues over commercially minded polite society, which Fletcher thought enervating. The famous phrase &quot;well regulated militia,&quot; which found its way into the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, appears in this work, as does the phrase &quot;ordinary and ill-regulated militia.&quot;

&quot;Two Discourses concerning the Affairs of Scotland&quot; (1698), in which he discussed the problems of Scottish trade and economics; and &quot;An Account of a Conversation concerning a right regulation of Governments for the common good of Mankind&quot; (1703). In Two Discourses he suggested that the numerous vagrants who infested Scotland should be brought into compulsory and hereditary servitude, it was already the case that criminals or the dissolute were transported to the colonies and sold as virtual slaves at that time. In &quot;An Account of a Conversation&quot; he made his well-known remark &quot;I knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christopher&#x27;s sentiment, that he believed if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the laws of a nation&quot;.

==Family==

In 1747 his nephew, Andrew Fletcher, who had inherited Saltoun Hall, purchased the lands of Brunstane House to the west. William Fletcher, a first cousin of Andrew, moved to Ireland in the 1690s. His descendants settled in Dublin and County Offaly and became prosperous.

<text>Handsworth () is an inner-city area of Birmingham in the county of the West Midlands, England. Historically in Staffordshire, Handsworth lies just outside Birmingham City Centre and near the town of Smethwick. In 2021 the ward had a population of 11,820.

==History==
The name &quot;Handsworth&quot; originates from its Saxon owner Hondes and the Old English word &quot;weorthing&quot;, meaning farm or estate. It was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086, as a holding of William Fitz-Ansculf, the Lord of Dudley, although at that time it would only have been a very small village surrounded by farmland and extensive woodland. One of the oldest buildings in Handsworth is the Old Town Hall which dates from 1460.

Historically in the county of Staffordshire, it remained a small village from the 13th century to the 18th century. Accommodation was built for factory workers, the village quickly grew, and in 1851, more than 6,000 people were living in the township. In that year, work began to build St James&#x27; Church. Later St Michael&#x27;s Church was built as a daughter church to St James&#x27;. In the census of 1881, the town was recorded as having approx. 32,000 residents. By the census of 1911, this had more than doubled to 68,610. The Council House, in Soho Road, now used as a public library and college campus, was completed in 1879.

The development of the built environment was sporadic and many of Handsworth&#x27;s streets display a mixture of architectural types and periods – among them some of the finest Victorian buildings in the city. Handsworth has two grammar schools – Handsworth Grammar School and King Edward VI Handsworth School (for girls). St Andrew&#x27;s Church is a listed building in Oxhill Road which also held Sunday school classes in a small building on the corner of Oxhill Road and Church Lane. It also contains Handsworth Park, which in 2006 underwent a major restoration, the vibrant shopping area of Soho Road and St. Mary&#x27;s Church containing the remains of the founders of the Industrial Revolution - Watt, Murdoch and Boulton. The 1901 Red Lion public house was grade II* listed in 1985, but has been empty since 2008 and is considered &quot;at risk&quot;.

In 1894 Handsworth became an urban district, on 9 November 1911 the urban district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Birmingham and Handsworth parish was transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire. In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 75,145. On 1 October 1930 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

Birmingham historian Dr. Carl Chinn noted that during the Second World War the boundary between Handsworth and the outlying suburb of Handsworth Wood marked the line between being safe and unsafe from bombing, with Handsworth Wood being an official evacuation zone, despite being at least ten miles away from any countryside that might now qualify as &quot;green belt&quot; land, and being on the periphery of many &quot;high risk&quot; areas. During the Second World War, West Indians had arrived as part of the colonial war effort, where they worked in Birmingham munitions factories. In the post-war period, a rebuilding programme required much unskilled labour and Birmingham&#x27;s industrial base expanded, significantly increasing the demand for both skilled and unskilled workers. During this time, there was direct recruitment for workers from the Caribbean and the area became a centre for Birmingham&#x27;s Afro-Caribbean community.

A tram depot was erected near Birmingham Road, next to the border with West Bromwich, during the 1880s, and remained in use until the tram service ended in 1939. Although it has since been demolished, a replica of the depot was created later in the 20th century at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley.

== Boulton and Watt ==
Matthew Boulton&#x27;s Soho Manufactory was set up on the northern edge of Handsworth, on Handsworth Heath. It operated from 1766 to 1848, and was demolished in 1863. Boulton commissioned Samuel Wyatt to design his nearby house Soho House, which is now a museum.

In 1790, Heathfield Hall, also designed by Wyatt, was built for Boulton&#x27;s business partner, the engineer James Watt. Watt died in the house in 1819, and was buried at nearby St Mary&#x27;s Church. In the 1880s engineer George Tangye bought the hall and lived there until his death in 1920. From 1927 the hall was demolished and the lands redeveloped. What was the Heathfield Estate is now the land that comprises West Drive and North Drive. Watt&#x27;s workshop from the house was dismantled and rebuilt in the Science Museum, London.

==Civil unrest, social issues and community==

A riot occurred in 1981, during which similar riots took place in Brixton (London), Chapeltown (Leeds), and Toxteth (Liverpool). The &#x27;sus&#x27; law (Vagrancy Act 1824) saw black youths being disproportionately stopped, searched and arrested by the police, on the grounds of mere &#x27;suspicion&#x27; of possible illegal activity; this, along with high unemployment and social alienation, was a key element of the backdrop to the 1981 riots. The subsequent Scarman report (1981) concluded that the riots were &quot;essentially an outburst of anger and resentment by young black people against the police&quot;. A similar social backdrop of tensions and hostility towards the police existed during the rioting of September 1985 (which lasted for two days, beginning in Lozells Road, Lozells, and spreading into Handsworth) to which this unrest was ascribed.

After the 1985 riots and a change in perception of British sub-urban integration, community relations were reviewed. Local government worked to improve community relations as a way of managing both racial and cultural differences. Encouragement was provided by arts organisations such as West Midlands Ethnic Minority Arts Service; its director, Pogus Caesar, photographed the riots, and Black Audio Film Collective produced the 1986 film &quot;Handsworth Songs&quot;.

There was further unrest in 1991 and 2005; with a fatality occurring during the 2005 riot. The 2011 England riots also spread to the Handsworth area.

&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s online article &quot;Riots don&#x27;t happen without a reason&quot; (August 2011) seeks to explore the context and histories of these inner-city riots, since the 1980s; emphasising the need for improvements in the relationship between the community and the police.

In the 2010s neighbourhood schemes and developments have helped to improve the area. Businesses in the area, particularly on Soho Road have contributed towards schemes in partnership with council. Soho Road, Holyhead Road &amp; Soho Hill is within a Business Improvement District (BID) area.
A number of initiatives promoting community cohesion exist within this multicultural community. The Handsworth Community Choir boasts a blend of singers from the area. The Handsworth Park Community Garden opened in July 2017. The community website ‘Inside Handsworth’, shares community news, events and stories.

== Musical legacy ==
Handsworth has produced some notable popular musical acts: Steel Pulse (whose first studio album &quot;Handsworth Revolution&quot; is named after the area), Joan Armatrading, Pato Banton, Benjamin Zephaniah, Swami, Apache Indian, Ruby Turner and Bhangra group B21. In addition, hard rock band Black Sabbath&#x27;s lead guitarist and songwriter Tony Iommi, Steve Winwood, pop singer Jamelia and progressive rock drummer Carl Palmer were born in Handsworth.

The tenor Webster Booth was born in Handsworth in 1902, and began his singing career as a child chorister at the local parish church of St. Mary&#x27;s. Together with his duettist wife Anne Ziegler, he became a mainstay of West End musicals and World War II musical films. A BBC Showbiz Hall of Fame article described him as &quot;possessing one of the finest English tenor voices of the twentieth century.&quot;

==Events==
Handsworth Park has hosted numerous events: The Birmingham Tattoo, The Birmingham Festival (both originally called Handsworth- rather than Birmingham). The Handsworth Carnival grew out of the Flower Show and Carnival; Caribbean-style carnivals began in Handsworth Park, in 1984, with a street procession via Holyhead Road. In 1994 the carnival was held in Handsworth Park for the last time. The following year it was moved from the park out onto the streets of Handsworth, since which time it has been known as the Birmingham International Carnival. In 1999, it was again held in a park, but this time in Perry Park.

==Education==

Among education providers is the Rookery School, a 100-year-old mixed state primary school, still housed largely in its original buildings. These were opened in 1899 to the designs of the architect Edward Holmes.

Secondary schools include Handsworth Wood Girls&#x27; Academy, Holyhead School, St John Wall Catholic School, also, selective state schools such as King Edward VI Handsworth Grammar School for Boys and King Edward VI Handsworth School (girls).

<text>Tara Bray Smith (born September 1970) is an American author. She has produced the books &quot;West of Then: A Mother, a Daughter, and a Journey Past Paradise&quot; (2004) and &quot;Betwixt&quot; (2007).

==Early years and career==
Smith was born and grew up in Hawaii. She graduated from Dartmouth College and received a master&#x27;s in non-fiction writing from Columbia University.

Her first book was a memoir, &quot;West of Then: A Mother, a Daughter, and a Journey Past Paradise&quot;, published in 2004. It tells the story of her actual and metaphorical search for her drug-addicted mother, as well as the history of her mother&#x27;s family in Hawaii, rooted in the wealth and subsequent decline of 19th-century sugarcane plantations. Smith also wrote an article about Hawaii that appeared in &quot;Granta 77: What We Think of America&quot; (2002).

Smith made her debut as a young adult author with her second book, the teen novel &quot;Betwixt&quot; (2007), which became the basis for a pilot for The CW Television Network, but was never turned into a series. The proposed series, called &quot;Betwixt&quot; and then &quot;Changelings&quot;, would have starred three teenagers (Jessy Schram, Allison Miller and Josh Henderson) who find out they are &quot;changelings&quot; who have the ability to protect the world from evil.

==Personal life==
Smith married the German photographer Thomas Struth in 2007. She lives in New York City and Düsseldorf.
