<text>Mr. Deeds is a 2002 American comedy film directed by Steven Brill, written by Tim Herlihy, and produced by Sid Ganis and Jack Giarraputo. It stars Adam Sandler in the title role, alongside Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Jared Harris, Allen Covert, Erick Avari, and John Turturro. The film is a remake of the 1936 Frank Capra film &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, which itself was based on the 1935 short story &quot;Opera Hat&quot; by Clarence Budington Kelland. It tells the story of a pizzeria owner who learns that he is the heir of a late multi-billionaire as he also meets a television reporter wanting a story on him.

Produced by Sandler&#x27;s production company Happy Madison Productions in association with New Line Cinema and Out of the Blue... Entertainment, &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on June 28, 2002. The film received negative reviews.

==Plot==
Boisterous billionaire Preston Blake, owner of Blake Media, freezes to death while climbing Mount Everest. During the ensuing media circus, his board of directors, led by the greedy Chuck Cedar, discover his closest-living-relative is a great-nephew named Longfellow Deeds. Deeds is a kind-hearted and fiercely protective man who runs a pizzeria in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire with his friend Jan. He also writes greeting cards in his free time, hoping they might be accepted by Hallmark.

Deeds is flown to New York City and meets various Blake staff-members, including well-meaning general counsel Cecil Anderson. He also meets Blake&#x27;s longtime butler Emilio Lopez, who saw Blake as a father figure and quickly befriends Deeds. Plans are made for Deeds to sell his shares in the company for $40 billion, though he must remain in New York for the time being. Cedar grows to despise Deeds, and secretly wants to break up Blake Media.

Cynical television tabloid reporter Babe Bennett, wanting in on the story, invents the false persona of &quot;Pam Dawson&quot; to get close to Deeds. She has her lecherous co-worker Marty pretend to steal her purse in front of Deeds so he can &quot;save her,&quot; though unfortunately, Deeds pummels Marty senseless. Deeds is immediately smitten with Babe, who clumsily makes up a story about being a school nurse from the actually real town of &quot;Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa.&quot;

Although initially only interested in the story, Babe eventually falls for the kind-hearted Deeds, who writes her a poem and manages to find a real &quot;Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa,&quot; which he takes her to on a surprise trip.

Marty tips-off Cedar to Babe&#x27;s true identity and during a dinner date, the truth is revealed about her deception. Heartbroken, Deeds decides to return home. He&#x27;s assured that the company will stay open, and asks to donate his money. However, he later learns from his mentally-unstable friend &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; that Cedar intends to sell the company and lay off thousands of employees.

Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, getting into a massive brawl with Jan, who is furious at Babe for hurting her friend. Jan realizes Babe really cares for Deeds and tells her where to find him. While approaching Deeds, Babe falls through the ice of a frozen lake. Deeds hears her cries and saves her from drowning, breaking the ice with his foot, which was rendered rock-hard from a childhood frostbite injury. Despite Babe&#x27;s pleas for forgiveness, he rejects her, and she sadly returns to New York.

At a shareholders&#x27; meeting, Cedar persuades everyone to sell the company until Deeds suddenly arrives. Deeds appeals to all of the shareholders to do the right thing and convinces them to change their minds. However, Cedar reveals that he secretly controls a majority of the shares and overrules them. Babe suddenly arrives, having stolen and studied Blake&#x27;s personal diary. The diary reveals that forty years earlier, Blake had a brief romance with his maid Consuela, Emilio&#x27;s late mother who died while giving birth to him nine months later. Thus, Emilio is Blake&#x27;s son and the true heir to his stake in the company.

Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media and fires Cedar and other corrupt board members, though he keeps Cecil on the board due to his good nature. Emilio thanks Deeds for his friendship and support, before giving him $1 billion as a farewell gift. Deeds and Babe reconcile and return to Mandrake Falls, where she now works alongside him and Jan at the pizzeria. The poem Deeds wrote for Babe is accepted by Hallmark and becomes a popular greeting card. He has also used some of his money to buy Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls... though &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; immediately crashes his.

==Production==
The producers were looking for a small, &quot;old-fashioned, New England-type&quot; town close to New York, when they serendipitously discovered New Milford, Connecticut, and, upon having lunch there at &quot;The Bistro Cafe&quot;, decided the town would be the perfect choice to portray the fictional home-town of Deeds, Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, and that the cafe was a great location to use as &quot;&#x27;Deeds&#x27; Pizza&quot; restaurant. Some scenes were also shot in Carmel, New York. Several sequences were filmed in New York City around Spring 2001. Following the September 11th, 2001 attacks, images of the World Trade Center towers were digitally removed from several shots of New York City. The Blake Media Hotel scenes were shot in Beverly Hills, California. The scene where Longfellow Deeds and Chuck Cedar are playing tennis at the tennis court was filmed at Roosevelt Island, New York.

<text>Come By Chance is a locality in the Pilliga district of northern New South Wales, Australia. It is located about north of Coonabarabran. It is in the Walgett Shire. At the 2006 census, Come By Chance had a population of 187. By the time of the 2016 census this had fallen to 125.

== History ==
Come By Chance is located on the lands of the Ngiyampaa nation.

George and William Colless purchased a sheep station in the area in 1862, naming it &quot;Come by Chance&quot; to reflect their surprise at being able to make such a purchase in this area. The town was later named after this property. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

== Events ==
Each year it attracts several thousand spectators to the &quot;Come-By-Chance Picnic Race Meeting&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The town features in Banjo Paterson&#x27;s wistful ballad &quot;Come-by-Chance&quot;:

&quot;But my languid mood forsook me, when I found a name that took me,Quite by chance I came across it — `Come-by-Chance&#x27; was what I read;&quot;&quot;No location was assigned it, not a thing to help one find it,&quot;&quot;Just an N which stood for northward, and the rest was all unsaid.&quot;

<doc id="594109" wikidata="Q1367937" url="?curid=594109" title="Wolfram Research">
<text>Wolfram Research, Inc. ( ) is an American multinational company that creates computational technology. Wolfram&#x27;s flagship product is the technical computing program Wolfram Mathematica, first released on June 23, 1988. Other products include WolframAlpha, Wolfram System Modeler, Wolfram Workbench, gridMathematica, Wolfram Finance Platform, webMathematica, the Wolfram Cloud, and the Wolfram Programming Lab. Wolfram Research founder Stephen Wolfram is the CEO. The company is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois, United States.

==History==
The company launched Wolfram Alpha, an answer engine on May 16, 2009. It brings a new approach to knowledge generation and acquisition that involves large amounts of curated computable data in addition to semantic indexing of text.

Wolfram Research acquired MathCore Engineering AB on March 30, 2011.

On July 21, 2011, Wolfram Research launched the Computable Document Format (CDF). CDF is an electronic document format designed to allow easy authoring of dynamically generated interactive content.

In June 2014, Wolfram Research officially introduced the Wolfram Language as a new general multi-paradigm programming language. It is the primary programming language used in Mathematica.

On April 15, 2020, Wolfram Research received $5,575,000 to help pay its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration. The loan was forgiven.

== Products and resources ==
=== Mathematica ===

Mathematica began as a software program for doing mathematics by computer, and has evolved to cover all domains of technical computing software, with features for neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, and visualizations. Central to Mathematica&#x27;s mission is its ability to perform symbolic computation, for example, the ability to solve indefinite integrals symbolically. Mathematica includes a notebook interface and can produce slides for presentations. Mathematica is available in a desktop version, a grid computing version, and a cloud version.

=== Wolfram Alpha ===

Wolfram Alpha is a free online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced curated data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine might. Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field and Wolfram Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations.

On February 8, 2012, Wolfram Alpha Pro was released, offering users additional features(e.g., the ability to upload many common file types and data — including raw tabular data, images, audio, XML, and dozens of specialized scientific, medical, and mathematical formats — for automatic analysis) for a monthly subscription fee.

In 2016, Wolfram Alpha Enterprise, a business-focused analytics tool, was launched. The program combines data supplied by a corporation with the algorithms from Wolfram Alpha to answer questions related to that corporation.

=== Wolfram System Modeler ===

Wolfram System Modeler is a platform for engineering as well as life-science modeling and simulation based on the Modelica language. It provides an interactive graphical modeling and simulation environment and a customizable set of component libraries. The primary interface, ModelCenter, is an interactive graphical environment including a customizable set of component libraries. The software also provides a tight integration with Mathematica. Users can develop, simulate, document, and analyze their models within Mathematica notebooks.

== Publishing ==
Wolfram Research publishes several free websites including the MathWorld and ScienceWorld encyclopedias. ScienceWorld, which launched in 2002, is divided into sites on chemistry, physics, astronomy and scientific biography. In 2005, the physics site was deemed a &quot;valuable resource&quot; by &quot;American Scientist&quot; magazine. However, by 2009, the astronomy site was said to suffer from outdated information, incomplete articles and link rot.

The Wolfram Demonstrations Project is a collaborative site hosting interactive technical demonstrations powered by a free Mathematica Player runtime.

Wolfram Research publishes &quot;The Mathematica Journal&quot;. Wolfram has also published several books via Wolfram Media, Wolfram&#x27;s publishing arm. In addition, they have experimented with electronic textbook creation.

==Media activities==
Wolfram Research served as the mathematical consultant for the CBS television series &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, a show about the mathematical aspects of crime-solving.

<text>Herbert Aptheker (July 31, 1915 – March 17, 2003) was an American Marxist historian and political activist. He wrote more than 50 books, mostly in the fields of African-American history and general U.S. history, most notably, &quot;American Negro Slave Revolts&quot; (1943), a classic in the field. He also compiled the 7-volume &quot;Documentary History of the Negro People&quot; (1951–1994). In addition, he compiled a wide variety of primary documents supporting study of African-American history. He was the literary executor for W. E. B. Du Bois.

From the 1940s, Aptheker was a prominent figure in U.S. scholarly discourse. Aptheker was blacklisted in academia during the 1950s because of his Communist Party membership. He succeeded V. J. Jerome in 1955 as editor of &quot;Political Affairs&quot;, a communist theory magazine.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Herbert Aptheker was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest child of a wealthy Jewish family.

In 1931, when he was 16, he accompanied his father on a business trip to Alabama. There he learned first-hand about the oppression of African Americans under Jim Crow Laws in the South. The trip proved shocking and life-altering for Aptheker, who upon his return to Brooklyn began writing a column called &quot;The Dark Side of The South&quot; for his Erasmus Hall High School newspaper.

Aptheker graduated from high school in the spring of 1933, during the Great Depression. Although admitted to Columbia University, he was unable to gain admission to the main campus of Columbia College, which had already filled a quota set for Jews by college president Nicholas Murray Butler. Instead, Aptheker was relegated to enrolling at Seth Low Junior College in Brooklyn Heights, a satellite school established by Butler as a &quot;de facto&quot; dumping ground for Jews and ethnic Italians admitted in excess of Butler&#x27;s quotas.

During his time at Seth Low, Aptheker was first drawn into political activity, helping to organize anti-war rallies and speaking on behalf of the communist-backed National Student League (NSL) and the socialist-backed Student League for Industrial Democracy. He began reading the Communist Party&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Worker,&quot; at this time as well as the party&#x27;s literary-artistic monthly, &quot;The New Masses,&quot; although he did not yet become a member of the party.

After two years at Seth Low, Aptheker was allowed to enroll at Columbia&#x27;s main campus in Morningside Heights in Manhattan, but not with full status as a member of Columbia College. Instead, he was classified as a &quot;university undergraduate&quot;, which placed him on track for a lesser Bachelor of Science degree rather than the higher-status Bachelor of Arts, which he received in 1936. At Columbia, Aptheker continued to engage in the anti-war movement, both through the NSL and the American League Against War and Fascism, a broader mass organization of the Communist Party during its Popular Front period.

Aptheker earned his Master&#x27;s degree from Columbia in 1937 and a Ph.D. in 1943 from the same institution. In September 1939, he joined the Communist Party USA. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in sociology in 1945.

===Marriage and World War II===
In 1942 Aptheker married Fay Philippa Aptheker (1905–1999), a first cousin who was also a native of Brooklyn. She was a union organizer and political activist. They were married for 62 years, until her death. Their daughter, Bettina, was born in 1944 at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Bragg, North Carolina during Aptheker&#x27;s service in World War II.

Aptheker participated in Operation Overlord, the invasion of northern France; by 1945 he had been promoted to the rank of Major in the artillery. He commanded the all-black 350th Field Artillery Battalion. In December 1950, after failing to respond to the U.S. Army&#x27;s letter of inquiry about his Communist political activity, he lost his commission after an honorable discharge.

===Work in the South===
Returning with his family to the South after the war, Aptheker became an educational worker for the Food and Tobacco Workers Union. Shortly afterward, he served as secretary of the &quot;Abolish Peonage Committee,&quot; which had been established in 1940 by activists in New York and Chicago, with the support of the International Labor Defense (IDL), an arm of the Communist Party. &quot;Peons&quot; in the South, the vast majority of whom were African American, were typically rural sharecroppers who became tied to plantations by the debt they owed to the plantation owners, or to local merchants. This practice had effectively maintained African-American slavery after the Civil War in all but name.

Given repeated publicity about peonage abuses, in 1941 Attorney General Francis Biddle had directed all federal prosecutors to &quot;actively investigate and try more peonage cases.&quot; On the verge of entering World War II, the US would make more effort to reduce rural peonage.

Similarly, southern states had run convict leasing programs, hiring out convicts to industries and taking the fees as revenue. Several southern states had banned convict leasing to industries in the early 20th century: Tennessee, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida by 1923.

====Research in African-American history====
Aptheker&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis, a study of Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion in Virginia in 1831, laid the groundwork for his future work on the history of American slave revolts. Aptheker asserted Turner&#x27;s heroism, demonstrating how his rebellion was rooted in resistance to the exploitative conditions of the Southern slave system. His &quot;Negro Slave Revolts in the United States 1526–1860&quot; (1939), includes a table of documented slave revolts by year and state. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;American Negro Slave Revolts&quot;, was published in 1943. Doing research in Southern libraries and archives, he uncovered 250 similar episodes.

Aptheker set forth historiographical arguments, challenging some conservative histories, most notably the perspective in the writings of Georgia-born historian Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, who was considered part of the Dunning School at Columbia University. Historians of this group had been critical of Reconstruction and argued that slavery was no worse than urban labor conditions. Phillips had characterized enslaved African Americans as childlike, inferior, and uncivilized; he argued that slavery was a benign institution; and defended the preservation of the Southern plantation system. Such works had been common in the field before Aptheker&#x27;s scholarship.

Aptheker long emphasized W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27; social science scholarship and lifelong struggle for African Americans to achieve equality. In his work as a historian, he compiled a documentary history of African Americans in the United States, a monumental collection which he started publishing in 1951. It eventually resulted in seven volumes of primary documents, a tremendous resource for African-American studies.

====Post-war activism====

During the 1950s and the period of McCarthyism, Aptheker was blacklisted in academia because of his membership in the Communist Party. He was unable to obtain an appointment as a university lecturer for a decade. Aptheker served on the National Committee of the CPUSA from 1957 to 1991. For several years in the 1960s and 1970s, he was executive director of the American Institute For Marxist Studies. In 1966, he ran in the U.S. House of Representatives election in New York&#x27;s 12th Congressional District for the Peace and Freedom Party; he received 3,562 votes. Given his work on African-American documents and history, Aptheker was chosen by W. E. B. Du Bois to be his literary executor.

A strong opponent of the Vietnam War, Aptheker lectured on the subject on college campuses nationwide. From 1969 to 1973, Aptheker taught a full-year course annually in Afro-American History at Bryn Mawr College. Aptheker died at age 87 on March 17, 2003, in Mountain View, California. His wife had died in 1999.

====Allegation of child abuse====
Bettina Aptheker is a professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In her 2006 memoir, &quot;Intimate Politics,&quot; she claimed that she was sexually abused by her father from the age of 3 to 13. Her memories of the events began to arise in 1999, after her mother&#x27;s death and when she was working on a memoir. She sought counseling for her dissociation and recovered memory. She also wrote that she and her father reconciled before his death in 2003.

Her assertion caused great controversy among historians and activists. Some raised questions about her credibility; others questioned the Old Left&#x27;s desire to bury the news, and still others wondered at how to look at Aptheker&#x27;s work in view of this information.

In her memoir, Bettina Aptheker wrote more at length about her father&#x27;s work on African-American history. She thought that he celebrated black resistance in part &quot;to compensate for his deep shame about the way, he believed, the Jews had acted during the Holocaust.&quot;

The controversy about her claims about her father continued for months, with many essays and letters published on the History News Network hosted by George Mason University. In November 2007, the historian Christopher Phelps published an overview of the issues. He also wrote that he had interviewed Kate Miller, who had been present during Bettina Aptheker&#x27;s 1999 conversation with her father about the abuse, and confirmed her account.

<text>Sir John Richard Harrison (23 May 1921 – 5 September 2003) was a New Zealand politician. After serving in a number of capacities in the National Party, he served as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1978 to 1984.

==Early life==
Harrison was born in Hastings, New Zealand, on 23 May 1921. He was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School and Canterbury University, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. During World War II, Harrison served in the army, and saw active service in Italy. He remained in the army for several years after the war. After leaving the military, he established himself as a farmer, although remained active as an army reservist. He served as commander of the reservist Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regiment from 1956 to 1959.

In 1948, he married Margaret Kelly, the daughter of E. J. Kelly. They had three sons and one daughter.

==Political career==



In the 1963 election, Harrison stood for Parliament in the electorate of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, and was successful. He served as a National Party backbencher for six years. After the 1969 election, he was made Junior Whip, and was Chairman of Committees in 1972, and again from 1976 to 1978. In 1978, he was elected Speaker after the death of Roy Jack. His Speakership ended at the 1984 election, when National Government lost, and when Harrison lost the election in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay electorate to Bill Sutton.

In the 1980 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Harrison was appointed a Knight Bachelor, two years after becoming speaker.

==Death==
Harrison died on 5 September 2003.

<text>Lake Gordon is a man-made reservoir created by the Gordon Dam, located on the upper reaches of the Gordon River in the south-west region of Tasmania, Australia.

==Features==
The reservoir was formed in the early 1970s as a result of the dam construction by the Hydro-Electricity Commission of Tasmania in order to create an upper storage for the Gordon Power Station, the largest and most controversial hydro-electric power scheme in Tasmania.

Drawing from a catchment area of , Lake Gordon is Tasmania&#x27;s largest lake, with a surface area of , with storage capacity of or of water, the equivalent of twenty-five times the amount of water in Port Jackson. Lake Pedder is connected to Lake Gordon through the McPartlans Pass Canal at .

==Controversy==
Additional dams were proposed for the lower Gordon River, however they were subject to political protest led by The Wilderness Society, most notably the Franklin Dam controversy during the early 1980s. In 1983 the Hawke-led Australian Government intervened and overturned a decision by the Tasmanian Government to dam the lower Gordon. When the Tasmanian Government refused to halt work in the UNESCO-listed World Heritage Area, the Australian Government successfully sought a ruling in the High Court of Australia in &quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot;. The lower Gordon was not dammed.

==Tasmanian Energy Crisis==
In early 2016, the lowest ever water supply levels in the lake were recorded during the 2016 Tasmanian energy crisis. However, by July of next year the drought had ended, and the lake had swelled by twenty metres over ten months.

<doc id="594122" wikidata="Q4970738" url="?curid=594122" title="British Rail Class 15">
<text>The British Rail Class 15 diesel locomotives, also known as the BTH Type 1, were designed by British Thomson-Houston, and built by the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company, between 1957 and 1961. They were numbered D8200-D8243.

The Class 15 was ordered by British Railways (BR) shortly after the announcement of the 1955 Modernisation Plan, which led to the procurement of a diverse number of diesel locomotives under the &#x27;pilot scheme&#x27;. Shortly following the completion of the first locomotive during 1957, its performance was sufficient to justify multiple follow-on orders, leading to a total fleet of 44 locomotives. In service, the type was relatively unreliable, much of this been traceable to its Paxman 16YHXL power unit. Its fortunes were further impacted by inconsistent policy making. During the late 1960s, it was decided to withdraw the Class 15 in favour of the more numerous and successful British Rail Class 20 locomotive, both types having been developed to satisfy the same Type 1 specification. Their final use was as departmental vehicles, coming to an end in the late 1980s. One example has survived into preservation.

== Background ==
In less than a decade following the formation of British Railways (BR), substantial changes were being made. Under the 1955 Modernisation Plan, a long-term strategy of replacing steam locomotives with a combination of diesel locomotives and electric locomotives was adopted, with the former being largely intended as an interim measure for most areas ahead of widespread electrification of trunk routes. There was also a strong political desire to support British manufacturers in transitioning towards the design and production of these favoured forms of traction. Due to a lack of expertise, this often involved the pairing of traditional locomotive manufacturers with various firms within the electrical sector, even though the latter typically had very limited experience of the railways.

In accordance with these policies, BR ramped up its efforts to convert its fleet, placing numerous orders within a short timeframe for diesel locomotives to several different specifications with various manufactures. It placed four separate lots of orders, for a cumulative 44 &quot;BTH Type 1&quot; diesel locomotives with the heavy engineering company British Thomson-Houston (BTH). The first batch of locomotives was primarily intended for evaluation purposes, this initiative coming under the remit of BR&#x27;s pilot scheme.

==Construction==
While BTH was appointed as the main contractor and was viewed as being capable of designing the type, the company lacked capacity at its facility in Rugby, Warwickshire, and thus was unable to produce the locomotives inhouse. The practical resolution to this was to subcontract both the design and manufacture of the mechanical elements (e.g. running gear, bogies, bodies) to other firms, primarily the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company, neither of which had any experience with main line diesel locomotives.

Accordingly, the design and manufacture of the type was a collaborative effort between these companies. Specifically, while BTH supplied the majority of the electrical equipment, Paxman supplied the power units, Clayton supplied the bogies and superstructure, construction of the frame and final assembly occurred at Yorkshire Engine&#x27;s Sheffield works, for the initial batch of ten locomotives. However, final assembly was transferred to Clayton for all subsequent batches.

The design of the locomotive was in conformance with the stated requirements listed in the &#x27;Type 1&#x27; specification. As such, this led to the inclusion of numerous features such as provisions for operating in multiple with other members of the type. The propulsion system consisted of a single Paxman 16YHXL engine that provided up to that, via a diesel-electric transmission, drove four individual DC traction motors. In comparison with a typical locomotive, the design featured a relatively high-speed engine for the era.

During late 1957, the first example of the type emerged. Furthermore, the type was envisioned for serving various types of smaller trains on secondary routes, such as the haulage of local freight and empty coaching stock trains. However, the fortunes of the class were somewhat impacted by the pilot scheme being abruptly terminated amid persistent budgetary shortages.

The performance of the initial batch of 10 locomotives quickly showed the design held promise, leading to repeat orders for 34 more locomotives to be placed soon after their entry into service. These locomotives, numbered D8210–D8243, were constructed at Clayton&#x27;s facility in Hatton, Derbyshire, were delivered between October 1959 and February 1961.

==Operations==
===Introduction===
The first ten locomotives were delivered to the London Midland Region&#x27;s Devons Road depot in Bow, East London, where they were evaluated against the contemporary North British Type 1 (class 16) and English Electric Type 1 (class 20) designs. Soon, however, the entire class was allocated to depots on the Eastern Region, where they remained until withdrawal. The second block of ten was originally allocated to March depot in East Anglia, however due to the Clean Air Act 1956 the locomotives were quickly re-allocated to East London, allowing the replacement of steam locomotives in that area. Thereafter, the type was allocated exclusively to Stratford, Finsbury Park and Ipswich depots.

Class 15s were generally used on freight and infrastructure operations, and haulage of passenger trains was limited to replacement as a result of failure. An example of such an occurrence was on the northbound Fenman on 6 January 1961 where D8236 hauled the train, including the failed Class 31 D5665, from near Stanstead to where a more powerful replacement took over.

A member of the class also worked as the train ferry shunter at Harwich Town during the 1960s and for a period a Class 15 operated as the station pilot at Liverpool Street station, the last locomotive used being 8234 which was replaced by a Class 08 on 4 October 1971.

===Problems and impact===
The Class 15 was troubled by its relatively high level of unreliability, which was largely centred around the type&#x27;s Paxman engine; as delivered, the engine was found to require excessive maintenance. A series of modifications to the pistons, piston rings and maintenance schedules, and fitting cast iron cylinder heads led to considerable improvements in the engine&#x27;s reliability, however, it remained a complex V16 for only providing 800 bhp, while the small size of the class bore poorly at a time when the rail network was rapidly contracting. Furthermore, the layout of the locomotive, which positioned its single cab part-way down the body akin to a North American road-switcher, provided the crew with a relatively poor forward visibility in both directions of travel, although this was initially tolerated as it was no worse than the visibility offered by the cab of a steam locomotive.

According to railway author Rodger Bradley, the shortcomings of the Class 15 were not so much attributable to its designers but largely came as a consequence of ill-defined requirements, which can be largely attributed back to moving government policies. Additional factors highlighted by Bradley include a general dependence upon the wider British electrical industry to both design and deliver numerous subsystems that would function sufficiently well upon the often-challenging railway environment, along with radical changes to the national economy during this era had also impacted the type&#x27;s suitability to these broader circumstances and thus its overall performance. Despite these various issues, the Class 15 can be considered to be more successful than several contemporary Type 1 locomotives, such as the Class 16 and the later Class 17.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 21 November 1963, locomotive No. D8221 crashed through buffers whilst shunting at Ipswich engine shed and ended up across Croft Street. After attempts to tow it back onto the track using diesel locomotives failed, it was retrieved using the only steam locomotive in service at Ipswich, which had been retained for carriage heating purposes.

===Withdrawal===
Following a persistent decline in freight duties in the London area, in combination with the type being a relatively small and unsuccessful non-standard class, the type was considered to be surplus to requirements by the late 1960s. The ubiquitous British Rail Class 20, which had been developed to meet the same Type 1 specification, was more numerous and had proved to be less troublesome to operate, thus it effectively replaced the type in all operational respects. The type was speedily removed from traffic, being withdrawn from capital stock between April 1968 and March 1971. D8225 was observed operating at Temple Mills as late as 28 March 1971.

After withdrawal 23 of the class were stored at the former Ipswich engine shed during 1971 before being hauled away, generally as part of booked freight trains, for scrapping.

==Conversion==

All but four locomotives had been broken up for scrap by the end of 1972. The four Class 15s that survived were used for departmental service for a time, for which they were converted into non-powered electric train pre-heating units based at Doncaster Works. These duties kept the locomotives in active use for another ten years or more, until these final examples were again found to be redundant and finally withdrawn.

== Preservation ==
One of the former train heating units, D8233, was purchased for preservation in 1984 and is now the only survivor of the type. It was originally kept at the South Yorkshire Railway in Sheffield, moving in 1986 to the East Lancashire Railway, and in 1988 to the Mangapps Farm Railway, where it remained until 1993. D8233 then moved to Crewe following an agreement with the Waterman Heritage Trust. Since its initial preservation the locomotive had received little work apart from cosmetic attention. Some work was carried out by the Waterman Heritage Trust, however the locomotive&#x27;s restoration remained dormant until the end of 2005, when a reformed owning group, alongside the WHT, agreed the time was right to accelerate the locomotive&#x27;s return to service. With an active plan for work agreed, the locomotive returned to the East Lancashire Railway in February 2006, where its restoration to working order is now under way.

==Models==
A ready to run model in 00 gauge was available from TechCad design based on a hand finished resin shell and powered by a Mashima motor. It was then available from TechCad as a kit, but TechCad have since ceased trading. Since 2010, Heljan have produced an OO gauge ready-to-run model in a variety of liveries. The Heljan model was first announced in 2008 and introduced as D8233 in BR green.

An N gauge kit of a member of the class is available from BH Enterprises, powered by a Graham Farish Class 20 chassis.

An O gauge ready-to-run model was produced by Little Loco Company

<text>Viktor Karlovich Knorre (; 4 October 1840 – 25 August 1919) was a Russian astronomer of German ethnic origin. He worked in Nikolaev, Pulkovo and Berlin and is best known for having discovered 158 Koronis and three other minor planets. Knorre&#x27;s father, Karl Friedrich Knorre, and grandfather, Ernst Friedrich Knorre, were also prominent astronomers. Recently, the main-belt asteroid 14339 Knorre was named in honor of the three generations of Knorre astronomers.

== Biography and family background ==

Knorre was born into a three-generation astronomer family. His grandfather, Ernst Friedrich Knorre (1759–1810), had moved from Germany to Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) where he worked (1803–10) as &quot;Observator&quot; for the Dorpat observatory (opened in 1802) and professor of Mathematics at the University of Dorpat.
Victor Knorre&#x27;s father, Karl Friedrich Knorre (1801–1883), set up and was director of the Nikolayev Astronomical Observatory starting in 1827.

Viktor was born the fifth of fifteen children in Nikolayev (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine). He moved to Berlin in 1862 to study astronomy with Wilhelm Julius Foerster. He worked at Pulkovo Observatory in 1867 as an astronomical calculator and then at Berlin Observatory, where his father moved circa 1871.

== Astronomer ==

From 1873, he was observer at the Berlin Observatory. Knorre discovered four asteroids. He did not teach students at the University of Berlin; instead he gave introductions into the use of the telescopes of the Observatory. In 1892 he was appointed Professor of Astronomy. Knorre took an interest in the improvement of astronomical equipment, and published papers on an improved equatorial telescope mount, referred to as the &quot;Knorre &amp; Heele&quot; mount.
== Chess master ==

Knorre was also known as a strong chess player, playing among others against Adolf Anderssen, Gustav Neumann and Johannes Zukertort. He took part in several chess tournaments during the 1860s. According to the ChessMetrics site, He was ranked among top 50 players in the world at his peak.

In the Two Knights Defense the &quot;Knorre variation&quot; (ECO code C59) is named after him. It follows the main line of the Two Knights defense for the first ten moves, and is characterized by the moves 10. Ne5 Bd6 11. d4 Qc7 12. Bd2. The Knorre variation of the Open defense in the Ruy Lopez, characterized by the move 6. Nc3, is also named after Knorre.

<text>The Gordon River is a major perennial river located in the central highlands, south-west, and western regions of Tasmania, Australia.

==Course and features==

The Gordon River rises below Mount Hobhouse in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park draining the eastern slopes of the King William Range. The river flows generally south and to the west of the Gordon Range before flowing west through the Gordon Gap and spilling into Lake Gordon, an impounded reservoir created by damming the Gordon at the Gordon Dam. Together with water fed from Lake Pedder, the principal purpose of the reservoir is for generation of hydro-electricity at the Gordon Power Station.

Flowing from east to west through Lake Gordon, the river continues west, passing through the Gordon Splits, a series of gorges once considered impassable until 1958 when Olegas Truchanas, a conservationist and nature photographer, was the first person to navigate the Gordon River in a kayak. The river flows north by west and then due north and finally due west as it reaches its mouth and empties into Macquarie Harbour at Wrights Bay.

From source to mouth, the river is joined by 25 tributaries including the Gell, Boyes, Pokana, Holley, Adams, Serpentine, Albert, Orange, Smith, Denison, Olga, Sprent, Franklin, and the Spence rivers.

The river descends over its course; much of which is located in an uninhabited wilderness area, contained with the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park and Southwest National Park. The lower part of the Gordon River is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and contains a cold-climate rainforest and rare trees. As with many rivers in western Tasmania, the water is fresh and drinkable, yet has the colour of weak tea due to the absorption of tannin from button grass growing in the catchment area.

Additional dams were proposed for the lower part of the river. However, these plans were changed as a result of significant opposition and public opinion. In particular, the Franklin Dam was proposed just downstream of the junction with the Franklin River, and would have flooded much of both rivers. It was a major political and environmental issue in the 1980s.

Boat excursions to the lower Gordon River from Macquarie Harbour are popular with tourists in Strahan. Seaplane flights depart Strahan during the warmer months and include an out landing on the Gordon River (usually a duration of one hour).

<doc id="594132" wikidata="Q457595" url="?curid=594132" title="Samoth">
<text>Samoth (born Tomas Thormodsæter Haugen, 9 June 1974) is a Norwegian guitarist and multi-instrumentalist in the country&#x27;s black metal scene. He is well known for his distinct guitar work and drumming in the band Emperor, as well as his formation of the death metal band Zyklon. In very early Emperor releases, he was called Samot (his name &quot;Tomas&quot; backwards), and with the formation of Zyklon he became known as Zamoth. Samoth was the owner of the record label Nocturnal Art Productions and had a close relationship with Candlelight Records.

== Biography ==
Samoth was born on 9 June 1974 in Hammerfest. He is the son of Spoonful of Blues bass player Jens Haugen, who encouraged his son to play bass guitar. He grew up in Akkerhaugen, Norway. When Samoth was a young man, he met a fellow musician, who would later become known as Ihsahn, at a rock clinic in Bergen. The two soon became friends and started playing music together. They formed a band and moved through various names – they were called Dark Device, Xerasia, and finally Embryonic. The group eventually settled on the name Thou Shalt Suffer in 1991. They were playing an early form of black metal with keyboards strongly influenced by death metal, particularly vocally.

Samoth and Ihsahn&#x27;s friendship proved to be strong, and the two eventually took their musicianship to a new level. Partially due to the influence of Euronymous of the band Mayhem, Samoth left Thou Shalt Suffer and with Ihsahn, began writing music for a new band called Emperor (in which he played drums). Ihsahn was the only member of Thou Shalt Suffer to remain, and soon bass player Mortiis and drummer Faust were recruited for Emperor; Samoth moved back to his more familiar position of guitar. At this point, the group was playing fully developed black metal. Emperor was quick to release several demos in 1992 and 1993, which gained them recognition and popularity in the underground. Mortiis did not stay in the band, and decided to form his own, more electronic-based solo band. He was succeeded by Tchort.

In 1994, Samoth was sentenced to 16 months in prison for burning Skjold Church in Vindafjord, together with Varg Vikernes. The arson was committed during a pause in the recording of the Burzum EP &quot;Aske&quot; (&quot;Ashes&quot;), where Samoth performed as a session bass player. As Tchort and Faust were also imprisoned at this time, Ihsahn was the only remaining band member outside prison, and Emperor did not release another album for three years. Tchort and Faust did not return to the band.

After years of playing in Emperor and being featured on various black metal side projects, Samoth, in conjunction with Ihsahn, decided to dissolve Emperor in 2001 due to their differing musical tastes. Although black metal was both Samoth and Ihsahn&#x27;s biggest influence and favorite genre of music, Samoth was leaning toward a futuristic death metal sound, while Ihsahn was more influenced by progressive metal and symphonic metal. After Emperor&#x27;s final release, &quot;&quot;, composed entirely by Ihsahn, Emperor was no more. Samoth went on to play guitar with fellow drummer Trym in the death metal band Zyklon.

Emperor regrouped in 2006 with the core trio of Ihsahn, Samoth and Trym augmented by a bassist and a keyboardist, and played a few one-night-off gigs in Europe and US in 2006 and 2007.

Recently Samoth was involved in Norwegian-American supergroup Scum, which also featured Bård Faust, Cosmocrator of Mindgrinder, Chasey Chaos of Amen and Happy Tom from Turbonegro.

Samoth did voice work for 2007&#x27;s Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; episode &quot;Dethfashion&quot;.

In 2008, Samoth formed The Wretched End with Cosmo and went on to release 3 albums: Ominous (2010), Inroads (2012) and In These Woods, From These Mountains (2016).

== Personal life ==
Haugen was married to German musician Andrea Haugen (née Meyer), with whom he fathered a daughter. The couple later divorced. On 13 October 2021, Andrea was killed alongside four other people in the Kongsberg attack.

After his divorce from Andrea, he married his second wife Erin, with whom he also has a daughter.

<text>Strahan ( ) is a small town and former port on the west coast of Tasmania. It is now a significant locality for tourism in the region.

Strahan Harbour and Risby Cove form part of the north-east end of Long Bay on the northern end of Macquarie Harbour. At the , Strahan had a population of 634.

==Port==
Originally developed as a port of access for the mining settlements in the area, the town was known as Long Bay or Regatta Point. In 1881, the settlement was renamed, after the colony’s new Governor, Sir George Cumine Strahan. The town was officially proclaimed in 1892.

Strahan was a vital location for the timber industry that existed around Macquarie Harbour.

For a substantial part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century it also was port for regular shipping of passengers and cargo. The Strahan Marine Board was an important authority dealing with the issues of the port and Macquarie Harbour, up until the end of the twentieth century when it was absorbed into the Hobart Marine Board.

==Post offices==
Macquarie Harbour Post Office opened on 16 May 1878, was renamed Strahan in 1881 and closed in 1891. East Strahan Post Office opened in 1891 and was renamed Strahan in 1893.

==Fishing and tourism==

Historically Strahan has been a port to a small fishing fleet that braves the west coast conditions and Hell&#x27;s Gates. It is the nearest inhabited locality to Cape Sorell and is literally the &#x27;gateway&#x27; to the south-west wilderness - as boats, planes and helicopters utilise Strahan as their base when travelling into the region.

The Huon Pine industry utilised stands around the harbour and up the tributary rivers - including King River, the Franklin River and the Gordon River.

Strahan is the location of the only all weather commercial airport in Western Tasmania, Strahan Airport. Also located at the airport is the Automatic Weather Station, an important western Tasmania weather observation point.

Strahan is the base for boat trips to Sarah Island, the notorious penal settlement that garnered the reputation as the harshest penal settlement in the Australian colonies, and the lower Gordon River.

Strahan is an access point to the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, which was declared part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in 1982. For several years Strahan became the focus of a conservation campaign opposed to the proposed Franklin-below-Gordon Dam.

It is the home of the Round Earth Theatre Company, which conducts explanatory tours of Sarah Island and also has produced a daily enactment/play about Sarah Island, &quot;The Ship That Never Was&quot;, which has exceeded 5000 performances and is Australia&#x27;s longest running play.

==Railways==
Strahan was a stopping place on the former Strahan to Zeehan railway. It was also known as Strahan Wharf.
The railway was government owned, and ran past the wharf at Strahan, and continued southwards around the harbour before running north on its way to Zeehan.
Strahan was connected with the former Mount Lyell railway line at a terminus at Regatta Point which is also the terminus of the currently operating West Coast Wilderness Railway.

==Cultural references==
An extinct species of &quot;Banksia&quot;, fossils of which were found in sediment at nearby Regatta Point, was named &quot;Banksia strahanensis&quot; after the town.

==Climate==
Strahan has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool to mild, damp summers and cool to cold, very rainy winters. Lying on Tasmania&#x27;s West Coast, Strahan is frequently buffeted by low pressure systems off the Southern Ocean, causing heavy rain and gusty winds. Strahan receives 15.7 days, on average, of clear weather annually.

Temperatures vary little between summer and winter, with minimums below having been recorded in every month. Hot weather is rare, with an average of only one day reaching or above every three years. The highest recorded temperature is on 14 February 1982, with the lowest recorded being on 30 June 1983. Snow down to sea level is uncommon, but falls frequently in the low hills just a few kilometres inland of Strahan.

==Features==
Longniddry is primarily a dormitory village for commuters, with good transport links by road and rail (Longniddry railway station is on the North Berwick Line) to the capital, some 12 miles to the West.
The village has a number of local, community based resources including local shops and Longniddry Community Centre, which also houses the library. Near to the library is the Scout Hall used by the Longniddry Scout Group. The golf course hosted the Carling-Caledonian Tournament in 1961. Like many coastal towns in East Lothian, Longniddry has a sandy beach beside the golf course. This stretch of local coastline is lined with dunes and known as Longniddry Bents.

<doc id="594137" wikidata="Q1882990" url="?curid=594137" title="Macquarie Harbour">
<text>Macquarie Harbour is a shallow fjord in the West Coast region of Tasmania, Australia. It is approximately , and has an average depth of , with deeper places up to . It is navigable by shallow-draft vessels. The main channel is kept clear by the presence of a rock wall on the outside of the channel&#x27;s curve. This man-made wall prevents erosion and keeps the channel deep and narrow, rather than allowing the channel to become wide and shallow. A reported Aboriginal name for the harbour is Parralaongatek.

The harbour was named in honour of Scottish Major General Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth Colonial Governor of New South Wales.

==History==
James Kelly wrote in his narrative &quot;First Discovery of Port Davey and Macquarie Harbour&quot; how he sailed from Hobart in a small open five-oared whaleboat to discover Macquarie Harbour on 28 December 1815.

However, different accounts of the journey have indicated different methods and dates of the discovery. In the commentary to the &quot;Historical Records of Australia&quot;, the editor notes that T.W. Birch stated before the commission of inquiry into the state of the colony in 1820 that Kelly had discovered Macquarie Harbour after proceeding along in a boat from Port Davey where they had travelled in the schooner &quot;Henrietta Packet&quot;. Kelly gave evidence before the commission, and did not mention any discoveries. In a letter dated 11 April 1816, preserved in the record office, London, T.W. Birch transmitted an account of this voyage, which records the discovery of Macquarie Harbour on 26 December 1815.

Charles Whitham notes variations on the date.

Surveyor-General Oxley of New South Wales in March 1820 battled with the seas around the heads and Hells Gates. Surveyor-General Evans travelled in the area in 1821–22.

In September 2020, almost 100 pilot whales were rescued from the harbour after becoming stranded. An estimated 350 whales which were unable to be rescued died.

==Convict era==

The harbour was established as a prison which was a place of &quot;extreme physical and mental torture&quot;. It was built for British convicts including Irish patriots but many Aboriginal Tasmanians were also detained there.

== Rivers ==
The King River which cuts through the West Coast Range and the Gordon River empty into Macquarie Harbour. The narrow entrance to Macquarie Harbour has hazardous tidal currents and is called Hell&#x27;s Gates. Outside of the Harbour the entrance area is known as Macquarie Heads, and the most western point is Cape Sorell. The sheer volume of fresh water that pours into the Harbour through the rivers, combined with the narrow exit result in barometric tides. When there is rain in the mountains surrounding the Harbour, the tide rises, and it falls when the atmospheric pressure reverses and results in less rain.

The Queen River, King River and Macquarie Harbour were all polluted by mine waste from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company until its closing in 1994. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River. The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was carried out by the office of Supervising Scientist and the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management over the following two years. The result of the program a marked reduction in the waste material entering the rivers and harbour.
* Bird River – mouth of river in Kelly Basin
* Braddon River – mouth on mid-eastern shore
* Clark River – mouth at Pillinger, Kelly Basin.

* Magazine Island 
* Neck Island 
* Philips Island – adjacent to mouth of Braddon River on east shore
* Sarah Island – in southern part of Harbour
* Soldiers Island

== Settlements ==
The first settlement at Macquarie Harbour was on Sarah Island, a small island in the harbour, named after the wife of Thomas William Birch. This island was used as a prison for recalcitrant prisoners from other settlements in Tasmania, due to its extreme isolation and extreme climate.

Later the small port of Strahan was developed on the shores of Macquarie Harbour to support the nearby mining settlements, mainly Queenstown. Another port was developed on the south east section of the harbour in Kelly Basin along with townsite of Pillinger. The settlement and port were short lived as was the North Mount Lyell company that developed the facilities.

* Strahan Harbour – from Strahan Point parallel to &#x27;The Esplanade&#x27;
* Swan Basin – near Hell&#x27;s Gates

== Tourism ==
Strahan is the departure point for tourism on Tasmania&#x27;s west coast. The West Coast Wilderness Railway takes part of the northeastern shore of the Harbour, before turning inland at the mouth of the King River. Boats take tourists from Strahan to Hell&#x27;s Gates and Macquarie Heads, Sarah Island and up the lower reaches of the Gordon River. Charter flights using helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft launch from Strahan Airport.

== Salmon farms ==
Salmon farms were first established in Macquarie Harbour in the 1980s. Production increased significantly in the 21st century. Tassal established farms there in 2003, Huon Aquaculture in 2008 and Petuna around 2011. A range of associated environmental issues in Macquarie Harbour have followed the harbour&#x27;s industrialisation. Problems include the creation of de-oxygenated &quot;dead zones&quot; beneath pens and massive stock mortalities occurred as stocking and pollution loads increased.

Management practices have been questioned and challenged, after which the EPA reduced the farms&#x27; stocking capacities.

The fate of the endangered Maugean skate has been a subject of concern and investigation.

<text>In mathematics, a Lucas chain is a restricted type of addition chain, named for the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. It is a sequence 

:&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ...

that satisfies

:&quot;a&quot;0=1,

The sequence of powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) and the Fibonacci sequence (with a slight adjustment of the starting point 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) are simple examples of Lucas chains.

Lucas chains were introduced by Peter Montgomery in 1983. If &quot;L&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the length of the shortest Lucas chain for &quot;n&quot;, then Kutz has shown that most &quot;n&quot; do not have &quot;L&quot; &lt; (1-ε) logφ &quot;n&quot;, where φ is the Golden ratio.

<text>This list shows an overview of postal code notation schemes for all countries that have postal or ZIP Code systems.

== List ==
; Legend
* A = letter
* N = number
* ? = letter or number
* CC = ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code

==On the use of country codes==
The use of the country codes in conjunction with postal codes started as a recommendation from CEPT (European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations) in the 1960s. In the original CEPT recommendation the distinguishing signs of motor vehicles in international traffic (&quot;car codes&quot;) were placed before the postal code, and separated from it by a &quot;-&quot; (dash). Codes were only used on international mail and were hardly ever used internally in each country.

Since the late 1980s, however, a number of postal administrations have changed the recommended codes to the two-letter country codes of ISO 3166. This would allow a universal, standardized code set to be used, and bring it in line with country codes used elsewhere in the UPU (Universal Postal Union). Attempts were also made (without success) to make this part of the official address guidelines of the UPU. Recently introduced postal code systems where the UPU has been involved have included the ISO 3166 country code as an integral part of the postal code.

At present there are no universal guidelines as to which code set to use, and recommendations vary from country to country. In some cases, the applied country code will differ according to recommendations of the sender&#x27;s postal administration. UPU recommends that the country name always be included as the last line of the address.

In the list above, the following principles have been applied:

* Integral country codes have been included in the code format, in bold type and without brackets. These are also used on internal mail in the respective countries.
* The ISO 3166 codes is used alone for countries that have explicitly recommended them.
* Where there is no explicit recommendation for ISO 3166 codes and the codes differ, both &quot;car codes&quot; and ISO 3166 codes are listed, with the &quot;car code&quot; listed first.

<text>The King River is a major perennial river in the West Coast region of Tasmania, Australia.

==Location and features==

Formed by the confluence of the Eldon and South Eldon rivers, the King River rises near Eldon Range on the slopes of the West Coast Range between Mount Huxley and Mount Jukes. The river flows generally south and then west, joined by nine tributaries including the Tofft, Governor, Nelson, Princess, and Queen rivers before emptying into Macquarie Harbour near , and merging with the Southern Ocean. The river descends over its course.

The upper section of the river lies in a glaciated valley, with glacier scouring scars high up on the upper parts of the mountains of the West Coast Range. Also small glacial lakes occur on and north of Mount Sedgwick. Lake Beatrice for instance lies on the eastern slope of Mount Sedgwick. The upper portion of the King River valley was first surveyed for damming in 1917 by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company.

== King River Power Development Scheme ==
The river is impounded by the Crotty Dam to form Lake Burbury, covering over the former valley and named after the first Australian born Governor of Tasmania, Stanley Burbury. Water drawn from the lake is used to supply the conventional hydroelectric John Butters Power Station, operated by Hydro Tasmania. Below the dam wall, the river flows through a narrow channel as it flows west towards , in the last of the river, where extensive silting from the mine tailings that have been carried down from Queenstown, has created such a resource that at least one mining company has in the past proposed the mining of the deposits at the edge of the river, as well as the delta formed out into Macquarie Harbour due to the amount of economically viable materials in the silt.

The small timber mill community adjacent to the old alignment of the Lyell Highway was submerged, as was a significant portion of the old railway alignment of the North Mount Lyell Railway between Linda and Pillinger. The site of the townsite of Crotty, and the smelters of Crotty were also submerged.

===Queen River===

The King River was considered to be Australia&#x27;s most polluted river. Mining started in the 1880s, with the Queen River, a major tributary of the King River, being used for waste water disposal from the Mt Lyell copper mine.

Between 1922 and 1995 low grade ore was concentrated on site and the tailings (ore-washing residue) dumped in the river also.

About 1.5 million tonnes of sulfidic tailings entered the river system each year up to 1995, along with huge volumes of acidic, metal-rich water flowing from the workings. This &#x27;acid mine drainage&#x27; is derived from water leaching through the exposed and oxidised sulfide rocks. When it was in operation, the fumes from the ore smelter produced acid rain which also leached minerals from the bare Queenstown hills.

In 1992 the King River was dammed above the confluence with the Queen River to generate hydroelectric power at the Crotty Dam. This changed the flow regime in the King River, and affected the way tailings were transported through the river system. The tailings in the river greatly affect the water quality.

About 100 million tonnes of tailings have been deposited on the banks and bed of the King River and in a delta at the mouth of the river where it enters Macquarie Harbour.

Since the closure of the mine in late 1995, and the construction of a tailings dam by the new operators, tailings no longer enter the river system. However, acid water continues to enter the river due to mine dewatering and run-off from the waste rock dumps. Without the buffering previously provided by the alkaline tailings, the acidity in the Queen and King rivers has increased, and dissolved metal concentrations have greatly increased-to levels highly toxic to aquatic life.

===Abt Railway route===
The north bank (except for the Teepookana to Quarter Mile Bridge section which was on the south bank) of the lower portion of the King River valley was the route for the old &quot;Abt&quot; rack railway to Queenstown. In 1962 the original builder and owner, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company closed and removed the line. This has been since restored in early 2002 for tourism purposes. The new line follows exactly the same route and is known as the West Coast Wilderness Railway.

<doc id="594156" wikidata="Q18550" url="?curid=594156" title="Mafia">
<text>&quot;Mafia&quot;, as an informal or general term, is often used to describe criminal organizations that bear a strong similarity to the original Mafia in Sicily, to the Italian-American Mafia, or to other organized crime groups from Italy. The central activity of such an organization would be the arbitration of disputes between criminals, as well as the organization and enforcement of illicit agreements between criminals through the use of threat or violence. Mafias often engage in secondary activities such as gambling, loan sharking, drug-trafficking, prostitution, and fraud.

The term &quot;Mafia&quot; was originally applied to the Sicilian Mafia. Since then, the term has expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, e.g. &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; or &quot;the Japanese mafia&quot;. The term was coined by the press and is informal; the criminal organizations themselves have their own names (e.g. the Sicilian Mafia and the related Italian-American mafia refer to their organizations as &quot;Cosa nostra&quot;; the &quot;Japanese mafia&quot; calls itself &quot;Ninkyō dantai&quot;, but is more commonly known as &quot;Yakuza&quot; by the public; &quot;Russian Mafia&quot; groups often call themselves &quot;bratva&quot;). &quot;Chinese Mafia&quot; groups are often referred to as Triads.

When used alone and without any qualifier, &quot;Mafia&quot; or &quot;the Mafia&quot; typically refers to either the Sicilian Mafia or the Italian-American Mafia and sometimes Italian organized crime in general (e.g., Camorra, &#x27;Ndrangheta, etc.).

Today the &#x27;Ndrangheta, originating in the southern Italian region of Calabria, is widely considered the richest and most powerful Mafia in the world. The &#x27;Ndrangheta has been around for as long as the better-known Sicilian Cosa Nostra, but was only recently designated as a Mafia-type association in 2010, under Article 416 bis of the Italian penal code. Italy&#x27;s highest court of last resort, the Supreme Court of Cassation, had ruled similarly on 30 March 2010.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Mafia&quot; (; ) derives from the Sicilian adjective &#x27;, which, roughly translated, means &#x27;swagger&#x27;, but can also be translated as &#x27;boldness&#x27; or &#x27;&#x27;. In reference to a man, &#x27; (&quot;mafioso&quot; in Italian) in 19th century Sicily signified &#x27;fearless&#x27;, &#x27;enterprising&#x27;, and &#x27;proud&#x27;, according to scholar Diego Gambetta. In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective &quot;&quot; means &#x27;beautiful&#x27; or &#x27;attractive&#x27;.

Because Sicily was an Islamic emirate from 831 to 1072, &quot;Mafia&quot; may have come to Sicilian through Arabic, although the word&#x27;s origins are uncertain. Possible Arabic roots of the word include:
* () = exempted. In Islamic law, &quot;jizya&quot; is the yearly tax imposed on non-Muslims residing in Muslim lands, and people who pay it are &quot;exempted&quot; from prosecution.
*&quot;màha&quot; = quarry, cave; especially the &quot;mafie&quot;, the caves in the region of Marsala, which acted as hiding places for persecuted Muslims and later served other types of refugees, in particular Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s &quot;Redshirts&quot; after their embarkment on Sicily in 1860 in the struggle for Italian unification.
* () = aggressive boasting, bragging
* () = rejected, considered to be the most plausible derivation; developed into &quot;marpiuni&quot; (swindler) to &quot;marpiusu&quot; and finally &quot;mafiusu&quot;.
* () = safety, protection
* () = the name of an Arab tribe that ruled Palermo. The local peasants imitated these Arabs and as a result the tribe&#x27;s name entered the popular lexicon. The word &quot;Mafia&quot; was then used to refer to the defenders of Palermo during the Sicilian Vespers against rule of the Capetian House of Anjou on 30 March 1282.
* (), meaning &#x27;place of shade&#x27;. The word &quot;shade&quot; meaning refuge or derived from refuge. After the Normans destroyed the Saracen rule in Sicily in the 11th century, Sicily became feudalistic. Most Arab smallholders became serfs on new estates, with some escaping to &quot;the Mafia&quot;. It became a secret refuge.

The public&#x27;s association of the word with the criminal secret society was perhaps inspired by the 1863 play &#x27; (&#x27;The Mafiosi of the Vicaria&#x27;) by Giuseppe Rizzotto and Gaspare Mosca. The words &quot;Mafia&quot; and &#x27; are never mentioned in the play. The play is about a Palermo prison gang with traits similar to the Mafia: a boss, an initiation ritual, and talk of &quot;umirtà&quot; (omertà or code of silence) and &quot;pizzu&quot; (a codeword for extortion money). The play had great success throughout Italy. Soon after, the use of the term &quot;Mafia&quot; began appearing in the Italian state&#x27;s early reports on the phenomenon. The word made its first official appearance in 1865 in a report by the prefect of Palermo .

==Definitions==
The term &quot;Mafia&quot; was never officially used by Sicilian mafiosi, who prefer to refer to their organization as &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. Nevertheless, it is typically by comparison to the groups and families that comprise the Sicilian Mafia that other criminal groups are given the label. Giovanni Falcone, an anti-Mafia judge murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992, objected to the conflation of the term &quot;Mafia&quot; with organized crime in general:
===Mafias as private protection firms===
Scholars such as Diego Gambetta and Leopoldo Franchetti have characterized the Sicilian Mafia as a cartel of private protection firms whose primary business is protection racketeering: they use their fearsome reputation for violence to deter people from swindling, robbing, or competing with those who pay them for protection. For many businessmen in Sicily, they provide an essential service when they cannot rely on the police and judiciary to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves (this is often because they are engaged in black market deals).

Scholars have observed that many other societies around the world have criminal organizations of their own that provide the same sort of protection service. For instance, in Russia, after the collapse of communism, the state security system had all but collapsed, forcing businessmen to hire criminal gangs to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves. These gangs are popularly called &quot;the Russian Mafia&quot; by foreigners, but they prefer to go by the term &quot;krysha&quot;.

In his analysis of the Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta provided the following hypothetical scenario to illustrate the Mafia&#x27;s function in the Sicilian economy. Suppose a grocer wants to buy meat from a butcher without paying sales tax to the government. Because this is a black market deal, neither party can take the other to court if the other cheats. The grocer is afraid that the butcher will sell him rotten meat. The butcher is afraid that the grocer will not pay him. If the butcher and the grocer cannot get over their mistrust and refuse to trade, they would both miss out on an opportunity for profit. Their solution is to ask the local mafioso to oversee the transaction, in exchange for a fee proportional to the value of the transaction but below the legal tax. If the butcher cheats the grocer by selling rotten meat, the mafioso will punish the butcher. If the grocer cheats the butcher by not paying on time and in full, the mafioso will punish the grocer. Punishment might take the form of a violent assault or vandalism against property. The grocer and the butcher both fear the mafioso, so each honors their side of the bargain. All three parties profit.

===Mafia-type organizations under Italian law===
Introduced by Pio La Torre, article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a Mafia-type association (Italian: &quot;associazione di tipo mafioso&quot;) as one where &quot;those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and omertà which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others&quot;.

==International==
Mafia-proper can refer to either:

<text>Sedgley is a town in the north of the Dudley district, in the county of the West Midlands, England.

Historically part of Staffordshire, Sedgley is on the A459 road between Wolverhampton and Dudley, and was formerly the seat of an ancient manor comprising several smaller villages, including Gornal, Gospel End, Woodsetton, Ettingshall, Coseley, and Brierley (now Bradley). In 1894, the manor was split to create the Sedgley and Coseley urban districts, the bulk of which were later merged into the Dudley County Borough in 1966.

Most of Sedgley was absorbed into an expanded County Borough of Dudley in 1966, with some parts being incorporated into Seisdon and Wolverhampton. Since 1974 it has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley.

==History==

The place name &quot;Sedgley&quot; was first mentioned in a 985 charter from King Æthelred to Lady Wulfrūn, when describing the Wolverhampton border. The original Old English place name was &#x27;Secg&#x27;s lēah&#x27; – &quot;Secg&quot; being a personal name (meaning sword-bearing man or warrior) and &quot;lēah&quot; meaning wood, glade or woodland clearing. Sedgley was also mentioned in the Domesday Book, as an estate held by William Fitz-Ansculf, Lord of Dudley.

Originally dotted with farming communities in the middle-ages, the village became industrialized as natural resources such as coal and limestone were exploited, and by the 18th century it was producing goods such as iron and brick.

Sedgley expanded rapidly during the early part of the 20th century, partly in response to the development of the nearby Baggeridge Colliery, despite a depletion in raw materials and a general decline in industry. As industry continued to decline, much of the area became redeveloped, with residential suburbs now dominating the landscape.

Many pre-1900 buildings in Sedgley survive to this day. They include Queen Victoria Primary School (1897), All Saints&#x27; Church (1805) and the early 19th century courthouse, now used as a public house.

===Civic history===
The ancient Manor of Sedgley consisted of nine villages; Sedgley, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, Woodsetton, Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley. In 1897, the villages of Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley broke away from the Manor of Sedgley to form the Coseley Urban District, while Sedgley itself, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, and Woodsetton were formed into the Sedgley Urban District. The entire area was part of the Wolverhampton Parliamentary Borough, created in 1832.

The east of the Sedgley district was transferred into Dudley as long ago as 1926, to allow for the development of the Priory and Wrens Nest Estates, where new council housing was built to rehouse families from the slum clearances in central Dudley in the 10 years leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The Old Park Farm Estate was added in the early 1950s.

Sedgley Urban District Council survived until 1 April 1966, when the majority of the area was merged into the Dudley County Borough, along with the Coseley and Brierley Hill districts. The Gospel End area, however, was merged into the Seisdon Rural District (later South Staffordshire), and the Goldthorn Park estate in the extreme north of the area was transferred into Wolverhampton. The civil parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Dudley, Himley and Wolverhampton. In 1961 the parish had a population of 27,912.

The Gornal villages are generally not considered part of modern-day Sedgley, nor is the bulk of Woodsetton. Gospel End is no longer even in the same county as Sedgley, having remained in Staffordshire.

==Neighbourhoods==
===Bull Ring===
The central area of Sedgley, so named because it was originally the site of bull baiting before the sport was declared illegal in 1835. All signs of the actual ring were destroyed in about 1930 on the construction of a traffic island, but the traffic island is still known as the Bull Ring.

The current Bull Ring is surrounded by a number of notable buildings. The Court House, built in the early 19th century, was originally the law court for Sedgley but is now empty despite their attempts of a succession of owners to keep in competitive with other local pubs. These law courts were relocated to a building at the nearby police station until the town&#x27;s courts were declared redundant in 1988. The Red Lion is approximately the same age as the Court House, and was once the village prison. It is still connected to the Court House by a passageway, though this has long fallen into disuse. The Clifton was opened in 1937 as Sedgley&#x27;s first cinema, and remained open until 1978, when it closed and was converted into a bingo hall before being taken over by JD Wetherspoon and converted into a public house in 1998. The White Horse was built in the 19th century and was refurbished in 2014. Since then it has been the liveliest pub in Sedgley. Monty&#x27;s wine bar also opened in 1998 in what was once a food store.

Presto opened a large supermarket on High Holborn in the town centre in 1987, on the site of a former filling station – with a former public car park being incorporated into the supermarket. A year later it was re-branded Safeway, and in 2004 it was taken over by the Midcounties Co-Operative. This in turn closed in the April 2017 and was re-opened in August 2017 as an Asda following a major refurbishment.

===High Arcal Estate===
Situated to the south of the town centre. It was developed in phases on part of a large field between 1992 and 1996; part of the field has been retained as a public open space and play area. The estate consists of around 300 Housing Association houses, flats and bungalows. Three-bedroom houses are the most frequent type of property in the area. Most residents on the estate are tenants of their homes, while some have shared ownership or full ownership. High Arcal is the largest post-1970s housing development in Sedgley.

===Cotwall End===
Cotwall End is situated around the rural Cotwall End Valley, and is one of the nine historic villages of the Sedgley manor.

A few pre-1900 buildings still exist, but the face of the area has changed dramatically since the Second World War by the construction of mostly upmarket detached houses in Cotwall End Road and Catholic Lane. Cotwall End Primary School has served the area since 1962, by which time most of the current surrounding houses had been built.

The Sandyfields Estate between Cotwall End Road and Sandyfields Road was built in the late 1950s, and is similar in style and layout to the nearby Brownswall and Straits Estates.

One of the few surviving buildings from the historic village of Cotwall End is Spout House Farm, which was built in the 18th century and remained in use for some 200 years, finally being abandoned during the 1970s. The farm house and buildings fell into disrepair over the next two decades but were restored in 2001 and converted into apartments.

A nature reserve, Cotwall End Valley, was opened in the area by Dudley council in 1969. Since 2005 the Brockswood Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit making company caring for rescued animals, has operated from the nature reserve.

===Brownswall Estate===
Situated to the north of Cotwall End Valley, this private housing estate was developed by Coseley-based builders Joseph Webb between 1956 and 1959, consisting of semi-detached and detached houses and bungalows with either two or three bedrooms. Most of the homes on the estate are three-bedroomed semi detached houses. It is also served by a recreation ground which includes a large football pitch and at one stage also a playground. However, the playground was dismantled in 2000 after more than 10 years of continued vandalism and gradual loss of playing equipment, which had reduced its popularity with local children.

===Northway===
Situated north of Cotwall End towards the border with Wolverhampton. The development began in the mid 1950s on land to the north of Gospel End Road, gathered pace in the 1960s and was mostly completed in the 1970s (by which time some 1,000 houses had been built) to join up with Wolverhampton Road.

Alder Coppice Primary School was opened on the Northway estate in 1967.

Alder Coppice, designated a local nature reserve in November 2019, is next to the estate. Also adjoining the estate is Sedgley Hall Park, built in the grounds of Sedgley Hall, a 15th-century house which was demolished in 1966. The park includes playing facilities for children, although some of the playing equipment was dismantled in the 1990s and 2000s due to vandalism.

The centre of the Northway Estate features shops, a medical centre and public house called &quot;The Cabin&quot;, which was part of the late 1960s phase of the estate.

===Beacon Estate===
The Beacon Estate was built by Sedgley UDC in the shadow of Beacon Hill during the 1920s and 1930s, with two small sections being added in the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the first houses built by Sedgley UDC were on the estate.

During the early hours of 28 July 2012, Shane Watson, a 23-year-old man who lived on the estate, was found murdered in an alleyway on the estate. Two local men, Shylon Wishart and James Cartwright, were later convicted of Mr Watson&#x27;s murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Places of interest==
===All Saints&#x27; Church===
All Saints&#x27; Church is a parish church situated in the centre of Sedgley. The first records of the church date back to the Domesday Survey of 1086, but the current structure dates to the early 19th century. Paid for by the Earl of Dudley, the Neo-Gothic building, completed in 1829, originally had a seating capacity of over 1,000, but was later re-seated to hold 850. The church is located on the corner of Vicar Street and Dean Street, with the modern vicarage and church hall on the opposite side of Vicar Street.

At the time, it was the only parish church in the large but relatively lightly populated parish of Sedgley, but the parish was later divided into five ecclesiastical districts, to cover the nine villages of the Manor.

===Baggeridge Park===
Baggeridge Park is a country park located 1.5 miles south-west of Sedgley in Gospel End. Originally part of the Earl of Dudley&#x27;s Himley estate, coal mining operations began on the site in 1902, with the opening of the Baggeridge Colliery. After its closure in 1968 the colliery was bought by Seisdon Rural District Council, and later granted country park status in 1970. Full reclamation of the land commenced in January 1981, with the park officially opened by Princess Anne in June 1983. It has so far been largely free of many of the problems which have become increasingly common across the rest of Sedgley since then.

===Sedgley Beacon===

Beacon Hill, one of several Beacon hills in England, is above sea level, one of the highest points in the West Midlands. It is well known for fossils. The hill was once the site where beacons were lit to warn local people of invaders. Sedgley Beacon Hill provides views across the Black Country, Cannock Chase and Birmingham to the east, and to the Wrekin, Clee Hills and Malvern Hills to the west; on very clear days it is possible to see the hills of North Staffordshire and Derbyshire, as well as the mountains of both North and South Wales. It is also possible to see another Beacon hill – Barr Beacon, some 15 miles away.

===Sarah Hughes Brewery===
The Sarah Hughes Brewery founded in 1921 in a Victorian brew house and pub is situated in Bilston Street, Sedgley, attached to the Beacon Hotel.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
* Queen Victoria Primary School – built in 1897, situated in the town centre. The school was one of the first to take part in a government-sponsored initiative to extend school hours with additional programs beyond the traditional school day, aimed at making better use of public resources for community benefit. New classrooms were built in 2006 to replace mobile classrooms that had been at the school since the 1970s. The original 1897 building is still in existence, and an extension dating from 1931 is also still standing. Students from Queen Victoria mostly transfer to The Dormston School; situated adjacent to the Queen Victoria school site. The two schools often collaborate in enrichment programs for younger students such as the JSLA (Junior Sports Leaders Award) students attending the primary school to teach younger students. Queen Victoria students often use the Mill Theatre for school productions, notably the first production to take place under such circumstance was &quot;A Spaceman Came Travelling&quot; for the Millennium production. The school is a 3–11 school which includes a nursery unit which opened in the 1970s, when the school also opened to 12-year olds as part of a local education reorganisation. However, the school lost a significant number of its pupils to the new Alder Coppice and Cotwall End schools during the 1960s, which were built to accommodate Sedgley&#x27;s rapidly growing population in the postwar years. There was also a senior school at Queen Victoria for pupils aged over 11 years until 1937, by which time Dormston School had opened nearby. The first and middle school buildings were connected in the early 1980s with the construction of a new administration area. The age range was altered to 3–11 from September 1990.
* Cotwall End Primary School – built in 1962, situated about half a mile west of the town centre. It provides a two-form entry for pupils aged 3–11 years. Originally a one-form entry school, it became a two-form entry school in 1971 following the completion of a new infant school building. Cotwall End originally had separate infant and junior schools (becoming a first and middle school in 1972), but merged in 1981 to form a single primary school, with the first and middle school departments reverting to infant and junior school when the leaving age was reduced from 12 to 11 after July 1990.
* Alder Coppice Primary School was opened in 1967 and situated about a mile north-west of the town centre on the Northway Estate. The current headteacher is Dr Duncan Jones, who arrived in January 2006 to replace the retiring Mr David Cox, who had been at the school since April 1999. His predecessor was Mrs Barbara Carter. The school&#x27;s previous headteacher, Mr Colin Gould, left in October 1995 for disciplinary reasons. Alder Coppice was put into special measures in December 1999 after OFSTED inspectors criticised the school&#x27;s weak management of resources and lack of direction, but it came out of special measures 18 months later and is successful again. Doctor Duncan Jones took over from David Cox in January 2006. It was originally two separate infant and junior schools (5–7 and 7–11 respectively), with a nursery unit being added in the 1970s around the same time that the infant and junior schools became first and middle schools in September 1972. However, the first and middle schools merged to form a primary school in September 1988, and the two departments reverted to infant and junior in September 1990 when the age of secondary transfer was reduced from 12 to 11.
* St Chad&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary school, although non-Catholic children are permitted to attend. The school opened in 1870 in a building attached to the church. Two teachers taught approximately 70 children. In 1876, the Victorian School was completed, but eventually became overcrowded. In 1954, work started on the New School. The first three classrooms opened in 1956. Later in 1962 the hall was added. After 1969, the old school became the Dining Room. Further classrooms were added in 1969 and 1973. All three school buildings remain on site, as does the church. It is situated about a quarter of a mile south of the town centre.
* Straits Primary School – built in 1968 to serve the (then) new Straits housing estate. It is situated about two miles south-west of the town centre. The current headmaster is Mr Len Haslehurst, who has there since April 2012. His predecessor was Mr Adrian Slack, who was at the school for 15 years. On Adrian Slack&#x27;s arrival, the school had been placed into special measures by OFSTED inspectors who had criticised the school heavily under its previous management. It came out of special measures in 1999 and is now one of the strongest performing primary schools in the whole Dudley Borough. In September 1989, mobile buildings in the school grounds were used as accommodation for pupils who were starting the new Milking Bank Primary School just over the border in Dudley, as the new school building was not ready in time for the 1989/90 academic year. However, the Milking Bank pupils left the Straits site on 27 November 1989 when their new school buildings was opened.

===Secondary schools===
* Dormston School – built in 1935, situated in the centre of Sedgley. Has expanded greatly since the late 1960s, and since 1996 has included a sixth form centre in partnership with Dudley College. Its status changed from secondary modern to comprehensive in 1975. The age range on its opening was 11+, before changing to 12–16 in 1972 and 11–16 in 1990.
* High Arcal School – built in 1961, situated about half a mile east of Sedgley in Woodsetton, and was a grammar school until becoming comprehensive in 1975. It had a sixth form until 1990. Sixth form facilities returned to the school in 2002, when the sixth form being run in partnership with Dormston School and Dudley College was extended to High Arcal.

===Former schools===
* Flax Hall Primary School – opened in the 1950s but closed in 1989 due to falling pupil numbers. The school buildings survive and are now used as a community centre.
* Tudor County Primary School – opened in the late 19th century, served the community of &quot;Upper Gornal&quot; until its closure in July 1986. The school buildings were used as an adult education centre until their demolition in 1996, when the site was redeveloped for housing.

==Transport==
Due to its hilly geography Sedgley has never had a rail or canal link, although near its historic border with Kingswinford there was a halt on the railway between Stourbridge and Wolverhampton known as Gornal Halt which opened in 1925 and closed in 1932 after just seven years in use, although the line on which it was situated survived into the 1960s.

However, it is served by bus routes to neighbouring areas such as Wolverhampton, Dudley, Bilston and Tipton. Services 27, 27A, 223, 224 and 229 are operated by Diamond Bus and service 1 is operated by National Express West Midlands.

==Crime==
Crime in Sedgley increased significantly during the 1990s and early 2000s, but has fallen in more recent years. In the ward of Sedgley (which includes the town centre, Brownswall, Northway and Beacon estates as well as some of the High Arcal Estate) it was not uncommon for more than 100 crimes to be reported in a single month – with anti-social behaviour by teenagers being particularly rife, more often than not fuelled by alcohol or drugs. The police regularly had to deal with incidents at Dormston School involving pupils. However, by 2014 the number of reported crimes in the Sedgley ward has regularly fallen to less than 50 crimes in a month, with the final two months of 2013 seeing less than 40 crimes reported each month.

<doc id="594164" wikidata="Q1658740" url="?curid=594164" title="Lake Illawarra">
<text>Lake Illawarra (Aboriginal Tharawal language: various adaptions of Elouera, Eloura, or Allowrie; Illa, Wurra, or Warra meaning pleasant place near the sea, or, high place near the sea, or, white clay mountain) is an open and trained intermediate wave dominated barrier estuary or large coastal lagoon , is located in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, situated about south of Sydney, Australia.

Until 2014, the lake environment was administered by the Lake Illawarra Authority (LIA), a New South Wales statutory authority established pursuant to the with the aim of transforming the degraded waters and foreshores of Lake Illawarra into an attractive recreational and tourist resource. In 2014, the LIA was replaced by the Lake Illawarra Estuary Management Committee (LIEMC), including representatives from Wollongong and Shellharbour City Councils, as well as independent scientific advisors, community members, and local Aboriginal representatives.

==Location and features==

Located south of the city of Wollongong, north of the city of Shellharbour, and northeast of Dapto, Lake Illawarra receives runoff from the Illawarra escarpment through Macquarie Rivulet and Mullet Creek, drawing from a catchment area of . With an average depth of , the relatively shallow lake, brought about because of infilling by sand which has been eroded from the surrounding catchments, covers a surface area of . At an elevation of , the maximum volume of water held in the lake is .

The narrow tidal entrance to the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean is located at Windang. Before 2007 Lake Illawarra was frequently closed to the sea. The lake system received large amounts of nutrient and sediment from the catchment which tended to remain within the lake. Water levels within the lake also fluctuated greatly, affecting the local flora species. In July 2007 the Lake Illawarra Authority completed works on training the entrance of the lake to create a permanent opening to the sea. 

Located on the western shore of Lake Illawarra at Yallah is the natural gas-powered Tallawarra Power Station. The power station draws water from the lake for cooling purposes, and returns water to the lake via an onsite water management system that ensures water quality is maintained at levels above the catchment average.

The lake&#x27;s location within the sprawling Wollongong urban area means that Lake Illawarra is vulnerable to pollution and urban run-off.
===Recreation===
Lake Illawarra is popular for recreational fishing, prawning and sailing. On 12 January 2009, it was suspected a man was bitten by a bull shark whilst snorkelling at Windang, near the mouth of Lake Illawarra.

Birds found at the lake include pelicans, cormorants, musk ducks, hoary-headed grebes, black swans, black ducks, grey teal ducks, herons, ibises and spoonbills.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding what is now known as Lake Illawarra are the Aboriginal Tharawal and Wadi Wadi peoples. Lake Illawarra was a valuable source of food and spirituality. Burial sites and middens (shell and camp rubbish heaps) discovered at Windang and surrounding areas indicate that the Wadi Wadi used the area extensively and performed various corroborees and ceremonies in the area. The name Illawarra is derived from various adaptions of the Aboriginal Tharawal language words of &quot;elouera&quot;, &quot;eloura&quot;, or &quot;allowrie&quot;; &quot;illa&quot;, &quot;wurra&quot;, or &quot;warra&quot; mean generally a pleasant place near the sea, or high place near the sea, or white clay mountain.

Matthew Flinders and George Bass called the lake Tom Thumb&#x27;s Lagoon on Flinders&#x27; chart, named after their little boat the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, when they were there in March 1796.

In &quot;Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history&quot;, Joseph Davis provides a wide-ranging environmental and historical biography of the lake and its foreshores. The book also contains many images and photographs depicting the lake. Davis edited &quot;John Brown of Brownsville: his manuscripts, letterbook and the records of Dapto Show Society 1857–1904&quot; that deals with the man who did most to protect the vegetation of the lake islands, and he authored &quot;Gooseberry &amp; Hooka: the island reserves of Lake Illawarra 1829–1947&quot;, the latter examining the records of John Brown and others and deals with the history of these two islands and how they survived to become nature refuges rather than recreation reserves.

<text>The Harvard College Observatory (HCO) is an institution managing a complex of buildings and multiple instruments used for astronomical research by the Harvard University Department of Astronomy. It is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, and was founded in 1839. With the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, it forms part of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.

HCO houses a collection of approximately 500,000 astronomical plates taken between the mid-1880s and 1989 (with a gap from 1953–1968). This 100-year coverage is a unique resource for studying temporal variations in the universe. The Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard project is digitally scanning and archiving these photographic plates.

==History==

In 1839, the Harvard Corporation voted to appoint William Cranch Bond, a prominent Boston clockmaker, as &quot;Astronomical Observer to the University&quot; (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO&#x27;s first telescope, the 15-inch Great Refractor, was installed in 1847. That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867.

Between 1847 and 1852, Bond and pioneer photographer John Adams Whipple used the Great Refractor telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace in London. On the night of July 16–17, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first daguerreotype of a star (Vega).

Harvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Williamina Fleming, and Florence Cushman performed pivotal stellar classification research. Cannon, Leavitt and Cushman were hired initially as &quot;computers&quot; to perform calculations and examine stellar photographs, but later made insightful connections in their research.

==Publications==
From 1898 to 1926, a series of &quot;Bulletin&quot;s were issued containing many of the major discoveries of the period. These were then replaced by &quot;Announcement Card&quot;s which continued to be issued until 1952.

In 1908, the observatory published the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue, which gave rise to the &quot;HR&quot; star catalogue, now maintained by the Yale University Observatory as the Bright Star Catalogue.

<text>Dapto is a suburb of Wollongong in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia, located on the western side of Lake Illawarra and covering . As at the , the suburb had a population of 10,954.

==History==
The name Dapto is said to be an Aboriginal word either from &quot;Dabpeto&quot; meaning &quot;water plenty&quot;, or from &quot;tap-toe&quot; which described the way a lame Aboriginal elder walked. The suburb was officially founded in 1834, when George Brown transferred the Ship Inn from Wollongong to Mullet Creek Farm, in an area now named in his honour as Brownsville. After an unsuccessful attempt at wheat growing in the 1850s, Dapto embraced the dairy industry. In 1887, the railway opened, and a butter factory was established. This began a transformation of Dapto and the town centre shifted south to where the new station was located. The Australian Smelting Company&#x27;s works were established on Kanahooka Road and employed over 500 men. A railway, operated by the Illawarra Harbour and Land Corporation Limited, connected the smelter with the Government railway at Dapto. By 1903 the Commissioner for Railways declared that Dapto was the most valuable station on the Illawarra line, its traffic being double that of Wollongong. The books &quot;John Brown of Brownsville&quot; (2012), &quot;Gooseberry and Hooka&quot; (2012) and &quot;Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history&quot; (2005) – all written by Joseph Davis and published by the Lake Illawarra Authority – contain much detail about Dapto&#x27;s history.

==Land use==
On Koonawarra Point is Mount Brown Reserve, a hill protected by a nature reserve for its important habitat. The eastern side and summit is owned by Tallawarra Power Station. Dapto used to be home to a smelting industry, but this has now closed. Most of the town is residential, with several commercial areas. The main one includes Dapto Mall, which is on the Princes Highway. A small area of the escarpment west of Dapto is protected as part of the Illawarra Escapment State Recreation Area, though not accessible to the public. The escarpment west of Dapto includes Mount Bong Bong, the site of an aeroplane crash when the controllers mistook Lake Illawarra for Botany Bay. A plaque commemorates this event in Dapto. Much of the land to the west is still used as farmland, though other ventures such as the shooting grounds exist. The land to the west is noticeably more hilly than the plain to the north of Wollongong.

The area of Dapto west of the rail line, formerly pastoral land, has undergone significant expansion over the past 20 years. This area has become the fastest growing part of the greater Wollongong region and consists of a sprawling, medium-density suburbia known as Horsley, now officially a suburb in its own right.

==Transport==
The South Coast line electric rail service terminated in Dapto prior to electrification being extended to Kiama in 2001.

==Recreation==
The Dapto Greyhound Racing Track, locally known as the &#x27;Dapto Greyhounds&#x27;, runs races every Thursday evening.

The Dapto Canaries compete in the local Illawarra Rugby League.

The Groundz Precinct, also known as The Groundz or Dapto Showground, is home of the famous Dapto Greyhounds every Thursday night. South Coast Greyhounds (Dapto Greyhound Racing Club) started racing in 1937 on the current site and is set to move to a new site at 34 Bong Bong Road, Dapto in 2025. 

==Facilities==
===Dapto Mall===

Dapto Mall is fourth-largest shopping centre in the Illawarra region, after competitors Wollongong Central, Stockland Shellharbour and Warrawong Plaza. Dapto Mall features Big W, Woolworths and Coles and around 66 stores.

=== Dapto Ribbonwood Centre ===
The centre was Dapto&#x27;s new community centre after relocating in 2001, it is named so after the species of tree that is planted in front. The local library is located on topmost floor of Level 1. It also hosts several conference rooms that can be hired out for a variety of events, ranging from private, small gatherings, to large social events, such as entertainment. The Ribbonwood Centre is also the home of CPSA Dapto Seniors a &#x27;not for profit&#x27; community organisation and the largest senior citizen group in the Illawarra, its fortnightly meetings and many weekly activities take place in Heininger House. Heininger House was incorporated in the Ribbonwood Centre when the community centre was constructed in 2001.
== Education ==
The original Dapto Public School opened in August 1875, and was operated out of a local church hall. A permanent and more central location was opened on the corner of Byamee and Moombara Streets in 1928, which remained the schools&#x27; location until 2004. It was not accessible during the last few years. Due to large expansion of the Horsley area, the school relocated to Sierra Drive, Horsley, opening in 2004.

The suburb has one high school, Dapto High School.

== Dapto in Popular Culture ==
Dapto was mentioned in &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot;, as a parody of the lyrics of the Lucky Starr song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot; were changed so that, instead of listing a wide range of Australian towns, the song said &quot;I&#x27;ve been to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong... Wollongong, Wollongong, Dapto, Wollongong&quot;.

In a bizarre alternate universe, Dapto is the main setting for the adult animated television series &quot;Koala Man&quot; that premiered on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in Australia on 9 January 2023. The series takes place in an alternate universe where the sinking of the Titanic was averted, indirectly resulting in the United States of America being destroyed (except Hollywood becoming an island), Australia becoming the world’s superpower, and Nicole Kidman becoming its Queen.

==Churches==
===Dapto Anglican Church===
The Dapto Anglican Church centre is adjacent to the Dapto Mall and the Dapto Greyhound Racing Club; it has services running from three other sites including the St Aidens building, the hall of Dapto Primary School on a Sunday morning, and the St Lukes Brownsville building (which is historically listed and over 100 years old). There are six services held weekly, as well as children and youth activities on Friday nights, children&#x27;s programs on a Sunday morning and during the weeks of the school holidays, &#x27;Cafe Church&#x27; during the week, and many one-off activities.

===Dapto Uniting Church===

Dapto Uniting Church is located in the heart of Dapto, next to the Dapto Medical Centre on the Princes Highway. Services are held at 9:30am every Sunday morning and incorporate both contemporary and tradition styles of worship. Children&#x27;s programs are held during the Sunday service, Sunday&#x27;s Cool, and there is a youth program, G1Youth of the second and fourth Saturday evening each month during school terms. The Dapto Uniting congregation is a healthy community composed of people of all generations, cultures and backgrounds.

The Dapto Uniting Church traces its roots right back to 1841 when Sunday services were first held in a Dapto schoolroom under the leadership of Presbyterian minister Rev. John Tait. With the establishment of the railway network in 1887, the Dapto area experienced a period of continued urban expansion over the ensuing decades. The current red brick building, St Andrews, was officially opened and dedicated on 7 February 1959. Construction work commenced in 1981 to attach new hall facilities to the existing church building.

For many years, the Dapto Uniting family has sought to serve the local community, through ministries such as the Op Shop, regular Market Days, Family Fun Days and group Heart &amp; Soul Exercise sessions.

===St John&#x27;s Catholic Church===
St John&#x27;s Church is the public worship centre of Dapto&#x27;s Catholic population, and can be found in Jeramatta Street.

<doc id="594171" wikidata="Q445765" url="?curid=594171" title="Dave Gibbons">
<text>David Chester Gibbons (born 14 April 1949) is an English comics artist, writer and sometimes letterer. He is best known for his collaborations with writer Alan Moore, which include the miniseries &quot;Watchmen&quot; and the Superman story &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;. He was an artist for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, for which he contributed a large body of work from its first issue in 1977.

==Early life==
Gibbons was born on 14 April 1949, at Forest Gate Hospital in London, to Chester, a town planner, and Gladys, a secretary. He began reading comic books at the age of seven. A self-taught artist, he illustrated his own comic strips. Gibbons became a building surveyor but eventually entered the UK comics industry as a letterer for IPC Media. He left his surveyor job to focus on his comics career.

==British comics work==
Gibbons&#x27;s earliest published work was in British underground comics, starting with &quot;The Trials of Nasty Tales&quot;, including the main cover illustration, and continuing in &quot;cOZmic Comics&quot; produced by Felix Dennis.

===IPC Comics===
Gibbons entered the British comics industry by working on horror and action titles for both DC Thomson and IPC. One of his earlier works was a 12-part comic-series titled &quot;Year of the Shark Men&quot; for DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard&quot; magazine, in April 1976 – July 1976. When the science-fiction title &quot;2000 AD&quot; was set up in the mid-1970s, Gibbons contributed artwork to the first issue, &quot;Prog 01&quot; (February 1977), and went on to draw the first 24 instalments of &quot;Harlem Heroes&quot;, one of the founding (and pre-Judge Dredd) strips.

Midway through the comic&#x27;s first year he began illustrating &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, a cherished project for Gibbons who had been a fan of the original series and artist Frank Hampson who, alongside Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence and Ron Turner are well-liked and inspirational artists to Gibbons, whose &quot;style evolved out of [his] love for the &quot;MAD&quot; magazine artists like Wally Wood and Will Elder&quot;.

Working on early feature &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; (after &quot;Starlord&quot; merged with &quot;2000 AD&quot;), Gibbons became one of the most prolific of &quot;2000 AD&quot;″s earliest creators, contributing artwork to 108 of the first 131 Progs/issues. He returned to the pages of &quot;the Galaxy&#x27;s Greatest Comic&quot; in the early 1980s to create Rogue Trooper with writer Gerry Finley-Day and produce an early run on that feature, before handing it over to a succession of other artists. He illustrated a handful of &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Future Shocks&quot; shorts, primarily with author Alan Moore.

Gibbons was known, by sight but not by name, to readers of the short-lived IPC title &quot;Tornado&quot;. Whereas &quot;2000 AD&quot; was said to be &quot;edited&quot; by the alien Tharg, &quot;Tornado&quot; was &quot;edited&quot; by superhero Big E, who as alter-ego Percy Pilbeam worked on the magazine. These characters appeared in photographic form within the comic, with Gibbons posing as both Big E and Pilbeam for the entire 22-issue run of &quot;Tornado&quot; before it was subsumed into &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Gibbons departed from &quot;2000 AD&quot; briefly in the late 1970s/early 1980s to become the lead artist on &quot;Doctor Who Weekly/Monthly&quot;, for which magazine he drew the main comic strip from issue No. 1 until No. 69, missing only four issues during that time.

The &quot;Doctor Who Storybook 2007&quot; (released Christmas 2006) features a story called &quot;Untitled&quot; which includes the name &quot;Gibbons&quot; in a list of great artists of Earth history.

The 2023 special &quot;The Star Beast&quot; was based on his 1980 comic of the same name, written by Pat Mills.

==American comics work==

===1980s===
Gibbons was one of the British comic talents identified by Len Wein in 1982 for American publisher DC Comics: he was hired primarily to draw &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; backup stories within the pages of &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. Gibbons&#x27;s first DC work was on the Green Lantern Corps story in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; No. 161 (February 1983), with writer Todd Klein, as well as the concurrently released &quot;Creeper&quot; two-part backup story in &quot;The Flash&quot; #318–319. Gibbons drew the lead story in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; No. 200 (July 1983) which featured a team-up of the Batmen of Earth-One and Earth-Two. With &quot;Green Lantern&quot; No. 172 (Jan. 1984), Gibbons joined writer Wein on the main feature while continuing to illustrate the backup features. In issue No. 182, Wein and Gibbons made architect John Stewart, who had been introduced previously in issue No. 87, the title&#x27;s primary character. Ceding the &quot;Tales of the Green Lantern Corps&quot; backup features to various other individuals from No. 181, Gibbons&#x27; last issue with Wein was issue No. 186 (March 1985). Gibbons returned to pencil the backup story &quot;Mogo Doesn&#x27;t Socialize&quot; with Alan Moore in issue No. 188.

While Marvel Comics reprinted some of Gibbons&#x27;s Marvel UK &quot;Doctor Who&quot; work, Eclipse Comics reprinted some of his &quot;Warrior&quot; work and Eagle reprinted various Judge Dredd tales, Gibbons continued to produce new work almost exclusively for DC throughout the 1980s. For the 1985 &quot;Superman Annual&quot; No. 11, Gibbons drew the main story &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;, again written by Alan Moore.

During 1985 and 1986, Gibbons&#x27;s artwork graced the pages of several issues of both DC&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe&quot; and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot;. He was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series and in December 1986, he contributed to Harrier Comics&#x27; &quot;Brickman&quot; No. 1 alongside Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Lew Stringer and others. Between May and August 1988, he contributed covers to &quot;The Phantom&quot; miniseries, inked Kevin Maguire&#x27;s pencilled contribution to &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 600, and produced the cover to &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; No. 601.

====&quot;Watchmen&quot;====
He is best known in the US for collaborating with Alan Moore on the 12-issue limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, now one of the best-selling graphic novels of all time, and the only one to feature on &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Novels&quot; list. Gibbons&#x27;s artwork in &quot;Watchmen&quot; is notable both for its stark utilisation of the formulaic comicbook nine-panel grid layout, as well as for its intense narrative and symbolic density, with some symbolic background elements suggested by Moore, others by Gibbons.

Initially pitched by Moore to use the Charlton Comics characters which had been purchased by DC Comics, &quot;Watchmen&quot; was re-tooled to feature new, analogue characters when it became clear that the story would have significant and lasting ramifications on its main players. Gibbons believes that his own involvement likely came about after the idea was already in its early initial stages. He recalls that he had:
To complement the story, Gibbons remembers working on rough character designs which ultimately changed little in their final appearance from &quot;the descriptions that Alan had provided,&quot; trying to come up with &quot;a classic superhero feel but be a little bit stranger ... a sort of operatic look ... an Egyptian kind of a look.&quot;

Gibbons lettered &quot;Watchmen&quot; and it was his lettering style that later served as one of two reference sources used by Vincent Connare when creating the controversial font Comic Sans in 1994. Gibbons has commented that &quot;It&#x27;s just a shame they couldn&#x27;t have used just the original font, because it&#x27;s a real mess. I think it&#x27;s a particularly ugly letter form.&quot;

Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;Watchmen&quot; &quot;called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated&quot;. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that &quot;As with &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot; set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim...and would continue to be regarded as one of the most important literary works the field ever produced.&quot;

Gibbons returned to &quot;Watchmen&quot; in 2008, producing the behind-the-scenes book &quot;Watching the Watchmen&quot; to tie into the release of the 2009 film. &quot;Watching the Watchmen&quot; is his take on the creation of the seminal work, and features a number of rarely seen pieces of artwork including sketches and character designs, as well as &quot;stuff,&quot; he says &quot;that I just don&#x27;t know why I kept but I&#x27;m really pleased I did.&quot; Gibbons stated that &quot;I&#x27;m basically thrilled with the movie, you know; it&#x27;s been in the making for years. There have been proposals to make it – some I was excited about, some I was less excited about. But I think the way that it finally has been made is just great. I honestly can&#x27;t imagine it being made much better.&quot;

===1990s===

From the start of the 1990s, Gibbons began to focus as much on writing and inking as on drawing, contributing to a number of different titles and issues from a variety of companies. Particular highlights included, in 1990, Gibbons writing the three-issue &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; miniseries for artist Steve Rude and DC, while drawing &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; for writer Frank Miller and Dark Horse Comics. He penned the first &quot;Batman Versus Predator&quot; crossover for artists Andy and Adam Kubert (Dec. 1991 – Feb. 1992), and inked Rick Veitch and Stephen R. Bissette for half of Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;1963&quot; Image Comics series (1993).

Rejoining Frank Miller in mid-1994 on &quot;Martha Washington Goes to War&quot;, the following year Gibbons wrote the Elseworlds title &quot;Superman: Kal&quot; for José Luis García-López, melding Arthurian legends to the Superman mythos in an &quot;out-of-continuity&quot; tale set in an alternate DC Universe. In Marvel Edge&#x27;s &quot;Savage Hulk&quot; No. 1 (Jan 1996), Gibbons wrote, penciled, inked, coloured and lettered &quot;Old Friends&quot;, a version of the events of &quot;Captain America&quot; No. 110 from the point of view of the Hulk. In 1996 and 1997, Gibbons collaborated with Mark Waid and Jimmy Palmiotti on two issues of the Amalgam Comics character &quot;Super-Soldier,&quot; a character born from the merging of the DC and Marvel Universes after the events of the 1996 intercompany crossover &quot;DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC&quot;.

Among many other covers, one-shots and minor works, Gibbons worked with Alan Moore again briefly on the latter&#x27;s Awesome Entertainment &quot;Judgment Day&quot; miniseries, providing (variant) covers to all three issues, on the first issue of Kitchen Sink Press&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit: The New Adventures&quot; revival and within the pages of the &quot;Alan Moore Songbook&quot;. He designed the logo for Oni Press in 1997. In 1999 he penciled and inked Darko Macan&#x27;s four-issue &quot;Star Wars: Vader&#x27;s Quest&quot; miniseries.

===2000s===
Gibbons was one of the artists on the &quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; one-shot written by Evan Dorkin and in December 2001 Gibbons collaborated with Stan Lee on &quot;Just Imagine... Stan Lee creating Green Lantern&quot;.

Gibbons wrote &quot;Captain America&quot; issues #17–20 (Nov. 2003 – Jan. 2004) for artist Lee Weeks. In 2005, he drew covers for &quot;JSA&quot;, as well as producing the complete original graphic novel &quot;The Originals&quot;, a black and white graphic novel which he scripted and drew. Published by Vertigo, the work is set in the near future, but draws heavily on the imagery of the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s.

He wrote &quot;The Rann–Thanagar War&quot; six-issue limited series for DC Comics, one of four lead-ins to the company-wide &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, and returned to the Green Lantern Corps with the five-issue &quot;Green Lantern Corps: Recharge&quot; (Nov. 2005 – March 2006), co-written with Geoff Johns, which spun off into an ongoing, Gibbons-written series in August 2006.

Gibbons was involved in two series released by DC/WildStorm when DC acquired American rights to the IPC stable of characters. He provided cover artwork for the flagship title, &quot;Albion&quot;, the six-issue limited series written by Leah Moore and her husband, John Reppion and co-plotted by her father, Alan Moore. Gibbons wrote the &quot;Albion&quot; spin-off &quot;Thunderbolt Jaxon&quot; (April–Sept. 2006), with art by John Higgins.

Gibbons provided covers for three issues of writers Kurt Busiek and Fabian Nicieza&#x27;s run on &quot;Action Comics&quot; (issues #841–843) and co-penciled (with Ethan van Sciver) the &quot;Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps&quot; issue as part of the &quot;Sinestro Corps&quot; story arc. He contributed to the ongoing &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; title on issues #18–20 (May–July 2007). Gibbons and Ryan Sook produced a Kamandi serial for &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; in 2009. In the late 2000s, he provided new alternative covers to IDW Publishing&#x27;s reprints of his Marvel UK &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comics.

===2010s===
On 9 April 2011 Gibbons was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9am scripting a 20-page black and white &quot;Superior&quot; comic book, with various artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering. The artists included Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Adi Granov, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Sean Phillips and Liam Sharp, who all drew a panel each, with regular &quot;Superior&quot; artist Leinil Yu creating the book&#x27;s front cover. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children&#x27;s Foundation.

In 2014 he was appointed the UK&#x27;s first Comics Laureate, to act as an ambassador for comic books and their potential to improve literacy.

Gibbons drew the 1950s variant cover for &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 1000 (June 2018).

==Work in other media==
Works other than comics include providing the cartoon strip on the inside sleeve of Jethro Tull&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Too Old to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: Too Young to Die!&quot;, background art for the 1994 computer game &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; and the cover to &quot;K&quot;, the 1996 debut album by psychedelic rock band Kula Shaker. In 1988, he did the cover art of album &quot;The Madness&quot;. In 2007, he served as a consultant on the film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, which was adapted from the book, and released in March 2009. &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; (2009) featured hand drawn art by Dave Gibbons. Since 2021, Gibbons has delivered the annual Christmas Day Message on Forbidden Planet TV, the official YouTube channel of the UK&#x27;s Forbidden Planet comics retail chain. Also since 2021, Gibbons has performed the voices of &quot;Jacob Marley&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Christmas Present&quot; in the annual Hard Agree Christmas Carol comics charity podcast.

<text>The Illawarra is a coastal region in the southeast of the Australian state of New South Wales. It is situated immediately south of Sydney and north of the South Coast region. It encompasses the two cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the coastal town of Kiama. Wollongong is the largest city within the Illawarra with a population of 240,000, followed by Shellharbour with a population of 70,000 and Kiama with a population of 10,000. These three cities have their own suburbs. Wollongong stretches from Helensburgh in the north to Windang in the south, with Maddens Plains and Cordeaux in the west. 

The Illawarra region is characterised by three distinct districts: the north-central district, which is a contiguous urban sprawl centred on Lake Illawarra, the western district defined by the Illawarra escarpment, which leads up to the fringe of Greater Metropolitan Sydney including the Macarthur in the northwest, and to the Southern Highlands region in the southwest, which is historically semi-rural, but now defined by increasing urbanisation.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot;illawarra&quot; is derived from the Aboriginal Tharawal word &quot;allowrie&quot;,&quot; also sometimes spelled as &quot;&quot;elouera&quot; or &quot;eloura&quot;.&quot; According to A. W. Reed, the word is variously translated as &quot;pleasant place near the sea&quot; or &quot;high place near the sea.&quot; The prefix of &quot;illa&quot; is also known to mean &quot;white clay;&quot; with the suffix &quot;&quot;warra&quot;,&quot; sometimes spelled as &quot;&quot;wurra&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;mountain&quot; in the local indigenous language. George Bass and Matthew Flinders were the first Europeans to visit the area, with Flinders recording that it &#x27;was called &quot;Allowrie&quot; by the natives&#x27;.

For the period around 1806, the region was called &quot;Five Islands&quot;; referring to the group of five islands off Red Point. In 1817 Governor Macquarie, referring to region, wrote: &#x27;part of the coast known generally by the name of the Five Islands, but called by the natives &quot;Illawarra&quot;.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people inhabited the Illawarra region for at least 20,000 years before the arrival of European settlers. The Tharawal and Wadi Wadi peoples were the traditional custodians of the land surrounding Lake Illawarra.

The first recorded European exploration of the Illawarra was conducted by Matthew Flinders and George Bass in 1796. The region remained largely uncharted until 1815, when a drought in Sydney prompted settlers to seek new grazing lands. That year, some of the traditional custodians guided European settlers and their cattle down the escarpment into the area.

== Geography ==

The region consists of a grassy coastal plain, narrow in the north and wider in the south, bounded by the Tasman Sea on the east and the mountainous, almost impassable Illawarra escarpment (forming the eastern edge of the Southern Highlands plateau) to the west. In the middle of the region is Lake Illawarra, a shallow lake formed when sediment built up at the entrance to a bay. The district extends from the southern hills of the Royal National Park in the north to the Shoalhaven River in the south, and contains the city of Wollongong, the fourth largest urban area in New South Wales.

North of Wollongong the plain narrows to a small strip of land between the coast and the escarpment. At Coalcliff and Stanwell Park small valleys are formed allowing further settlement. To the south it widens, and becomes increasingly hillier before reaching Stockyard Mountain, a long divide between the main plain and the Jamberoo Valley, which stretches until it reaches Kiama. South of Kiama is Saddleback Mountain and south of that the Shoalhaven plains and the outcrop of Coolangatta Mountain.

===Ecology===

Ecologically, the coastal grassy region of the Illawarra is within the &quot;Illawarra Lowlands Grassy Woodland&quot; biome. Characteristic tree species in the region include &quot;Eucalyptus tereticornis&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus eugenioides&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus longifolia&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus bosistoana&quot; and &quot;Melaleuca decora&quot;. Shrub species include &quot;Acacia mearnsii&quot;, &quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot; and as well as the endangered orchard &quot;Pterostylis gibbosa&quot;.

The wet elevated areas of the Illawarra, where rainfall exceeds 1300mm, are within the &quot;Southern Lowland Wet Sclerophyll Forests&quot; and &quot;Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests&quot; biomes which generally feature tall, compact eucalyptus forests 30m-60m tall and understorey that include moist shrubs, tree ferns, a few vines and a uninterrupted herbaceous groundcover. The Illawarra-Shoalhaven subtropical rainforest lies in the region.

== Government administration ==

For the purposes of Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral Divisions of Cunningham, Whitlam and the northern tip of Gilmore.

For the purposes of New South Wales elections for the NSW Legislative Assembly, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral districts of Wollongong, Keira, Shellharbour, Heathcote, and Kiama.

For the purposes of local government administration, the Illawarra region is contained within the cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the Municipality of Kiama.
*The City of Wollongong forms the northernmost boundary, ranging from Helensburgh to Lake Illawarra, with northernmost coastal suburb Helensburgh and southernmost suburbs including Windang, Yallah and Haywards Bay.
*The City of Shellharbour is south of Wollongong City, and ranges from Albion Park Rail in the north, west to Macquarie Pass near the escarpment, south to Dunmore near the Minnamurra River, and bordered on the east by ocean stretching from Lake Illawarra, Warilla, Barrack Point and Shellharbour.
*The Municipality of Kiama is south of Shellharbour City, and ranges from the Minnamurra River, west to Bald Hill, and south to about south of Gerroa.

==Economy==
The main industries in the area have traditionally been farming, coal mining and steel making. Australia&#x27;s largest steel-works, BlueScope, operates at Port Kembla. The area, especially around Port Kembla and Wollongong, was once known for its mainly industrial jobs, but since the 1990s commerce has played an increasing role in the city, overtaking industry in many areas.

Illawarra cattle were originally bred in Illawarra and are now Australia&#x27;s 3rd largest breed in population. They are large dark red cows sometimes with white patches. They produce large amounts of high butter fat and high protein milk and are suited to the Australian climate. The Illawarra Central Co-operative Dairy Factory was used by the Illawarra Central Co-operative Dairy Co. Ltd. for the intake of milk and cream from dairy farmers in the local area.

Coal mining has been a key part to the Illawarra&#x27;s economy for over 200 years. The southern part of the region has been a source of crushed-stone construction aggregate and railway track ballast material for over 140 years.

==Transport==
The Illawarra region is linked to Sydney in the north by several passes, a motorway (Southern Freeway) and an electric railway (see Illawarra railway line); to the west by the Illawarra Highway and Picton Road; and to the south by the Princes Highway. At Albion Park Rail the Illawarra Regional Airport serves the region.

== Sport ==
=== Rugby League Football ===
The Illawarra Steelers Rugby league Football Club played in the NSWRL rugby league competition, then the NRL, from 1982 to 1998, and currently forms one half of the St George Illawarra Dragons joint venture, who play six of their twelve home games at WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the lower rugby league divisions.

Many famous footballers, such as Bob Fulton, Graeme Langlands, Mick Cronin, Rod Wishart, Paul McGregor, Craig Fitzgibbon, Luke Bailey, Steve Roach, Garry Jack, Warren Ryan, and the Stewart brothers Brett and Glenn, have come from the Illawarra region.

=== Basketball ===
The Illawarra Hawks have represented the region (previously known as The Hawks and the Wollongong Hawks) since the foundation year of the NBL, 1979.
They won the NBL championship in 2001 defeating the Townsville Crocs 2-1 in the best of 3 finals.
They also finished as runners-up in 2005 and 2010 seasons. 
The team caught global attention when American teen sensation LaMelo Ball announced on ESPN&#x27;s show The Jump that he will be joining the Hawks through the NBL&#x27;s Next Star program. In April 2020, LaMelo Ball and his business manager, Jermaine Jackson announced they had bought the Hawks.

=== Association football ===
The Wollongong Wolves participated in the now defunct NSL, winning back to back premierships in 2000 and 2001. The Wolves were not selected for the NSL&#x27;s replacement, the A-League, and instead chose to compete in the New South Wales Premier League under the name Wollongong FC. The Wolves organisation collapsed in 2008, and was taken over by Wollongong Community Football Club. The Wolves have continued to play in the New South Wales Premier League.

=== Cricket ===
Cricket has also been played in the Illawarra for at least one hundred and fifty years with the Keira Cricket Club being founded in 1862.

=== Water Polo ===
The first recorded match of water polo in the Illawarra came in 1894, in a men&#x27;s match between the Wollongong and Kiama Swim Clubs at Brighton Beach. The Kiama Swim Club prevailed, winning 3-0. Water polo is currently played at UOW Pool through the Illawarra Water Polo Club. Each year, Illawarra also compete at the NSW Country Club Championships, whereby the Illawarra U14&#x27;s boys won in 2021.

<doc id="594181" wikidata="Q3115185" url="?curid=594181" title="Decline and Fall">
<text>Decline and Fall is a novel by the English author Evelyn Waugh, first published in 1928. It was Waugh&#x27;s first published novel; an earlier attempt, titled &quot;The Temple at Thatch&quot;, was destroyed by Waugh while still in manuscript form. &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; is based, in part, on Waugh&#x27;s schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House, a former private school in north Wales. It is a social satire that employs the author&#x27;s characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s.

The novel was written at Plas Dulas in north Wales, while staying with the archaeologist Richard MacGillivray Dawkins. In 1925, he taught at Arnold House preparatory school, nearby in the village of Llanddulas, and his experience during this time influenced the fictional school Llanabba Castle in the novel.

The novel&#x27;s title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&quot; The title alludes also to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918–1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse.

Waugh read both Gibbon and Spengler while writing his first novel. Waugh&#x27;s satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and &quot;themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam ... both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour&quot;. This &quot;undertow of moral seriousness provides a crucial tension within [Waugh&#x27;s novels], but it does not dominate them&quot;. Waugh himself stated in his author&#x27;s note to the first edition &quot;Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY&quot;.

In the text of the 1962 Uniform Edition of the novel, Waugh restored a number of words and phrases that he had been asked to suppress for the first edition.

The novel was dedicated to Harold Acton, &quot;in homage and affection&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Modest and unassuming theology student Paul Pennyfeather falls victim to the drunken antics of the Bollinger Club and is subsequently expelled from Oxford for running through the grounds of Scone College without his trousers. Having thereby defaulted on the conditions of his inheritance, he is forced to take a job teaching at an obscure private school in Wales called Llanabba, run by Dr Fagan. Paul soon discovers that the other masters are all failures in life.

Attracted to the mother of one of his pupils, a wealthy widow called the Honourable Margot Beste-Chetwynde, he is delighted to be hired by her as tutor to her son during the vacation. Living in her country mansion, he becomes aware of her lovers and drug use but fails to realise that her business is running a chain of high-class brothels in Latin America. She however wants to marry him. First, he has to fly to Marseille, where a consignment of her girls bound for Brazil has been held up by the police, who need bribing. Paul&#x27;s activities there are shadowed by his college friend, Potts, who now works for the League of Nations investigating human trafficking.

Back in London, he is arrested on the morning of the wedding and, taking the fall to protect his fiancée&#x27;s honour, is sentenced to seven years in prison for traffic in prostitution. In jail, he meets several former staff from Llanabba, which has been closed. Unable to wait seven years, Margot marries a government minister, who arranges for Paul to be rushed from prison to a private clinic for an urgent operation. The clinic is run by Dr Fagan, who certifies that Paul died under anaesthetic and puts him on a boat to Greece.

Deciding to resume his interrupted theological studies, Paul grows a heavy moustache and applies under his own name to Scone, saying he is a distant cousin of the dead criminal. The novel ends as it started, with Paul sitting in his room listening to the distant shouts of the Bollinger Club.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Guardian&quot;, in 1928, praised the book as &quot;a great lark; its author has an agreeable sense of comedy and characterisation, and the gift of writing smart and telling conversation, while his drawings are quite in tune with the spirit of the tale&quot;. The newspaper also compared the superficial presentation in the novel to that employed by P. G. Wodehouse. Arnold Bennett hailed it as &quot;an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire&quot; and the writer John Mortimer called it Waugh&#x27;s &quot;most perfect novel ... a ruthlessly comic plot.&quot;

In his biography of Waugh, journalist Christopher Sykes recalled, &quot;I was in a nursing home when &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; came out, and Tom Driberg visited me and brought a copy. He began to read out some favourite passages and was literally unable to read them to the end because he and I were so overcome by laughter.&quot;

In a 2009 episode of &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, the British actor and comedian David Mitchell named &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; as the book he would take to a desert island, calling it &quot;one of the funniest books I&#x27;ve ever read&quot; and &quot;exactly the sort of novel I would like to have written.&quot;

==In other media==
The novel was dramatised as the 1969 film &quot;Decline and Fall... of a Birdwatcher&quot;, starring Robin Phillips, and also by Jeremy Front in a 2008 BBC Radio 4 production starring Alistair McGowan as Pennyfeather, Jim Broadbent as Grimes, Andrew Sachs as Prendergast, Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Fagan, Jonathan Kidd as Philbrick, Joanna David as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Emma Fielding as Flossie, and Richard Pearce as Peter.

It was dramatised again in 2015 by BBC Radio 4, with Kieran Hodgson as Pennyfeather, Emilia Fox as Margot, Tom Hollander as Otto, John Sessions as Grimes, Alex Lawther as Peter, James Fleet as Prendergast and Geoffrey Whitehead as Fagan.

In 2017, the BBC produced a three-part TV dramatisation starring Jack Whitehall as Paul Pennyfeather, David Suchet as Dr Fagan, Eva Longoria as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Douglas Hodge as Captain Grimes, and Vincent Franklin as Mr Prendergast. The production was the book&#x27;s first television adaptation, and received largely positive reviews. Alastair Mckay with the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;delicately constructed and pitch-perfect.&quot; Ellen E. Jones remarked on the show&#x27;s &quot;many enjoyable performances,&quot; especially that of Hodge as the &quot;drink-soaked deviant&quot; Captain Grimes, adding, &quot;Give him a spin-off series immediately.&quot;

<doc id="594183" wikidata="Q1025118" url="?curid=594183" title="Cadence Records">
<text>Cadence Records was an American record company based in New York City whose labels had a picture of a metronome. It was founded by Archie Bleyer, who had been the musical director and orchestra leader for Arthur Godfrey in 1952. Cadence also launched a short-lived jazz subsidiary, [[Candid Records]].

The first recording star for Cadence was a Godfrey alumnus, Julius La Rosa. Other Godfrey alumni signed to the label included the Chordettes. Bleyer had written a few hit songs in 1932–34 (Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Business in F&quot; is a good example) and had a band that recorded for ARC in 1934 and 1935 (his records were issued on Vocalion, Melotone, Perfect and Romeo). 

In October 1954, Godfrey fired singer Julius La Rosa, causing a storm of controversy.

Almost immediately after firing La Rosa, Bleyer was fired from the Godfrey show, for signing Don McNeill, Chicago-based talk host, to a record deal and producing spoken-word records for Cadence featuring. Godfrey considered McNeill a rival. &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; aired on ABC Radio opposite Godfrey&#x27;s morning show, although McNeill&#x27;s success was nowhere on a par with that of Godfrey.

The label also issued the early recordings of Andy Williams and the Everly Brothers, as well as Johnny Tillotson and Lenny Welch. Virtuoso jazz/classical pianist Don Shirley was signed to Cadence in the 1950s and 1960s. One of Cadence&#x27;s most popular songs in the 1950s was &quot;Eloise&quot;, written and sung by Kay Thompson.

Cadence charted nearly 100 American singles between 1953 and 1964. The label also released the 1962 bestselling parody album &quot;The First Family&quot;, starring comedic actor and impressionist Vaughn Meader. Acclaimed at that time as the fastest-selling album in history, this White House satire on the Kennedy family and Capitol Hill politics remained at #1 on the Billboard 200 for 12 weeks. Featuring Meader&#x27;s impression of President John F. Kennedy, the sketch revue also included takes on First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and Vice-President Lyndon Johnson. A sequel album, &quot;The First Family Volume Two&quot;, released in March 1963, reached #4. Both albums were immediately withdrawn following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November, 1963.

The departures of the Everly Brothers in 1960 (to Warner Bros. Records) and of Andy Williams in 1961 (to Columbia Records), along with radical changes in public taste and the music business brought on by the British Invasion, led to the rapid decline of Cadence. By 1964, Bleyer opted to shut down the label. Bleyer had competing offers from Kapp Records, Liberty Records and Andy Williams, who initially wanted to purchase just the masters of his own Cadence recordings. Bleyer&#x27;s sale specified a complete purchase of the entire Cadence catalog (including Candid Records), which Williams accepted.
 Williams reissued his old Cadence recordings on Columbia and formed Barnaby Records to manage the rest of the Cadence catalog.

<doc id="594188" wikidata="Q3501089" url="?curid=594188" title="Elstree Studios">
<text>Elstree Studios is a generic term which can refer to several current and demolished British film studios and television studios based in or around the town of Borehamwood and village of Elstree in Hertfordshire, England. Production studios have been located in the area since 1914 when film production began there. 

Films shot at Elstree include: Britain&#x27;s first sound film, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963), &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) and the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films.

Television shows shot at Elstree include &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;. The music video for Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was filmed at Elstree in November 1975.

Currently, two major sites remain in use in Borehamwood: Elstree Studios on Shenley Road and the BBC Elstree Centre on Eldon Avenue. A third, Sky Studios Elstree is currently under construction, whilst a fourth Millennium Studios still exists in a much reduced capacity where it trades as Studio 2000.

==History and facilities==
Despite being called &quot;Elstree Studios&quot;, only one studio has ever been located in Elstree itself, the remainder residing in the adjacent town of Borehamwood. When the studios were being established, Elstree was significantly larger than Borehamwood. Nowadays, Borehamwood is larger, but the old names have remained in use.

The civil parish that contains the town was called &quot;Elstree&quot;. The local railway station was originally known as &quot;Elstree&quot; (nowadays, it is called &quot;&quot;). The local telephone exchange was also called &quot;Elstree&quot;.

===Eldon Avenue Studios, Borehamwood===
The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. Production ceased during 1917, and the studio was sold to the Ideal Film Company who used the site up until 1924.

During 1928, the studio was sold to Ludwig Blattner who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions during 1934, which purchased the site two years later. Rock Productions built four new large stages. The site was again sold, and taken over by the British National Films Company between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the British government for war work.

During 1953, the studios were bought by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., mainly for television production and were later sold to Lew Grade&#x27;s Associated Television (ATV). The Eldon Avenue centre became the main television production hub for ATV. The smaller Studios A and B were used for schools and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmes such as the ATV Morecambe and Wise series &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1961–68) and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–81).

When ATV was restructured as Central Independent Television in 1982, one of the conditions of its licence renewal by the governing body of the ITV network, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, was that ATV should leave any London-centric facilities and become more focused on the Midlands, the part of the United Kingdom to which it broadcast ITV programmes. They remained in operation by Central up until July 1983.

The BBC bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce its new soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (first aired on 19 February 1985). In addition to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, many other programmes have been made there including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot;, &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, &quot;Hangar 17&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot;. Most of the site is now devoted to &quot;EastEnders&quot; production, but Studio D is available for hire via BBC Studioworks.

===Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood===
British National Pictures Ltd. purchased of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. The first film produced there was &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot; (1927). The company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and a second stage was ready for production in 1928.

Alfred Hitchcock made &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), the first British talkie at the studios in 1929. At the end of the silent-film era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the British &amp; Dominions Film Corporation. BIP became Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. During World War II, the studios were used by the War Office for storage.

In 1946, Warner Brothers acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. In 1969, EMI gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios. In 1969, Bryan Forbes was appointed head of production of the film studio (see EMI Films). His tenure was short-lived and marked by financial problems, brought about by deliberately withheld funding and failed projects. Forbes resigned in 1971. During the period 1970–73, when EMI had a short-lived production and distribution deal with the American Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, the facilities were known as the EMI-MGM Elstree Studios.

In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. This was halted, but only with significant job cuts and closure of some facilities. The studio&#x27;s immediate survival was secured through the facilities being used for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequels and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in director Steven Spielberg. In 1979, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI after EMI&#x27;s debacle with its invention of the CT scanner, and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios.
The studios were put up for sale in 1985. Acquired by the entertainment and property company Brent Walker part of the largely derelict backlot and their facilities were demolished and 19 acres were sold to Tesco plc to build their superstore. 

A &quot;Save Our Studios&quot; campaign mainly led by local writer and historian Paul Welsh MBE, saw the remaining site purchased by Hertsmere Borough Council (for whom Welsh then worked) in February 1996 for two million pounds and they invested ten million pounds for renovations and the construction of two brand new stages, Welsh estimates Hertsmere ratepayers receive a 15% annual return on their original investment. Management company, Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd were appointed to run the studios in 2000.

The studios at Shenley Road are used for both film and television production and are the permanent home of BBC Studioworks during the redevelopment of Television Centre. Shows such as &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;Pointless&quot; are recorded there.

===Station Road Studios, Borehamwood===
A single large stage was built in Station Road in 1928 by Whitehall Films Ltd, but the company was wound up in 1930. In 1935, Julius Hagen, the owner of Twickenham Studios, bought the site and formed a new company, JH Studios.

In 1937, financial difficulties forced Hagen to sell the studios to MP Productions owned by producer J Banberger.

During World War II, the studio was used by the government for storage.

In 1950, the site was bought by J. Arthur Rank, who renamed it Gate Studios and made religious films.

Production ceased in 1957, and the site was sold to Andrew Harkness, a manufacturer of cinema screens. Harkness Screens moved out of the site in 2004 having established a global manufacturing base in France and the US and relocated its UK operation to a new production facility in Stevenage. The building in Borehamwood was demolished in 2006 to make way for apartments new properties, the development being named Gate Studios in homage to the former site.

===Imperial Studios, Borehamwood===
In 1930, the British and Dominions Film Corporation bought three new sound stages from British International Pictures Ltd on the adjoining site before their construction was completed, which they named &quot;Imperial Studios&quot;. Alexander Korda made one of his greatest successes at the studio, &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), which starred Charles Laughton as the King. The film&#x27;s success in the United States and elsewhere persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda&#x27;s proposed Denham Film Studios.

Film production continued until 1936 when fire destroyed the three stages. British and Dominions made a substantial investment in Pinewood Studios at Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, and moved production there. The support buildings in Borehamwood that remained after the fire were sold off to various companies including Frank Landsdown Ltd, which opened a film vault service. The Rank Organisation bought the music stage for the production of documentary films. It later became the headquarters of the film and sound-effect libraries.

===MGM British, Borehamwood===

Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937, but its plans collapsed and the facility was soon sold to Rank, who never used it for making films. After a brief period owned by the Prudential, the studios were purchased by the American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1944 and was renamed MGM-British Studios. After improvements the studio contained seven stages totalling over of floor space. MGM sometimes leased the studios to other film companies including the 20th Century Fox-produced &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958), for which a large set of a Chinese town, complete with artificial lakes, covering some 500,000 square feet, was constructed.

Several stages were taken up with the sets for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) over its extended production schedule, and indeed Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film is sometimes blamed for making the studios financially unviable. The facility continued to be used until 1970 when MGM closed the studios. The American company formed a short-lived deal with EMI, while the site of its former studios was redeveloped for industrial use and housing.

===Danziger Studios, Elstree===

In 1956 the Danziger brothers converted a wartime plane engine testing factory into a film studio they called &quot;New Elstree&quot;, which was located to the west of the Aldenham Reservoir. The site had six sound stages and employed 200. It was used mainly for second features and television series, but was closed by 1962 and sold in 1965. The site is now occupied by &quot;The Waterfront&quot; business park on the A411 Elstree Road.

===Millennium Studios, Elstree Way, Borehamwood===
Established in 1993, the Millennium Studios on the south side of Elstree Way (opposite the site of the former MGM-British studios) offered television and film production space together with associated services. Productions shot there include the first series of CBBC&#x27;s &quot;The Mysti Show&quot; in 2004 and one year of Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot; in 2005. Millennium Studios relocated to Thurleigh near Bedford in 2010.

A single television studio, Studio 2000, remains on the Borehamwood site, and has been used for &quot;Rude Tube&quot;.

===Sky Studios Elstree, Borehamwood===

In December 2019, media conglomerate Sky announced plans to develop a new studio facility at Rowley Lane. The new studios were expected to open in 2022, and to have 13 stages with the smallest being approximately . The site is also expected to house post-production facilities and an on-site screening cinema. A further 10 stages could be added in a proposal (&quot;Sky Studios Elstree North&quot;) to extend the site northward.

There is also a proposal for a separate 21-stage Hertswood Studios immediately to the north of the proposed Sky Studios Elstree North site.

<doc id="594193" wikidata="Q7428948" url="?curid=594193" title="Say It (ABC song)">
<text>&quot;Say It&quot; is a single by the pop band ABC, with additional remixing by the team behind the Italian house music group Black Box. It was released in 1991 as a 7&quot; single, 12&quot; single and CD single.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release as a single, Stuart Maconie of &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;Say It&quot; as an &quot;inconsequential House ditty&quot; and added, &quot;I like the guitar, I like the Philly strings. I don&#x27;t like anything else. But &#x27;I was baked Alaska&#x27; must be the bravest lyrical gambit of the decade. A pity this germ of lunacy couldn&#x27;t have infect more of the song.&quot;

<doc id="594195" wikidata="Q633753" url="?curid=594195" title="Archie Bleyer">
<text>Archibald Martin Bleyer (June 12, 1909 – March 20, 1989) was an American song arranger, bandleader, and record company executive.

==Early life==
Bleyer was born in the Corona section of the New York City borough of Queens. His father was a well-known trumpet player who had played with the Metropolitan Opera. The younger Bleyer began playing the piano when he was only seven years old. In 1927, he attended Columbia College, intending to become an electrical engineer, but as a sophomore switched to a music major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger. In the early 1930s, Bleyer wrote a number of songs that were recorded, all &#x27;hot&#x27; novelty numbers, including &quot;Mouthful O&#x27;Jam&quot;, &quot;Business In F&quot; and &quot;Business In Q&quot;.

In 1934, he began to lead his own band at Earl Carroll&#x27;s club in Hollywood, California. Bleyer&#x27;s orchestra recorded for Vocalion Records in 1934 and in 1935 moved to the ARC group of labels (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole). One of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was Johnny Mercer, who later became known as a songwriter and co-founder of Capitol Records.

In 1945, Bleyer began a collaboration on the CBS radio network as the orchestra conductor for the popular &quot;Gordon MacRae Show&quot;. Included among the instrumentalist who appeared with his orchestra was John Serry Sr., who emerged in later years as a leading orchestral accordionist.

==Godfrey years==
Bleyer became Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s musical director in 1946, remaining in this role until 1953. Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer&#x27;s creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey&#x27;s radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer&#x27;s judgment in the areas of presentation and production.

Bleyer founded Cadence Records in 1952. The label&#x27;s first artist was Julius La Rosa, a member of the Godfrey cast, which also included vocalists Janette Davis, Frank Parker, Marion Marlowe, and the racially integrated vocal group The Mariners. At the time, La Rosa was the show&#x27;s most popular cast member. Bleyer had several instrumental hit singles of his own, and signed other artists who had performed on Godfrey&#x27;s programs, including The Chordettes, one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife in 1954.

In the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer &quot;lacked humility&quot;, which diminished Godfrey&#x27;s popularity. La Rosa had hired a personal manager, going against an unofficial Godfrey policy. That same day, Godfrey fired Bleyer, apparently offended when Bleyer recorded spoken recitations by Chicago radio personality Don McNeill, host of &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot;. This long-running Godfrey-like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest and tailored to that audience. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Godfrey later claimed when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him from at least one of the three shows Godfrey hosted, the conductor shrugged and told him to do what he had to do.&quot;

Radio historian John Dunning has suggested, in &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio&quot;, that Bleyer&#x27;s relationship with Janet Ertel was also a factor in Godfrey&#x27;s decision to fire him; Godfrey tried to enforce a no-dating policy among his cast and fired several who dated each other. Bleyer never made a public comment about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa&#x27;s firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer&#x27;s, began the slow unraveling of Godfrey&#x27;s seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV, just as Bleyer&#x27;s career was beginning to blossom. The loss of Bleyer&#x27;s expertise in staging and production matters, where he served as an informal mentor to Godfrey despite their age differences, was detrimental to Godfrey&#x27;s programs.

==Cadence Records==
While LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included Andy Williams and the label&#x27;s biggest act of all, The Everly Brothers, whose hits such as &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; and &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by Chet Atkins. Bleyer was also the step father-in-law of Phil Everly. (In 1963, Everly married Jacqueline Alice Ertel, daughter of Bleyer&#x27;s wife, Janet. They divorced in 1970.) Don Shirley appeared on the label in 1955 with &quot;Tonal Expressions&quot;. It became a Top 15 album in the spring of that year, reportedly selling more than 20,000 copies, a respectable debut for a jazz artist. It was the only chart album Shirley was to enjoy, but his sales remained steady enough that he was with the label until it closed in 1964, recording more than a dozen long-play releases.

Bleyer also had limits to his tolerance for rock and roll. While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not as tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist Link Wray. In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release Wray&#x27;s no-frills, roaring instrumental &quot;Rumble,&quot; in part due to his daughter&#x27;s fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate. He shelved the album and canceled Wray&#x27;s contract. The material would not be released for decades until it was acquired by the British Rollercoaster label.

Cadence had a short-lived jazz subsidiary, Candid, which lasted for about a year from 1960 (it was reactivated under new owners several decades later).

Cadence had another major hit in 1962 with comic Vaughn Meader&#x27;s album &quot;The First Family&quot;, which featured Meader&#x27;s comedic sketches and his peerless impersonations of President John F. Kennedy. The album was an enormous seller, as was a follow-up, until Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.

Cadence always maintained a small roster of artists. Other Cadence hits included 14 chart hits by Johnny Tillotson, ten by The Chordettes, four by Lenny Welch, and two by Don Shirley. In 1964, Bleyer, who was unable to accept the changing pop music market at the dawn of the British Invasion, sold the Cadence label and all its recordings (except for certain material which he kept to himself, like the Link Wray album). The buyer was Cadence artist Andy Williams, who formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalog.

Bleyer moved with his wife Janet to her hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where he died in 1989 of the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, less than a year after his wife. 

Bleyer was a freemason, and a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568, New York City.

<doc id="594196" wikidata="Q850120" url="?curid=594196" title="Wadcutter">
<text>A wadcutter is a special-purpose flat-fronted bullet specifically designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under approximately . Wadcutters have also found favor for use in self-defense guns, such as .38 caliber snubnosed revolvers, due to shorter barrel lengths, lower bullet velocities, and improved lethality. Wadcutters are often used in handgun and airgun competitions.

==Bullet profile==

A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that is typically as wide as the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, such as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 52. Although this is not always the case, as some wadcutters may have rounded bullet nose profiles.

==Types of firearm wadcutters==
A variety of wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow at the rear end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for automatic press reloading uses, as they may be used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with gas checks. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding , the gas check reducing leading within the bore.

===Accuracy===
The maximum accurate distance of wadcutters varies considerably with the shape of the front of the bullet. Full caliber diameter wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond , full caliber diameter wadcutters become highly inaccurate. On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding . In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes.

===Lubrication and bullet crimping===
Lead wadcutters require proper lubrication to prevent leading (buildup of lead deposits) of rifling and forcing cones when used in firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately . Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both .44 Special and .44 Magnum cartridges, in instances where overall cartridge lengths may need to be set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.

===Indoor wadcutters===
Wadcutter bullets for center-fire firearms often have a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a clean cut without tearing of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut the surface of the rubber mat.

===Bullet loading techniques===
Wadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case opening or they may be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy; the desired powder capacity of the case; or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality.

==Leading effects==
Wadcutters are typically made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels and into the forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. A modern solution to leading at higher velocities is powder coating the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective shell. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if full metal jacket bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Mechanical and/or chemical means may be employed to remove the lead buildup caused by shooting wadcutters at excessive velocity.

==Air rifle and pistol wadcutters==

Target airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at muzzle velocities around . The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of or less.

<doc id="594198" wikidata="Q586591" url="?curid=594198" title="Cumberland sausage">
<text>Cumberland sausage is a pork sausage that originated in the historic county of Cumberland, England, ceremonially part of Cumbria. It is traditionally very long, up to , and sold rolled in a flat, circular coil, but within western Cumbria, it is more often served in long, curved lengths.

The meat is chopped, not ground or minced, giving the sausage a chunky texture. Seasonings are prepared from a variety of spices and herbs, though the flavour is commonly dominated by pepper, both black and white, in contrast to more herb-dominated varieties such as Lincolnshire sausage. Traditionally no colourings or preservatives are added.

In March 2011, the European Union granted &quot;Traditional Cumberland sausage&quot; Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status.

==History==
The Cumberland sausage has been a local speciality in the area for around 500 years. How the Cumberland sausage came to acquire its special shape and taste is not known. Historically, the sausage was more highly seasoned than it is today, reflecting a strong influx of spices into Whitehaven during the eighteenth century. During this time, Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper, and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar, and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria&#x27;s local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland sausage.

==Ingredients==
Cumberland sausage is typically filled with chopped or coarsely minced pork, to which is added pepper, thyme, sage, nutmeg and cayenne, and some rusk as a binder. The meat content is usually 85–98%. However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse-cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick, continuous lengths.

Until the 1950s, most local farms and many households kept a pig as part of their regular husbandry and means of self-sufficiency. Over time, a local variety of pig was bred that was suited to the cooler and wetter climate in Cumberland, known as the Cumberland pig. The Cumberland pig was a heavy pig with an upturned snout and ears that flopped forwards. Heavy boned, slow to mature, and extremely hardy, the creature became a symbol of the region, but was allowed to die out in the early 1960s at Bothel. As an alternative, Large Black, Gloucestershire Old Spots, and Welsh breeds can be used. The Cumberland pig breed has now been revived, although not officially recognised by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

==Protected Geographical Status==

A campaign was made by some Cumbrian butchers and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a Protected Geographical Status classification under European Commission rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to Parma ham and Feta cheese. The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include a high meat content of more than 80%; the sausage to be coiled, not linked; a wider diameter than conventional sausages; and a rough-cut texture. The association asserts the sausage should be prepared in Cumbria. While individual butchers have their own recipes, they are generally more highly seasoned than traditional sausages, possibly due to the historical import of spices at Whitehaven.

However, opposition arose to the campaign in its present form, which essentially calls for the modification of the proposition to reduce the region of the proposed protection from the post-1974 &#x27;administrative&#x27; County of Cumbria – which incorporates Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire &#x27;north of the Sands&#x27; but without abolishing the original counties – to the Traditional County of Cumberland, on native grounds, with provisions including the native right for natives to continue to manufacture the sausage elsewhere.

In March 2011, PGI status was granted to the name &quot;Traditional Cumberland sausage&quot;. To display the PGI mark, the sausage must be produced, processed, and prepared in Cumbria and have a meat content of at least 80%. It must include seasoning and be sold in a long coil. However, sausages not meeting these criteria are sold as Cumberland sausages (without claiming PGI).

<doc id="594199" wikidata="Q895961" url="?curid=594199" title="Boyden Observatory">
<text>Boyden Observatory is an astronomical research observatory and science education centre located in Maselspoort, north-east of the city of Bloemfontein in Free State, South Africa. The observatory is managed by the Physics Department of the University of the Free State (UFS). The Friends of Boyden assist the observatory as a public support group, organising open evenings and protecting its public interest. Boyden also makes use of members of ASSA Bloemfontein Centre, the amateur astronomy club of the city, for presenters and telescope assistants.

== History ==

The Boyden Station of Harvard Observatory was founded in 1889 by Harvard University at Mount Harvard near Lima, Peru. It was relocated to Arequipa, Peru in October 1890 (obs.
 code: 800). It was named after Uriah A. Boyden, who in 1879 left in his will $238,000 to Harvard Observatory to be used for astronomical purposes. Significant work done at Arequipa include the discovery of Phoebe, an outer moon of Saturn, by William Henry Pickering using photographic plates captured with the Bruce Astrograph.

In 1927, the observatory was moved to its present location in South Africa. This was done because it was expected that Bloemfontein would be less cloudy than Arequipa, which after two years of recording proved to be true. The site near the settlement of Mazelspoort was formally dedicated in 1933. Its first and longtime director in South Africa was John S. Paraskevopoulos, who held the post from 1927 to 1951. Financial issues at Harvard almost led to the closure of Boyden in 1954, but several European countries became partners in funding and using the observatory. In 1975 Harvard, which had transferred the title to the Smithsonian Institution, announced it would withdraw its support in the following year. UFS agreed to support the facility, and it was donated to UFS in 1976.

== Telescopes ==
* The Boyden-UFS Telescope, which is also known as the Rockefeller Reflector, is a Cassegrain reflector.
* The Watcher Robotic Telescope is a f/14.25 robotic telescope developed by the University College Dublin and UFS. The primary function of the telescope is visual spectrum observation following Gamma-ray bursts.
* The Nishimura Telescope is a reflector commissioned by the Nagoya University and constructed by Nishimura Co. Ltd. in 2000. It was not in use as of 2009.
* The Alvan Clark Telescope is a refractor named after its maker, Alvan Clark. The telescope was first installed at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1889. It is used for outreach purposes.
* The Metcalf Photographic Triplet Refractor is a display item.
* A coelostat (solar telescope) is used for outreach purposes.

=== Boyden-UFS Telescope history ===

Andrew Ainslie Common figured a mirror in 1885 (and another in 1890) for a Newtonian reflecting telescope (later converted to a Cassegrain), but the telescope fell into disuse and was bought by the Harvard College Observatory from Common&#x27;s estate. The primary mirror was re-figured in 1933, and along with a new mount it was installed at Boyden.

In the mid-1960s the Hamburg engineering firm of Heidenreich and Harbeck was contracted to build a new mirror cell for the telescope to reduce the problems experienced due to the thinness of the mirror and the fact its back surface was not flat. Shortly afterward the old Common primary mirror was replaced by a new mirror from Loomis made of low-expansion glass.

In 2001 the telescope received a major upgrade by DFM Engineering. This upgrade included a new control system, modifications to the mirror cell, and a new primary light shield. From 2005 to 2009 it was part of the Probing Lensing Anomalies Network.

=== Former telescopes ===
* The Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard Telescope was a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope built in 1949 by Perkin-Elmer. Three organisations were involved: Armagh Observatory, Dunsink Observatory, and Harvard. It was installed at Bloemfontein in 1950. However, it never worked well, and after several attempts to fix it, the mirrors and lens were removed in 1981 and sent to Dunsink.
* The Bruce Astrograph was a refracting telescope built in 1893 by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons. After being used for many years in Arequipa, it was brought to Bloemfontein and housed in a building with a roll-off roof. With plates taken by this telescope, Harlow Shapley discovered the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies, the first of their kind. In 1950, it was replaced by the Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard Telescope.

== Research and discoveries ==
Boyden Observatory performs professional astrophysics research using the 1.5 meter reflector. In addition to the research program, the observatory runs an active educational program for school children from all backgrounds as well as for members of the public, attracting thousands of visitors each year. In 1966, this observatory discovered four asteroids.

Facilities include the main building where the original offices were and where the library is, the resident astronomer&#x27;s house, a state-of-the-art auditorium seating 100 people inside and 200 people on its roof for open-air sky shows, the main telescope buildings, smaller telescope buildings, a lecture room, store room, the ASSA Bloemfontein clubhouse, observation platforms, and various vantage points.

=== Proposed Extensions ===

The observatory is constantly experiencing growth in visitor numbers and the extension of its facilities. Medium term plans call for e.g. the establishment of an educational walking route for visitors to appreciate the diverse natural life in the area, a museum and science exhibition areas, upgrading of the educational telescope facilities etc. Long term plans include the construction of a digital planetarium and the completion of the fully-fledged Science Hall. A digital planetarium is open in the nearby city of Bloemfontein on Naval Hill (South Africa&#x27;s first digital planetarium), inside the original dome of the Lamont-Hussey observatory.

<text>The southern pig-footed bandicoot (&quot;Chaeropus ecaudatus&quot;) was a small species of herbivorous marsupial in the genus &quot;Chaeropus&quot;, the pig-footed bandicoots.

==Taxonomy ==
The description of the population was revised in 2019, separating a central western population as &quot;Chaeropus yirratji&quot; and recognised two earlier descriptions as subspecies Chaeropus ecaudatus ecaudatus (found in southeastern Australia) and Chaeropus ecaudatus occidentalis (found in western and southwestern Australia).

== Description ==
It has been believed to be extinct since the mid-20th century, having reportedly vanished from its final refuge in southern Australia by 1945. It was presumably the first of the two species of &quot;Chaeropus&quot; to go extinct. Pig footed-bandicoots were the only marsupials to walk on reduced digits both on the fore and hind feet. In addition, the pig footed-bandicoot diverges from two different species. According to molecular phylogenetic analyses they diverged from other bandicoots like the Peramelidae, and also from the bilbies like Thylacomyidae in the mid-Late Oligocene.

It is thought to have been distributed in shrubland habitats in the southern regions of Australia&#x27;s deserts, and its range likely extended to Western Australia. It physically closely resembled the northern pig-footed bandicoot (&quot;C. yirratji&quot;), but it had fewer holes on its palate and shorter feet. It also had a different dentition than &quot;C. yirratji&quot;, indicating that it may have had a different diet. &quot;C. ecaudatus&quot; rapidly adapted to drying conditions and changing environment, quickly becoming a grazer in a short period of time &quot;C. ecaudatu&quot;s is thought to have undergone rapid herbivorous evolution due to lesser high crown and lateral blade development on the lower molars found in an ancestral species, &quot;Chaeropus baynesi&quot;. The two species were formerly considered conspecific until a study released in 2019 found them to be separate species. This species likely went extinct due to predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats, as well as habitat degradation by introduced livestock.

<doc id="594204" wikidata="Q2298481" url="?curid=594204" title="Take My Breath Away">
<text>&quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; is a song written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock for the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, performed by American new wave band Berlin. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1986.

==Background==
Italian musician Giorgio Moroder was asked by Jerry Bruckheimer, the co-producer for &quot;Top Gun&quot;, to write a song for the film. He first wrote &quot;Danger Zone&quot; which was recorded by Kenny Loggins. Happy with the result, Bruckheimer then requested a slower song for a romantic scene. Once Moroder had written the musical backing to what would become &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, he recorded a demo which featured a distinctive bass sound on a synthesizer that would later be used on the actual recording. Moroder gave the demo to lyricist Tom Whitlock. The two first became acquainted when Whitlock, a mechanic, fixed the brakes on Moroder&#x27;s Ferrari, and informed him that he was also a lyricist. Whitlock wrote the lyrics while driving home from the studio, and then spent a few hours at home polishing them. A demo of the song, sung by a background singer, impressed director Tony Scott and producers Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who decided to film new romantic scenes between Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to feature the song.

The song was first offered to The Motels, who much later released their original demo, which is fairly similar to Berlin&#x27;s released version, on their compilation album &quot;Anthologyland&quot; (2001). Columbia Records suggested some of their signed artists, but eventually Moroder thought of the band Berlin, whose song &quot;No More Words&quot; he had produced. Whitlock made a few changes to the lyrics before Terri Nunn recorded the vocals. Moroder has said that of all the songs he has produced in his career, he is most proud of this song.

==Releases and performances==
&quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; was the second single from the &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtrack album, following Kenny Loggins&#x27; &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, and was released in 1986 as a split single alongside the song &quot;Radar Radio&quot;, performed by Moroder featuring Joe Pizzulo.

The song peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and also topped the charts in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium. It later went on to win Best Original Song at the 59th Academy Awards.

&quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; is available on both the original &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtrack album and the expanded edition. The song was also featured on Berlin&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Count Three &amp; Pray&quot; and, as the band&#x27;s biggest hit, on several of the band&#x27;s compilation albums: &quot;Best of Berlin 1979–1988&quot;, &quot;Master Series&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits Remixed&quot; (which includes a &quot;Mission UK Remix&quot; version), &quot;Live: Sacred &amp; Profane&quot;, and &quot;Metro Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; was one of the few songs not written by Berlin&#x27;s John Crawford that they had performed on any album up to that point. Following the release of &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, the band split over different points of view regarding the track: while Nunn viewed it as an opportunity that allowed the band to perform worldwide, Crawford disliked it as it had not been written or composed by any of them. He later said: &quot;None of us had ever heard it. None of us had anything to do with it. I didn&#x27;t play on it. Nobody played on it. No one wrote it&quot;.

&quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; was re-released in the United Kingdom in October 1990 to coincide with the first television showing of &quot;Top Gun&quot; (by ITV, on the evening of October 6, 1990), as well as Peugeot&#x27;s television advertising campaign for the 405 model range. The re-release reached number three on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2017, &quot;ShortList&quot;″s Dave Fawbert listed the song as containing &quot;one of the greatest key changes in music history&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video features scenes from the film &quot;Top Gun&quot; intermingled with Berlin&#x27;s singer Terri Nunn performing the song in blue coveralls, walking between parts of planes in a windy aircraft boneyard (part of the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port) at night. Bandmates John Crawford and Rob Brill are shown relaxing in the yard and then following Nunn. Nunn&#x27;s coveralls appear to be scorched (as if her character was in an accident), and where she appears, surrounding electric lights come to life akin to paranormal phenomena associated with ghosts. As her bandmates watch, Nunn is greeted by the ghostly appearance of military airmen of various eras. Nunn and the military men disappear into thin air at the end of the video, indicating they were all ghosts in the boneyard, and a reference to the titular lyric of the song. 

The video can be seen occasionally on VH1 Europe&#x27;s Top 10 Movie Soundtracks program. It was later included on the 2004 &quot;Top Gun&quot; collector&#x27;s edition DVD.

==Jessica Simpson version==

American singer Jessica Simpson covered &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; and released it as the third single from the album &quot;In This Skin&quot; in March 2004. Her version was produced by Billy Mann. Simpson chose to cover this song because she thought that it was the theme song of her relationship with her then-husband, Nick Lachey.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as the top 10 on the Top 40 Tracks and Top 40 Mainstream charts. It also became another number-one single for Simpson on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. On November 7, 2005, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

<text>Moruroa (Mururoa, Mururura), also historically known as Aopuni, is an atoll which forms part of the Tuamotu Archipelago in French Polynesia in the southern Pacific Ocean. It is located about southeast of Tahiti. Administratively Moruroa Atoll is part of the commune of Tureia, which includes the atolls of Tureia, Fangataufa, Tematangi and Vanavana. France undertook nuclear weapon tests between 1966 and 1996 at Moruroa and Fangataufa, causing international protests, notably in 1974 and 1995. The number of tests performed on Moruroa has been variously reported as 175 and 181.

==History==

The first recorded visit this atoll was Commander Philip Carteret on HMS &quot;Swallow&quot; in 1767, just a few days after he had discovered Pitcairn Island. Carteret named Mururoa &quot;Bishop of Osnaburgh Island&quot;. In 1792, the British whaler was wrecked here, and it became known as Matilda&#x27;s Rocks. Frederick William Beechey visited it in 1826.

Early European explorers found that the atoll was not continuously inhabited. In 1826 Beechey found it empty. A visit in 1832 found &quot;dwellings but no inhabitants&quot;. A visiting ship in 1834 killed all but three of the inhabitants it found there, and it was unclaimed in 1847. It was briefly inhabited by copra workers in the late nineteenth century, and again from 1942 to 1943 and 1950–52, but has had no permanent inhabitation since.

===French nuclear weapons testing===
Mururoa, and its sister atoll Fangataufa, were the site of extensive nuclear testing by France between 1966 and 1996, as well as the site of numerous protests by various vessels, including the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;. The atoll was officially established as a nuclear test site by France on 21 September 1962, when the Direction des Centres d&#x27;Expérimentations Nucléaires (DIRCEN) was established to administer the nuclear testing. This followed with the construction of various infrastructures on the atoll commencing in May 1963. The atoll of Hao, to the north-west of Mururoa, was chosen as a support base for the nuclear tests and other operations.

Despite objections from some 30 members of the Polynesian Territorial Assembly, the first nuclear test was conducted on 2 July 1966, code named Aldebaran, when a plutonium fission bomb was exploded in the lagoon. Greenpeace states in a 21st-century study that the explosion sucked all the water from the lagoon, &quot;raining dead fish and mollusks down on the atoll&quot;, and that it spread contamination across the Pacific as far as Peru and New Zealand. President Charles de Gaulle himself was present at Moruroa on 10 September 1966 when a test was conducted, using a device suspended from a balloon. Most of these tests were conducted on the western end of the atoll, designated as Dindon. Smaller blasts were detonated on the northern end of the atoll, designated as Denise. Three nuclear explosive devices were detonated on barges, three were air dropped from bombers, and the rest were suspended from helium filled balloons. A total of 41 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at Mururoa between 1966 and 1974.

France abandoned atmospheric nuclear testing in 1974 and moved to underground testing in the midst of intense world pressure which was sparked by the New Zealand Government of the time, which sent two frigates in July 1973, HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot; and &quot;Otago&quot;, to the atoll in protest for a nuclear free Pacific. Shafts were drilled deep into the volcanic rocks underlying the atolls where nuclear devices were detonated. This practice created much controversy as cracking of the atolls was discovered, resulting in fears that the radioactive material trapped under the atolls would eventually escape and contaminate the surrounding ocean and neighbouring atolls, a case of so-called tired mountain syndrome. A major accident occurred on 25 July 1979 when a test was conducted at half the usual depth because the nuclear device got stuck halfway down the 800 metre shaft. It was detonated and caused a large submarine landslide on the southwest rim of the atoll, causing a significant chunk of the outer slope of the atoll to break loose and causing a tsunami affecting Mururoa and injuring workers. The blast caused a 2 kilometre long and 40 cm wide crack to appear on the atoll.

French president Jacques Chirac&#x27;s decision to run a nuclear test series at Mururoa on 5 September and 2 October 1995, just one year before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was to be signed, caused worldwide protests, including an embargo of French wine. Riots took place across Polynesia, and the South Pacific Forum threatened to suspend France. These tests were meant to provide France with enough data to improve further nuclear technology without needing additional series of tests. The last nuclear test on Moruroa occurred on 27 December 1995.

The test site at Mururoa was dismantled following France&#x27;s last nuclear test to date, which took place on 27 January 1996 on Fangataufa. In total, 181 explosions took place at Moruroa, 41 of which were atmospheric. However, the total number has been variously reported: nuclear scientists working at the site claim 175 explosions in total took place in the Pacific.

===Aftermath===
As of October 2005, it is still prohibited to visit Moruroa, according to the French Polynesia&#x27;s president, Oscar Temaru, due to the high levels of radioactive contamination. The atoll is still guarded by French Forces.

== Monitoring ==
A report from 2012 suggested that only 11 of the 20 monitoring system sensors are actually functional, which could mean the atoll could potentially collapse without forewarning of the monitoring system.

In February 2021, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research INSERM published a report entitled &quot;Nuclear tests and health - Consequences in French Polynesia&quot;. The objective of this study was to establish an assessment of the available international scientific knowledge on the health consequences of the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by France in French Polynesia, on the general population and former civilian and military workers.

<doc id="594214" wikidata="Q3360654" url="?curid=594214" title="John Wagner">
<text>John Wagner (born 1949) is an American-born British comics writer. Alongside Pat Mills, he helped revitalise British comics in the 1970s, and continues to be active in the British comics industry, occasionally also working in American comics. He is the co-creator, with artist Carlos Ezquerra, of the character Judge Dredd.

Wagner started his career in editorial with D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. in the late 1960s before becoming a freelance writer and a staff editor at IPC in the 1970s. He has worked in children&#x27;s humour and girls&#x27; adventure comics, but is most notable for his boys&#x27; adventure comics; he helped launch &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; (1975), for which he wrote &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot;, and &quot;2000 AD&quot; (1977), for which he created numerous characters, including Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog, Robo-Hunter and Button Man. In the 1980s, he and co-writer Alan Grant wrote prolifically for IPC&#x27;s &quot;2000 AD&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Scream!&quot; and &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;. They also wrote for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Batman&quot; in the U.S., created a series of Batman and Judge Dredd team-up comics, and started the British independent comic &quot;The Bogie Man&quot;. Judge Dredd has twice been adapted for film, and David Cronenberg adapted Wagner&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;A History of Violence&quot; into the 2005 film of the same name. Wagner continues to write for &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Wagner was born in Pennsylvania, U.S., in 1949, the product of a war marriage. When Wagner was twelve his parents separated and his mother returned to Greenock in Scotland with the children. Wagner describes himself as &quot;a pretty badly adjusted youth&quot; in America, fighting and getting into trouble, and says he &quot;benefited a lot from the added discipline of life in Scotland.&quot;

When he left school he joined a printing company, going to college on day release, until his aunt showed him an advert for editorial assistants at D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. in Dundee. He got the job, starting in the Fiction department, and went on to become chief sub-editor of the romance comic &quot;Romeo&quot;, and also wrote horoscopes. He and Pat Mills, a fellow sub-editor, left to go freelance in 1971, and began submitting scripts to London&#x27;s IPC, working from Mills&#x27; garden shed in Wormit, Fife. Starting with humour titles like &quot;Cor!!&quot; and &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;, they also went on to write for girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; adventure comics, including strips like &quot;Yellowknife of the Yard&quot;, about a Native American detective in London, drawn by Doug Maxted, for &quot;Valiant&quot;; &quot;Partridge&#x27;s Patch&quot;, about a friendly rural policeman and his dog, drawn by Mike Western, for &quot;Jet&quot;; &quot;The Can-Do Kids&quot; for &quot;Lion&quot;, and boarding school serial &quot;School for Snobs&quot; for &quot;Tammy&quot;. IPC managers John Purdie and John Sanders began to take notice.

After nine months their writing partnership broke up, and Wagner moved to London to join IPC&#x27;s staff, editing girls&#x27; titles &quot;Sandie&quot; and &quot;Princess Tina&quot; until 1973, when both were merged into other titles. After that he quit comics for a time, taking a variety of jobs, including as caretaker of an estate in the Scottish Highlands and dredging on a barge.

===&quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;===

In the autumn of 1974 Pat Mills had been tasked with developing &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;, a new war-themed title for IPC to compete with D. C. Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Warlord&quot;. He asked Wagner to join him and help develop characters. Mills and Wagner were dissatisfied with the sanitised nature of boys&#x27; comics and wanted to make them harder-hitting, with more working-class heroes. They devised the opening line-up themselves, with the assistance of Gerry Finley-Day, before farming the stories out to other writers. The title was launched with a cover date of 8 March 1975, and was a hit.

Wagner continued to write for girls&#x27; comics, including scripting gymnastics strip &quot;Bella at the Bar&quot; for &quot;Tammy&quot;, and was appointed editor of the ailing boys&#x27; weekly &quot;Valiant&quot;. Characters he created for this title included the tough New York City cop &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot;, drawn by John Cooper, which was inspired by the film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and became the comic&#x27;s most popular character, and &quot;Soldier Sharp&quot;, drawn by Joe Colquhoun, about a cunning coward in World War II. Both strips transferred to &quot;Battle&quot; when &quot;Valiant&quot; was merged into it in 1976, with One-Eyed Jack leaving the police and becoming a spy.

Wagner then quit editorial and returned to freelance writing. In 1976–77 he wrote &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; for &quot;Battle&quot;, a violent series about a renegade British captain leading a group of lost soldiers in a personal war against the Japanese in Burma during World War II, drawn by Mike Western, which became one of the comic&#x27;s most popular strips, although Wagner has since said he regrets &quot;some of the jingoistic, racist language&quot; used. A collected edition was published by Titan Books in 2011. Other strips he wrote for &quot;Battle&quot; included &quot;Joe Two Beans&quot; (1977), about a mute Native American soldier in the Pacific Campaign, drawn by Eric Bradbury, and the naval series &quot;HMS Nightshade&quot; (1978–79), drawn by Western. For Mills&#x27; short-lived, controversial title &quot;Action&quot; he scripted the boxing strip &quot;Blackjack&quot;. During this time he shared a flat on Camberwell New Road in London with future &quot;2000 AD&quot; editor Steve MacManus.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;===
In 1976 Mills brought Wagner in as script adviser for the new science fiction comic he was developing, &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Wagner suggested the new title needed a cop story, and his proposal, &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, took the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; archetype further, imagining a violent lawman, empowered to dispense justice on the spot in a future New York. Artist Carlos Ezquerra was asked to visualise the character, but Wagner initially hated the elaborate look Ezquerra came up with, thinking it &quot;way over the top&quot;. When a proposed buy-out of &quot;2000 AD&quot; that would have improved creators&#x27; terms and conditions fell through, Wagner walked away from the comic, leaving Mills to develop the character by commissioning stories from freelancers. The first published episode appeared in issue 2, based on a script by Peter Harris, rewritten by Mills and drawn by Mike McMahon, which alienated Ezquerra. Wagner returned to write the character from issue 9, and has written the majority of Judge Dredd stories since. Ezquerra returned in 1982 to draw the &quot;Apocalypse War&quot; storyline, and continued to draw the character semi-regularly until his death in 2018.

Wagner created two long-running series in 1978. One, &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot;, a private detective-style character who specialised in robot-related cases, was initially drawn by José Ferrer, but his pages were partly redrawn by Ian Gibson, who became the strip&#x27;s regular artist. The other, &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, a sci-fi western about a bounty hunter in a future where mutants are an oppressed minority forced into doing such dirty work, was created by Wagner and Ezquerra for &quot;Starlord&quot;, a short-lived sister title to &quot;2000 AD&quot; with higher production values. &quot;Starlord&quot; was later merged into &quot;2000 AD&quot;, bringing &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; with it.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
During their writing partnership, Wagner and Mills had submitted story ideas to the BBC for the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the 1970s, but Wagner eventually dropped out, tired of the endless rewrites requested, an experience which turned him off TV writing. Mills&#x27; involvement came to an end when the show&#x27;s script editor changed. Artist Dave Gibbons was aware of this, and when he was offered the chance to draw the lead strip in &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; in 1979, he suggested them as writers. The pair wrote four eight-part serials, based on their unmade TV scripts. They adapted them separately, Wagner scripting &quot;City of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Dogs of Doom&quot;, and Mills scripting &quot;The Iron Legion&quot; and &quot;The Star Beast&quot;, although all were credited to &quot;Mills &amp; Wagner&quot;.

===Partnership with Alan Grant===

From 1980 to 1988 he wrote in partnership with Alan Grant, an old friend and former D. C. Thomson and &quot;2000 AD&quot; sub-editor with whom he was sharing an old farmhouse in Essex, although most stories were credited to Wagner alone (under one of his pseudonyms) or Grant alone – whichever of them typed the script up got the cheque. Wagner (as John Howard or T. B. Grover) was credited with &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, and Grant with the less frequent &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot;, &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, and the Judge Dredd spin-off &quot;Anderson, Psi Division&quot;, while some strips, like the CB-inspired space haulage comedy &quot;Ace Trucking Co.&quot;, were credited to &quot;Grant/Grover&quot;. &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; was credited to &quot;Wagner/Grant&quot; starting in 1986.

Other pseudonyms were created, at the insistence of publisher John Sanders, to disguise how prolific the two writers were. For the revived &quot;Eagle&quot; they wrote &quot;Doomlord&quot;, &quot;Joe Soap&quot;, &quot;Rebel the Police Dog&quot;, &quot;Computer Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Fists of Danny Pyke&quot;, &quot;Manix&quot; and &quot;The House of Daemon&quot;; for &quot;Scream!&quot; they wrote &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;, for &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; they wrote &quot;Dan Harker&#x27;s War&quot;, and for &quot;Battle&quot; they wrote &quot;Invasion 1984&quot;. During this time Wagner wrote the documentary strip &quot;Fight for the Falklands&quot; for &quot;Battle&quot;, without Grant who had no interest in war stories, and &quot;Dan Dare&quot; with Pat Mills for &quot;Eagle&quot;.

Wagner and Grant became part of the so-called &quot;British Invasion&quot; of American comics during the 1980s. In 1987 their first title, a mini-series called &quot;Outcasts&quot;, was published by DC Comics with Cam Kennedy as artist. &quot;Outcasts&quot; was well received, though it never sold in great quantities, and this success led to the pair writing Batman in the pages of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; from issue 583, largely with Norm Breyfogle on art duties. Grant and Wagner introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story and the Ratcatcher in their third. The pair also created the bleak nuclear dystopia &quot;The Last American&quot; for Epic Comics with longtime Dredd artist Mike McMahon. Arguments over the direction of that title and the ending of the Judge Dredd story &quot;Oz&quot; led to the end of their writing partnership and they split their work between them: Wagner kept &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, while Grant continued &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; and &quot;Anderson, Psi Division&quot; and became the sole writer of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. Although the two continued to collaborate from time to time, they never resumed a full-time partnership.

===Creators&#x27; rights===
In 1987, IPC&#x27;s comics division was sold to Robert Maxwell as Fleetway Publications. John Davidge was appointed as publishing director in 1989, and within a matter of weeks was confronted by Wagner, who emptied a large bag of Judge Dredd merchandise onto his desk, pointed out he had received no royalties for any of it, and threatened a creator walk-out over the issue. Davidge, whose background was in magazine and book publishing, was shocked, and introduced written contracts and royalty payments for comic creators.

===&quot;The Bogie Man&quot; and the 1990s===
One series Wagner and Grant did continue writing together was &quot;The Bogie Man&quot;, about an escaped mental patient who thinks he&#x27;s Humphrey Bogart, or rather a composite of the characters he played, and constructs imaginary cases by associating random events with events in Bogart films. They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing &quot;Outcasts&quot;. It was first published as a four-part miniseries by the Scottish independent Fat Man Press in 1989, intending to tie in with Glasgow&#x27;s position as European City of Culture in 1990, and further stories followed from other publishers.

Wagner and Grant were named as consulting editors on a new title, the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;, in 1990. Wagner did most of the development work, and wrote three of the five strips in the opening line-up, including &quot;America&quot;, illustrated by Colin MacNeil, which examined the totalitarian nature of the Judge system through the story of a young woman who becomes a pro-democracy terrorist, and &quot;Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend&quot;, with art by Peter Doherty, which told the origin of Dredd&#x27;s arch-enemy Judge Death in humorous style. While his efforts were concentrated on Dredd in the &quot;Megazine&quot;, Wagner took a break from writing the character in &quot;2000 AD&quot;, replaced by Garth Ennis, Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and others. He did not resume writing for &quot;2000 AD&quot; for more than three years.

Wagner was initially involved in &quot;Toxic!&quot;, an independent weekly anthology launched in 1991, but, aside from two &quot;Bogie Man&quot; serials co-written with Grant, most of his proposed stories were rejected and he withdrew from the project. One such proposal, &quot;Al&#x27;s Baby&quot;, a comedy about a male mob hitman who becomes pregnant, drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, ran in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; in 1991. Another, &quot;Button Man&quot;, a contemporary urban gladiator thriller drawn by Arthur Ranson, was published in &quot;2000 AD&quot; in 1992. Both spawned sequels.

Wagner and Grant reunited in 1992 for &quot;Judgement on Gotham&quot;, a hit graphic novel teaming up Judge Dredd and Batman, co-published by Fleetway and DC and featuring painted art by Simon Bisley. Further team-ups between Dredd and Batman followed, but were beset by production delays.

In the mid-1990s Wagner worked on a number of licensed properties for Dark Horse Comics in the US, including &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; – notably solo stories starring Boba Fett and the comics strand of the multimedia project &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; – and &quot;&quot;. In 1997 he wrote his first original graphic novel, &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, a contemporary thriller about an unassuming small-town man whose background in gang crime comes back to haunt him, drawn by Vince Locke for the Paradox Press imprint of DC Comics. It was nominated for the Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario in 2006.

===21st century===
In 2000 Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra revived &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; (main character Johnny Alpha had been killed off in 1990 in a story written by Alan Grant), based on a treatment Wagner had written for an abortive TV pilot. Initially, stories were set before the character&#x27;s death in a revised continuity, but 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot; brought Johnny back from the dead.

Wagner has continued to be the main writer of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; in &quot;2000 AD&quot; and the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;. In 2003 he co-wrote the Judge Dredd/Aliens crossover, &quot;Incubus&quot;, with Andy Diggle, which was co-published by Dark Horse Comics and &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Since 2005 he has shared the character with other writers, including Gordon Rennie, Robbie Morrison, Si Spurrier, Al Ewing and Michael Carroll. Major storylines he has contributed include &quot;Origins&quot; (2006–2007), exploring how the Judge system was established, and &quot;Day of Chaos&quot; (2011–2012), in which many of the institutions of Dredd&#x27;s world are destroyed, leaving a more dangerous city.

In 2016 Wagner teamed up with Grant to create a new comic for &quot;BHP Comics&quot;. Drawn by Dan Cornwell &quot;Rok of the Reds&quot; tells the story of a dangerous intergalactic outlaw, Rok of Arkadi, who, while on the run, hides on the planet earth by taking over the body and life of troubled football star Kyle Dixon.

A father of two, Wagner lives with his wife near Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

==Style and influence==
Pat Mills describes Wagner&#x27;s writing as &quot;romantic but not emotional&quot;. His depictions of violent action, from &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; to &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; to &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, are unsentimental and laced with mordant humour. Other strips, like &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot;, &quot;Ace Trucking Co.&quot; and &quot;The Balls Brothers&quot;, reveal a more overt comedy side to his writing. He is well known for writing terse scripts, described by artist Dave Gibbons as being like &quot;exciting telegrams&quot;. He says he does not think visually, but rather &quot;in terms of plot developments [and] dialogue&quot;, preferring to leave the visual decisions to the artist.

Described by Warren Ellis as &quot;probably the single most influential writer in British comics&quot;, Wagner is named as an influence by writers such as Alan Grant, who says he &quot;taught me almost all I know about comic writing&quot;, Garth Ennis, Andy Diggle and Rob Williams. Alan Moore was inspired by the work of Wagner and Pat Mills in &quot;2000 AD&quot; to try and express his ideas in mainstream comics. Wagner&#x27;s own influences include the comics of D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. Outside of comics, authors he admires include John Steinbeck, Patrick O&#x27;Brian and Michael Connelly.

==Screen adaptations==
A TV film of &quot;The Bogie Man&quot; was made in 1992 by BBC Scotland starring Robbie Coltrane, but was not well received and a series was never made. Wagner and Grant made very little money out of it. Wagner felt that the screenwriter did a poor job adapting it, and Coltrane did not understand the character.

1995 saw the release of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, a big budget version of the comic directed by Danny Cannon and starring Sylvester Stallone. Wagner was unhappy with the result, feeling they had filmed &quot;the wrong script&quot; and that &quot;Stallone was badly advised&quot;. A second attempt at adapting the character to the screen, entitled &quot;Dredd&quot;, was released in September 2012, directed by Pete Travis from a script by Alex Garland, and starring Karl Urban. This time Wagner was consulted over the script, was involved in the promotion of the film, and has described it as &quot;unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd&quot;.

In 2005 his graphic novel &quot;A History of Violence&quot; was adapted into a film, directed by David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris. Wagner had backed the film once he saw the group of actors Cronenberg had gathered. The film was nominated for the Palme D&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2005, and the script, by Josh Olson, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2005.

It was reported in May 2012 that Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn was in talks with DreamWorks about a possible &quot;Button Man&quot; film.

The 2023 Tamil movie, LEO, an official remake of the novel “A History of Violence” has put a thank you card at the beginning of the movie. There are rumours that the author Mr. Wagner nor the producer of the initial adaptation are not aware of this remake. The movie is a smash hit and crossed 50 million dollars worldwide in 7 days.

<doc id="594219" wikidata="Q563731" url="?curid=594219" title="Anna and the King of Siam (film)">
<text>Anna and the King of Siam is an American 1946 drama film directed by John Cromwell. An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon&#x27;s book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights.

The story mainly concerns the culture clash of the Imperialist Victorian values of the British Empire with the autocratic rule of Siam&#x27;s King Mongkut. The successful film starred Rex Harrison as the king and Irene Dunne as Anna. At the 19th Academy Awards ceremony, the film received two Oscars; for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, Frank E. Hughes). Also nominated were Bernard Herrmann for the score, the screenwriters and supporting actress Gale Sondergaard.

Landon&#x27;s novel was later adapted by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their 1951 stage musical &quot;The King and I&quot; and subsequent 1956 film of the same name. American film director Andy Tennant remade the film in 1999 as &quot;Anna and the King&quot; with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-fat.

The portrayal of Tuptim in &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; is considerably less sympathetic than in the musical version &quot;The King and I&quot;, as the 1946 film shows animosity between Tuptim and Anna, while the musical makes her into a romantic character. Also, Tuptim is ultimately executed cruelly by the king, following an episode in Leonowens&#x27;s book, while in the musical her fate is made ambiguous.

==Plot==
In 1862, Anna Owens arrives in Bangkok with her son Louis to tutor the children of the King. Her letter from the King asking her to come to Siam includes a promise that she will have a house of her own away from the Palace, but the Kralahome (Prime Minister) says she will have to stay in the harem for now.

Anna goes to the Kralahome&#x27;s office the next day and asks him to introduce her to the King so she can get the house business straightened out and start her school. When she meets the King, he tells her it is polite to prostrate oneself before him; Anna says she will bow as she would to her own Queen. Mongkut introduces her to his many wives and his 67 children and insists she live in the palace, where she will be more accessible. When she insists, she is shown a sleazy house in the fish market, but rejects it and stays in the palace, starting her school there. He finally cedes to Anna on the matter of the house.

Mongkut begins summoning Anna in the middle of the night to discuss the Bible and other scholarly matters. On the way back from one of these sessions, she discovers a chained slave with a baby. This is L&#x27;Ore, who belongs to Lady Tuptim, the King&#x27;s newest wife. Tuptim refuses to let L&#x27;Ore go, even though L&#x27;Ore&#x27;s husband has offered to pay for her. Anna reminds the King that his own law requires that slaves must be freed if the money is offered. Tuptim runs away.

Mongkut expects English visitors and asks Anna to dress some of his prettiest wives in European style and to provide English-style decor and utensils to show that he is not a barbarian. Anna suggests that the King invite consuls to come from other countries at the same time. The party is a great success, combining British, European, and Siamese traditions and convincing the visitors that Siam is a civilized nation with a proud history.

Lady Tuptim is found in a Buddhist temple, disguised as a young man. At trial, she explains she couldn&#x27;t stand being shut up, and so disguised herself and went to the monastery, where she was accepted as a novice and studied with Phra Palat, her former fiancé, who took holy vows when Tuptim was presented to the king. No one believes her story. Anna begs the King&#x27;s help, but he is insulted that she even knows about such a private matter. Anna loses her temper and tells the king he has no heart. Phra Palat and Tuptim are both burned at the stake.

Anna decides that she has had enough and says goodbye to the children. The royal wives read her a letter pleading with her to stay. Lady Thiang says that the crown prince may not grow up to be a good king if Anna doesn&#x27;t stay to educate him. At the same time, Louis dies in a riding accident. When the King asks Anna to continue secretarial duties, she says, &quot;It&#x27;s the children I want,&quot; and goes on with her school.

Many years later, Anna is summoned to the bedside of the dying King. The King says that Anna spoke the truth to him and was a good influence on the children. He expresses his gratitude and dies. The Kralahome asks Anna to stay and help the prince. When Chulalongkorn is crowned, his first act is to abolish the practice of prostration before the King so that everyone can respect each other and work together.

==Cast==
==Historical inconsistencies==
There are a number of differences between the plot of this film and historical fact, including:
* Anna was Anglo-Indian, raised in India, and not Welsh, as she claimed; she had never even visited Britain before becoming a governess in the court of Siam. Also, she was the widow of a civilian clerk and hotel-keeper, not a British army officer.
* King Mongkut had been a Buddhist monk for 27 years before succeeding his brother as king. This is actually brought out quite prominently in one scene. His portrayal as an arrogant tyrant is debated. The film and musical production were based on Margaret Landon&#x27;s 1944 novel, &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, which was in turn based on Leonowens&#x27; accounts of her experiences. To set the record straight, Thai intellectuals Seni Pramoj and Kukrit Pramoj (brothers) wrote &quot;The King of Siam Speaks&quot; in 1948. ()
* Tuptim&#x27;s torture and execution by burning at the stake is disputed by a great-granddaughter of the King who claimed also to be Tuptim&#x27;s granddaughter. This type of execution was never done in Siam according to former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun.
* Mongkut really did write a letter to Washington offering elephants to be used as stock for breeding American elephants, but the offer was unrelated to the Civil War. His letter, accompanied by some gifts, was addressed to President James Buchanan during the last month of his term, &quot;or to whomsoever the people have elected anew as Chief ruler in place of President Buchanan&quot;. The response, dated almost a year later, came from President Abraham Lincoln, thanking the king for the gifts and good wishes, but declining the elephants on the grounds that the latitude of the U.S. made raising elephants impractical.
* Anna&#x27;s son Louis dies as a child in a riding accident in the film. The historical Louis Leonowens did not die as a child, and in fact outlived his mother.
* In the film, Anna is present at the death of King Mongkut. The historical Anna had been granted a leave of absence for health reasons in 1867 and was in Britain at the time of the King&#x27;s death in 1868; she was not invited to resume her post by the new king.

<text>Nachman HaKohen Krochmal (; born in Brody, Galicia, on 17 February 1785; died at Ternopil on 31 July 1840) was a Jewish Galician philosopher, theologian, and historian.

== Biography ==
Nachman HaKohen Krochmal began studying Talmud at an early age. He married at fourteen as was customary at the time. The girl was the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Habermann. The couple lived with the father-in-law in Zhovkva, near Lemberg, where Krochmal devoted himself to full-time study. He learned German and began to read the German philosophers, especially Immanuel Kant. He also read Latin and French classics, and Arabic and Syriac books. After suffering from health problems, he sought treatment in Lemberg. There he met Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport. He became Rapoport&#x27;s teacher, a collaboration that was ultimately fruitful for &quot;Jewish science&quot; (Wissenschaft des Judentums).

On his return to Żółkiew, he went back to studying philosophy. He delved into the work of Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose ideas influenced him greatly. Aside from Rapoport, who often visited him in Żółkiew, he gathered around him a group of young students.

In 1814, after the death of his wife&#x27;s parents, he went into business. Twelve years later he lost his wife and his health deteriorated. He refused an invitation to the rabbinate of Berlin despite the poor state of his business. Instead he began to work as a bookkeeper in Żółkiew, a position he held from 1836 to 1838. Now seriously ill, he went to stay with his daughter in Tarnopol and died there two years later.

==Literary career==
Krochmal was reluctant to publish his writings. Apart from several Hebrew essays in periodicals (&quot;Sulamith,&quot; 1818; &quot;Ha-Ẓefirah,&quot; Zolkiev, 1824; and &quot;Kerem Ḥemed,&quot; vols. iv., v.), he wrote only one book, &quot;Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman&quot; (Lemberg, 1851), edited, according to the author&#x27;s last will, by Leopold Zunz, whom he admired as a great scholar though they never met. Other editions appeared in Lemberg in 1863 and Warsaw in 1898. The final, now-standard version of the text was established by Simon Rawidowicz in 1924. All later printings are facsimiles of the Rawidowicz edition.

===Moreh Nevukhe ha-Zeman===
&quot;Moreh Nevukhe ha-Zeman&quot; (&quot;Guide for the Perplexed of the Time&quot;) is divided into seventeen chapters, of which the first six deal with religion in general.

Ch. vii describes Israel&#x27;s spiritual gift as the desire for and faculty of seeking God. The next three chapters contain a philosophical analysis of Jewish history, which, corresponding to Israel&#x27;s attachment to the Lord, that is, to its religious development, is divided into three epochs. These epochs terminate respectively: (1) with the death of Gedaliah after the destruction of the Temple; (2) with the death of Bar Kokba (ca. 135); and (3) with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492). The author does not characterize the modern period in which he himself lived.

Ch. xi-xv deal with the post-exilic Biblical and the Apocryphal literature and with the various religious movements. The author discusses also the necessity of tradition and gives a critical &quot;résumé&quot; of the development of the &quot;Halakhah&quot; and &quot;Aggadah&quot;.

Ch. xvi gives a brief sketch of the future development of Jewish religious philosophy based on the principles of Hegel. The work finishes with an exposition of Ibn Ezra&#x27;s philosophy. The historical digressions in the book touch the profoundest problems of Jewish science; and it remains their indisputable merit to have paved the way for critical studies in Jewish history. The work really became, as intended by the author, a &quot;guide&quot; to students of Jewish science in the nineteenth century.

<doc id="594229" wikidata="Q5329389" url="?curid=594229" title="East Side Story (Squeeze album)">
<text>East Side Story is the fourth studio album by new wave group Squeeze. The album peaked at number 19 in the UK Albums Chart, spending 26 weeks in the listing.

The album marked a shift from the new wave sound of their earlier work, as it contained songs influenced by rockabilly, R&amp;B, blue-eyed soul, Merseybeat, and psychedelia among other genres. It also contained Squeeze&#x27;s last top 10 UK single, &quot;Labelled with Love&quot;. It was the first album to feature new keyboardist Paul Carrack, replacing Jools Holland who had departed in early 1981. He sang lead on the track &quot;Tempted&quot;, which became Squeeze&#x27;s first U.S. chart hit. Shortly after the release of this album, Carrack left the band for a solo career, but he returned to Squeeze for a time in the early 1990s, playing and singing on the &quot;Some Fantastic Place&quot; album.

In the UK, &quot;East Side Story&quot; was reissued on CD in 1997 with two album outtakes, as part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Six of One...&quot; box set. The set included the band&#x27;s first six studio albums, all digitally remastered. A year later, each separate CD (including the expanded &quot;East Side Story&quot;) was made available for individual purchase. In 2007, the album was digitally remastered and released in Japan. It contained two extra bonus tracks, both taken from B-sides from the album&#x27;s singles; &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Yap, Yap, Yap&quot;.

==Recording==
The initial concept for the album, proposed by manager Jake Riviera, was for Squeeze to record a double album with one side produced by Elvis Costello, another by Dave Edmunds, a third by Nick Lowe and the fourth by Paul McCartney. Although all producers were willing, the logistical difficulty of assembling the four producers ultimately made the plan impossible. In the end, the album was narrowed down to a single disc and was largely produced by Costello and Roger Bechirian, though Dave Edmunds produced the opening track, &quot;In Quintessence&quot;.

In the studio, Costello, in the line of his longtime producer Nick Lowe, served more as a creative advisor while Bechirian handled the technical aspect of production. Bechirian explained, &quot;Elvis sat there and pontificated a lot about this, that, and the other and I got on with getting the stuff down and rallying the band. I mean, Elvis did have an influence to some extent, but it wasn&#x27;t that great&quot;. Chris Difford spoke glowingly of Costello&#x27;s influence, saying, &quot;I was in complete awe of working with him. It was a great challenge to come in every day with a lyric that would be better than the one he might come up with. ... I could tell which were the weak ones just by looking at his face&quot;. Costello later recorded a version of the album&#x27;s &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Heart&quot; for a yet-to-be-compiled Squeeze tribute album in the 2010s.

The album was halfway completed when John Lennon was assassinated on 8 December 1980. The band were in the studio at the time; Difford recalled, &quot;We went into the studio and a dozen or so musicians just dropped in. We cracked some beers and just played John Lennon songs the whole day. It was highly emotional&quot;.

==Music==
Simru Sonmez-Erbil opined that &quot;East Side Story&quot; was &quot;more blended with their post-punk sound&quot; and that it &quot;demonstrated the band&#x27;s ability to make any musical styling work&quot;. The album saw the band diverging from their traditional new wave sound and integrating elements of progressive rock, psychedelia, rockabilly, soul and Western.

==Reception==
Upon its release, &quot;East Side Story&quot; was praised by contemporary critics in the British music press. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Ian Cranna gave the album a 9 out of 10 rating, praising the songwriting partnership of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook and the musical diversity, and &quot;Record Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Mike Nicholls was similarly impressed, giving it a full five star rating.

In 1989, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; music critics took a look over the albums they had reviewed in the past four years to include in a list based on &quot;commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit.&quot; &quot;East Side Story&quot; was placed at number 2 on the list, only being beaten by &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; went on to note that &quot;songwriters Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook hit their creative peak in 1981, grafting Motown rhythms, country melodies and close harmonies onto a nervy New Wave soundtrack. At once ironic and sentimental, East Side Story is a masterpiece of kitchen-sink drama, from the shattered war bride in &quot;Labelled With Love&quot; to the harried housewife of &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the album as an &quot;exceptionally satisfying pop record&quot;.

Bechirian later said of the album, &quot;I think the sound they got was amazing on that record. I&#x27;m really, really pleased with it. I think it&#x27;s one of the best works that I&#x27;ve been involved with&quot;. Difford named the LP one of the two great albums that Squeeze ever made.

<doc id="594233" wikidata="Q5500257" url="?curid=594233" title="Free lunch">
<text>A free lunch is the providing of a meal at no cost, usually as a sales enticement to attract customers and increase revenues from other business. The practice was once common in saloons and taverns in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing frequently in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the late 1920s. These establishments included a &quot;free&quot; lunch, which varied from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth more than the price of a single drink. The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.

In the United States, the financial hardships of the Great Depression marked the virtual end of the free lunch for reasons of economy and it never really returned. In contemporary times, many taverns and lounges offer free food during Happy Hour, along with low-priced drinks and other menu items. Free or lower priced food and drink is frequently supplied by gambling establishments such as casinos.

The concept of a free lunch is critiqued in the phrase &quot;no such thing as a free lunch&quot;, popularized in part by authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and Milton Friedman.

== History ==
In 1875, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of elaborate free lunches as a &quot;custom peculiar to the Crescent City&quot; (New Orleans): &quot;In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the war ... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way.&quot; As described by this reporter,
A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of classes, and when a man takes up a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either dignified or consequential. In New-Orleans all classes of the people can be seen partaking of these free meals and pushing and scrambling to be helped a second time. [At one saloon] six men were engaged in preparing drinks for the crowd that stood in front of the counter. I noticed that the price charged for every kind of liquor was fifteen cents, punches and cobblers costing no more than a glass of ale.

The repast included &quot;immense dishes of butter&quot;, &quot;large baskets of bread&quot;, &quot;a monster silver boiler filled with a most excellent oyster soup&quot;, &quot;a round of beef that must have weighed at least forty pounds&quot;, &quot;vessels filled with potatoes, stewed mutton, stewed tomatoes, and macaroni &quot;à la Français&quot;&quot;. The proprietor said the patrons included &quot;at least a dozen old fellows who come here every day, take one fifteen cent drink, eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant, and then complain that the beef is tough or the potatoes watery&quot;. ($0.15 in 1875 is ; $1 in 1875 is )

== Fiends ==
The nearly indigent &quot;free lunch fiend&quot; was a recognized social type. An 1872 &quot;New York Times&quot; story about &quot;loafers and free-lunch men&quot; who &quot;toil not, neither do they spin, yet they &#x27;get along&#x27;&quot;, visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers: &quot;Should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed.&quot;

In American saloon bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, bouncers had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon&#x27;s free buffet. To attract business, &quot;... many saloons lured customers with offers of a &quot;free lunch&quot;—usually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon &quot;bouncer&quot; was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites&quot;.

The custom was well-developed in San Francisco. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 California Gold Rush calls the free lunch fiend the &quot;only landmark of the past&quot;. It asks &quot;how do all these idle people live&quot; and asserts: &quot;It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve.&quot; Rudyard Kipling, writing in 1891, noted how he

came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the &quot;free lunch&quot; I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.

A 1919 novel compared a war zone to the free lunch experience by saying &quot;the shells and shrapnels was flyin round and over our heads thicker than hungry bums around a free lunch counter&quot;.

==Free school meals==
==Universal school meals==
== Controversies ==
The temperance movement opposed the free lunch as promoting the consumption of alcohol. An 1874 history of the movement writes:
In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold out the sign &quot;Free Lunch.&quot; Does it mean that some [philanthropist] ... has gone systematically to work setting out tables ... placing about them a score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies ... hiring a band of music? Ah, no! ... there are men who do all this in order to hide the main feature of their peculiar institution. Out of sight is a well-filled bar, which is the centre about which all these other things are made to revolve. All the gathered fascinations and attractions are as so many baits to allure men into the net that is spread for them. Thus consummate art plies the work of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these worse than Moloch shrines.

A number of writers suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer William T. Stead commented that in winter in 1894 the suffering of the poor in need of food
would have been very much greater had it not been for the help given by the labor unions to their members and for an agency which, without pretending to be of much account from a charitable point of view, nevertheless fed more hungry people in Chicago than all the other agencies, religious, charitable, and municipal, put together. I refer to the Free Lunch of the saloons. There are from six to seven thousand saloons in Chicago. In one half of these a free lunch is provided every day of the week.&quot; 
He states that &quot;in many cases the free lunch is really a free lunch&quot;, citing an example of a saloon which did not insist on a drink purchase, although commenting that this saloon was &quot;better than its neighbors&quot;. Stead cites a newspaper&#x27;s estimate that the saloon keepers fed 60,000 people a day and that this represented a contribution of about $18,000 a week toward the relief of the destitute in Chicago.

In 1896, the New York State legislature passed the Raines law which was intended to regulate liquor traffic. Among its many provisions, one forbade the sale of liquor unless accompanied by food; another outlawed the free lunch. In 1897, it was amended to allow free lunches again.

<text>Jane Waddington Wyatt ( ; August 12, 1910 – October 20, 2006) was an American actress. She starred in a number of Hollywood films, such as Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, but is likely best known for her role as homemaker and mother Margaret Anderson on the CBS and NBC television comedy series &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, and as Amanda Grayson, the human mother of Spock on the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Wyatt was a three-time Emmy Award–winner.

==Early life==
Wyatt was born on August 12, 1910, in Campgaw, a neighborhood in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and raised in Manhattan. Her father, Christopher Billopp Wyatt, was a broker. Her mother was Euphemia Van Rensselaer Waddington, granddaughter of Henry Bell Van Rensselaer. Wyatt had two sisters and a brother.

==Education==
While in New York City, Wyatt attended Miss Chapin&#x27;s School, where she had roles as Joan of Arc and as Shylock. She later attended two years of Barnard College. After leaving Barnard, she joined the apprentice school of the Berkshire Playhouse at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where for six months she played a variety of roles.

==Stage and film==
One of her first jobs on Broadway was as understudy to Rose Hobart in a production of &quot;Trade Winds&quot;—a career move that cost her her listing in the New York Social Register (she later was relisted upon her marriage). Receiving favorable notices on Broadway and celebrated for her understated beauty, Wyatt made the transition from stage to screen and was placed under contract by Universal Pictures.

She made her film debut in 1934 in &quot;One More River&quot;. In arguably her most famous film role, she co-starred as Ronald Colman&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest in Frank Capra&#x27;s Columbia Pictures film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937). She reflected on &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; sixty years later in &quot;St. Anthony Messenger&quot; magazine:
During the war, they cut out all the pacifist parts of the film—the High Lama talking about peace in the world. All that was cut because they were trying to inspire those G.I.&#x27;s to get out there and go &quot;bang! bang! bang!&quot; which sort of ruined the film.
Other film appearances included &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; with Gregory Peck, &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; with Cary Grant, &quot;Boomerang&quot; with Dana Andrews, and &quot;Our Very Own&quot; with Farley Granger. Wyatt co-starred in the crime dramas &quot;Pitfall&quot; and &quot;House by the River&quot;, and with Randolph Scott in a Western, &quot;Canadian Pacific&quot;. She played the wife of Gary Cooper in the war story &quot;Task Force&quot;.

Her film career suffered due to her outspoken opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy, the chief figure in the anti-Communist investigations of that era, and was temporarily derailed for having assisted in hosting a performance by the Bolshoi Ballet during the Second World War, though it was at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Wyatt returned to her roots on the New York stage for a time and appeared in such plays as Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Autumn Garden&quot;, opposite Fredric March.

==Television==
For many people, Wyatt is best remembered as Margaret Anderson on &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, which aired from 1954 to 1960. She played opposite Robert Young as the devoted wife and mother of the Anderson family in the small town of Springfield. This role won consecutive Emmy Awards for her in 1958, 1959 and 1960 for best actress in a comedy series. After &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, Wyatt guest-starred in several other series.
On June 13, 1962, she was cast as the lead in &quot;The Heather Mahoney Story&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. In 1963, she portrayed Kitty McMullen in &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Say Goodbye&quot; on the ABC drama &quot;Going My Way&quot;, with Gene Kelly and Leo G. Carroll, a series about the Catholic priesthood in New York City. In 1964 Wyatt appeared as Mrs. Sarah Brynmar on &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode &quot;The Secret of Brynmar Hall&quot;. In 1965, Wyatt was cast as Anne White in &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw – A Retelling&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.
Wyatt portrayed Amanda Grayson, Spock&#x27;s mother and Ambassador Sarek&#x27;s (Mark Lenard) wife, in the 1967 episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; of the original NBC series &quot;Star Trek&quot; (credited as Miss Jane Wyatt), and the 1986 film &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. Wyatt was once quoted as saying her fan mail for these two appearances in this role exceeded that of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;.

In 1969, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;, but did not have any scenes with Mark Lenard, who was starring on the show as sawmill owner Aaron Stemple. Also in 1969, Wyatt appeared as a concerned mother in the first episode of the ABC comedy anthology series &quot;Love, American Style&quot; in a segment titled &quot;Love and the Pill.&quot;

In 1970, Wyatt guest-starred in the episode &quot;Wedding Day?????&quot; (the five question marks being part of the title) in the second season of the TV sitcom &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;, which played on ABC (the first season having played on NBC). She portrayed Emily Williams, the mother of Mrs. Muir.

In 1976, she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Gibbsville&quot;, and she appeared as Anna, mother of the Virgin Mary, in the 1978 television film &quot;The Nativity&quot;. Late in her career, she appeared in a recurring role in the 1980s medical drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, as Katherine Auschlander, wife of hospital administrator Dr. Daniel Auschlander (Norman Lloyd).

==Personal life==
Wyatt was married to investment broker Edgar Bethune Ward from November 9, 1935, until his death on November 8, 2000. The couple met in the late 1920s when both were weekend houseguests of Franklin D. Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York. they had three children.

Ward later converted to the Catholic faith of his wife. Wyatt suffered a mild stroke in the 1990s but recovered well. She remained in relatively good health for the rest of her long life.

==Death==
Wyatt died on October 20, 2006, at her home in Bel-Air, California, aged 96. Wyatt&#x27;s family included three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

<doc id="594239" wikidata="Q3082475" url="?curid=594239" title="Frank (Squeeze album)">
<text>Frank is a studio album by new wave group Squeeze, released in 1989. The album sold poorly, and Squeeze was dropped by A&amp;M Records while on tour. Forced to take offers from different major labels for the first time in their career, the band soon signed with Reprise Records and began working on their next studio album, &quot;Play&quot;.

&quot;Frank&quot; peaked at number 58 in the UK Albums Chart. It peaked at No. 113 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== Style ==
Susan Whitall of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; described &quot;Frank&quot; as having a &quot;typically Squeezian diversity of songs&quot;. The album was described as post-punk.

==Production==
&quot;Frank&quot; was recorded live in the studio with producer Eric &quot;E.T.&quot; Thorngren.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album the band&#x27;s best since &quot;Argybargy&quot;, writing: &quot;Relocating its original magic with memorably inventive material and spirited delivery, Squeeze here seems exuberantly youthful, as if music-making had suddenly become fun again.&quot; &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; wrote that Squeeze went &quot;for a live garagey sound that finally gives [Gilson] Lavis&#x27; powerhouse drumming center-stage placement.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; called the album &quot;well-crafted&quot; but &quot;only occasionally involving.&quot;

<doc id="594240" wikidata="Q1334550" url="?curid=594240" title="Kate &amp; Leopold">
<text>Kate &amp; Leopold is a 2001 American romantic comedy science fiction film that tells a story of a physicist by the name of Stuart (Liev Schreiber), who accidentally pulls his great‑great‑grandfather, Leopold (Hugh Jackman), through a time portal from 19th‑century New York to the present, where Leopold and Stuart&#x27;s ex‑girlfriend, Kate (Meg Ryan), fall in love with each other.

== Plot ==
On 28 April 1876, Leopold is the orphaned and impoverished 3rd Duke of Albany, living in New York City with his uncle, Millard Mountbatten, under the care of the butler by the name of Otis. Conversant with the arts and sciences, he has designed and modelled a prototype Otis elevator, but Uncle Millard exhorts him to return to reality and marry a wealthy American heiress.

While sketching the Brooklyn Bridge during a public meeting dedicated to the completion of its Manhattan tower, Leopold notices Stuart Besser taking photographs with an anachronistically small camera. Stuart is an amateur physicist (and a great‑great‑grandson of Leopold) from 21st‑century New York, who has discovered the existence of gravitational time portals. At the evening ball, during which Leopold is to announce his bride-to-be, he sees Stuart photographing design sketches in the duke&#x27;s study. Chasing Stuart, he tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only for both to fall into the time portal.

Leopold regains consciousness on a Wednesday morning in the year 2001 in Stuart&#x27;s apartment at 88 White Street, Manhattan. Stuart explains that the portal will reopen on the next Monday, until which time Leopold should stay in Stuart&#x27;s apartment. While taking his dog out, Stuart is injured by falling into the empty elevator shaft and, after ranting about his scientific discovery in the hospital, is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. According to Stuart&#x27;s concept, Leopold&#x27;s time travel to the 21st century has caused a widespread &quot;occlusion&quot; of elevators, and may cause the disappearance of Stuart himself if Leopold does not go back to 1876 on Monday.

Leopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart&#x27;s ex-girlfriend who lives downstairs. He says that she produces the impression of a &quot;career woman&quot; and, upon learning that she works in market research, ironically remarks, &quot;Mm. A fine avocation for women, research. Perfect for the feminine mind.&quot; (Later on, Kate&#x27;s boss tells her the same thing: &quot;You skew male. You&#x27;re like a man. A man who understands women—their desires, their needs. You understand them, but you&#x27;re not really one of them.&quot;) Kate shrugs it off and demands that Leopold take Stuart&#x27;s dog for a walk. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie—Kate&#x27;s brother and an aspiring actor, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character.

On Thursday morning, Kate becomes impressed by Leopold&#x27;s eloquent exposition of how important the tastiness of food is to the quality of human life. She takes him to an audition for a TV commercial pitching a fat-free butter, Farmer&#x27;s Bounty, produced by the English company Jansen Foods, which is being taken over by Kate&#x27;s company, Camden Research Group. After the successful audition, Kate and Leopold stop by a horse-drawn tourist carriage to hail a taxi, at which moment a thief snatches Kate&#x27;s briefcase and flees into Central Park. Seeing Kate run after the purse-snatcher, Leopold borrows one of the horses and hurries to help her. , he drives the thief into an impasse and forces him to drop the briefcase. Bedazzled by the sight of Leopold riding on a white horse to her rescue, Kate begins to admit that his 19th century dukedom may be &quot;for real&quot;.

On Friday, Leopold hires a violinist and invites Kate to a rooftop dinner, which ends with a waltz and the first kiss.

On Saturday, they stroll about Lower Manhattan and come across Uncle Millard&#x27;s home at 1 Hanover Square, where Leopold retrieves a metal box with his boyhood treasures, including his mother&#x27;s ring, from a drawer hidden in his room&#x27;s wall. In the evening, he tries to propose to Kate, but she falls asleep on his lap.

On Sunday, Leopold acts in a Farmer&#x27;s Bounty commercial, but walks off the set upon finding the diet margarine disgusting. Leopold chastises Kate about integrity, to which she counters that he lacks connection with reality. Realizing that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation.

On Monday morning, Stuart escapes from the asylum and sends Leopold to his own time, which makes the elevators work again. Charlie notices Kate in a photo taken at Leopold&#x27;s ball on 28 April 1876, and shows the picture to Stuart, who realizes that Kate&#x27;s future is in the past. That night, when Kate is about to accept her promotion at the Anglo-American merger meeting held, to her surprise, at 1 Hanover Square, Stuart and Charlie tell her that in order to be with Leopold she has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes. Kate rejects their suggestion as absurd and goes to give her acceptance speech, during which she sees herself, wearing the same evening dress, in one of Stuart&#x27;s photos. Her speech falters to a musing and terminates with an apology for having to leave, at which point the three of them rush to the bridge.

Having made it through the portal, Kate appears in 1876 and runs to 1 Hanover Square, where the Anglo-American engagement is to take place. Just when Leopold is about to announce his bride of convenience, Kate storms into the ballroom, and he instead announces her name, styled as &quot;Kate McKay, of the McKays of Massapequa&quot;. Among the shocked guests, Kate and Leopold reunite with a kiss and dance a bridal waltz. Thus Kate turns out to be Stuart&#x27;s great‑great‑grandmother.

== Cast ==
== Alternative versions ==
References suggesting that Kate is Stuart&#x27;s great-great-grandmother were censored from the film just a few days before the theatrical release—according to director James Mangold, due to &quot;2 critics who were horrified by Liev Schreiber&#x27;s distant relationship to Leo&quot;. Those two critics were Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper. The previous four-year relationship of Stuart and Kate is classified as illegally incestuous in many jurisdictions, because she is his lineal ancestor (see &quot;Legality of incest#Table&quot;).

The following scenes were excised:
*References suggesting that Kate has a genetic relationship to Stuart.
*A scene where Ryan appears in the background of a 19th-century party.
*A cameo by director James Mangold, where he plays a director whose film is being changed to meet the demands of a test screening.

The director&#x27;s cut, lasting 123 minutes, was released on DVD (Region 4) on 29 January 2003, and on Blu-ray (Region A) on 10 April 2012. The theatrical cut, lasting 118 minutes, exists only on DVD, first released on 11 June 2002.

== Music ==
The soundtrack to &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; was released on December 25, 2001.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on reviews from 133 critics, and an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Though Hugh Jackman charms, &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; is bland and predictable, and the time travel scenario lacks logic.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 based on 27 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Meg Ryan does this sort of thing about as well as it can possibly be done, and after &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, here is another ingenious plot that teases us with the possibility that true love will fail, while winking that, of course, it will prevail.&quot;
Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;comfort food for bruised romantics&quot;.

Lael Loewenstein of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;A time-travel romantic comedy whose best elements—Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman—overcome distracting plot holes, loose threads and assorted contrivances to make for a mostly charming and diverting tale.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
Hugh Jackman was nominated in 2001 for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for the song &quot;Until...&quot;, written and performed by Sting. The same song was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Sting performed the song during the ceremony.

<doc id="594242" wikidata="Q731832" url="?curid=594242" title="Paykan">
<text>The Paykan ( meaning &quot;Arrow&quot;) is the first Iranian-made car produced by Iran Khodro, between 1967 and 2005. The car, formerly called &quot;Iran National&quot;, is a licensed version of the British Rootes Arrow (Hillman Hunter) and was very popular in Iran from its introduction until its discontinuation.

The Paykan spawned some locally developed variants, most notably a pickup named Bardo and having a different body shell from the one sold elsewhere.

==History==

The design was introduced to Iran by Mahmoud Khayami, co-founder and, by then, owner of the Iran Khodro (formerly called &quot;Iran National&quot;) company and factory, who accurately predicted that Iran was in need of a simple &quot;no-frills&quot; motorcar within the price range of ordinary people.

The car itself originated in 1966 as the &quot;Arrow&quot; series of vehicles (the most prolific version of which was badged as the Hillman Hunter); designed and manufactured by the Rootes Group, which was the British wing of Chrysler Europe. In 1967, Rootes began exporting Hillman Hunters to Iran Khodro in &quot;complete knock down&quot; (CKD) kit form, for assembly in Iran. By the mid-1970s, full-scale manufacturing of the car (minus the engine) had started in Iran.

In 1977, Roy Axe designed a new Paykan facelift model using many interior and exterior parts from the Chrysler Alpine.

In 1978, PSA Peugeot Citroën purchased the ailing Chrysler Europe after Chrysler exited the European market; and with it acquired the rights to the Hillman Hunter/Arrow design. A year later, Peugeot ended Hillman Hunter production in Ireland. Following this, the Paykan&#x27;s engine production tooling was moved to Iran and was in full-scale manufacturing under Peugeot licence. This ended in 2005 with the final Paykan leaving the assembly line.

Iran Khodro tried to replace Paykan with a so-called &quot;New Paykan&quot; but Peugeot did not agree with the naming. This revealed the fact that the intellectual ownership of the Paykan brand and logo still belongs to PSA Peugeot Citroën, as a legacy of Rootes Group.

==Design==
Although the Paykan was based on a 1966 Hillman Hunter, there were many changes and modifications made to it over the years – notably the substitution of the original 1725cc Rootes engine with a Peugeot 504-derived unit. The modifications to the exterior included revised headlights and taillights. A Paykan Pickup was also offered. There was another pickup truck based on the Hillman Hunter sold in South Africa – the Dodge Husky – but the two models used different bodies. The South African version has a thicker B-pillar and retains the saloon&#x27;s lines along the side panels. The tailgate and rear window are also subtly different.

The Iranian government reportedly offered Iran Khodro a large cash incentive to end Paykan production by 2005, labelling the car as an environmental hazard because of its unacceptably high fuel consumption. During its last years, the order backlog was nearly two years long.

The Samand, commonly referred to as the &quot;New Paykan&quot;, is currently being produced by Iran Khodro as a modern substitute for the Paykan class of cars. In 2005, Iran Khodro announced that it had sold the discontinued Paykan&#x27;s motorcar production line to the Khartoum Transport Company in Sudan, while car-parts production for the Paykan still continues by third-party manufacturers in Iran.

== Legacy ==

Despite the vehicle being fully discontinued in 2015, the Paykan still left its mark on the Iranian automotive industry. The Peugeot ROA, which is still offered, shares the Paykan chassis, although its bodyshell is from Peugeot 405. A similar vehicle based on the Paykan chassis is also produced under the IKCO Arisun name, although it is stylistically based on Peugeot 405.

The PaykanArtCar art project, started in 2021, use a Paykan as a &quot;canvas&quot;.

<doc id="594244" wikidata="Q7655766" url="?curid=594244" title="Sweets from a Stranger">
<text>Sweets from a Stranger is the fifth studio album by the British new wave group Squeeze, released April 30, 1982 through A&amp;M. The album peaked at number 20 in the UK Albums Chart. The band split up soon after a world tour for the record, and the two main songwriters went on to record 1984&#x27;s &quot;Difford &amp; Tilbrook&quot;. Squeeze reunited and released &quot;Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti&quot; in 1985. As with all Squeeze albums, Chris Difford wrote the words first and Glenn Tilbrook would write the music afterwards often editing Difford&#x27;s material to create a streamlined narrative. Tilbrook would record a demo afterwards and play it for Difford.

== Background and recording ==

&quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot; was recorded during a period of tumult for the band, with tensions exacerbated by the band&#x27;s continued touring and the pressures on the Difford–Tilbrook songwriting team from being compared to Lennon–McCartney. Tilbrook explained, &quot;The band was not in a happy place on the year from &quot;East Side Story&quot; to &quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot;. There were some great songs on &quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot;, but the band itself did not feel great; there was dark cloud above us. It was just hard work being on the road then, and it was an odd time. Really, when you&#x27;re having that sort of success, no manager is going to say, &#x27;You need to stop for a while.&#x27; And no one did, so we had to.&quot;

Paul Carrack had left the band to work on his solo career and work as a studio musician. He was replaced by Don Snow. Snow would later appear with Procol Harum and Tina Turner on their respective albums and tours. Snow would later change his name to Jonn Savannah.

Within a year after the release of this album, Squeeze broke up. Difford and Tilbrook carried on releasing an album under both of their names before reforming Squeeze with the band&#x27;s original drummer Gilson Lavis and keyboardist Jools Holland. Keith Wilkinson who had toured with Difford and Tilbrook replaced John Bentley for the reunion album &quot;Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti&quot;.

In 1997, the CD was released in the UK with two bonus tracks, as part of the &quot;Six of One...&quot; box set. The set included the band&#x27;s first six studio albums, each digitally remastered. These CDs were made available for individual purchase in 1998.

A 2008 reissue included the two 1997 bonus tracks, and added a further seven tracks.

== Music ==
Detailing the stylistic direction of &quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that Squeeze &quot;wound up largely ditching the pop classicism of &quot;East Side Story&quot; for a gangly new wave experimentalism&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Returned&quot; has been likened to Bruce Springsteen in sound, while Erlewine detailed &quot;Onto the Dance Floor&quot; to be &quot;wannabe Bowie&quot;.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;I&#x27;ve Returned&quot; &quot;soars on the strength of ringing guitars and an exuberant Tilbrook vocal.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed and predominantly critical summary of &quot;Sweets from a Stranger&quot;. Despite noting &quot;connections&quot; to the band&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;East Side Story&quot; and speaking positively of songs including &quot;I&#x27;ve Returned&quot; and the &quot;sublime&quot; peak &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;, Erlewine wrote-off much of the effort as &quot;new wave clatter&quot;.

=== Artist&#x27;s reflection ===
In retrospect both composers were critical of the album stating feeling that the songwriting and the production weren&#x27;t up to par compared to what they did before. The American edition of the album featured praise for Difford and Tilbrook songs which both felt created additional pressure to create a classic with every single song. Difford commented &quot;You just write to please yourself first of all...if other people like it, that&#x27;s a bonus.&quot;

<doc id="594252" wikidata="Q981953" url="?curid=594252" title="Gregorio Aglipay">
<text>Gregorio Aglipay Cruz y Labayán (; Filipino: &quot;Gregorio Labayan Aglipay Cruz&quot;; pronounced ; May 5, 1860 – September 1, 1940) was a Filipino former Roman Catholic priest and revolutionary during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine–American War who became the first head and leader of the &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; (IFI), the first-ever wholly Filipino-led independent Christian Church in the Philippines in the form of a nationalist church.

Known for inciting patriotic rebellion among the Filipino clergy during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine–American War, he was also a political activist who became acquainted with writer and labor leader Isabelo de los Reyes who would then start an independent Christian Filipino Church colloquially named after Aglipay in 1902 as a revolt against the Roman Catholic Church, which was the state religion of the Philippines at the time, due to the mistreatment of the Spanish friars towards the Filipinos. Contrary to popular belief, Aglipay did not join the IFI until one month from its proclamation by de los Reyes and the &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática&quot;.

Aglipay was previously excommunicated by Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda y Villa of Manila in May 1899, upon the expressed permission of Pope Leo XIII, due to his involvement in revolutionary activities, despite his prior intercession and defense of some of the Spanish Roman Catholic clergy from liberal-nationalist Filipino revolutionaries. The Roman Catholic Church made attempts to bring Aglipay back to their fold, but failed. Aglipay joined Freemasonry in May 1918, a society excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church. Aglipay married Pilar Jamias y Ver from Sarrat, Ilocos Norte in 1939 and then died one year later. Followers of Aglipay through the Church are sometimes colloquially referred to by their membership as &quot;Aglipayans&quot;.

==Early life, studies and priesthood==

Born in Batac, Ilocos Norte on May 5 and baptized on May 9, 1860 in the Roman Catholic Church, Aglipay personally preferred May 8 as the celebration for his date of birth. He was the third child of Pedro Aglipay y Cruz and Victoriana Labayán y Hilario and became an orphan at a young age who grew up in the care of relatives at the tobacco fields in the last volatile decades of the Spanish occupation in the Philippines. He bore deep grievances against the colonial Spanish government of the islands, stemming from abuses within the agricultural system. Arrested at age fourteen for failing to meet his quota as a tobacco-picking worker for a Spanish tobacco grower, he later moved to the country&#x27;s capital of Manila in 1876 to study law under the tutelage of lawyer and private school owner Julian Carpio, with the financial help of his uncle Francisco del Amor Romas who was a employee of the Dominican Sisters School of Santa Catalina.

After two years of study under Carpio, Aglipay continued his studies at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in 1878 for his third year as a working student, and later at the University of Santo Tomas in 1880 for his fourth year wherein he was an academic topnotcher. During his time in Santo Tomas, Aglipay met José Rizal, a senior medical student who used to be his fencing partner, and a newly-transferred Isabelo de los Reyes who also came from Letran. Aglipay obtained his pre-law Bachelor of Arts degree at Santo Tomas in 1881 and subsequently enrolled in law and theology in 1882, still at Santo Tomas. He then discontinued his law and theology studies at Santo Tomas and entered the Roman Catholic seminary in Vigan, Ilocos Sur in 1883 at age 23, as previously influenced by Rizal. He was ordained to the priesthood six years later on December 21, 1889, on the Feast of St. Thomas the Apostle, at the old Dominican Church in Intramuros, Manila and celebrated his first mass as an ordained Roman Catholic priest on January 1, 1890 at Santa Cruz Church, Manila. 

Aglipay then began a career as an assistant priest to Spanish friars in various parishes around the main northern island of Luzon, notably in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia. He later dropped Cruz in his surname and while serving in Victoria, Tarlac, Aglipay discreetly gave aid to the revolutionaries and employed thirty carpenters who in reality were revolutionists in touch with the Katipunan group. Aglipay then organized the said revolutionists and called their group &quot;Liwanag&quot; (&quot;Light&quot;), a local auxiliary of the Katipunan based in Victoria, Tarlac.

==Philippine Revolution==
In 1896, a secret society, Katipunan, led by the Supremo, Andrés Bonifacio, was discovered by Spanish authorities. With Roman Catholicism as the state religion, Manila Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda tasked Aglipay to confront the revolutionary leaders, offering them a level of autonomy in the future for the Philippines if they would end the rebellion. General Emilio Aguinaldo, in turn, sent Colonel Luciano San Miguel to Aglipay with the intention of getting him to join the rebellion. Aguinaldo convinced Aglipay, who appointed him as military chaplain (&quot;capellán castrense&quot;) of the revolutionary government sometime in May or June 1898, the first ever to be appointed as such in the Philippine Revolution.
Aglipay also later became a member of the Malolos Congress, the lone member coming from the religious sector, although he also represented his home province of Ilocos Norte, as well. On October 20, 1898, Aguinaldo elevated Aglipay to the post of Military Vicar General (&quot;Vicario General Castrense&quot;) of the revolutionaries, a position that made him head of all military chaplains in the revolution. In the course of Aglipay&#x27;s journey to the north, the Philippine–American War started at the conclusion of the Spanish–American War. Aglipay interpreted his appointment as Vicar General as making him Ecclesiastical Superior to all native Filipino priests, who as such should all be appointed military chaplains for the duration of the war.

==Philippine–American War==

When Aglipay returned to Manila and discovered that the Americans had attacked, he joined the revolution. The fighting that broke out between the U.S. and Filipino forces on February 4, 1899, prompted Aglipay to withdraw to Ilocos Norte to organize an armed resistance and was given the rank of lieutenant-general. He eventually formed the guerrilla group &quot;Sandataan&quot;. Aglipay was summoned to Manila by Manila Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda but did not appear, which resulted in Nozaleda excommunicating Aglipay on April 29, 1899 for &quot;usurpation of ecclesiastical jurisdiction&quot; upon the expressed permission of Pope Leo XIII, and the sentence of excommunication was exposed from May 4 to June 5 in the archiepiscopal tribunal of Manila.

Aglipay was one of the last generals to surrender to the Americans. Realizing the futility of the cause for which they had been fighting, on April 28, 1901, a month after the capture of Aguinaldo, he surrendered to Captain Edward Mann Lewis of the 20th U.S. Regular Infantry in Laoag, to prevent further casualties from his men as he saw less chances of winning from the much dominant American troops. After his surrender, he later moved back to the already-American-occupied Manila and worked at a reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church. The Americans officially ended the war on July 2, 1902, and granted full amnesty to all persons in the Philippines who had participated in the conflict.

==After the war==
Following the end of the war in 1902, writer-activist Isabelo de los Reyes was working towards the formation of a nationalist church that is independent of Rome. Spanish friars were still in control of the parishes all throughout the country at the time of the American occupation. On August 3, de los Reyes and his labor group &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática&quot; proclaimed the establishment of the church and suggested that Aglipay be its first head bishop. Aglipay, a Catholic at the time even after he had been excommunicated, was reluctant as he was initially against a schism, but eventually accepted de los Reyes&#x27; offer to head an independent church on September 6, 1902, and was appointed as the first Supreme Bishop or &quot;Obispo Máximo&quot; of the &quot;Philippine Independent Church&quot; (officially &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot;, abbreviated as IFI and also referred as the &quot;Aglipayan Church&quot; after him). The church retained many of the Roman Catholic forms of worship.

According to renowned historian Teodoro Agoncillo, Aglipay finally decided to join the new church after his talks with Francisco Foradada, a Spaniard Jesuit priest and author, backfired. Knowing that Aglipay was influential with the Filipino clergy, the Jesuits assigned Foradada in a desperate attempt to persuade Aglipay from returning to the Roman Catholic fold in order to further prevent the schism from succeeding. In a meeting held at the Jesuit House in Santa Ana, Manila, Aglipay was allegedly offered to be appointed bishop or archbishop with a large sum of money thrown in if he would return. Aglipay would have sign a document of confession to the Roman Catholic Church but on condition of assurance that by signing the document, the issues of the native Filipino Catholic priests would be solved, and that the Filipino clergy would be appointed to the posts formerly held by the Spanish regulars. Foradada responded by tactlessly asking Aglipay &quot;why would he care about Filipino priests since the world knows that they are vicious and hopelessly inefficient.&quot; It was believed that Aglipay felt insulted by Foradada&#x27;s brash comments that he angrily lunged at him and held him by the nape demanding to withdraw his remarks as Foradada, terrified, fell on his knees. Witnesses of the reported incident include León María Guerrero and Joaquin Luna. Subsequently, Aglipay reputedly walked out from the meeting and threw away the document. 

Although he had already decided to join the new church after his first failed conference with the Jesuits, Aglipay was still disinclined to accept the supreme bishop post. He even met with American Protestant leaders and tried to persuade them to assist and join them in their new church in order &quot;to divide the ranks of the [Roman] Catholics.&quot; Aglipay also suggested that Filipino priests would be appointed to higher ranks on the clergy of the new church. The American Protestants declined Aglipay&#x27;s proposal as they found the new church &quot;too Roman in its ritual&quot; and &quot;too rationalistic in its theology.&quot; They were also seemingly adamant on having Filipino church leaders at the time as they were likely &quot;enjoying the feeling of superiority.&quot; 

In a final attempt, the Jesuits tried to negotiate again with Aglipay years after he joined the new church and accepted the supreme bishop post through a more diplomatic Spanish Father Joaquin Villalonga. Pope Pius X had approved to grant Aglipay pardon if the new church went back to the Roman Catholic fold, but Aglipay was already persistent to continue the Iglesia Filipina Independiente.

Aglipay celebrated his first mass as the &quot;de facto&quot; Supreme Bishop on October 26, 1902. On January 18, 1903, Aglipay was consecrated to the position of Supreme Bishop, held in Manila, by the IFI Church&#x27;s then-Bishops of Isabela, Cagayan, Pangasinan, Abra, Nueva Ecija, Cavite, and Manila. As Supreme Bishop, he allied himself with the nationalist and most political parties during his time, like the Sakdalistas, and later on, even with the Socialist and Communist parties.

During the theological discussions he attended while visiting other churches on his travels abroad, Aglipay later rejected the belief in the Trinity and became theologically accepting of the main Unitarian belief, however, a significant number from his own Church refused to accept his amended theology. Aglipay&#x27;s unitarian, rationalist, and progressive theological ideas were evident in his &quot;novena&quot;, the &quot;Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak&quot;, 1925 and its English translation, &quot;Novenary of the Motherland&quot;, 1926.

Aglipay was awarded Doctor of Divinity (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) by the Meadville Theological School in Chicago, Illinois in 1931.

==Later life and legacy==
Despite being a Christian leader, Aglipay, like other Filipino revolutionaries, later joined Freemasonry. Spanish Masonic Grand Master Miguel Morayta personally pushed Aglipay to Freemasonry. In May 1918, Aglipay obliged and was inducted at Magdalo Lodge 31 in Cavite. In 1925, Aglipay rose to the 32nd degree, one degree short of the highest Masonic rank.

Aglipay ran for elections in 1935 as President of the Commonwealth under the Republican Party, the first nationwide at-large election ever held in the Philippines (per the Tydings–McDuffie Act). He was the last presidential candidate to announce his candidacy, along with Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas&#x27; candidate Norberto Nabong as his running mate in a joint Republican-Communist Party ticket, but both lost to Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña of the Nacionalista Party, respectively. Aglipay was the first ever religious leader to run for presidency in the history of the Philippines. He sent a congratulatory message to Quezon three days after the election when the results became apparent and quickly accepted defeat.

Since his Church permits married clergy, Aglipay married then 64-year-old Pilar Jamias y Ver, a teacher from Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, in 1939 at the IFI Tondo Cathedral officiated by bishop Fernando Buyser; but he died the following year on September 1, 1940 due to natural causes (cerebral hemorrhage), aged 80. Then-President Manuel L. Quezon, his cabinet, and most of the highest state officials came to pay their respects in a funeral service for Aglipay. 

Although he had for many years opposed celibacy among the priesthood, Aglipay himself was not married until the age of 79. Aglipay and Jamias begot a daughter twenty six years before their marriage, named Liwliwa, born on February 24, 1913. She served as Philippine secretary of the Rationalist Society of London and secretary to Aglipay in translating English letters for his contacts abroad. She studied at the University of the Philippines. Liwliwa died on February 17, 1938, seven days before her 25th birthday or thirteen months before the marriage of Aglipay and Jamias. She was buried in the Pasay Municipal Cemetery.

Also referred to as &quot;Apo Aglipay&quot; by his followers, Aglipay held the position of Supreme Bishop until his death. His remains are interred at the Cathedral of Saint Mary, Aglipay National Shrine in Batac, Ilocos Norte.

Aglipay was on trial calendars in The Episcopal Church&#x27;s calendar of saints in the years 2009 and 2015 but the aforementioned calendars were never made official and his feast is not part of current proposals.

The City of Batac, Ilocos Norte annually celebrates the 1st day of September as a special non-working holiday to commemorate the death anniversary of Aglipay, known as the &quot;Gregorio L. Aglipay Day&quot;, which was enacted on February 10, 1989, as per Republic Act No. 6701.

<text>The rufous-bellied eagle or rufous-bellied hawk-eagle (Lophotriorchis kienerii) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae that is found in the forested regions of tropical Asia. Relatively small for eagles and contrastingly patterned like a falcon, this species was earlier placed in the genus &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; and sometimes also in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; but thought to be distinctive enough to belong to a separate genus.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

This eagle was originally described as &quot;Astur kienerii&quot; on the basis of a specimen from the Himalayas. It was later moved to &quot;Limnaetus&quot; by Jerdon, the genus &quot;Lophotriorchis&quot; and still later to &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, the so-called &quot;hawk-eagles&quot;. A study of the phylogeny of some &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; species and other eagles indicated that they were nested within the &quot;Aquila&quot; clade of eagles, resulting in their repositioning. Another molecular study of the eagles suggested that &quot;kienerii&quot; was distinctive enough to be retained in a separate genus for which the name &quot;Kienastur&quot; had been suggested but as this occurred in a thesis it is invalid for taxonomic purposes, and in any case &quot;Lophotriorchis&quot; was proposed much earlier (though originally shared with the Black-and-chestnut eagle which is nowadays placed in &quot;Spizaetus&quot;).

Within its wide range, two subspecies are recognized although there is no marked plumage difference. The nominate &quot;kienerii&quot; of India and Sri Lanka (the northern birds are larger); and &quot;formosus&quot; described by Erwin Stresemann in 1924 which is widely distributed across Southeast Asia from Burma to Sulawesi.

The species name was given by Count Louis Ernest Gustave de Sparre (1802-1866) and honours the French naturalist Louis Charles Kiener (1799-1881).

==Description==
Adult rufous-bellied eagles are distinctive in their pattern. They have a black hood with a short crest. Chestnut underparts and wing coverts contrast with the white on the throat and breast. The sexes are almost indistinguishable in plumage but females are slightly larger and have more black on the face. They perch in a very upright stance and the wingtip almost reaches the tail. The tarsus is fully feathered. Juveniles have very white underparts with dark markings on the sides of the body, head mask and edge of underwing coverts. They can appear similar to a booted eagle (&quot;Aquila pennata&quot;). In flight, the underwing lining is dark and the greater coverts are black. The flight feathers are thinly barred with a black edge. The tail is dark and barred.

==Distribution and habitat==

The rufous-bellied eagle is found in southern and south-eastern Asia and its range also extends to Sulawesi.

This species is associated mainly with hill forests. In India, they are commoner in the Western Ghats than along the Himalayas where they occur from Nepal to Assam. They also occur in parts of the Eastern Ghats.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Rufous-bellied eagles are usually seen in flight, soaring high over the forest canopy. They dive to capture prey that can include birds and mammals in the air, canopy, or forest floor. Birds the size of the Sri Lanka wood pigeon, Kalij pheasant and junglefowl have been recorded as prey. The breeding season of the eagles is in winter with the young fledging in spring when the prey species are also breeding. The display flight involves stooping and wing-quivering. Their calls include a series of high pitched &quot;fwick, fwick...&quot; notes followed by a thin &quot;sweek!&quot;. They nest on a large, often bare tree, building a large platform of dry sticks and branches that they break off. The nest is lined with green leaves and a single egg is laid. Both parents take turns in incubation, feeding and nest defence.

<text>Walkabout is a 1971 adventure survival film directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Jenny Agutter, Luc Roeg, and David Gulpilil. Edward Bond wrote the screenplay, which is loosely based on the 1959 novel by James Vance Marshall. It centres on two white schoolchildren who are left to fend for themselves in the Australian Outback and who come across a teenage Aboriginal boy who helps them to survive.

Roeg&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;Walkabout&quot; was released internationally by 20th Century Fox, and was one of the first films in the Australian New Wave cinema movement. Alongside &quot;Wake in Fright&quot;, it was one of two Australian films entered in competition for the Grand Prix du Festival at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. It was subsequently released in the United States in July 1971, and in Australia in December 1971.

In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the &quot;50 films you should see by the age of 14&quot;.

== Plot ==
A teenage girl and her younger brother live with their parents in a modest high rise apartment in Sydney. One day their father drives them into the Outback, still in their school uniforms, ostensibly for a picnic. As they prepare to eat, the father draws a gun and fires at the children. The boy believes it to be a game, but the daughter realises her father is attempting to murder them, and flees with her brother, seeking shelter behind rocks. She watches as her father sets their car on fire and shoots himself in the head. The girl conceals the suicide from her brother, retrieves some of the picnic food, and leads him away from the scene, attempting to walk home through the desert.

By the middle of the next day, they are weak and the boy can barely walk. Discovering an oasis with a small water hole and a fruit tree, they spend the day playing, bathing, and resting. By the next morning, the water has dried up. They are then discovered by an Aboriginal boy. He does not speak English, much to the girl&#x27;s frustration, but her brother mimes their need for water and the newcomer cheerfully shows them how to draw it from the drying bed of the oasis. The three travel together, with the Aboriginal boy sharing kangaroo meat he has caught from hunting. The boys learn to communicate to some extent using words from each other&#x27;s languages and gestures; the girl makes no such attempts.

While in the vicinity of a plantation, a white woman walks past the Aboriginal boy, who simply ignores her when she speaks to him. She appears to see the other children, but they do not see her, and they continue on their journey. The children also discover a weather balloon belonging to a nearby research team working in the desert. After drawing markings of a modern-style house, the Aboriginal boy eventually leads them to an abandoned farm, and takes the small boy to a nearby road. The Aboriginal boy hunts down a water buffalo and is wrestling it to the ground when two white hunters appear in a truck and nearly run him over. He watches in shock as they wantonly shoot several buffalo with a rifle. The boy then returns to the farm, but passes by without speaking.

Later, the Aboriginal boy lies in a trance among a slew of buffalo bones, having painted himself in ceremonial markings. He returns to the farmhouse, catching the undressing girl by surprise, and initiates a courtship ritual, performing a dance in front of her. Although he dances outside all day and into the night until he becomes exhausted, she is frightened and hides from him, and tells her brother they will leave him the next day. In the morning, after they dress in their school uniforms, the brother takes her to the Aboriginal boy&#x27;s body, hanging in a tree. Showing little emotion, the girl wipes ants from the dead boy&#x27;s chest. Hiking up the road, the siblings find a nearly-deserted mining town where a surly employee directs them towards nearby accommodation.

Years later, a man arrives home from work as the now adult girl prepares dinner. While he embraces her and relates office gossip, she either imagines or remembers a time in which she, her brother, and the Aboriginal boy are playing and swimming naked in a billabong in the Outback.

==Cast==

None of the characters are named.

==Themes==
Roeg described the film in 1998 as &quot;a simple story about life and being alive, not covered with sophistry but addressing the most basic human themes; birth, death, mutability&quot;.

Agutter regards the film as multilayered, in one regard being a story about children lost in the Outback finding their way, and, in the other, an allegorical tale about modern society and the loss of innocence. The Australian filmmaker Louis Nowra noted that biblical imagery runs throughout the film; in one scene there is a cut to a subliminal flashback of the father&#x27;s suicide, but the scene plays in reverse and the father rises up as if he has been &quot;resurrected&quot;. Many writers have also drawn a direct parallel between the depiction of the Outback and the Garden of Eden, with Nowra observing that this went as far as to include &quot;portents of a snake slithering across the bare branches of the tree&quot; above Agutter&#x27;s character as she sleeps.

Gregory Stephens, an associate professor of English, sees the film framed as a typical &quot;back to Eden&quot; story, including common motifs from 1960s counterculture; he offers the skinny-dipping sequence as an example of a &quot;symbolic shedding of the clothes of the over-civilized world&quot;. By way of the girl&#x27;s rejection of the Aboriginal boy and his subsequent death the film paints the Outback as &quot;an Eden that can only ever be lost&quot;. Agutter shares a similar interpretation, noting, &quot;We cannot go back and have that Garden of Eden. We cannot go back and make it innocent again.&quot; She considers the ages of the two adolescents, who are on the cusp of adulthood and losing their childhood innocence, as a metaphor for the irreversible change wrought by Western civilisation.

== Production ==
The film was the second feature directed by Nicolas Roeg, a British filmmaker. He had long planned to make a film of the novel &quot;Walkabout&quot;, in which the children are Americans stranded by a plane crash. After the indigenous boy finds and leads them to safety, he dies of influenza contracted from them, as he has not been immunised. Roeg approached the English playwright Edward Bond about writing the script, who handed in fourteen pages of handwritten notes. Roeg was impressed, and Bond expanded his treatment into a 63-page screenplay. Roeg then obtained backing from two American businessmen, Max Raab and Si Litvinoff, who incorporated a company in Australia and sold the distribution rights to 20th Century Fox.

Filming began in Sydney in August 1969 and later moved to Alice Springs, and Roeg&#x27;s son, Luc, played the younger boy in the film. Roeg brought an outsider&#x27;s eye and interpretation to the Australian setting, and improvised greatly during filming. He commented, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really plan anything—we just came across things by chance…filming whatever we found.&quot; The film is an example of Roeg&#x27;s well-defined directorial style, characterised by strong visual composition from his experience as a cinematographer, combined with extensive cross-cutting and the juxtaposition of events, location, or environments to build his themes. The music was composed and conducted by John Barry, and produced by Phil Ramone, and the poem read at the end of the film is &quot;Poem 40&quot; from A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;.
About her nude swimming scene, Jenny Agutter said, &quot;Nic wanted the scene in which I swam naked to be straightforward. He wanted me to be uninhibited – which I wasn&#x27;t. I was a very inhibited young woman. I didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable about the intention of the scene, but that doesn&#x27;t make you feel any better. There was no one around, apart from Nic in the distance with his camera. No lights, nothing. Once he&#x27;d got the shot, I got out of the water and dressed as quickly as possible.&quot; Agutter has stated she does not regret filming the scenes, but regrets how they have been taken out of context and uploaded to the internet by &quot;perverts&quot;.

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) surmised Agutter was seventeen years old at the time of filming (she was actually sixteen when filming began in July 1969), and therefore the scenes did not pose a problem when submitted to the BBFC in 1971 and later in 1998. The Protection of Children Act 1978 prohibited distribution and possession of indecent images of people under the age of sixteen so the issue of potential indecency had not been considered on previous occasions. However, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 raised the age threshold to eighteen which meant the BBFC was required to consider the scenes of nudity in the context of the new law when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes and considered them not to be indecent and passed the film uncut.

The film features several scenes of animal hunting and killing, such as a kangaroo being speared and bludgeoned to death. The Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937 makes it illegal in the United Kingdom to distribute or exhibit material where the production involved inflicting pain or terror on an animal. Since the animals did not appear to suffer or be in distress the film was deemed not to contravene the Act.

== Reception ==
&quot;Walkabout&quot; fared poorly at the box office in Australia. Critics debated whether it could be considered an Australian film, and whether it was an embrace of or a reaction to the country&#x27;s cultural and natural context. In the US, the film was originally rated R by the MPAA due to nudity, but was reduced to a GP-rating (PG) on appeal.

Critic Roger Ebert called it &quot;one of the great films&quot;. He writes that it contains little moral or emotional judgement of its characters, and ultimately is a portrait of isolation in proximity. At the time, he stated: &quot;Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That&#x27;s what the film&#x27;s surface suggests, but I think it&#x27;s about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication.&quot; Film critic Edward Guthmann also notes the strong use of exotic natural images, calling them a &quot;chorus of lizards&quot;. In &quot;Walkabout&quot;, an analysis of the film, author Louis Nowra wrote: &quot;I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting.&quot; Writer and filmmaker Alex Garland characterised the film as &quot;virtuoso filmmaking&quot;.

More than 50 years after its release, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 42 critics and judged 86 per cent of the reviews to be positive, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10. In the 2012 BFI survey of the world&#x27;s greatest films, &quot;Walkabout&quot; featured in four critics&#x27; and four directors&#x27; choices of their favourite films.

<doc id="594262" wikidata="Q3246907" url="?curid=594262" title="Strontium Dog">
<text>Strontium Dog is a long-running British comics series starring Johnny Alpha, a mutant bounty hunter who lives in Earth&#x27;s future. The series was created in 1978 by writer John Wagner (under the pseudonym T. B. Grover) and artist Carlos Ezquerra for &quot;Starlord&quot;, a short-lived weekly science fiction comic. When &quot;Starlord&quot; was cancelled, the series transferred to the British science fiction weekly &quot;2000 AD&quot;. In 1980, Wagner was joined by co-writer Alan Grant, although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series by himself from 1988 to 1990. Wagner revived the series after a ten-year hiatus in 2000. After Ezquerra&#x27;s death in October 2018, the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation (other than some single-episode stories in special issues aimed at younger readers).

The series takes place in an imagined future after the Great Nuclear War of 2150. Due to nuclear fallout of strontium-90, humanity has an increased number of mutant births, most of whom have physical abnormalities but some of whom possess superhuman abilities. John Kreelman is born with white blank eyes and a mutant &quot;alpha radiation&quot; power that grants him greater perception, allowing telepathy and the ability to see through many surfaces. Facing discrimination, John Kreelman adopts the name &quot;Johnny Alpha&quot; and becomes a bounty hunter for the Search/Destroy Agency. Due to the origin of their mutation and their S/D badges, mutant bounty hunters are nicknamed &quot;strontium dogs.&quot; A formidable bounty hunter, Johnny Alpha uses not only his mutant abilities in combat but also an array of high-tech gadgets and weapons.

&quot;Strontium Dog&quot; stories are often known for a bleak, minimalistic edge at times reminiscent of spaghetti westerns. Several stories veer into satire and overtly bizarre science fantasy. Johnny Alpha&#x27;s adventures sometimes involve time travel (such as a mission to 1945 where he attempts to apprehend Adolf Hitler) or alternate dimension (including one that seems to be Hell). On several occasions, Johnny Alpha&#x27;s time travel adventures to periods before the Great Nuclear War have featured him crossing paths with another &quot;2000 AD&quot; character Judge Dredd.

==Series background==
In the world of &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wipes out 70% of Britain&#x27;s population, leading to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout (strontium-90). The mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the usual depiction of mutants in American comics, such as those published by Marvel, in that they are generally afflicted with obvious physical abnormalities. Only a rare few are born with superhuman powers. These strontium-influenced mutants face a high degree of prejudice from average humans (&quot;norms&quot;). Born in 2150 to Diana Kreelman and her husband Nelson Bunker Kreelman, the boy Johnny Kreelman has mutant eyes that can increase his perception by channeling &quot;alpha radiation&quot;, allowing telepathy and telekinesis, as well as the ability to see through most surfaces. A bigoted politician, Nelson gains popularity by drafting anti-mutant laws and creating the anti-mutant police force known as the Kreelers. Despised, abused, and hidden away by his father, Johnny Kreelman escapes his parents at a young age and adopts the name Johnny Alpha. He then joins the rising resistance group known as the Mutant Army and quickly becomes a valued leader, despite still being a teenager.

The Mutant Uprising of 2167 fails to overthrow the government. Despite this, Johnny Alpha blackmails his own father Nelson Kreelman, leading to the man&#x27;s resignation and the disbanding of the Kreelers (though many members simply transfer into the local police force). Members of the Mutant Army are pardoned for their actions only on condition that they leave Earth forever. An orbital space-station is built and becomes the headquarters of the new Search/Destroy Agency, an organization that accepts contracts to hunt down criminals and threats deemed too dangerous for conventional law enforcement and &quot;norms.&quot; The former Mutant Army members become galactic bounty hunters for the S/D Agency. Due to their &quot;S/D&quot; badges and the origins of their mutations, these bounty hunters are nicknamed &quot;strontium dogs&quot; by Earth people. This also leads the S/D orbital base to be nicknamed the Doghouse.

On Earth, new laws protect mutants from being hunted and targeted for extermination. However, they still face great prejudice from society and are segregating into ghettos, such as a large mutant settlement at Milton Keynes. In the cities of Earth, mutants have limited working opportunities and cannot own their own businesses. Several mutants succumb to societal pressures and poverty, while others join the S/D Agency as new bounty hunters. By 2180, Johnny Alpha is one of the most famous strontium dog bounty hunters.

===Earth===

Earth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain – Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than &quot;Judge Dredd&#x27;s&quot; Brit-Cit by the same writers, but contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include Salisbury (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch &amp; Bournemouth (now a combined conurbation), Cardiff, Isles of Scilly, and Winchester. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. In the sequel series &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot;, it was stated that Britain had a large empire of outer-space colonies.

The mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Stories like &quot;Traitor To His Kind&quot; reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter), make attempts to slowly improve the mutants&#x27; situation, but much of this goes unnoticed by the public. Many other figures in the government prefer to regress toward greater oppression or even attempted extermination of the mutant population.

Ireland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the United States of America and Canada were both visited in &quot;The Mork Whisperer&quot; (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic was shown in &quot;The Final Solution&quot;. Antarctica was the setting of part of &quot;Outlaw&quot;, shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre was Antarctic City (also the name of a megacity in &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic Militia.

In &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, the government is usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; story had it that after the destruction of the New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. &quot;Crossroads&quot;, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six &quot;minor wars&quot;, and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot; ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government.

===Dating===
The first &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; stories in &quot;Starlord&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot; were said to be set in the year 2180. During the &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; series published in &quot;2000 AD&quot;, in-story events progressed were indicated as occurring in real time to publication. The story &quot;Max Bubba&quot; was published five years after the first Strontium Dog story and gave the date 2185 for its events. Similarly, the main &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; stories progress in parallel to the real time publication dates. Exceptions to this are some stories appearing in annual issues and summer specials that indicate they are revisiting earlier points of Johnny Alpha&#x27;s life.

Despite this, there have been some dating discrepancies in the &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; series. The stories &quot;The No-Go Job&quot; and &quot;The Final Solution&quot; present a date of 2180 but are said to take place two years after the events in &quot;Max Bubba.&quot; Likewise, the story &quot;Judgement Day&quot; gives the date 2178 even though it is set after the events in &quot;Max Bubba.&quot;

==Johnny Alpha==
&quot;Strontium Dog&quot; stories focus on John Alpha, whose mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. Born in 2150, he is the son of Diana Kreelman and her husband Nelson Bunker Kreelman. Nelson is a bigoted politician who drafts the anti-mutant laws and gains power on the back of bigotry, creating the anti-mutant police force known as the Kreelers. Despised, abused and hidden away by his father, Johnny escapes at a young age and joins the Mutant Army, changing his name from Kreelman to Alpha and deciding to keep his father&#x27;s identity secret. Johnny becomes one of the Mutant Army&#x27;s key leaders, playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167 when he is only 17.

By the time he joins the Search/Destroy agency, Johnny Alpha is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter, adept at combining his mutant powers with hand-to-hand combat and weaponry. A sarcastic, cynical man, he none the less believes that innocent life must be protected or avenged, even if the odds are against you. Deeply loyal to friends, he can also be short on patience and quick to anger if plans go wrong or situations continue to worsen, but often this motivates him to improvise new solutions rather than simply stew in anger. A dogged bounty hunter determined to earn reward for his work, Johnny is also guided by a moral conscience. He will not give up pursuing a target if the job becomes difficult, but he might if he learns the target is a victim of greater evil. If he believes the cause is great enough, he may forego payment or decide not to accept it. In &quot;The Doc Quince Case&quot;, learning new information convinces him to no longer pursue a man he&#x27;s been hunting but instead to rescue and help the person. In &quot;The Slavers of Drule&quot;, Johnny tracks down a group of slavers simply because he believes it is the right thing to do. Despite his morality, Johnny is not above vengeance for himself or those he considers family. A device he used on his own father caused Nelson Kreelman to be locked in a time-loop where he continuously relived his final moments, begging for his life.

Johnny has a &quot;norm&quot; sister called Ruth, who has a husband named Nigel and a daughter named Marci. Ruth and her family remain friendly to Johnny, even helping him blackmail Nelson Kreelman during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. But during an early comic book adventure, Marci is abducted and almost killed by a criminal looking for revenge on Johnny. After this, Ruth forbids him from coming near her family again, only making contact with him afterward when she deems it absolutely necessary.

Nelson Kreelman had an affair, resulting in a half-brother to Johnny named Nelson Culliver. After the war, Culliver becomes head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In &quot;Traitor to His Kind&quot;, Culliver tries to have Alpha murdered, but is exposed and fired. Alpha decides to assassinate him, but relents on meeting his children.

During the course of his career as a Strontium Dog, Johnny Alpha becomes a formidable legend and even a hero to some. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing Adolf Hitler to the future to face trial. He becomes known for generously assisting mutants in trouble, such as when he donates a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in &quot;Mutie&#x27;s Luck&quot;.

At times, Alpha has encountered another &quot;2000 AD&quot; character, Judge Dredd, by journeying into the past via time travel, but it is ambiguous whether Johnny Alpha&#x27;s future world is the fate of Dredd&#x27;s timeline or one of several possibilities.

===Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities===

Like all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology. His usual equipment includes a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified brass knuckles, a short-range teleporter, a &quot;time drogue&quot; that can briefly &quot;rewind&quot; the last few minutes of time in the immediate area, and &quot;time bombs&quot; which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved in its orbit, causing the victim to reappear in empty space).

Johnny Alpha has white, incandescent eyes and multiple mutant abilities. Most frequently, high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people&#x27;s minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents, or to &quot;suggest&quot; illusions into their perceptions. Alpha has used this to save his life several times - in the stories &quot;Judgement Day&quot; and &quot;Rage&quot;, Alpha made Sabbat the Necromagus and Max Bubba respectively believe that there were people behind them, distracting each long enough for Alpha to strike them.

===Supporting cast===

Johnny&#x27;s original partner is Wulf Sternhammer, who is not a mutant but a normal human from Scandinavia; he became a Strontium Dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy &quot;safe for decent people&quot;. A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf was far less prone to doubt and introspection and tried to bring his friend back in line when he had doubts. Ever since &quot;Starlord&quot; #5, Wulf wore the fur pelt of a Gronk that he&#x27;d befriended - the alien&#x27;s custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acted a lot like a stereotypical Viking and it was eventually retconned that he was a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time.

Early strips included the Gronk, the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It was a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist Blas Gallego). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its &quot;poor heartses&quot;, and in &quot;Outlaw&quot; showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that &quot;the Gronk&quot; was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for &quot;the Gronk&quot;. In the &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier.

King Clarkie the Second, a thinly veiled parody of Prince Charles was the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning.

Two allies who gained their own solo spin-off series were Middenface McNulty, a Scottish mutant raised in a ghetto/concentration camp called &#x27;Shytehill&#x27; - presumably a reference to the Sighthill area of Glasgow - and whose head is covered with lumps; and Durham Red, a female agent whose mutation resembles vampirism and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants.

Feral, introduced in &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, was a young, savage mutant. He initially despised the Strontium Dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but was inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnessed Alpha&#x27;s sacrifice in &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, and in the original &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; strips of the 1990s, he became first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot;, this was ignored and he became a SD Agent soon after &quot;The Final Solution&quot; – due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and became an outlaw who tried to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he was executed for murder on an alien world.

In both the original series and the revival Alpha frequently encountered or worked alongside members of a mutant family known as the Stix Clan. All members male and female are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from a single town called Stixville on the planet Freedonia and are highly hostile to any outsiders. They often appear as antagonist to Alpha but at times have worked alongside him, however they usually double cross and betray him at some point showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan.

The revival would introduce Negus, the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who would both hire Johnny and act as his Upminster contact. Negus was pushing for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus&#x27; position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate.

Flashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny&#x27;s life would introduce Precious Matson, a reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia. A competent and dogged reporter, she became friends with Johnny and helped him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In &quot;Life and Death&quot;, she began investigating the true events of Johnny&#x27;s death and, with McNulty&#x27;s aid, was able to resurrect him.

In 2018 &quot;The Son&quot; revealed that Wulf had had a son, Kenton Sternhammer, who joined the Search/Destroy Agency.

==Major stories==

===Original run===

&quot;Portrait of a Mutant&quot;, a flashback story in 1981, filled in the background of the series and Johnny&#x27;s role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army&#x27;s leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny&#x27;s sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman&#x27;s son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending &quot;Portrait&quot;, Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever.

In the story &quot;Outlaw&quot;, Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot.

In the 1986 story &quot;Max Bubba&quot;, a lengthy story explaining Wulf&#x27;s origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic &quot;Rage&quot;, in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner&#x27;s killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with Durham Red or Scottish mutant Middenface McNulty.

Johnny was killed off in 1990, sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman&#x27;s illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny&#x27;s final adventures were illustrated by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil. John Wagner later admitted in &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;&#x27;s Thrill Power Overload feature on the history of the comic that &quot;killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I&#x27;m doing my best to rectify.&quot; He later described it as &quot;one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.&quot;

===Post-death and &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot;===

The medium of time travel allowed him to make further appearances. In the 1991 &quot;Judge Dredd Annual&quot; John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew &quot;Top Dogs&quot;, in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping Judge Dredd. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in 1992 in the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, written by Garth Ennis and drawn mainly by Ezquerra.

The supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; in the 1990s, written by Garth Ennis and Peter Hogan. It was criticised by Ennis in the book &quot;Thrill Power Overload&quot; as being anticlimactic and that the lead, Feral, &quot;was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny&quot;. The series was scrapped when David Bishop became &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s editor. The first story, &#x27;&quot;Monster&quot; starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort &quot;liberation&quot; taxes from mutants (an allegory for The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Ennis&#x27; home).

Ennis would bring back the Gronk in &#x27;&quot;Return of the Gronk&quot;, turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who had killed Alpha in &quot;The Darkest Star&#x27;&quot;. In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed – including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives – including, at his friend&#x27;s request, Alpha himself, who couldn&#x27;t live on in such excruciating pain.

From &quot;2000 AD&quot; # 897, Peter Hogan became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to &quot;clean their dirty laundry for them&quot;.

Durham Red was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later Dan Abnett. This series continued after &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; was cancelled.

===Revival===

In the &quot;Prog 2000&quot; holiday special, published at the end of 1999, Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny&#x27;s death.

The first story, &quot;The Kreeler Conspiracy&quot;, was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were &#x27;folklore&#x27; and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run.

A subsequent story in 2004, &quot;Traitor To His Kind&quot; (progs 1406–1415), introduced Johnny&#x27;s half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King&#x27;s murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind.

The 2009 story &quot;Blood Moon&quot; retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi&#x27;s bombing and executed him there.

===&quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot;===

In prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&#x27;&quot;, which took place following &quot;The Final Solution&quot;. The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny&#x27;s death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the &quot;true&quot; story of what happened, and diverged from &quot;The Final Solution&quot; when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny&#x27;s body had been brought &quot;back&quot; by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind). Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be &quot;apologists and mutie-lovers&quot;, ignoring &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot;.

Middenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny&#x27;s death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life – but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live – the story ended with Johnny returning to life.

The story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction.

After the conclusion of &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot;, the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In &quot;The Son&quot; (2018) a new character, Wulf Sternhammer&#x27;s son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent. This was the last &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; story to be illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra, who died later that year, and the last in the series to be written by John Wagner (as of July 2022). Other writers and artists have produced one-episode stories since, but no multi-part stories.

==Hiatus==
Since the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of &quot;2000AD&quot;, Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development. A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 &quot;Villains Takeover Special&quot;. In 2020 a one-episode story about Johnny Alpha as a child appeared in prog 2183, by Michael Carroll and Nick Brokenshire.

==Crossover stories==
Johnny Alpha has also appeared in three &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd&#x27;s era. The first was &#x27;&quot;Top Dogs&quot;, written by John Wagner, which appeared in the &quot;Judge Dredd Annual 1991&quot; (published in 1990). The second was &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, a 20-episode story written by Garth Ennis, which appeared in both &quot;2000 AD&quot; and in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; in 1992. The third was &quot;By Private Contract&quot; in issue 2000 of &quot;2000 AD&quot; in September 2016, also written by Wagner.

He also stars with Judge Dredd in the Big Finish audio book &quot;Pre-Emptive Revenge&quot;, in their attempt to stop a nuclear dirty bomb from launching while trying to reach safety after a successful co-operative mission.

==Publication==
In 1987, Titan Books produced the first collected volume of Strontium Dog stories and others have appeared piecemeal over the years. Starting in 2007, Rebellion Developments released a complete run of collected Strontium Dog stories as the &quot;Search/Destroy Agency Files&quot;.
In 2008 Rebellion also began reprinting the new series of stories. Most of the post-&quot;Final Solution&quot; &quot;Strontium Dogs&quot; stories were collected in softback collections bagged with issues of the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;.

All material from &quot;Max Quirxx&quot; to &quot;Journey into Hell&quot; written by John Wagner and illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra unless otherwise stated. All stories thereafter written by John Wagner and Alan Grant writing in partnership unless otherwise stated.

==In other media==

===Fan film===
A fan film, &quot;Search/Destroy&quot;, premiered at 2000 AD&#x27;s 40 Years of Thrill-Power Festival, on February the 11th 2017. John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra both praised the film, which received 3 1/2 to 5 star reviews from several Sci-Fi and comic related outlets.

===Computer games===
In 1984, a computer game called &quot;Strontium Dog: The Killing&quot; was released by Quicksilva for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. In the game, (based on the storyline &quot;The Killing&quot; from progs 350–359,) Alpha has to rid the galaxy of all the &#x27;vicious murderers&#x27; by roaming through a maze of corridors and rooms killing the murderers with his gun. The game was of extremely poor quality, with reviews of the period deriding it for poor graphics, a lack of playability and for being extremely boring.

The same year, Quicksilva released &quot;Strontium Dog: The Death Gauntlet&quot;, a side-scrolling shoot-em-up for the Commodore 64.

===Board game===

In 2018 Warlord Games released tabletop skirmish game called &quot;Strontium Dog Miniatures Game&quot;.

===Novels===

In 2003, Black Flame started publishing official &quot;2000 AD&quot; novels, including five featuring Strontium Dog. These were:

* &quot;Bad Timing&quot; (Rebecca Levene, June 2004 )
* &quot;Prophet Margin&quot; (Simon Spurrier, December 2004 )
* &quot;Ruthless&quot; (Jonathan Clements, April 2005 )
* &quot;Day of the Dogs&quot; (Andrew Cartmel, July 2005 )
* &quot;A Fistful of Strontium&quot; (Jaspre Bark and Steve Lyons, October 2005 )

===Audio dramas===
In recent years, Big Finish Productions have released a number of audio dramas with &quot;2000 AD&quot; characters. These have mostly featured Judge Dredd, but three have starred Strontium Dog. In these Judge Dredd and Wulf Sternhammer are played by Toby Longworth and Johnny Alpha is played by Simon Pegg. The current list of Strontium Dog plays includes:

* 3. &quot;Strontium Dog: Down to Earth&quot; by Jonathan Clements
* 10. &quot;Strontium Dog: Fire from Heaven&quot; by Jonathan Clements
* 16. &quot;Judge Dredd: Pre-Emptive Revenge&quot; by Jonathan Clements (taking place in the immediate aftermath of the &quot;Judge Dredd/Strontium Dog&quot; crossover story &quot;Judgement Day&quot;)

===Film===
In the opening scene of the 2012 film &quot;Dredd&quot;, one of the &quot;mega blocks&quot; of Mega-City One is named &quot;Sternhammer&quot;.

===Fanzines===
&quot;Dogbreath&quot; is an unofficial small press comic produced by fans of the series.

==In popular culture==

In an episode of TV sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;, an angry Mike tells his friend Tim to remember &quot;whose shoulder you cried on&quot; when Johnny Alpha was killed in &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Tim&#x27;s actor and &quot;Spaced&quot; co-author Simon Pegg later went on to play Johnny Alpha in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; audio plays.

<text>Eliphalet Remington (October 28, 1793 – August 12, 1861) was an American engineer who founded what would become known as Remington Arms. Originally the company was known as &quot;E. Remington&quot; followed by &quot;E. Remington &amp; Son&quot; and then &quot;E. Remington and Sons&quot;.

==Early years==

Eliphalet Remington II was born in 1793 in the town of Suffield, Connecticut. He was the second child of four surviving children (but the only son) of Elizabeth (née Kilbourn) and Eliphalet Remington, whose family origins lay in Yorkshire, England. He was a cousin of the western artist Frederic Remington. 

Eliphalet II followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and entered the blacksmith trade at the family&#x27;s rural forge in Herkimer County, New York. The original family home at Kinne Corners, New York, built about 1810 and known as Remington House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

==Remington Company co-founder==

The younger Remington worked with his father in the forge, and at 23 he hand-made a flintlock rifle using a firing mechanism bought from a gunsmith, but constructing the barrel himself.

The rifle received such a response that Remington decided to manufacture it in quantity. By 1840, when his three sons began to take a more active role in the family business, he formed the firm of E. Remington and Sons, which he headed until his death in 1861.

The company continued to grow and to develop its product and gradually began the manufacture of other sporting goods, such as bicycles. The company operated as Remington Arms until its bankruptcy in 2020.

==Personal life==
Remington married Abigail Paddock (1790–1841), and together they had five children: Philo, Eliphalet III, Samuel, Mary Ann and Naria. He donated substantial sums of money to then newly established Syracuse University.

In August 1861, Remington was diagnosed with &quot;inflammation of the bowels&quot;. He would die shortly after on August 12, 1861.

<doc id="594265" wikidata="Q1764693" url="?curid=594265" title="Robert Dudley (explorer)">
<text>Sir Robert Dudley (7 August 1574 – 6 September 1649) was an English explorer and cartographer. In 1594, he led an expedition to the West Indies, of which he wrote an account. The illegitimate son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, he inherited the bulk of the Earl&#x27;s estate in accordance with his father&#x27;s will, including Kenilworth Castle. In 1603–1605, he tried unsuccessfully to establish his legitimacy in court. After that he left England forever, finding a new existence in the service of the grand dukes of Tuscany. There, he worked as an engineer and shipbuilder, and designed and published &quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot; (1645–1646), the first maritime atlas to cover the whole world. He was also a skilled navigator and mathematician. In Italy, he styled himself &quot;Earl of Warwick and Leicester&quot;, as well as &quot;Duke of Northumberland&quot;, a title recognized by Emperor Ferdinand II.

==Early life==
Robert Dudley was the son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his lover Douglas Sheffield, daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. He grew up in the houses of his father and his father&#x27;s friends, but had leave to see his mother whenever she wished. His mother married Sir Edward Stafford in November 1579, and then left for Paris. Leicester was fond of his son and often made trips to see him. Dudley was given an excellent education and was enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1587, with the status of &quot;filius comitis&quot; (&quot;Earl&#x27;s son&quot;). There, his mentor was Thomas Chaloner, who also became his close friend. In 1588, when the Spanish Armada threatened England, the 14-year-old Robert joined his father, who was commanding the army at Tilbury Camp, preparing to resist a Spanish invasion, but on 4 September, the Earl of Leicester died. His will gave Dudley a large inheritance, including the castle and estate at Kenilworth, and on the death of his uncle, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk.

In early 1591, Dudley was contracted to marry Frances Vavasour with the consent of Queen Elizabeth I, who liked Dudley very much but wished him to wait until he was older. Later that year, Vavasour secretly married another man and was banished from court. In turn, the 17-year-old Dudley married Margaret, a sister of Sir Thomas Cavendish, in whose last voyage he had probably invested. Dudley was excluded from court for this secret marriage, but only for a few days. Margaret was given two ships by her father Robert, named the &quot;Leicester&quot; and the &quot;Roebuck&quot;. She soon died childless.

==Expeditions==
In 1594, Dudley assembled a fleet of ships, including his flagship, the galleon &quot;Beare&quot;, as well as the &quot;Beare&#x27;s Whelpe&quot;, and the pinnaces &quot;Earwig&quot; and &quot;Frisking&quot;. He intended to use them to harass the Spaniards in the Atlantic. The Queen did not approve of his plans, because of his inexperience and the value of the ships. She did commission him as a general but insisted that he sail to Guiana, instead.

Dudley recruited 275 veteran sailors, including the navigator Abraham Kendal, and the captains Thomas Jobson and Benjamin Wood. Dudley&#x27;s fleet sailed on 6 November 1594, but a sudden storm separated the ships and drove the vessels back to different ports. Dudley sent word to the captain of the &quot;Beare&#x27;s Whelp&quot; to join him in the Canary Islands or Cabo Blanco, and he sailed again.

At first, Dudley&#x27;s trip proved unlucky: the &quot;Earwig&quot; sank, and most of the vessels he encountered were friendly. Dudley led only one raid in the Gulf of Lagos.

In December, the expedition finally managed to capture two Spanish ships at Tenerife. Dudley renamed them &quot;Intent&quot; and &quot;Regard&quot;, manned them with his sailors, and put Captain Woods in charge. He sailed to Cabo Blanco, expecting to meet the &quot;Beare&#x27;s Whelpe&quot; there, but it did not show up. Dudley&#x27;s fleet sailed to Trinidad and anchored at Cedros Bay on 31 January 1595. There, he discovered an island that he claimed for the English crown and named &quot;Dudleiana&quot;. Then he sailed to Paracoa Bay for repairs and made a reconnaissance to San José de Oruña, but decided not to attack it.

Dudley divided his forces, sending the &quot;Intent&quot; and &quot;Regard&quot; to the north. In Trinidad, he recruited a Spanish-speaking Indian who promised to escort an expedition to a gold mine up the Orinoco River. The expedition, led by Captain Jobson, returned after two weeks; as it turned out, their guide had deserted them, and they had struggled back. Dudley returned to Trinidad.

On 12 March, Dudley&#x27;s fleet sailed north, where it finally captured a Spanish merchantman. It then sailed on to Cabo Rojo, in Puerto Rico, waited for suitable prey for some time, and then sailed towards Bermuda. A storm blew the &quot;Beare&quot; north to near what is now New England before the fleet finally reached the Azores. Low on provisions and working guns, Dudley sailed for home, but he met a Spanish man-of-war on the way. He managed to outmanoeuvre and cripple it in a two-day battle, but decided not to board it. The &quot;Beare&quot; arrived at St Ives in Cornwall at the end of May 1595, and Dudley heard that Captain Woods had taken three ships.

The next year, 1596, Dudley joined Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to serve as commander of the &quot;Nonpareil&quot; in an expedition against Cádiz. He was later knighted for his conduct in the Capture of Cádiz, although what he did is not recorded. Shortly afterwards he married Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh.

In 1597, Dudley sent Captain Wood on a trading voyage to China with the &quot;Beare&quot;, the &quot;Beare&#x27;s Whelp&quot; and the &quot;Benjamin&quot;, but they never returned.

==Claiming legitimacy==
Dudley claimed to have been told in May 1603, by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury, that his parents had been secretly married. He began trying to establish his claim to the peerages of Earl of Leicester and Earl of Warwick, as well as to the property of his deceased uncle Ambrose Dudley, including Ambrose&#x27;s Warwick Castle estates. The case came before the Star Chamber in 1604–1605 and aroused great public interest. Ninety witnesses appeared for Dudley and 57 for the widowed Countess of Leicester, Lettice Knollys. Dudley persuaded, and perhaps pressured, his mother to support his cause. She declared in writing (she did not attend the trial in person) that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, Westminster, in 1571, and that they were married at Esher, Surrey, &quot;in wintertime&quot; in 1573. Yet all of the 10 putative witnesses (&quot;besides others&quot;) to the ceremony were long since dead. Neither could she remember who the &quot;minister&quot; was, nor the exact date of the marriage. The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Drury, who in his turn had sought &quot;his own private gains&quot;. King James I ratified the judgement, and it was handed down on 10 May 1605. In 1621, an official investigation in Tuscany, Dudley&#x27;s new country, concluded that Dudley&#x27;s &quot;friends maintain that his father married Lady Sheffield, but they are unable to account for her marriage during his lifetime, an act so injurious to the alleged legitimacy of her son.&quot;

==In Italy==
Dudley left England in July 1605, by Calais. His lover and cousin Elizabeth Southwell accompanied him, disguised as a page. She was a daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and Lady Elizabeth Howard, who was a granddaughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Dudley&#x27;s uncle. The couple declared that they had converted to Catholicism.

Dudley married Elizabeth Southwell in Lyon in 1606, after they had received a papal dispensation because they were blood relatives, and they first settled in Florence. In English law, this marriage was bigamous as he was still married to Lady Alice (a marriage not recognised by the Pope as it had taken place in the Church of England). He began to use his father&#x27;s title of Earl of Leicester and his uncle&#x27;s title of Earl of Warwick.

Dudley designed and built warships for the arsenal of Livorno and became a naval advisor to Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medici family. He received an annuity of 2,000 ducats. In 1608, Dudley convinced the Duke to send the privateer galleon &quot;Santa Lucia Buonaventura&quot; to Guiana and northern Brazil in the only tentative Italian colonization in the Americas, known as the Thornton expedition.

===Attempts at reconciliation===
James I revoked Dudley&#x27;s travel licence in 1607. When he ordered Dudley to return home to provide for his deserted wife and family, Dudley refused. He was then declared an outlaw, and his estate was confiscated. He continued contacts with the English court through Sir Thomas Chaloner, who was now a chamberlain to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. He corresponded with the young Prince on the subjects of navigation and shipbuilding, and in 1611 tried to broker a marriage between him and Caterina, daughter of Duke Ferdinand. Meanwhile, Henry Frederick had taken a fancy to Kenilworth Castle, calling it &quot;the most noble and magnificent thing in the midland parts of this realm&quot;. Wanting it, he was willing to buy it from Dudley and agreed in 1611 to pay £14,500, with Dudley to hold the office of constable of the castle for his lifetime. When Henry died in 1612, only £3,000 had been paid, and it is unclear whether Dudley ever received it. The new Prince of Wales, Charles, then took possession of the castle but failed to pay the balance owing. In 1621, he got an Act of Parliament allowing Dudley&#x27;s wife to sell the estate to him for £4,000.
In 1618, James I granted the Earldoms of Leicester and Warwick to others (respectively Lord Lisle and Lord Rich). In 1620, Dudley convinced Grand Duchess Maria Magdalena, wife of the new duke Cosimo II, to ask her brother, the Emperor Ferdinand II, to recognize his claim to his grandfather&#x27;s title of Duke of Northumberland. Dudley succeeded on 9 March 1620, and James I severed all negotiations for conciliation.

===Later years===
In addition to shipbuilding, Dudley was busy with many projects in Tuscany, including the Livorno&#x27;s breakwater and harbour fortifications, draining local swamps, and building a palace in the heart of Florence. He also designed new galleys, and he wrote his memoirs of navigation and seamanship between 1610 and 1620. Later, Dudley incorporated his notes into six volumes of &quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot; (&quot;The Secret of the Sea&quot;), self-published in 1646–1647. He also wrote a &quot;Maritime Directory&quot; as a manual for the Tuscan Navy but it was never published. In 1631, his wife Elizabeth died the day after giving birth to her last child. Several of their 13 children married into the Italian nobility. In 1644, King Charles I created Dudley&#x27;s second wife Alice Duchess of Dudley for life and recognized Dudley&#x27;s legitimacy but did not restore his titles and estate. Robert Dudley died on 6 September 1649 outside Florence in Villa Rinieri (now Villa Corsini a Castello). He was buried at San Pancrazio in Florence.

A son of Dudley was Carlo Dudley, titular Duke of Northumberland who was the father of Maria Cristina Dudley, the second wife of Marquis Andrea Paleotti; they were the parents of Adelhida Paleotti who married Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury; there was no issue of this marriage. Despite the marriages of Dudley descendants, &quot;No Dudleys in the line male now remained to carry on the name. After the third generation they became extinct in Italy&quot;.

In 1660, after the Restoration, Lady Alice, Dudley&#x27;s second wife (regarded in English law as his legitimate widow), petitioned King Charles II to have her title as Duchess of Northumberland recognised; and for her daughters, Lady Katherine Leveson and Lady Anne Holborne, to be given the rank and precedence of a duchess&#x27;s daughters. However, the King kept the title in the gift of the Crown, and bestowed it instead on his illegitimate son, George Fitzroy.

Dudley bequeathed his estate to Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His collection of scientific instruments is on display at the Museo Galileo (Galileo Museum, formerly the Institute and Museum of the History of Science) in Florence.

==&quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot;==
The most important of Dudley&#x27;s works was &quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot; (Secrets of the Sea). It includes a comprehensive treatise on navigation and shipbuilding and it has become renowned as the first atlas of sea charts of the world. &quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot; consists of six known volumes that illustrate Dudley&#x27;s knowledge of navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy and it includes 130 original maps, all his own creations and not copied from existing maps, which was unusual for the period. Originally published at Florence in 1646 in Italian, they represent a collection of all contemporary naval knowledge. The atlas also includes a proposal for the construction of a fleet of five rates (sizes) of ships, which Dudley had designed and described. &quot;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&quot; was reprinted in Florence in 1661 without the charts of the first edition. The distinctive character of Dudley&#x27;s charts was an early use of Mercator projection.

<doc id="594269" wikidata="Q855035" url="?curid=594269" title="Vietnamese Quoted-Readable">
<text>Vietnamese Quoted-Readable (usually abbreviated VIQR), also known as Vietnet, is a convention for writing Vietnamese using ASCII characters encoded in only 7 bits, making possible for Vietnamese to be supported in computing and communication systems at the time. Because the Vietnamese alphabet contains a complex system of diacritical marks, VIQR requires the user to type in a base letter, followed by one or two characters that represent the diacritical marks.

== Syntax ==

VIQR uses the following convention:

VIQR uses codice_1 or codice_2 for the Vietnamese letter &quot;Đ&quot;, and codice_3 for the Vietnamese letter &quot;đ&quot;. To type certain punctuation marks (namely, the period, question mark, apostrophe, forward slash, opening parenthesis, or tilde) directly after most Vietnamese words, a backslash (codice_4) must be typed directly before the punctuation mark, functioning as an escape character, so that it will not be interpreted as a diacritical mark. For example:
: 
:: &quot;What is your name [Sir]? My name is Trần Văn Hiếu.&quot;

== Software support ==
VIQR is primarily used as a Vietnamese input method in software that supports Unicode. Similar input methods include Telex and VNI. Input method editors such as VPSKeys convert VIQR sequences to Unicode precomposed characters as one types, typically allowing modifier keys to be input after all the base letters of each word. However, in the absence of input method software or Unicode support, VIQR can still be input using a standard keyboard and read as plain ASCII text without suffering from &quot;mojibake&quot;.

Unlike the VISCII and VPS code pages, VIQR is rarely used as a character encoding. While VIQR is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority as a MIME &quot;charset&quot;, MIME-compliant software is not required to support it. Nevertheless, the Mozilla Vietnamese Enabling Project once produced builds of the open source version of Netscape Communicator, as well as its successor, the Mozilla Application Suite, that were capable of decoding VIQR-encoded webpages, e-mails, and newsgroup messages. In these unofficial builds, a &quot;VIQR&quot; option appears in the Edit | Character Set menu, alongside the VISCII, TCVN 5712, VPS, and Windows-1258 options that remained available for several years in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.

== History ==
By the early 1990s, an ad-hoc system of mnemonics known as Vietnet was in use on the Viet-Net mailing list and soc.culture.vietnamese Usenet group.

In 1992, the Vietnamese Standardization Group (Viet-Std, &quot;Nhóm Nghiên Cứu Tiêu Chuẩn Tiếng Việt&quot;) from the TriChlor Software Group led by Christopher Cuong T. Nguyen, Cuong M. Bui, and Hoc D. Ngo in California formalized the VIQR convention. It was described the next year in RFC 1456.

<doc id="594277" wikidata="Q59999" url="?curid=594277" title="Spirit (comics character)">
<text>The Spirit is a fictional masked crimefighter appearing in American comic books. Created by cartoonist Will Eisner, he first appeared as the main feature of a tabloid-sized comic book insert distributed in the Sunday edition of Register and Tribune Syndicate newspapers. Popularly referred to as &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;, the insert ran from June 2, 1940 to October 5, 1952.

The Spirit is the alias of Denny Colt, a private investigator and criminologist based in the fictional Central City, who falls into suspended animation while trying to apprehend the mad scientist Dr. Cobra. Officially pronounced dead, Colt revives after being interred in Wildwood Cemetery. With the blessing of his old friend, police Commissioner Eustace Dolan, Colt becomes a domino mask-wearing &quot;friendly outlaw&quot; who pursues criminals that might otherwise escape capture by traditional law enforcement. The Spirit usually does not possess any superpowers, but relies on his wits and physical prowess, as well as the myth of his supposed resurrection, in his battles against evildoers. He frequently encounters femme fatales over the course of his adventures, including serial seducer P&#x27;Gell, thief-turned-troubleshooter Silk Satin, and his estranged childhood friend Sand Saref; he also comes into conflict with his archenemy the Octopus, an unseen criminal mastermind. Other supporting characters include Ellen Dolan, Commissioner Dolan&#x27;s headstrong daughter and the Spirit&#x27;s primary love interest, and his recurring sidekick Ebony White, a young, diminutive cab driver.

&quot;The Spirit Section&quot; was commissioned by Quality Comics publisher Everett M. &quot;Busy&quot; Arnold as a means of helping the Register and Tribune compete with the burgeoning comic book industry; Eisner, with the assistance of several ghost writers and artists, used &quot;The Spirit&quot; to reach a more mature readership compared to other comic books of the time. Although predominantly a mix of crime drama, noir and mystery, the series defied reader expectations by wildly experimenting with genre and tone, including horror, slapstick comedy, romance, fantasy, metafiction and science fiction. In some stories, the role of the Spirit himself amounts to only a cameo appearance, with Paul Gravett noting that the character would often take a &quot;back seat to the small dramas of losers, dreamers and ordinary joes&quot;, and that the series as a whole was, &quot;as much as anything, about the human spirit&quot;. At the peak of its popularity, &quot;The Spirit Section&quot; was included in 20 American newspapers, with a total circulation of five million copies.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, Eisner wrote and drew a handful of new &quot;Spirit&quot; stories, which appeared in Harvey Comics and elsewhere. Warren Publishing and Kitchen Sink Press variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and color comic books; DC Comics reprinted the entirety of Eisner&#x27;s run in a 26-volume color collection known as &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot;. From the 1990s to the 2010s, Kitchen Sink Press, DC Comics and Dynamite Entertainment also published new &quot;Spirit&quot; stories by other writers and artists.

Widely regarded as Eisner&#x27;s most famous creation, &quot;The Spirit&quot; has been credited with influencing the later underground comix movement and such filmmakers as William Friedkin and Brad Bird. In 2011, IGN ranked the Spirit as 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time. In other media, the character was portrayed by Sam J. Jones in a 1987 television film and by Gabriel Macht in a 2008 film adaptation written and directed by Frank Miller.

==Publication history==
In late 1939, Everett M. &quot;Busy&quot; Arnold, publisher of the Quality Comics comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of American comic books, as exemplified by the &quot;Chicago Tribune Comic Book&quot;, premiering two months before &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;. Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of &quot;The Washington Star&quot; liked George Brenner&#x27;s comic-book feature &quot;The Clock&quot;, but not Brenner&#x27;s art, and was favorably disposed toward a Lou Fine strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine&#x27;s slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine&#x27;s boss at the Eisner &amp; Iger studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work.

In &quot;late &#x27;39, just before Christmas time&quot;, Eisner recalled in 1979, &quot;Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom&quot;. In a 2004 interview, Eisner elaborated on that meeting:

Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright the feature but, &quot;Written down in the contract I had with &#x27;Busy&#x27; Arnold— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership— Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to &#x27;Busy&#x27; Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership.&quot; This would include the eventual backup features, &quot;Mr. Mystic&quot; and &quot;Lady Luck.&quot;

Selling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;. &quot;They gave me an adult audience&quot;, Eisner said in 1997, &quot;and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he&#x27;d have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, &#x27;Yes, he has a costume!&#x27;&quot;

The character and the types of stories Eisner would tell, Eisner said in 1978, derived from his desire

The character&#x27;s name, he said in that interview, came from Arnold: &quot;When &#x27;Busy&#x27; Arnold called, he suggested a kind of ghost or some kind of metaphysical character. He said, &#x27;How about a thing called the Ghost?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Naw, that&#x27;s not any good,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Well, then, call it the Spirit; there&#x27;s nothing like that around.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know what you mean.,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Well, you can figure &quot;that&quot; out—I just like the words &quot;the Spirit.&quot;&#x27; He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think... [A]nd actually, the more I thought about it the more I realized I didn&#x27;t care about the name.&quot;

&quot;The Spirit&quot;, an initially eight (and later seven) page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features &quot;Mr. Mystic&quot; and &quot;Lady Luck&quot; in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;) that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. Eisner, the overall editor, wrote and drew most &quot;Spirit&quot; entries, with the uncredited assistance of his studio of assistants and collaborators, though with Eisner&#x27;s singular vision a unifying factor. From 1940–1950, Busy Arnold reprinted &quot;Spirit&quot; stories under his Quality Comics banner, first individually from 1940–1947 as one of the features in ninety-two issues of &quot;Police Comics&quot; (#11–102), and from 1944–1950 as twenty-two issues of an associated &quot;Spirit&quot; comic book with several stories per issue. From 1952–1954, Fiction House published five issues of their own &quot;Spirit&quot; reprint comic book, continuing this process.

Eisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in late 1941, &quot;and then had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off&quot; to fight in World War II. In his absence, the newspaper syndicate used ghost writers and artists to continue the strip, including Manly Wade Wellman, William Woolfolk, Jack Cole and Lou Fine.

Eisner&#x27;s rumpled, masked hero (with his headquarters under the tombstone of his supposedly deceased true identity, Denny Colt) and his gritty, detailed view of big-city life (based on Eisner&#x27;s Jewish upbringing in New York City) both reflected and anticipated the &quot;noir&quot; outlook of film and fiction in the 1940s. Eisner said in 2001 that he created the strip as a vehicle to explore various genres: &quot;When I created The Spirit, I never had any intention of creating a superhero. I never felt The Spirit would dominate the feature. He served as a sort of an identity for the strip. The stories were what I was interested in.&quot; In some episodes, the nominal hero makes a brief, almost incidental appearance while the story focuses on a real-life drama played out in streets, dilapidated tenements, and smoke-filled back rooms. Yet along with violence and pathos, the feature lived on humor, both subtle and overt. He was shot, knocked silly, bruised, often amazed into near immobility and constantly confused by beautiful women.

The feature ended with the October 5, 1952, edition. As &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; editor-publisher Gary Groth wrote, &quot;By the late &#x27;40s, Eisner&#x27;s participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired Jerry Grandenetti and Jim Dixon to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, Jules Feiffer was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and Al Wenzel were drawing them.&quot; Grandenetti, who penciled as a ghost-artist under Eisner&#x27;s byline, said in 2005 that before the feature&#x27;s demise, Eisner had &quot;tried everything. Had me penciling &#x27;The Spirit&#x27;. Later on it was Wally Wood&quot;, who drew the final installments.

==Fictional character biography==
The Spirit, referred to in one newspaper article cited below as &quot;the only real middle-class crimefighter&quot;, was the hero persona of young detective/criminologist Denny Colt. Presumed killed in the first three pages of the premiere story, Colt later revealed to his friend, Central City Police Commissioner Dolan, that he had in fact gone into suspended animation caused by the villainous Dr. Cobra&#x27;s experiments. When Colt awakened in Wildwood Cemetery, he established a base there (underneath his own tombstone). Using his new-found anonymity, Colt began a life of fighting crime wearing a simple costume consisting of a blue domino mask, business suit, fedora hat, and gloves (plus a white shirt and red necktie). While elements of this basic costume occasionally vary (depending on the Spirit&#x27;s circumstances and where he is in the world), he is always depicted wearing his blue domino mask and blue leather gloves. The Spirit dispensed justice with the aid of his assistant Ebony White, funding his adventures with an inheritance from his late father Denny Colt Sr. and the rewards from capturing various villains.

The Spirit originally was based in New York City, but this was quickly changed to the fictional &quot;Central City&quot;. Not tied to one locale, his adventures took him around the globe and even to the Moon. He met eccentrics, kooks, and femmes fatale, bringing his own form of justice to all of them. The story changed continually, but certain themes remained constant: the love between the Spirit and Dolan&#x27;s feisty protofeminist daughter Ellen; the annual &quot;Christmas Spirit&quot; stories; and his archenemy the Octopus (a psychopathic criminal mastermind who was never seen, except for his distinctive purple gloves).

==Ebony White==
Eisner was criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the Spirit&#x27;s African-American sidekick. The character&#x27;s name is a racial pun, and his facial features, including large white eyes and thick pinkish lips, are typical of racial blackface caricatures popular throughout the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; era. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with &quot;responsibility&quot;, and argued that &quot;at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity&quot;. The character, who was consistently treated with respect by the strip&#x27;s fellow cast-members, developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced such African-American characters as the no-nonsense Detective Grey who defied popular stereotypes.

Ebony debuted as a resourceful taxi driver in the first &quot;Spirit Section&quot;. He became a mainstay of the strip and a principal member of the Spirit&#x27;s supporting cast, appearing semi-regularly as the focus of an episode rather than the Spirit himself. Eisner phased him out of the series in 1949, introducing a Caucasian boy named Sammy as the Spirit&#x27;s new assistant. Sammy returns to Central City with the Spirit from an adventure in the South Seas, and is welcomed by Ebony and the Dolans. Ebony appears only briefly over the subsequent months, then is not seen again during the regular run of the series. His last &quot;starring&quot; role was in &quot;Young Dr. Ebony&quot;, published on May 29, 1949.

The character appears as an adult office worker in a one-off Spirit story that appeared January 9, 1966, in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. In an accompanying feature article in that edition, Eisner&#x27;s former office manager Marilyn Mercer wrote, &quot;Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early Minstrel Show, he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of Tom Sawyer and Penrod, with a touch of Horatio Alger hero, and color didn&#x27;t really come into it&quot;.

==Other characters==
* Dr. Cobra is a mad scientist whose chemicals and machinations inadvertently help Denny Colt become the Spirit.
* Darling O&#x27; Shea is the richest and most spoiled child in the world.
* Hazel P. Macbeth is a witch with a Shakespearean motif and apparent magical powers. (&quot;Vide&quot; Macbeth.)
* Lorelei Rox, an apparent siren, appeared in a September 1948 strip and subsequently in 2000s DC Comics Spirit stories. (&quot;Vide&quot; Lorelei rock.)
* Mister Carrion is a morbid con man with a pet vulture named Julia. (&quot;Vide&quot; carrion.)
* The Octopus is the archenemy of the Spirit. He is a criminal mastermind and master of disguise who never shows his real face, though he is identified by his distinctive purple gloves. In the second issue of the 1960s Harvey Comics &quot;Spirit&quot; comic book, his name is given as Zitzbath Zark. The first name is a pun on sitz bath.
* P&#x27;Gell is a femme fatale who perennially tries to seduce the Spirit to a life of crime at her side. She seduces and marries wealthy men who invariably die in mysterious ways, and uses their money to fund her crime empire in Istanbul and expand her influence and control over the underworld. After moving to Central City to find the Spirit, she continues her modus operandi of selected marriages with the cream of society, even gaining an ally in the form of Saree, the young daughter of one of her deceased husbands. In the 2000s DC Comics version, P&#x27;Gell was once a young socialite in love with a doctor, working in Third World countries, and turned to a life of crime when he was killed. (&quot;Vide&quot; Pigalle.)
* P.S. Smith (&quot;Peppermint Stick&quot; Smith AKA Algernon Tidewater) is a silent, baseball helmet-wearing associate of Ebony. Always sucking on a peppermint stick and appearing to be 6–8 years of age, the wordless &quot;P.S.&quot; is capable of almost-superhuman feats (always played for comedic effect) and serves as Eisner&#x27;s comic embodiment of anarchy and disruption. &quot;P.S.&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; as the star of a silent pantomime strip appearing underneath the main &quot;Spirit&quot; story, before Eisner introduced the character within the main strip (as &quot;Algernon Tidewater&quot;) in 1941. The character was renamed &quot;P.S.&quot; in his first postwar appearance in May 1946.
* Officer Sam Klink is a brave, big-hearted but not particularly bright member of the Central City Police Department. A regular member of the postwar &quot;Spirit Section&quot; cast list, Klink is a loyal aide to Commissioner Dolan and a frequent ally of the Spirit.
* Sand Saref is a childhood friend of Denny Colt, and knows he is the Spirit. Working in espionage, she usually ends up on the opposite side of the law from him. She appears several times, always involved in some criminal scheme. (&quot;Vide&quot; sans serif.)
* Silk Satin is a tall, statuesque brunette with a white streak in her hair, originally an adventuress who later reformed and worked as an international troubleshooter for the insurance company Croyd&#x27;s of Glasgow. In later stories, it is revealed she has a daughter, Hildie, who motivates her to stay on the straight path. In the 2000s DC Comics revival, she is a smaller, more slender, blond CIA agent.
* Silken Floss is a nuclear physicist and a surgeon, who acts as the accomplice to the Octopus.

==&quot;Ev&#x27;ry Little Bug&quot;==
The song &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Little Bug&quot; (with lyrics written by Eisner) appears regularly between 1946 and 1950. The initial lines of the song were first uttered in the story &quot;Poole&#x27;s Toadstool Facial Cream&quot; (June 9, 1946). By the end of 1946, all of the lyrics had appeared, sung by various characters. In 1947, Eisner collaborated with his World War II service friend Bill Harr, who composed a melody for Eisner&#x27;s lyrics. The complete song appears in the April 27, 1947 &quot;Spirit Section&quot;, here titled &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Li&#x27;l Bug&quot;, with Ebony credited within the storyline as its composer. In the story &quot;Wiffenpoof&quot; (June 29, 1947), real-life operatic singer Robert Merrill was depicted singing the tune. Shortly afterward, the Robbins Music Corporation of New York published &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Little Bug&quot; as sheet music, with an image of Ebony on its cover page. After three more appearances in the strip, &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Little Bug&quot; remained dormant until 1987, when music producer John Christensen assembled a recording featuring five versions of the tune, released by Kitchen Sink as a picture disc with an exclusive Spirit/Ebony image illustrated by Eisner on one side and the original art for the sheet music on the other. The record featured actor Billy Mumy playing guitar on some tracks.

==The Spirit and John Law==
Several Spirit stories, such as the first appearance of Sand Saref, were retooled from a failed publishing venture featuring an eyepatched, pipe-smoking detective named John Law. Law and his shoeshine-boy sidekick, Nubbin, starred in several adventures planned for a new comics series. These completed adventures were eventually adapted into Spirit stories, with John Law&#x27;s eyepatch being changed to the Spirit&#x27;s mask, and Nubbin redrawn as Willum Waif or other Spirit supporting characters.

The original John Law stories were restored and published in &quot;Will Eisner&#x27;s John Law: Dead Man Walking&quot; (IDW Publishing, 2004), a collection of stories that also features new adventures by writer-artist Gary Chaloner, starring John Law, Nubbin, and other Eisner creations, including &quot;Lady Luck&quot; and &quot;Mr. Mystic&quot;.

==Assistants and collaborators==
Like most artists working in newspaper comic strips, Eisner after a time employed a studio of assistants who, on any given week&#x27;s story, might draw or simply ink backgrounds, ink parts of Eisner&#x27;s main characters (such as clothing or shoes), or as eventually occurred, ghost-draw the strip entirely. Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him.

Jules Feiffer, who began as an art assistant and later became the primary writer through the strip&#x27;s end in 1952, recalled, &quot;When I first worked for Will there was John Spranger, who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was Sam Rosen, the lettering man. Jerry Grandenetti came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And Abe Kanegson, who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all-trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.&quot;

Eisner&#x27;s studio also included:

*Art assistants: Bob Powell (1940), Dave Berg (backgrounds, 1940–41), Tex Blaisdell (1940–41), Fred Kida (1941), Alexander Kostuk a.k.a. Alex Koster (1941–43), Jack Cole (1942–43), Jack Keller (backgrounds, 1943), Jules Feiffer (1946–47), Manny Stallman (1947–49), Andre LeBlanc (1950), Al Wenzel (1952)
*Inkers: Alex Kotzky (1941–43), John Belfi (1942–43), Don Komisarow (1943), Robin King (year?), Joe Kubert (1943–44), Jerry Grandenetti (1948–51), Jim Dixon (1950–51), Don Perlin (1951)
*Letterers: Sam Rosen (1940-1942), Martin De Muth (1942-1947), Abe Kanegson (1947-1951), Samm Schwartz (1951), Ben Oda (1951-1952)
*Colorists: Jules Feiffer (1950–52), Chris Christiansen (1951)
*Ghost artists (pencilers): Lou Fine and Jack Cole (variously, during Eisner&#x27;s World War II service, 1942–45), Jerry Grandenetti (1951), Wally Wood (1952)
*Ghostwriters/writing assistants: Toni Blum (1942), Jack Cole, Manly Wade Wellman and William Woolfolk (variously, during Eisner&#x27;s World War II service, 1943–45), Klaus Nordling (1946, 1951), Marilyn Mercer (1946), Abe Kanegson (1950), Jules Feiffer (1951–52)

==Latter-day Spirit comics==
===1960s===

A five-page Spirit story, set in New York City, appeared as part of a January 9, 1966, article about the Spirit in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

Harvey Comics reprinted several Spirit stories in two giant-size, 25-cent comic books published October 1966 and March 1967, each with new Eisner covers. The first of these two 60-page issues opened with a new seven-page retelling of the Spirit&#x27;s origin by writer-penciler-inker Eisner (with inking assist by Chuck Kramer). Also new was the text feature &quot;An Interview with the Spirit&quot;, credited to Marilyn Mercer; and writer-artist Eisner&#x27;s two-page featurette &quot;Spirit Lab: Invincible Devices&quot;. Seven 1948–1949 Spirit stories were reprinted. The second issue opened with a new seven-page story by writer-artist Eisner, &quot;Octopus: The Life Story of the King of Crime,&quot; giving the heretofore unrevealed origin of the Spirit&#x27;s nemesis The Octopus, as well as his given name (Zitzbath Zark). Also new was the two-page text feature &quot;The Spirit Answers Your Mail&quot;, and writer-artist Eisner&#x27;s two-page featurette &quot;The Spirit Lab: The Man from MSD&quot;. Reprinted were seven 1948–50 &quot;Spirit&quot; stories.

===1970s===
In 1973, Denis Kitchen&#x27;s Kitchen Sink Press published two issues of &quot;The Spirit&quot; (also known as &quot;Underground Spirit&quot;), consisting primarily of reprints with original front and back covers, and featuring introductions by Maurice Horn and John Benson. The first issue includes four original single-page stories, while the second issue (cover titled &quot;All About P&#x27;Gell&quot;) includes the four-page story, &quot;The Capistrano Jewels.&quot; During this period, Eisner also released &quot;The Invader&quot;, a five-page story in a one-shot Spirit publication Eisner created for his lecture at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, Canada in 1973. It was reprinted in Kitchen Sink&#x27;s hardcover &quot;Will Eisner Color Treasury&quot;(1981).

From 1974 to 1976, James Warren&#x27;s Warren Publishing published 16 issues of &quot;The Spirit&quot; (also known as &quot;The Spirit Magazine&quot;), a large black-and-white magazine consisting of reprints with original covers (primarily by Eisner), concluding with a separate 1975 color issue, &quot;The Spirit Special&quot;, which includes an afterword by Bill DuBay. Kitchen Sink picked up the series beginning in 1977 with issue 17, eventually concluding with issue 41 (June 1983). Issue 30 of the Kitchen Sink series (July 1981) features &quot;The Spirit Jam&quot;, with a script from Eisner and a few penciled pages, plus contributions from 50 artists, including Fred Hembeck, Trina Robbins, Steve Leialoha, Frank Miller, Harvey Kurtzman, Howard Cruse, Brian Bolland, Bill Sienkiewicz, John Byrne, and Richard Corben.

In 1976, Tempo Books published &quot;The Spirit Casebook of True Haunted Houses and Ghosts&quot;, in which the Spirit plays the EC host, introducing &quot;true&quot; stories of haunted houses. The Spirit also makes a cameo in &quot;Vampirella&quot; #50 (April 1976), in the eight-page story &quot;The Thing in Denny Colt&#x27;s Grave&quot;.

===1980s===
After &quot;The Spirit Magazine&quot; ceased publication with issue #41 (June 1983), Kitchen Sink Press published a complete reprinting of the post-World War II Eisner work in a standard-formatted comic-book series, which ran 87 issues (October 1983–January 1992). The series featured color stories in its first 11 issues, but switched to black-and-white from issue 12 on. Also in 1983, Kitchen Sink published &quot;Outer Space Spirit: 1952&quot;, collecting the final newspaper sections (July 27, 1952 – October 5, 1952), along with the scripts for what would have been the final three sections of the &quot;Outer Space Spirit&quot; saga. The publisher additionally published the one-shot &quot;Will Eisner&#x27;s 3-D Classics featuring The Spirit&quot; (Dec. 1985).

===1990s and beyond===

In the 1990s, Kitchen Sink published two hardcover volumes of &quot;The Spirit Casebook&quot;, the first cover-titled simply &quot;Spirit Casebook&quot; (1990), and the second cover-titled &quot;All About P&#x27;Gell: The Spirit Casebook, Volume II&quot; (1998). Kitchen Sink also published a series of original Spirit stories in &quot;The Spirit: The New Adventures&quot; (March–November 1998), including contributions from Will Eisner, Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Brian Bolland, Tim Bradstreet, Kurt Busiek, Eddie Campbell, Marcus Moore, Paul Chadwick, Neil Gaiman, Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud, Joe R. Lansdale, David Lloyd, and Paul Pope.

In the mid-2000s, DC Comics began reprinting &quot;The Spirit&quot; chronologically in the company&#x27;s hardcover Archive series, in an approximately 8x10-inch format, smaller than the Kitchen Sink and Warren publications.

Eisner&#x27;s final Spirit story appeared in the sixth issue of &quot;The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist&quot;, from Dark Horse Comics, published on April 20, 2005. This 6-page story featured a crossover between the Spirit and the book&#x27;s lead character, the Escapist.

===DC Comics===

The DC Comics one-shot &quot;Batman/The Spirit&quot; (January 2007), by writer Jeph Loeb and artists Darwyn Cooke and J. Bone introduced the Spirit into the DC Universe. The first issue of the ongoing series &quot;The Spirit&quot;, written and pencilled by Cooke and inked by J. Bone, debuted the following month. The series updated some concepts, with Ellen&#x27;s Internet skills helping to solve a case, and Ebony White stripped of his racial stereotype characteristics. The team of Mark Evanier and Sergio Aragones became the series&#x27; regular writers beginning with issue #14 (March 2008), with Mike Ploog and later Paul Smith providing the artwork. DC&#x27;S &quot;The Spirit&quot; series ran through issue #32 (Aug. 2009), with most running a single 22-page story.

The imprint First Wave, launched in January 2010, featured the Spirit, pulp heroes Doc Savage and The Avenger, and DC&#x27;s Rima the Jungle Girl, the Blackhawks, and a Golden Age incarnation of Batman into a DC &quot;pulpverse&quot; overseen by writer Brian Azzarello. This imprint incorporated the 17-issue &quot;The Spirit&quot; volume two (June 2010 - Oct. 2011), written variously by Mark Schultz, David Hine, Lilah Sturges, and Howard Chaykin.

===IDW===
In 2013, IDW published a four issue miniseries, &quot;The Rocketeer and The Spirit: Pulp Friction&quot;, using the Spirit, Dolan, Ellen, and the Octopus as well as characters from Dave Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; series. The four issues were collected in a hardcover graphic novel.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In 2015, Dynamite Entertainment obtained the license to publish new Spirit comics, beginning with a story by writer-artist Matt Wagner, &quot;Who Killed The Spirit?&quot; In 2017, the Spirit and fellow venerable crimefighter the Green Hornet shared a five-issue series, &quot;Green Hornet &#x27;66 Meets the Spirit&quot;.

==In other media==
===Comic strip===
From October 13, 1941 to March 11, 1944, there was also a black-and-white daily newspaper comic strip starring the Spirit. These were later reprinted in several collections, including the complete run in DC&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot; Volume 25.

In early 2017, the Spirit returned to newspaper strips as a guest-star in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; by Mike Curtis (script) and Joe Staton (art), continuing the trend of Tracy stories reviving characters from defunct strips.

===Television film===

The character was the subject of a 1987 ABC television film starring Sam J. Jones as the Spirit, Nana Visitor as Ellen Dolan, and Garry Walberg as Commissioner Dolan. The film served as a pilot for a planned TV series.

===Planned animated film===
An animated feature to be directed by Brad Bird was in development in the 1980s. Steven Paul Leiva, animator Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz also were involved, and a presentation trailer was produced. The Spirit&#x27;s voice was supplied by animator Randall William Cook.

===Film===
The film adaptation &quot;The Spirit&quot;, written and directed by Frank Miller, was released in theaters by Lionsgate on December 25, 2008. The film stars Gabriel Macht as the Spirit and Samuel L. Jackson as the Octopus.

===Radio===
Denis Kitchen, the Eisner estate&#x27;s agent, said in a July 8, 2006 online interview that a radio series had been in development: &quot;It was pitched to the estate by a couple of producers, one of whom is very experienced with NPR, so we have been back and forth on how that would work. Again, it would be premature to tell you it is going to happen, but it is in serious discussion&quot;.

<doc id="594286" wikidata="Q581897" url="?curid=594286" title="Cooperative Linux">
<text>Cooperative Linux, abbreviated as coLinux, is software which allows Microsoft Windows and the Linux kernel to run simultaneously in parallel on the same machine.

Cooperative Linux utilizes the concept of a Cooperative Virtual Machine (CVM). In contrast to traditional virtual machines, the CVM shares resources that already exist in the host OS. In traditional VM hosts, resources are virtualized for every (guest) OS. The CVM gives both OSs complete control of the host machine while the traditional VM sets every guest OS in an unprivileged state to access the real machine.

== Overview ==

The term &quot;cooperative&quot; is used to describe two entities working in parallel. In effect Cooperative Linux turns the two different operating system kernels into two big coroutines. Each kernel has its own complete CPU context and address space, and each kernel decides when to give control back to its partner.

However, while both kernels theoretically have full access to the real hardware, modern PC hardware is not designed to be controlled by two different operating systems at the same time. Therefore, the host kernel is left in control of the real hardware and the guest kernel contains special drivers that communicate with the host and provide various important devices to the guest OS. The host can be any OS kernel that exports basic primitives that allow the Cooperative Linux portable driver to run in CPL0 mode (ring 0) and allocate memory.

== History ==
Dan Aloni originally started the development of Cooperative Linux as a research project based on similar work with User-mode Linux. He announced the development on 25 Jan 2004. In July 2004 he presented a paper at the Linux Symposium. The source was released under the GNU General Public License. Other developers have since contributed various patches and additions to the software.

== Comparisons ==
Cooperative Linux is significantly different from full x86 virtualization, which generally works by running the guest OS in a less privileged mode than that of the host kernel, and having all resources delegated by the host kernel. In contrast, Cooperative Linux runs a specially modified Linux kernel that is &quot;Cooperative&quot; in that it takes responsibility for sharing resources with the NT kernel and not instigating race conditions.

== Distribution ==

Most of the changes in the Cooperative Linux patch are on the i386 tree—the only supported architecture for Cooperative at the time of this writing. The other changes are mostly additions of virtual drivers: cobd (block device), conet (network), and cocon (console). Most of the changes in the i386 tree involve the initialization and setup code. It is a goal of the Cooperative Linux kernel design to remain as close as possible to the standalone i386 kernel, so all changes are localized and minimized as much as possible.

The coLinux package installs a port of the Linux kernel and a virtual network device and can run simultaneously under a version of the Windows operating system such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It does not use a virtual machine such as VMware.

Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Gentoo are especially popular with the coLinux users.

Due to the rather unusual structure of the virtual hardware, installing Linux distributions under coLinux is generally difficult. Therefore, users in most cases use either an existing Linux installation on a real partition or a ready made filesystem image distributed by the project. The filesystem images are made by a variety of methods, including taking images of a normal Linux system, finding ways to make installers run with the strange hardware, building up installs by hand using the package manager or simply upgrading existing images using tools like yum and apt. An easier way to get an up-to-date filesystem image is to use QEMU to install Linux and &quot;convert&quot; the image by stripping off the first 63 512-byte blocks as described in the coLinux wiki.

Since coLinux does not have access to native graphics hardware, X Window or X Servers will not run under coLinux directly, but one can install an X Server under Windows, such as Cygwin/X or Xming and use KDE or GNOME and almost any other Linux application and distribution. All of these issues are fixed by using coLinux based distributions such as andLinux, based on Ubuntu, or TopologiLinux, based on Slackware.

=== Dedicated distributions ===
A few distributions were built specifically to work with coLinux.

*AndLinux
*speedLinux
*TopologiLinux

== Emulated hardware ==
* Ethernet network via TAP, PCAP, NDIS and SLiRP.

== Limitations ==
* Does not yet support 64-bit Windows or Linux (nor utilize more than 4GB memory), but a port is under development by the community.
* No multi-processor (SMP) support. Linux applications and the underlying kernel are able to use only one CPU.

<text>Grandstand was the flagship sports programme of the BBC which was broadcast on Saturday afternoons on BBC1 between 1958 and 2007, and from 1981 on Sunday afternoons as Sunday Grandstand on BBC2, although until 1998 the Sunday edition aired only during the summer.

The last editions of &quot;Grandstand&quot; and &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot; were broadcast over the weekend of 27–28 January 2007.

==History==
During the 1950s, sports coverage on television in the United Kingdom gradually expanded. The BBC regularly broadcast sports programmes with an outside studio team, occasionally from two or three separate locations. Production assistant Bryan Cowgill put forward a proposal for a programme lasting three hours; one hour dedicated to major events and two hours showing minor events. Outside Broadcast members held a meeting in April 1958, and Cowgill further detailed his plans taking timing and newer technical facilities into consideration. During the development of the programme, problems arose over the proposed schedule which would result in the programme ending at 16:45 to allow children&#x27;s programmes to go out. Paul Fox insisted that the service was broadcast until 17:00 to ensure a proper results service.

Three weeks before the debut of the programme, sports broadcaster Peter Dimmock favoured naming the show &quot;Out and About!&quot; with Fox persuading Dimmock to agree on a new name, which was &quot;Grandstand&quot;. &quot;Grandstand&quot; launched on 11 October 1958 from Lime Grove Studios with Dimmock as the presenter. Dimmock presented the first two editions and three weeks later, he was replaced by sports commentator David Coleman. In the autumn of 1959, &quot;Grandstand&quot; was extended by fifteen minutes and would finish at 17:00 every Saturday. According to Richard Haynes in &quot;BBC Sport in Black and White&quot;, the 1960s saw the &quot;Grandstand&quot; name &quot;become synonymous with the BBC&#x27;s coverage of sport&quot; and it &quot;became a trusted vehicle for British viewers to access a variety of sports.&quot;

The show was one of the most recognisable on British television, dominating Saturday afternoons on BBC1 and covering nearly every major sporting event in Britain, such as the FA Cup Final, Wimbledon, the Grand National and the University Boat Race, as well as major international events like the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, the Commonwealth Games and the FIFA World Cup where the Grandstand name would be used - eg &quot;Olympic Grandstand&quot; and &quot;World Cup Grandstand&quot;.

From the programme&#x27;s launch until the lifting of restrictions on broadcasting hours by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in 1972, sports coverage was one of the few programming areas which was exempt from the broadcasting hours restrictions. Instead, sporting coverage and outside broadcasts were provided with a separate quota of broadcasting hours per year by the Postmaster General. By the mid 1960s this amounted to 350 hours per year. This meant &quot;Grandstand&quot; was a key part of the BBC&#x27;s Saturday afternoon schedules, as the time the programme was on the air did not count towards the 50-hour a week restriction on normal broadcasting hours.

Beginning in the early 1980s, a lunchtime news summary provided by BBC News was included in the broadcast, functioning as a programme break between &quot;Football Focus&quot; and the start of that week&#x27;s live events.

===&quot;Football Focus&quot;===

The first item of the programme which began in the early afternoon during the football season was the football magazine show &quot;Football Focus&quot;. It began for several years up to 1974, on as a slot called &quot;Football Preview&quot;, previewing the day&#x27;s matches in the First Division. &quot;Football Focus&quot; remained part of &quot;Grandstand&quot; until 2001, when it became a separate programme in its own right.

===&quot;Around the Grounds&quot;===
Between the main live sporting events being shown on the day in the mid afternoon a brief segment was shown where the programme went around the football grounds just prior to the 3pm kick-offs with the on site commentators announcing the team line ups and pre match news. This was done in the format of &quot;Final Score&quot;.

===&quot;Final Score&quot;===

In the late afternoon during the football season, with many Football League and Scottish Football League matches approaching full-time, the programme would draw to a close with &quot;Final Score&quot;. This covered not only the results from all the matches, but also gave the results of the football pools. Perhaps the segment&#x27;s most famous feature was the teleprinter, which by the start of the 1980s had become digitised and was accordingly renamed as the vidiprinter, which typed out the results as they came through, with the characters in each result appearing one by one. When all the football results were in they would be read out as the &quot;classified football results&quot;, when all the scores would be read out line by line on screen. Only two people regularly read out the classified results on &quot;Final Score&quot; when it was part of &quot;Grandstand&quot;: the Australian Len Martin (from the first programme until his death in 1995) and Tim Gudgin (from 1995 until &quot;Final Score&quot; was separated from &quot;Grandstand&quot; in 2001 – he continued to read the classified results until 2011). Whilst football was the primary focus of &quot;Final Score&quot;, news and results from other sports, such as rugby union and, until 1987, racing, were also included.

A shorter version was aired during the football close season, and stand-alone shorter editions of &quot;Final Score&quot;, which did not include the vidiprinter sequence, were broadcast on bank holidays when, despite a full football programme taking place, BBC1 generally did not broadcast an edition of &quot;Grandstand&quot;.

==Winter phase TV schedule format==
In the winter format the main live sporting events on the programme were centred around the afternoon&#x27;s 3pm football matches, with &quot;Football Focus&quot; opening the programme and &quot;Final Score&quot; closing the programme. Live coverage was mostly racing during the early part of the programme and rugby (both codes), kicking off at either 14:30 or 15:00 which was timed and centred into the programme to avoid any clash with the final football results which would come in after 16:40, with the minor pre-recorded sporting items mostly proceeding the main event in the early afternoon. An example of this format is seen from the schedule below dated Saturday 31 October 1992 with the main event of the day in bold:

:12:15 &quot;Grandstand Opening&quot;
:12:20 &quot;Football Focus&quot;
:12:50 &quot;BBC News&quot;
:12:55 Racing
:13:10 Motor Sport
:13:25 Racing
:13:40 Motor Sport
:13:55 Racing
:14:10 Boxing
:14:30 Rugby Union: Ireland v Australia
:16:20 Motor Sport
:16:40-17:05: &quot;Final Score&quot;

==Summer phase TV schedule format==
The summer phase format was used outside of the football season, it was less formal than the winter format and the programme centred more on the live events in which it was covering and sometimes the programme would begin earlier than its normal regular slot, at just before 11:00 so that the programme could show live cricket from the start of the day&#x27;s play. Here is an example of a typical show from 12 June 1993, with the main event of the day in bold.

:12:15 &quot;Grandstand Opening&quot;
:12:35 &quot;Motorsport&quot;
:13:00 &quot;BBC News&quot;
:13:05 Tennis: Queens
:15:00 Athletics
:16:00 Swimming/Athletics/Tennis
:17:15 &quot;Close&quot;

===&quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot;===
A Sunday edition, named &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot;, launched in 1981 and was broadcast on BBC2, although a few editions had been broadcast on BBC1 in 1978, 1979 and 1980. Its on-air time was a later five-hour slot, so as to be able to provide coverage of the day&#x27;s F1 Grand Prix race or the conclusion of the Sunday League Cricket matches which were carried over from the previous afternoon-long cricket match which had been part of BBC2&#x27;s summer Sunday schedule since 1965. The 13:55 to 18:50 slot remained in place from the programme&#x27;s launch until the end of the 1980s, after which the broadcast hours started to become more varied.

Until 1998, the Sunday edition was usually only broadcast during the summer months, although there were exceptions, such as a special edition in January 1995 to cover a Regal Trophy semi-final. However, from February 1998 &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot; became a year-round programme, incorporating the &quot;Ski Sunday&quot; and &quot;Rugby Special&quot; programmes.

===Competition from ITV===
Between 1965 and 1985, &quot;Grandstand&quot; faced competition from ITV&#x27;s &quot;World of Sport&quot;, but by the end of the 1980s ITV had stopped broadcasting Saturday afternoon sport in favour of other programmes.

==Later years and demise==
From the 1990s onwards the programme&#x27;s scope of sporting coverage began to diminish as the BBC gradually began to lose major broadcasting sports rights including live Formula One, the FA Cup, England&#x27;s home cricket test matches, Sunday League cricket, the NatWest Trophy and the Ryder Cup particularly to the then emerging Sky Sports, ITV and even lost some sporting rights to Channel 4. &quot;Grandstand&quot; was not shown on 20 May 2000 as no major sporting events broadcast by the BBC were taking place. Another day when Grandstand was not shown was 23rd December 1978. This was due to strike action on the Friday which had only ended at 10pm the previous night. BBC1 could not get back on air until 3pm which meant that Grandstand was not shown but there was a &quot;Final Score&quot;. In 2001 the BBC lost the rights to show weekly highlights of the Premier League although it did regain the rights to show live FA Cup and England football internationals.

In October 2001, the head of BBC Sports and Programming Pat Younge announced plans to revamp &quot;Grandstand&quot; by placing emphasis on broadcasting one particular sport rather than alternating between several sports.

In its final few years, the show was rarely presented from a studio and as such there was no longer a main presenter. The show tended to be broadcast from wherever the main event of the day was taking place. The host would be associated with that feature; for example, Hazel Irvine would host snooker, Suzi Perry for motorcycle racing, Sue Barker for tennis, Clare Balding for racing or rugby league, and John Inverdale for rugby union. The 2004 Summer Olympics were the last Olympic Games to be broadcast as &quot;Olympic Grandstand&quot;.

===&quot;Football Focus&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot; part company===
In August 2001, the &quot;Football Focus&quot; section, having been the first feature on &quot;Grandstand&quot; since 1974, became a separate programme in its own right. This meant that &quot;Grandstand&quot;&#x27;s start time was now 13:00 rather than 12:15.

At the same time, &quot;Final Score&quot; also become a programme in its own right, running from 16:30, meaning that Grandstand only broadcast between 13:00 and 16:30. &quot;Around the Grounds&quot; and the half time sequence did remain within the &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme. In 2004, following the success of Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; programme featuring reports from the afternoon&#x27;s football matches, the BBC introduced its own football scores programme called &quot;Score&quot;. It ran for the full duration of the afternoon&#x27;s football matches, beginning at 14:30, and was available as an add-on service on the Red Button until 16:30 when BBC One joined the programme and at that point Score would become &quot;Final Score&quot;.

===2006 announcement===
On 24 April 2006, the BBC announced that &quot;Grandstand&quot; would be gradually phased out after nearly fifty years, due to the increasing use of interactive services and the need to meet the challenges of the digital, on-demand world. This had been hinted at by the dropping of the &quot;Grandstand&quot; title from the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the major international sporting events, like that year&#x27;s Winter Olympics and Commonwealth Games.

It was originally intended that the show would end in 2009, but this was brought forward to 28 January 2007.

==After &quot;Grandstand&quot; ended==
The last Saturday edition of &quot;Grandstand&quot; was broadcast on 27 January 2007 with World Indoor Athletics from Glasgow, and the final edition was broadcast the following day, 28 January 2007, with the live action being the final of the World Indoor Bowls Championships from Hopton-on-Sea in Norfolk with a short tribute to the history of the show forming its final feature. Sport still features prominently on the BBC&#x27;s schedules on Saturday afternoon as well as on BBC Red Button and iPlayer; &quot;Final Score&quot; is still shown at the end of the football matches played on Saturday afternoon.

==Presenters==
Hosts included Peter Dimmock, David Coleman, Frank Bough, Des Lynam, Steve Rider, Ronald Allison, Clare Balding, Sue Barker, Barry Davies, Dougie Donnelly, Harry Carpenter, Harry Gration, Tony Gubba, David Icke, John Inverdale, Hazel Irvine, Gary Lineker, Craig Doyle, Roger Black, Helen Rollason, Ray Stubbs, David Vine, Alan Weeks and Bob Wilson.

==Theme tune==
The original theme was &quot;News Scoop&quot; by Len Stevens, which was used until 6 November 1971. From 13 November 1971 to 11 October 1975, another tune, composed by Barry Stoller, who also composed the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; theme, was used. The programme&#x27;s longest running theme, composed for the programme by Keith Mansfield, was first broadcast at the end of the 11 October 1975 edition (the 1000th edition of Grandstand) (and apart from a brief remix which commenced in 1999 but dropped after a few weeks due to complaints) remained until the end of the programme&#x27;s existence.

==Notable live events==

<doc id="594295" wikidata="Q1070275" url="?curid=594295" title="Fear (1996 film)">
<text>Fear is a 1996 American psychological thriller film directed by James Foley and written by Christopher Crowe. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petersen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman.

It revolves around a wealthy family whose seemingly perfect life is threatened when their teenage daughter begins dating an attractive and mysterious young man who turns out to be a violent sociopath.

The film was largely derided by critics upon its release but became a sleeper hit in the spring of 1996, grossing $20 million at the U.S. box office. It has since become a cult film, while at the same time launching teen idol status for its two young leads – Wahlberg and Witherspoon – who were romantically linked at the time of the movie&#x27;s premiere. Wahlberg was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain. The film&#x27;s own producer, Brian Grazer, described it as &quot;&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; for teens&quot;.

==Plot== 

Sixteen-year-old Nicole Walker lives in the suburbs of Seattle with her father Steven, his new wife Laura, and Laura&#x27;s son Toby. While she is at a cafe with her best friend Margo Masse and friend Gary Rohmer, Nicole meets David McCall and instantly falls for his good looks and charm.

Steven dislikes David and grows angry with him when he disregards Nicole&#x27;s curfew and, eventually, has sex with her. David soon becomes possessive and jealous of Nicole, culminating in attacking Gary when he sees them hugging, beating him up, and giving Nicole a black eye. As a result, she breaks up with him, but they get back together when David apologizes to her for his actions. He later manipulates her into believing her father assaulted him.

David invites Nicole to a party at his friend Logan&#x27;s house. At first, she declines but then decides to drive to the party, where she witnesses Margo smoking crack and going off to have sex with David, although Nicole does not realize that she gets sexually assaulted by him.

The following day, Nicole confronts David about his infidelity and breaks up with him for good. She also confronts Margo, not believing that David sexually assaulted her. He then threatens Margo so she will convince her friend to take him back. After seeing Gary help Nicole into her stepmom&#x27;s car, David follows and kills him.

Nicole goes with Laura and Toby to the mall, where David corners her in the women&#x27;s restroom, vowing to her that he will not let anyone stand in the way of him having Nicole for himself. Meanwhile, Steven finds his car vandalized with an insulting note left by David.

Furious, Steven breaks into the house David shares with Logan and vandalizes it after discovering a shrine David made for Nicole. In retaliation for the vandalism, David heads to the Walkers&#x27; residence with his four friends: Logan, Terry, Knobby, and Hacker, aiming to harm Nicole&#x27;s family and take Nicole for himself.

After Margo informs the Walkers of Gary&#x27;s death, David and his gang arrive and behead Kaiser, the family dog, then make multiple attempts to break inside. Steven and Laura barricade the doors, and Laura injures Hacker with a drill, leading Knobby to take him to the hospital. Using a flashlight, Nicole sends an SOS to the Walkers&#x27; private security guard Larry, who arrives to confront the situation but is killed by Terry.

David, Logan, and Terry take Steven hostage, forcing Laura to surrender. Toby escapes through a window and gets to Laura&#x27;s car phone. After Terry finds him in the garage, Toby fatally runs him over with the SUV. Logan forces himself onto Nicole; Margo intervenes but is knocked unconscious.

David shoots Logan dead for attempting to rape Nicole and then tells her that he intends to kill her father so he can finally have her, believing that Nicole will get over it and accept him. After Toby retrieves Larry&#x27;s keys and releases his parents, Steven rushes at David. However, David takes him down and gets ready to kill him, until Nicole saves her father by impaling David in the back with a peace pipe (a gift from David himself).

As a hurt David looks at Nicole in shock, Steven gets back up and brawls with him. An enraged David attempts to attack Nicole, but Steven furiously throws him to his death through the bedroom window. The family embraces as the police and paramedics arrive.

==Cast==
==Production==
In March 1994, it was announced that Imagine Entertainment was in the process of putting together a thriller written by Christopher Crowe titled &quot;No Fear&quot;, with James Foley in negotiations to direct.

Leonardo DiCaprio was looked at for the role of David McCall (surnamed McNeil prior to production), but did not think he was right for the part. Instead, he put in a good word for Mark Wahlberg (with whom he co-starred on &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;) to director James Foley.

Reese Witherspoon said she requested a stunt double for the sex scene during the roller coaster sequence, saying:&quot;I didn&#x27;t have control over it. It wasn&#x27;t explicit in the script that that&#x27;s what was going to happen, so that was something that I think the director [James Foley] thought of on his own and then asked me on set if I would do it, and I said, &#x27;No.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t a particularly great experience.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Fear&quot; was released on April 12, 1996, in 1,584 theaters. It opened at number four at the box office, making $6.3 million in its opening weekend. By the end of its run, the film earned $20.8 million in the US.

== Soundtrack ==
# &quot;Jessica&quot; by The Allman Brothers Band
# &quot;Green Mind&quot; by Dink
# &quot;Comedown&quot; by Bush
# &quot;Wild Horses&quot; by The Sundays
# &quot;Machinehead&quot; by Bush

# &quot;Irie Vibe&quot; by One Love.

==Reception==
&quot;Fear&quot; holds a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Fear&quot; has an appealing young cast, but their efforts aren&#x27;t enough to consistently distract from an increasingly overblown – and illogical – teen stalker story&quot;. On Metacritic it has a score of 51% based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Fear&quot; is hard to resist. On one hand, it&#x27;s a shameless thriller that makes up for the inevitability of its story by consistently being bigger, faster, and more appalling than you might expect. On the other hand, it contains enough truth about fathers, teenage daughters, and young lust to distinguish it from most thrillers and ground it in vivid emotion. It is a nightmare fantasy for fathers. Director James Foley and screenwriter Christopher Crowe keep raising the stakes all the way to a finish that&#x27;s something out of &quot;The Straw Dogs&quot;. It&#x27;s a maddening, satisfying, junky, enjoyable picture.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, further accrediting the comparisons to &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. According to him, &quot;&quot;Fear&quot; is a teen &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, with Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon in the Glenn Close and (respectively) Michael Douglas roles, and with William Petersen in Anne Archer&#x27;s. And – surprise – it isn&#x27;t bad.&quot; He did, however, criticize the finale: &quot;[Director] James Foley does a fine job evoking the sexual tensions between father, daughter, and rogue suitor. Yet he has less luck with the (inevitable) garish climax, which is unconvincingly staged... never even making it over the top&quot;.

Gene Siskel gave the film a thumbs-down while Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs-up. Siskel called the picture &quot;Predictable trash with an &#x27;inspired&#x27; title, and with a third act which nosedives into pure mayhem... It&#x27;s shocking that such a film was made by the same director who gave us &quot;At Close Range&quot;, &quot;Glengary Glen Ross&quot;, and &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot;; this one is not worthy of his talent. It should have been titled &quot;Who&#x27;s That Boy&quot;.&quot; Ebert claimed the movie &quot;generates genuine psychological interest, with an effective and suspenseful portrait of a family under siege.&quot;

Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture two out of four stars: &quot;This passable slasher epic benefits from taut, stylish direction and from decent performances; still, it&#x27;s awfully derivative – especially the climactic showdown. Mark Wahlberg is menacing as the lovestruck hood, but he could benefit from diction lessons.&quot;

Critical revaluation of the film has proved more positive than its initial reception, with Carter Burwell&#x27;s score being especially well received. One critic has since stated that &quot;although dismissed by some reviewers upon its release as a sensationalist, hysterical, formulaic piece, &quot;Fear&quot; has improved with age&quot;. The film was placed as No. 19 on Bravo TV&#x27;s &quot;30 Even Scarier Movie Moments&quot;.

==Adaptations==
On May 23, 2019, it was announced that Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment would produce a remake of the film with Brian Grazer again producing, along with Karen Lunder as co-producer. Jonathan Herman was reported to adapt Crowe&#x27;s script for a modern audience and Amandla Stenberg was in talks to star.

In October 2022, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the film is in development at Peacock.

<doc id="594297" wikidata="Q4048401" url="?curid=594297" title="Rogue Trooper">
<text>Rogue Trooper is a science fiction strip in the British comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;, created by Gerry Finley-Day and Dave Gibbons in 1981. It portrays the adventures of a &quot;Genetic Infantryman&quot; named Rogue and three uploaded minds mounted on his equipment who search for the Traitor General who betrayed their regiment to the enemy.

The series was rebooted in 1989 in the story &quot;The War Machine&quot;, featuring a new version of the character called Friday. This version of the character last appeared in 1996. The original character returned in 1999 and all stories since then have featured the original Rogue. The character has also featured in a number of &quot;2000 AD&quot; crossovers.

==Publication history==
Gibbons left the strip early on to be replaced by a succession of artists and writers who have taken the strip in several different directions over the years. Artists to have drawn the character include Brett Ewins, Cam Kennedy and Colin Wilson. This quest continued from 1981 until 1985, when the G.I. had his final confrontation with the traitor general and, after a brief further run set on the Planet Horst, Finley-Day ceased writing the strip. Simon Geller took over, reinventing the character as an intergalactic hitman attempting to end the war by assassinating key figures, but this new direction was dropped in 1989. John Smith wrote a &#x27;flashback&#x27; story, &quot;Cinnabar&quot;, set in Rogue&#x27;s deserter days, before original series artist Dave Gibbons returned to write a much more radical revamp of the character.

In &quot;The War Machine&quot;, Gibbons and artist Will Simpson created a different war, set on a different planet, starring a different Genetic Infantryman, this time called Friday. The bio-chips were dropped, and Gibbons concentrated on the politics and economics of war and the sinister nature of the genetic engineering involved. A new ongoing series featuring Friday followed, written by American writer Michael Fleisher. In Fleisher&#x27;s final story, &quot;Scavenger of Souls&quot;, the bio-chips are reintroduced via an alien &#x27;soul collector&#x27;.

Fleischer was replaced with Steve White, who made the military aspect of the strip more up-to-date and tried to reconcile the two versions of the character. He also reintroduced Venus Bluegenes (Helm&#x27;s treacherous girlfriend from an earlier story who gained a more prominent role during the Simon Geller run) who had her own short spin-off run. His run on the character was the &quot;2000 AD&quot; debut of artist Henry Flint.

The character was rested after White&#x27;s last story in 1996. In 1997 a related character, blue-skinned ambulance pilot Tor Cyan was introduced in the story &quot;Mercy Heights&quot;.

In 2002 the original Rogue was reintroduced, again in flashback to his days hunting the traitor general, written by Gordon Rennie. Artists have included Staz Johnson, Dylan Teague, Mike Collins, Simon Coleby and PJ Holden. In 2004 Rennie stated that he had intended to revamp the character yet again, but had been blocked by &quot;2000 AD&quot; editorial. He also hints that any return to the Rogue Trooper universe will concentrate on supporting cast and not include the Rogue character. This can be seen in the new series &quot;The 86ers&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==
The story is initially set on the planet Nu-Earth, where a war of attrition between two factions, the Norts and Southers, is being fought. The Norts are a fascist society, whom the Traitor General was briefly allied with, while the Southers are democratic.

There are similarities and occasional references to past Earth conflicts including the American Civil War and both World Wars, with the Norts resembling Germany, and the Southers the Allied forces. During the conflict, the use of chemical and biological weapons has poisoned the planet. As a result, what remains of the population of the planet, including the troops of both sides, live in enclosed domed military bases and habitats. They wear protective suits, helmets and respiration gear when outside their domes. These suits are known as &quot;chemsuits&quot;. Any damage to the helmet or chemsuit is usually fatal to the wearer.

In an attempt to bring an end to the stalemate, the Southern High Command have created the GI, or &quot;Genetic Infantryman&quot;. The GI is a soldier genetically engineered to be immune to the poisonous atmosphere of Nu-Earth, and therefore be able to fight without chemsuits. The Southern High Command deploy the entire GI Regiment in a mass spaceborne capsule drop over an area known as &quot;The Quartz Zone&quot;, which resembles one of the Earth&#x27;s poles because the surface has an icy, glass-like nature due to nuclear weapon detonation melting the soil. The assault was intended to be a surprise attack, but because a traitor within the Souther High Command has passed details of it to the Norts, they are expecting it. The Norts employ elite infantry known as the Kashan and Kashar Legions to repulse the assault, and the entire GI Regiment - apart from Rogue - are wiped out. This event is referred to as &quot;The Quartz Zone Massacre&quot;. Rogue, the only surviving G.I., goes AWOL in order to track down the traitor. Along the way he thwarts numerous Nort schemes, discovers and inadvertently destroys the only portion of Nu-Earth not contaminated by chemical weapons, and is betrayed by every female character he encounters.

A later storyline – &quot;MilliCom Memories&quot; – shows how the GIs progress through their training, and that rather than a name each GI has a letter suffixed by their age. Rogue is &quot;R&quot;, Gunnar &quot;G&quot;, Helm &quot;H&quot; and Bagman &quot;B&quot;. Two other troopers &quot;D&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are referenced in the storyline. During their training each GI is given a nickname - Gunnar is so named because of his marksmanship ability. Millicom Memories showed there were other prototype GIs before the development of Rogue&#x27;s class, some of which were killed during his training. Much earlier prototype GIs, created by genetically modifying existing humans featured in the story &quot;First of the Few&quot; in the 1984 2000 AD annual. All except one were killed within 24 hours of deployment on Nu Earth. The final proto-GI died of old age shortly after being discovered by Rogue, saying he had been on Nu Earth &quot;...years and years and years, dog-chip.&quot;

In a multi-part story titled &quot;The Marauders&quot;, Rogue encounters a group of deserters from both Nort and Southern sides, who operate as scavengers from a hidden base and attack both Nort and Southers in order to obtain food, ammunition and supplies. Unknown to Rogue, the commander of The Marauders is the Traitor General. Due to an accident the General was severely burned and is now unrecognisable. The General later reveals himself to Rogue, then captures and tortures him. Rogue eventually escapes, and with the help of one of the Marauders (a Souther pilot known as &#x27;Player&#x27;), defeats the Marauders that pursue him. The Traitor General escapes, destroying the Marauder base as he does so.

In &quot;All Hell on the Dix-I Front&quot; a massive Nort assault forces the Southerners to retreat from a vast area of Nu-Earth, similar to the Ardennes assault of World War II. During this, other elite units of the Nort military are introduced, such as the Sun Legion, a Regiment of solar glider troops, and the Scum Marines, an amphibious assault force. &quot;Sister Sledge&quot;, a pun on the pop group of the same name and a military nurse, accompanies Rogue during the Dix-I campaign. She is secretly an enemy agent known as a &quot;filth columnist&quot;, a play on fifth columnist, and dies in the final episode of the series when Bagman causes her to fall from a boat into the heavily polluted and toxic &quot;Scum Sea&quot;.

&quot;Fort Neuro&quot; introduced a defensive line that had been cut off from both Southers and Norts since the beginning of the war. The Fort has been split into separate sectors by clouds, meaning each sector operates independently of each other, without any contact or cohesion. The soldiers within each sector are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, so the French sector – known as &quot;Franks&quot; – wear Napoleonic era uniforms, and hold grand balls that were popular in that period. Other sectors display similarly erratic behaviour, with the English troops – known as &quot;Lime-ees&quot; – dressing as holiday camp redcoats and behaving as though they are on a perpetual holiday, while the &quot;Rom&quot; garrison fashion themselves as 1950&#x27;s Teddy Boys - or &quot;Romeos&quot;.

Rogue is immune to all known toxins, diseases, and acids, with three known exceptions:
* A new plant is discovered after permafrost is melted in an arctic zone which renders him unconscious.
* In the flashback story &quot;Cinnabar&quot; a retrovirus is engineered specifically to target his immune system, making him susceptible to all other Nu-Earth hazards, ultimately forcing him to wear a chem-suit.
* On Horst, Rogue is bitten by one of the Dragoid creatures, causing him to pass out. As Bagman points out, Rogue was engineered to be resistant to conditions on Nu Earth, not those unique to Horst. However, the toxin quickly wears off, and in fact has a beneficial effect on Rogue.

In a lighter moment during the Fort Neuro series, Rogue is shown to have difficulty breathing when in a staff car full of officers from the &quot;Rom&quot; sector, who in anticipation of a good night out with the neighboring &quot;Scan&quot; sector, have applied too much aftershave.

The Biochips are infected by a latent malady unknowingly contracted whilst passing through the Neverglades area of Nu Earth. The unnamed condition renders them susceptible to &quot;Enzyme E dysfunction&quot;, which causes their newly re-gened bodies to disintegrate, leaving only their bio-chips.

==Historical influences==

Many elements of the Rogue back-story were inspired by World War II, The Vietnam War, the American Civil War and the Cold War. Norts (Northerner Unionists) fought against generally less-well equipped Southers (Southern Confederates), and several battles were referenced, such as the First Battle of Bull Run, which was retold as the &quot;Battle of Mek-Bull Run&quot;. The Norts appear totalitarian in nature. While their uniforms have Nazi connotations their dialect and names are mostly quasi-Slavic, as if they represented a futuristic version of the Soviet Bloc, although there is some usage of German names as well, for example General Vagner, Admiral Torpitz (a play on the German admiral Tirpitz). Their conduct and methods of waging war are also more barbaric than those of the comparatively civilised Southers. Although as the series develops the Southers are also shown committing comparably immoral acts as well. &quot;Genetic Infantryman&quot; is a direct homage to the supposed &quot;Government Issue&quot; tag that American troops were nicknamed after.

The Rogue Trooper has appeared frequently in comics and other media.

===IDW Publishing reboot===

On 20 July 2013, American company IDW Publishing announced that after the success of its adaptation of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; from &quot;2000 AD&quot; it would now champion Rogue Trooper with recoloured old issues as well as completely new stories. On 13 November 2013 it was announced that the new series would be written by British fantasy writer Brian Ruckley and drawn by Alberto Ponticelli. Brian Ruckley acquired the position &quot;by writing a pitch document that people apparently liked.&quot; He described his first challenge as scriptwriter as &quot;I can now say from personal experience that writing comics is not straightforward or effortless!&quot;

The new Rogue Trooper features a re-designed helmet, rifle and backpack which serve as the three main supporting characters in the stories. The first episode was originally set to ship at the end of February 2014, but the first issue was actually released on 5 March 2014. Due to lower-than-expected sales, the decision was made to put the series &quot;on hold&quot;. The final issue of the new Rogue Trooper series was issue 4, published on 21 May 2014. All four issues were collected as a trade paperback and released on 17 September 2014 under the title &quot;Rogue Trooper: Last Man Standing&quot;. The series was reprinted in four issues of the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; (#459 to 462) in 2023.

IDW also published &quot;Rogue Trooper Classics&quot;, a series of recoloured stories from &quot;2000 AD&quot;, in order. It was originally intended to consist of 12 issues (with issue 1 being published on 14 May 2014), but like the new Rogue title, it was cut short, with only 8 issues to be produced in total – again, a result of lower-than-expected sales.

==Other media==
A range of Rogue Trooper material has been produced:

===Novels===
There are three novels based on Rogue Trooper:

* &quot;Crucible&quot; (Gordon Rennie, October 2004 )
* &quot;Blood Relative&quot; (James Swallow, March 2005 )
* &quot;The Quartz Massacre&quot; (Rebecca Levene, March 2006 )

===Boardgames===

The Rogue Trooper Boardgame was released in 1987 by Games Workshop.

EN Publishing released the Rogue Trooper tabletop roleplaying game in 2020.

===Video games===
A number of Rogue Trooper computer games have been released in 1986 and 1990. An isometric shooter by Piranha Software for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum was released in 1986. The game consists of killing Norts while searching Nu-Earth for 8 vid-tapes containing evidence of the Traitor General&#x27;s involvement in the Quartz Zone Massacre. On finding all 8 tapes, Rogue has to return to the Souther base of Milli-Com to prove the General&#x27;s treachery and the extenuating circumstances of his going AWOL. During the game, as well as the vid-tapes, players could also pick up medi-kits to regain health and ammo boxes to feed Gunnar. A platform game incorporating first-person vehicle levels for the Amiga and Atari ST by Krisalis Software came out in 1990.

After Rebellion bought &quot;2000 AD&quot; they released a third-person shooter Rogue Trooper video game in 2006, with a Wii version out in 2009.

In 2009 Rogue Trooper featured a guest role in the game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; for PS3. It came in the form of content which could be bought in the PlayStation Store.

In 2017 Rogue Trooper Redux was released to the current generation PC, PS4, XB1 and Nintendo Switch, developed by Rebellion and TickTock Games.

===Film===
Grant Morrison has spoken about writing a &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot; screenplay for Sam Worthington&#x27;s production company Full Clip Production. On 16 July 2018, Duncan Jones revealed that he will direct the movie, without Full Clip Production.

In 2018, a not-for-profit short fan film directed by Adam Kirley, produced by Joby Stephens, and starring stuntman Damien Walters was released, with its premiere at the International London Sci Fi film festival.

In November 2018, Rebellion Developments announced they were setting up a studio for a film and TV series based on &quot;2000 AD&quot; characters with a Rogue Trooper animated film as one of their projects.

In January 2024, it was announced that principal photography had concluded, with Aneurin Barnard voicing the eponymous character, and Jones reconfirmed as director, writer, and co-producer. The film was animated using Unreal Engine 5.

<text>Louise Lombard (born Louise Marie Perkins; 13 September 1970) is an English actress. She is known for her roles as Evangeline Eliott in the BBC drama series &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; (1991–94), Sofia Curtis in the CBS drama series &quot;&quot; (2004–11) and Trish in the &quot;After&quot; film series.

==Early life and education==
Lombard was born in Redbridge, London, England, the fifth of seven children to Irish immigrant parents. One of her siblings is former footballer Declan Perkins.

Lombard began taking drama lessons when she was eight. She attended Trinity Catholic High School, a Roman Catholic school, from which she achieved nine O Levels. Lombard studied English literature at St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge University

==Career==
Lombard is best known for playing Evangeline Eliott in the 1990s television drama &quot;The House of Eliott&quot;. Her first big break was in the hit series &quot;Chancer&quot;, after which Lombard went on to star in the television dramas &quot;Bodyguards&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; and several films including &quot;Gold in the Streets&quot;, &quot;My Kingdom&quot; and &quot;After the Rain&quot;.

In 1994, she was named one of &quot;People Magazine&quot;″s 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. From 1998 to 2000, Lombard took a career break to study English literature at Cambridge.

In 1998, Lombard starred in &quot;Tale of the Mummy&quot;; and, in 1999, she starred in the film &quot;Esther&quot;, with F. Murray Abraham. In 1999, Lombard starred in &quot;After the Rain&quot; with Ariyon Bakare, Paul Bettany and Peter Krummack.

In 2004, Lombard appeared in the film &quot;Hidalgo&quot;. In November that same year, Lombard began a recurring role on the television series &quot;&quot; during Seasons 5 and 6. She made her first appearance in Season 5, Episode 7 (&quot;Formalities&quot;), playing Sofia Curtis, a crime scene investigator who later becomes a homicide detective. In September 2006, in the Season 7 premiere (&quot;Built to Kill, Part 1&quot;), Lombard began a regular role which she held throughout that season, until its finale (&quot;Living Doll&quot;). In September 2007, Lombard appeared in the Season 8 premiere (&quot;Dead Doll&quot;) and was credited as a Special Guest Star.

In 2009, Lombard appeared in the backdoor pilot episode of &quot;&quot;, which aired during Season 6 of the main &quot;NCIS&quot; series; Episodes 22 (&quot;Legend Part 1&quot;) and 23 (&quot;Legend Part 2&quot;). She played Special Agent Lara Macy in charge of the NCIS Office of Special Projects in Los Angeles.

In March 2011, TVLine announced that Lombard would reprise her role as Sofia Curtis on &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; in the episode &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, which aired on 28 April 2011 and revealed that her character had been promoted to Deputy Chief.

In 2014, Lombard starred in the pilot for the Lifetime post-apocalyptic drama series &quot;The Lottery&quot;.

<doc id="594303" wikidata="Q1784114" url="?curid=594303" title="True airspeed">
<text>The true [[airspeed]] (TAS; also KTAS, for &quot;knots true airspeed&quot;) of an aircraft is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air mass through which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as GPS has become available for civilian use, the importance of such air-measuring instruments has decreased. Since &quot;indicated&quot;, as opposed to &quot;true&quot;, airspeed is a better indicator of margin above the stall, true airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft; for these purposes the indicated airspeed – IAS or KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) – is used. However, since indicated airspeed only shows true speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below . Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account.

==Performance==
TAS is the appropriate speed to use when calculating the range of an airplane. It is the speed normally listed on the flight plan, also used in flight planning, before considering the effects of wind.

==Airspeed sensing errors==
The airspeed indicator (ASI), driven by ram air into a pitot tube and still air into a barometric static port, shows what is called indicated airspeed (IAS). The differential pressure is affected by air density. The ratio between the two measurements is temperature-dependent and pressure-dependent, according to the ideal gas law.

At sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) and at low speeds where air compressibility is negligible (i.e., assuming a constant air density), IAS corresponds to TAS. When the air density or temperature around the aircraft differs from standard sea level conditions, IAS will no longer correspond to TAS, thus it will no longer reflect aircraft performance. The ASI will indicate less than TAS when the air density decreases due to a change in altitude or air temperature. For this reason, TAS cannot be measured directly. In flight, it can be calculated either by using an E6B flight calculator or its equivalent.

For low speeds, the data required are static air temperature, pressure altitude and IAS (or CAS for more precision). Above approximately , the compressibility error rises significantly and TAS must be calculated by the Mach speed. Mach incorporates the above data including the compressibility factor. Modern aircraft instrumentation use an &quot;air data computer&quot; to perform this calculation in real time and display the TAS reading directly on the electronic flight instrument system.

Since temperature variations are of a smaller influence, the ASI error can be estimated as indicating about 2% less than TAS per of altitude above sea level. For example, an aircraft flying at in the international standard atmosphere with an IAS of , is actually flying at TAS.

==Use in navigation calculations== 
To maintain a desired ground track while flying in the moving airmass, the pilot of an aircraft must use knowledge of wind speed, wind direction, and true air speed to determine the required heading. See also wind triangle.

==Calculating true airspeed==
===Low-speed flight===
At low speeds and altitudes, IAS and CAS are close to equivalent airspeed (EAS).

formula_1

TAS can be calculated as a function of EAS and air density:

formula_2

where
:formula_3 is true airspeed,
:formula_4 is equivalent airspeed,
:formula_5 is the air density at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (15 °C and 1013.25 hectopascals, corresponding to a density of 1.225 kg/m3),
:formula_6 is the density of the air in which the aircraft is flying.

===High-speed flight===
TAS can be calculated as a function of Mach number and static air temperature:

formula_7

where 
:formula_8 is the speed of sound at standard sea level (),
:formula_9 is Mach number,
:formula_10 is static air temperature in kelvins,
:formula_11 is the temperature at standard sea level (288.15 K).

For manual calculation of TAS in knots, where Mach number and static air temperature are known, the expression may be simplified to

formula_12

(remembering temperature is in kelvins).

Combining the above with the expression for Mach number gives an expression for TAS as a function of impact pressure, static pressure and static air temperature (valid for subsonic flow):

formula_13

where:
:formula_14 is impact pressure,
:formula_15 is static pressure.

Electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) contain an air data computer with inputs of impact pressure, static pressure and total air temperature. In order to compute TAS, the air data computer must convert total air temperature to static air temperature. This is also a function of Mach number:

formula_16

where
:formula_17 total air temperature.

In simple aircraft, without an air data computer or machmeter, true airspeed can be calculated as a function of calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some airspeed indicators incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).

Sykes was the presenter of the daytime series &quot;Gene Detectives&quot; for BBC One. In 2008, Sykes was a judge on &#x27;The Sofa Factor&#x27;, an item for &quot;GMTV&quot;, where viewers sent in short clips and the winner got to present TV Pick of the Day and win a trip to Las Vegas.

In 2010, Sykes guest presented five episodes of &quot;The 5 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; with Denise van Outen on Channel 4.

In August 2011, Sykes returned to daytime television, co-hosting &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Lunch with Gino &amp; Mel&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Christmas with Gino &amp; Mel&quot; with Gino D&#x27;Acampo on ITV. The show was cancelled in 2014.

On 13 September 2011, Sykes co-hosted the three-part series &quot;Missing Millions&quot; with Paul Heiney on ITV.

In February 2014, BT Sport announced that Sykes would become part of their MotoGP team. Due to other work commitments, she left the channel in May 2014.

In 2014, Sykes took part in the fourteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; where she finished in third place, behind runner-up Jake Quickenden and winner Carl Fogarty.

In 2015, Sykes co-presented &quot;Humble Pie&quot;, a cookery series for Watch, alongside Marco Pierre White. On 4 April 2017, Sykes was confirmed as the new voice of &quot;Blind Date&quot;, taking over the role most famously held by Graham Skidmore in the original series. The show is broadcast on Saturday nights on Channel 5.

In 2017, Sykes appeared on a &quot;celebrity&quot; charity edition of TV quiz show, &quot;The Chase.&quot; She departed early and did not make the final round.

In March 2018, Sykes won Star Baker in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot;.

In 2021 Sykes alongside Joanna Page were the new presenters of BBC One&#x27;s consumer series Shop Well for Less.

In August 2021 it was announced that Sykes would be a competitor on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. She progressed to the semi-final where she won Star Chef on the fourth day. Sykes revealed that a comment, during this period, from &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; judge, Gregg Wallace, led her to end her career in the entertainment industry.

Sykes presented &quot;The A List&quot;, a national radio chart show based on total sales, produced by Unique the Production Company at the studios of London&#x27;s Heart 106.2. She left the show towards the end of 2006 and was replaced by Gail Porter.

Sykes was heard on BBC Radio 2 with Aled Jones sitting in for &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; on 22, 23 and 24 December 2008. In May 2010, she began co-hosting the BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Going Out with Alan Carr&quot; after Emma Forbes&#x27; resignation. Sykes continued on the show until its end in March 2012. She returned on Boxing Day 2015 with Alan Carr for a one-off show on BBC Radio 2. In January/February 2017 she and Carr again returned to Radio 2 to sit in for Paul O&#x27;Grady for 4 weeks.

Sykes and Carr presented their own Saturday morning show called &quot;Alan and Mel&#x27;s Summer Escape&quot; on BBC Radio 2 for 10 weeks during the summer of 2017. She presented a show with Carr on BBC Radio 2 on Christmas Eve and another on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2017. Sykes and Carr returned for further specials for Easter, for the Royal Wedding, and for further runs of &quot;Alan and Mel&#x27;s Summer Escape&quot; in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

For a time, Sykes presented her own radio show on Capital FM.

===Other work===
Sykes has been the face of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo in Britain, appearing in print and television advertising and the high street chain Matalan. She has also appeared in advertisements for Morrisons, Wynsors World of Shoes and Churchill Insurance.

In 2006 the book &quot;Blooming Beautiful: My Plan for Looking Great, Being Healthy and Surviving Hormonal Havoc, Throughout Pregnancy and as a New Mum&quot;, co-written by Sykes with Hilary Boyd, was published by Michael Joseph.

Sykes posed naked for the December 2011 edition of men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Esquire&quot;. Sykes had her own line of underwear and lingerie with high street chain and retailer Debenhams. In June 2016 Sykes created FRANK Magazine, &quot;the magazine for open-minded women of all ages across the world&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was the girlfriend of Matt Goss from early 1991, for five years. Sykes married actor Daniel Caltagirone in January 2001. The couple have two sons, born in 2002 and 2004. In July 2008, it was reported that the couple had separated, with Sykes having &quot;grown apart&quot; from Caltagirone, who had moved out of their Hampstead, London home. They divorced in June 2009. Sykes married Jack Cockings on 18 May 2013 at Sherborne Castle in Dorset.

In November 2013, Sykes was arrested and cautioned by police over a common assault against Cockings. Soon after the caution, after less than one year of marriage, Sykes began the process of filing for divorce. The caution was later revoked and deleted from police records, and Sykes has since campaigned for better treatment of women facing domestic violence, including from partners who make spurious allegations of assault so as to legally and financially harm their victims. She has said that the police handled her case badly and misled her into accepting a caution as the quickest way out of her situation.

In November 2021 Sykes received an autism diagnosis, which she said gave her a &quot;deeper understanding of myself, my life, and the things I have endured&quot;. Her younger son is also autistic, having been diagnosed at three years old. In July 2023 Sykes revealed she had self-diagnosed with Tourette syndrome.

<doc id="594308" wikidata="Q535064" url="?curid=594308" title="Magiritsa">
<text>Magiritsa ( ) is a Greek soup made from lamb offal, associated with the Easter (Pascha) tradition of the Greek Orthodox Church. Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it &quot;Easter soup&quot;, &quot;Easter Sunday soup&quot;, or &quot;Easter lamb soup&quot;. In some parts of Greece, most notably Thessaly, it is not served as soup but rather as a fricassee, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup.

==Traditional use==
Magiritsa is eaten to break the fast of the Greek Orthodox Great Lent, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa consists of the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared on Holy Saturday along with the next day&#x27;s lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the midnight Divine Liturgy.

When eaten on Easter morning after church, magiritsa is sometimes accompanied by salad and cheese, tsoureki sweet bread, and hard-boiled eggs dyed red.

<doc id="594312" wikidata="Q2468712" url="?curid=594312" title="Indicated airspeed">
<text>Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed of an aircraft as measured by its pitot-static system and displayed by the airspeed indicator (ASI). This is the pilots&#x27; primary airspeed reference.

This value is not corrected for installation error, instrument error, or the actual encountered air density, being instead calibrated to always reflect the adiabatic compressible flow of the International Standard Atmosphere at sea level.

It uses the difference between total pressure and static pressure, provided by the system, to either mechanically or electronically measure dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure includes terms for both density and airspeed. Since the airspeed indicator cannot know the density, it is by design calibrated to assume the sea level standard atmospheric density when calculating airspeed. Since the actual density will vary considerably from this assumed value as the aircraft changes altitude, IAS varies considerably from true airspeed (TAS), the relative velocity between the aircraft and the surrounding air mass. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is the IAS corrected for instrument and position error.

An aircraft&#x27;s indicated airspeed in knots is typically abbreviated &quot;KIAS&quot; for &quot;Knots-Indicated Air Speed&quot; (vs. &quot;KCAS&quot; for calibrated airspeed and &quot;KTAS&quot; for true airspeed).

The IAS is an important value for the pilot because it is the indicated speeds which are specified in the aircraft flight manual for such important performance values as the stall speed. These speeds, in true airspeed terms, vary considerably depending upon density altitude. However, at typical civilian operating speeds, the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic structure responds to dynamic pressure alone, and the aircraft will perform the same when at the same dynamic pressure. Since it is this same dynamic pressure that drives the airspeed indicator, an aircraft will always, for example, stall at the published &quot;indicated&quot; airspeed (for the current configuration) regardless of density, altitude or true airspeed.

Furthermore, the IAS is specified in some regulations, and by air traffic control when directing pilots, since the airspeed indicator displays that speed (by definition) and it is the pilot&#x27;s primary airspeed reference when operating below transonic or supersonic speeds.

== Calculation ==

Indicated airspeed measured by pitot-tube can be approximately expressed by the following equation delivered from Bernoulli&#x27;s equation.

:formula_1

NOTE: The above equation applies only to conditions that can be treated as incompressible. Liquids are treated as incompressible under almost all conditions. Gases under certain conditions can be approximated as incompressible. See Compressibility.

The compression effects can be corrected by use of Poisson constant. This compensation corresponds to equivalent airspeed (EAS).
:formula_2

where:
* formula_3 is indicated airspeed in m/s,
* formula_4 is stagnation or total pressure in pascals,
* formula_5 is static pressure in pascals,
* formula_6 is standard atmosphere fluid density in formula_7 at sea level, and
* formula_8 is the specific heat capacity ratio (≈1.401 for air).

==IAS vs CAS==

The IAS is not the actual speed through the air even when the aircraft is at sea level under International Standard Atmosphere conditions (15 °C, 1013 hPa, 0% humidity). The IAS needs to be corrected for known instrument and position errors to show true airspeed under those specific atmospheric conditions, and this is the CAS (Calibrated Airspeed). Despite this the pilot&#x27;s primary airspeed reference, the ASI, shows IAS (by definition). The relationship between CAS and IAS is known and documented for each aircraft type and model.

==IAS and V speeds==

The aircraft&#x27;s pilot manual usually gives critical V speeds as IAS, those speeds indicated by the airspeed indicator. This is because the aircraft behaves similarly at the same IAS no matter what the TAS is: E.g. A pilot landing at a hot and high airfield will use the same IAS to fly the aircraft at the correct approach and landing speeds as when landing at a cold sea level airfield, even though the TAS must differ considerably between the two landings.

Whereas IAS can be reliably used for monitoring critical speeds well below the speed of sound this is not so at higher speeds. An example: Because (1) the compressibility of air changes considerably approaching the speed of sound, and (2) the speed of sound varies considerably with temperature and therefore altitude; the maximum speed at which an aircraft structure is safe, the never exceed speed (abbreviated &quot;V&quot;NE), is specified at several differing altitudes in faster aircraft&#x27;s operating manuals, as shown in the sample table below.

Ref: &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Notes for Tempest V Sabre IIA Engine&quot; - Air Ministry A.P.2458C-PN

==IAS and navigation==

For navigation, it is necessary to convert IAS to TAS and/or ground speed (GS) using the following method:
* correct IAS to calibrated airspeed (CAS) using an aircraft-specific correction table;
* correct CAS to true airspeed (TAS) by using Outside Air Temperature (OAT), Pressure-altitude and CAS on an E6B flight computer or equivalent functionality on most GPSs;
* convert TAS to ground speed (GS) by allowing for the effect of wind.

With the advent of Doppler radar navigation and, more recently, GPS receivers, with other advanced navigation equipment that allows pilots to read ground speed directly, the TAS calculation in-flight is becoming unnecessary for the purposes of navigation estimations.

TAS is the primary method to determine aircraft&#x27;s cruise performance in manufacturer&#x27;s specs, speed comparisons and pilot reports.

==Other airspeeds==
From IAS, the following speeds can also be calculated:
* convert CAS to equivalent airspeed (EAS) by allowing for compressibility effects (not necessary at slow speed or low altitude); EAS is used by aircraft engineers and some very high-altitude flying aircraft such as the U-2 and the SR-71;
* convert EAS to true airspeed (TAS) by allowing for differences in density altitude.

On large jet aircraft the IAS is by far the most important speed indicator. Most aircraft speed limitations are based on IAS, as IAS closely reflects dynamic pressure. TAS is usually displayed as well, but purely for advisory information and generally not in a prominent location.

Modern jet airliners also include ground speed (GS) and Machmeter. Ground speed shows the actual speed that the aircraft uses compared to the ground. This is usually connected to a GPS or similar system. Ground speed is just a pilot aid to estimate if the flight is on time, behind or ahead of schedule. It is not used for takeoff and landing purposes, since the imperative speed for a flying aircraft always is the speed against the wind.

The Machmeter is, on subsonic aircraft, a warning indicator. Subsonic aircraft must not fly faster than a specific percentage of the speed of sound. Usually passenger airliners do not fly faster than around 85% of speed of sound, or Mach 0.85. Supersonic aircraft, like the Concorde and military fighters, use the Machmeter as the main speed instrument with the exception of take-offs and landings.

Some aircraft also have a taxi speed indicator for use on the ground. Since the IAS often starts at around (on jet airliners), pilots may need extra help while taxiing the aircraft on the ground. Its range is around .

<doc id="594313" wikidata="Q602271" url="?curid=594313" title="Metaobject">
<text>In computer science, a metaobject is an object that manipulates, creates, describes, or implements objects (including itself). The object that the metaobject pertains to is called the base object. Some information that a metaobject might define includes the base object&#x27;s type, interface, class, methods, attributes, parse tree, etc. Metaobjects are examples of the computer science concept of reflection, where a system has access (usually at run time) to its own internal structure. Reflection enables a system to essentially rewrite itself on the fly, to alter its own implementation as it executes.

== Metaobject protocol ==
A metaobject protocol (MOP) provides the vocabulary (protocol) to access and manipulate the structure and behaviour of systems of objects. Typical functions of a metaobject protocol include:
*Create or delete a new class
*Create a new property or method
*Cause a class to inherit from a different class (&quot;change the class structure&quot;)
*Generate or change the code defining the methods of a class

Metaobject protocol is contrary to Bertrand Meyer&#x27;s open/closed principle, which holds that software object systems should be &quot;open for extension&quot; but &quot;closed for modification&quot;. This principle effectively draws a distinction between &quot;extending&quot; an object by adding to it, and &quot;modifying&quot; an object by redefining it, proposing that the former is a desirable quality (&quot;&quot;objects should be extensible to meet the requirements of future use cases&quot;), while the latter is undesirable (&quot;objects should provide a stable interface not subject to summary revision&quot;&quot;). Metaobject protocol, by contrast, transparently exposes the internal composition of objects and the entire object system in terms of the system itself. In practice, this means that programmers may use objects to redefine themselves, possibly in quite complex ways.

Furthermore, metaobject protocol is not merely an interface to an &quot;underlying&quot; implementation; rather, through metaobject protocol the object system is recursively implemented in terms of a &quot;meta&quot;-object system, which itself is theoretically implemented in terms of a &quot;meta&quot;-metaobject system, and so on until an arbitrary base case (a consistent state of the object system) is determined, with the protocol as such being the recursive functional relationship between these implementation levels.

Implementing object systems in such a way opens the possibility for radical discretionary redesign, providing deep flexibility but introducing possibly complex or difficult-to-understand metastability issues (for instance, the object system must not destructively update its own metaobject protocol - its internal self-representation - but the potential destructiveness of some updates is non-trivial to predict and may be hard to reason about), depending on the recursive depth to which the desired modifications are propagated. For this reason, metaobject protocol, when present in a language, is usually used sparingly and for specialised purposes such as software that transforms other software or itself in sophisticated ways, for example in reverse engineering.

=== Runtime and compile time ===
When compilation is not available at run-time there are additional complications for the implementation of metaobject protocol. For example, it is possible to change the type hierarchy with such a protocol but doing so may cause problems for code compiled with an alternative class model definition. Some environments have found innovative solutions for this, e.g., by handling metaobject issues at compile time. A good example of this is OpenC++.
The Semantic Web object-oriented model is more dynamic than most standard object systems, and is consistent with runtime metaobject protocols. For example, in the Semantic Web model classes are expected to change their relations to each other and there is a special inference engine known as a classifier that can validate and analyze evolving class models.
=== Usage ===
The first metaobject protocol was in the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language developed at Xerox PARC. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) came later and was influenced by the Smalltalk protocol as well as by Brian C. Smith&#x27;s original studies on 3-Lisp as an infinite tower of evaluators. The CLOS model, unlike the Smalltalk model, allows a class to have more than one superclass; this raises additional complexity in issues such as resolving the lineage of the class hierarchy on some object instance. CLOS also allows for dynamic multimethod dispatch, which is handled via generic functions rather than message passing like in Smalltalk&#x27;s single dispatch. The most influential book describing the semantics and implementation of the metaobject protocol in Common Lisp is &quot;The Art of the Metaobject Protocol&quot; by Gregor Kiczales et al.

Metaobject protocols are also extensively used in software engineering applications. In virtually all commercial CASE, re-engineering, and Integrated Development Environments there is some form of metaobject protocol to represent and manipulate the design artifacts.

A metaobject protocol is one way to implement aspect-oriented programming. Many of the early founders of MOPs, including Gregor Kiczales, have since moved on to be the primary advocates for aspect-oriented programming. Kiczales et al. of PARC were hired to design AspectJ for Java, a language which does not possess a native metaobject protocol.

<text>Lady Lucinda Lambton (born 10 May 1943), also known as Lady Lucinda Worsthorne, is an English writer, photographer, and broadcaster on architectural subjects.

==Early life==
Lucinda Lambton was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest child of the Conservative defence minister Lord Lambton. The family lived in County Durham and London, where her sister Anne Lambton, later to become an actress, was born in 1954.

Lambton spent six years at Queen&#x27;s Gate School, London, then went to a finishing school in Florence, but she ended her education without gaining any qualifications and became a professional photographer working for various newspapers, including the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Her first assignment was working for the historian Frank Atkinson, who was collecting artefacts to form the basis of Beamish Museum in County Durham.

==Marriages==
On 16 January 1965, Lambton married Henry Mark Harrod, eldest son of Sir Roy Harrod. They were divorced in 1973. In January 1986, she married secondly Sir Edmund Cameron-Ramsay-Fairfax-Lucy, 6th Baronet, and divorced him in 1989. In May 1991, she married thirdly the journalist Sir Peregrine Worsthorne, and they stayed together until his death in October 2020.

==Career==
Lambton has researched, written and presented 55 films for the BBC and 25 films for ITV. They include &quot;On The Throne – The History of the Lavatory&quot;, &quot;The Great North Road&quot;, &quot; A Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; and &quot;The Other House of Windsor&quot;. &quot;Sublime Suburbia&quot;, her series of four films for ITV about the architectural and historic delights of London&#x27;s suburbs, won the Regional Television award for the best documentary series of 2003. A further series of &quot;Sublime Suburbia&quot; in six parts, followed in 2004.

She has written and taken the photographs for 14 books including: &quot;Temples of Convenience&quot;, a history of the lavatory; &quot;Beastly Buildings&quot;, about architecture for animals; &quot;Vanishing Victoriana&quot;; &quot;An Album of Curious Houses&quot; and &quot;Lucinda Lambton&#x27;s A-Z of Britain&quot;, a companion to the 26-part television series for the BBC.

Lambton has made presentations, often illustrated with her own slides, throughout the British Isles, and in America. She has been sponsored by the National Art Collections Fund at the Royal Geographical Society, and provided several of the annual talks for the National Trust at The Royal Festival Hall. She has also travelled on board the &quot;QE2&quot; to speak for the National Trust and the Royal Oak Foundation and she has spoken at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. She sometimes opens new buildings and museums, and hosts architectural and canine prize giving events.

She has made several series for BBC Radio 4, including &quot;Bringing the House Down&quot;, &quot;Elevations and Revelations&quot;, &quot;Pride of Place&quot;, an argument against modern architecture, &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; and&quot; Listed&quot;, illuminating efforts of the Twentieth Century Society to save notable post-World War II buildings. She has been a castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

Lambton is a regular contributor to newspapers and magazines, including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Country Life&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Oldie&quot;.

She is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and an honorary member of the Chelsea Arts Club, as well as President of the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings. She is a patron of the Cinema Theatre Association. She is an Honorary Vice President of The Crossness Engines Trust. She is president of the Garden History Society.
