<text>The University of St. Thomas (also known as UST or simply St. Thomas) is a private Catholic research university with campuses in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1885 as a Catholic seminary, it is named after Thomas Aquinas, the medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of students. As of fall 2021, St. Thomas enrolled 9,347 students, making it Minnesota&#x27;s largest private, nonprofit university.

==History==
Founded in 1885 by John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, St. Thomas began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. In 1894, the liberal arts program became an independent college through a gift from local railroad tycoon James J. Hill, who provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary apart from the college. In 1903, the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus, and it was officially termed a military school by the U.S. War Department in 1906. Initially, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915. In 1922, military training became optional.

From the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, who run the University of Notre Dame, controlled the college&#x27;s administration. The diocese called those priests in to help with the school&#x27;s financial problems; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established &quot;Tom Town&quot; on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently the site to the O&#x27;Shaughnessey-Frey Library and O&#x27;Shaughnessey Education Center. Tom Town, made of 20 double-dwelling huts, consisted of white, barracks-like housing units for faculty, students, and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after World War II.

In the latter half of the 20th century, St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs, education in 1950 and business administration in 1974. The school became co-educational in 1977, and although women were not allowed to enroll until then, female students from St. Catherine University (then the College of St. Catherine) often took classes at St. Thomas. Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus, but the staff, faculty, and administration have seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co-education. In 1990, the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year, the university opened the Minneapolis campus. In 2001, St. Thomas reinstated its School of Law at its Minneapolis campus; it had been shut down during the Great Depression. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the speaker at the grand opening.

==Campuses==

===Saint Paul===

The St. Paul campus is the main campus and is home to most undergraduate students. The main campus, built on a farm site once considered &quot;far removed from town&quot;, is located where St. Paul&#x27;s Summit Avenue meets the Mississippi River. The site was farmed by ex-Fort Snelling soldier William Finn, who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty.

The western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park. Summit Avenue, which runs through the middle of the campus, is the country&#x27;s longest span of Victorian homes. This tree-lined avenue includes the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s townhome, and James J. Hill&#x27;s mansion.
In 2005, a new apartment-style residence hall was built on an existing parking lot. McNeely Hall was also built the following year. It is a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name. A new residential village, more parking ramps, and general planning all have been negotiated successfully with the surrounding neighborhood. These developments are expected to begin within the next five years.

In early 2012, St. Thomas completed the final stage of its three-building expansion on the St. Paul campus. The two main additions that were completed are the Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center (AARC) and the Anderson Student Center. These projects were completed in the summer of 2010 and January 2012, respectively. The Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center has a field house, basketball arena, weight room, and swimming pool. The track in the field house is home to the most dominant track team in the MIAC conference. Other St. Thomas sports that use the AARC&#x27;s facilities have also had recent success, including a playoff run for the football team, and a national championship for the men&#x27;s basketball team. The new Anderson Student Center is home to new food venues, as well as entertainment options, including a game room and bowling alley, and a coffee shop. An art gallery on the second floor is home to the American Museum of Asmat Art.

St Thomas&#x27; newest dormitories, Frey Residence Hall and Tommie North Residence Hall, opened on north campus in 2020. Frey Residence Hall is a 5-story facility which houses 260 second-year and transfer students. Tommie North is also a 5-story facility, houses 480 residents and has a 116-stall underground parking ramp. It is connected to the Iverson Center for Faith and Ireland Hall via tunnel and sits on the site of the former John Paul II dormitory.

In 2021, St. Thomas moved forward with plans for a new $110 million, 130,000 square foot building on South Campus called Schoenecker Center. A dedication ceremony to celebrate the latest addition to campus was held on May 8, 2024. The new facility will focus on STEAM fields. The 126-year-old Loras Hall, most recently used as an administrative building, was demolished to make way for Schoenecker Center.

In 2023, the university announced plans for a $175 million on-campus indoor arena known as Lee and Penny Anderson Arena. The 6,000-seat arena is planned to be the home of the basketball and hockey teams in addition to hosting other events such as commencement. Cretin Hall, McCarthy Gymnasium and the Service Center are to be demolished to make way for the arena.

===Minneapolis===

In fall 1992, the university opened a permanent campus at 1000 LaSalle Ave. in Minneapolis. The first building, named Terrence Murphy Hall in May 2000, is headquarters to the university&#x27;s Opus College of Business. Artist Mark Balma created one of the largest frescoes in the United States on the arched ceiling of its atrium. The seven-panel, fresco was completed in the summer of 1994 and portrays the seven virtues discussed in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. The Minneapolis campus also holds St. Thomas&#x27; School of Education, the School of Law, and Schulze School of Entrepreneurship.

===Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center (Owatonna)===
As announced on May 15, 2014, the Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center was to be sold to Meridian Behavioral Health, LLC, with a plan to convert it to a treatment facility for addiction and behavioral disorders. The deal closed in August 2014.
The deal included the entire 180-acre property and all the buildings except for the Winton Guest House, which was designed by architect Frank Gehry. St. Thomas then sold the house at auction and it was moved from the site.

===Bernardi (Rome)===
Since 1999, the University of St. Thomas has been the only university in the United States to have a formal affiliation with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum).

==Academics==

Each year, the university awards almost 2,500 degrees, including five different bachelor&#x27;s degrees (B.A., B.M., B.S., B.S.M.E. and B.S.E.E.). It has 88 major fields at the undergraduate level, with 59 minor fields of study and seven preprofessional programs. At the graduate and professional level, the university offers 41 master&#x27;s degrees, 2 education specialist degree, 1 juris doctor, and 5 doctorates.

===Schools and colleges===

The university offers its degree programs through nine divisions. The College of Arts and Sciences includes undergraduate departments in the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, plus a number of interdisciplinary programs. The Opus College of Business has seven departments offering graduate and undergraduate curricula including Executive Education and Professional Development at University of St. Thomas, and is one of six AACSB accredited business schools in Minnesota. St. Thomas also houses the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, which offers master&#x27;s- and doctoral-level degrees oriented to theological study and the practice of ministry. Saint John Vianney Seminary, a minor college seminary, is also at St. Thomas. Other schools include the School of Education, the School of Engineering, and the School of Social Work. The Master of Social Work is offered as a double degree program with the St. Catherine University.
Schools housed on the Minneapolis campus include the Graduate School of Professional Psychology, Undergraduate and Graduate Schools of Education, Graduate Programs in Software Engineering, and the School of Law, which was re-opened in 1999 after a 66-year hiatus.

The University of St. Thomas is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC), a consortium of five private liberal arts colleges. This program allows students to take classes at one of the associated colleges for no additional cost. Other schools include Hamline University, St. Catherine University, Macalester College, and Augsburg University.

In the Princeton Review 2023 rankings for best undergraduate entrepreneurship programs the St. Thomas Schulze School of Entrepreneurship was ranked 18th in the country.

==Athletics==

St. Thomas&#x27;s school colors are purple and gray, and the athletic teams are called the Tommies. The mascot for these teams is &quot;Tommie&quot;. &quot;Tommy&quot; was changed to the &quot;ie&quot; spelling when women were accepted as full-time students, to be more inclusive.

For most of its athletic history, St. Thomas was a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC), which competes at the NCAA Division III level. Since 1885, athletics have been present on St. Thomas&#x27; campus. The first sports teams that became popular were intramural. The top intramural baseball teams in the 1890s were the &quot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Grays&quot;, which is where the school colors come from. Varsity sports did not begin until 1904, and UST was a founding member of the MIAC in 1920. St. Thomas celebrated its 100th year of varsity athletics in 2003–2004.

St. Thomas&#x27; longtime archrival was Saint John&#x27;s University from Collegeville, Minnesota. Recent national titles include men&#x27;s basketball in 2011 and 2016; men&#x27;s baseball in 2009 and 2001; women&#x27;s softball in 2005 and 2004; men&#x27;s lacrosse (MCLA Division II) in 2019, 2016, 2013, 2012, 2010 and 2009; women&#x27;s volleyball in 2012; and dance team in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2008 and 2006. St. Thomas also won national championships with women&#x27;s basketball in 1991; men&#x27;s cross country in 1986 and 1984; men&#x27;s indoor track in 1985; and women&#x27;s cross country in 1987, 1986, 1984 and 1982. In 2012, St. Thomas played for the first time in the Stagg Bowl in Salem, Virginia, which is the Division III Football National Championship game, against the University of Mount Union, losing 28-10. In 2015, St. Thomas reached the Stagg Bowl for the second time, prompting another championship match against Mount Union. St. Thomas ultimately ended up losing the game, with a final score of 49-35.

WCCO has broadcast radio coverage of Tommies football games since 2011.

On May 22, 2019, it was announced that St. Thomas was &quot;involuntarily removed&quot; from the MIAC. St. Thomas was to have been allowed to remain as a member of the conference until the spring of 2021 while they searched for a new conference had that become necessary but would be allowed to leave at an earlier date should a new conference accept them prior to spring 2021 or should they have decided to become an independent. On October 4, 2019, St. Thomas announced that it had been invited to the Summit League, an NCAA Division I conference. This announcement also noted that St. Thomas had applied for a waiver from the NCAA to move directly from Division III to Division I beginning with the 2021-22 season. While the process of transitioning from Division III to Division I normally takes 12 years and requires transitioning through Division II, on July 15, 2020, the NCAA announced they had approved St. Thomas&#x27;s application to move directly to Division I. As the Summit League does not sponsor football or ice hockey, St. Thomas joined the Pioneer Football League for football, the CCHA for men&#x27;s hockey and the WCHA for women&#x27;s hockey. Starting in the 2026-2027 season, St. Thomas will join the NCHC for men&#x27;s hockey.

==Student life==

===Student housing===

Undergraduate housing is found on the St. Paul Campus. Approximately 2,400 residents live in 10 traditional halls and apartments. Additionally, St. John Vianney College Seminary holds approximately 140 students. All residence halls are co-ed. Residence halls on campus are named after Archbishops of St. Paul-Minneapolis, such as William O. Brady, Austin Dowling, and John Ireland. Built in 1894, Cretin Hall is the oldest hall on campus and was designed (along with Loras and Grace halls) by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray.

Recently the department of residence life has purchased additional buildings on what they are calling &#x27;mid-campus&#x27; in the area between Grand and Summit Avenues. These buildings house men and women transfer students in one of two buildings. There are two apartment complexes that are specifically designed for sophomores. Students are also housed in the residence above the Center for Well-Being.
The University of St. Thomas offers special interest floors, or floors that are intended to house specific residents with similar interests or class standing. Almost one-third of all floors are First Year Experience floors, which consist of only freshmen. This practice attempts to create a cohesive community by placing students together who will have a similar experience. First year students have the opportunity to participate in Living Learning Communities (LLCs). These include Sustainability, Aquinas Scholars, Tommies Do Well(ness), Pathways to Engineering, eMedia, Bridging Divides, Catholic Studies, Major Explorers, and Business for the Common Good.

==Controversy==

===Desmond Tutu===
In 2007, the president of the University of St. Thomas, Father Dennis Dease, cancelled a planned speech by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti-apartheid figure, Desmond Tutu, on the grounds that his presence might offend some members of the local Jewish community. Members of the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace led an email campaign calling on St. Thomas to reconsider its decision, which the president did and invited Tutu to campus. Tutu declined the re-invitation, speaking instead at the Minneapolis Convention Center at an event hosted by Metropolitan State University. However, he addressed the issue two days later while making his final appearance at Metro State.

===Demolition of Foley Theater===
In 2008, plans were announced to the public that the theater department at the University of St. Thomas was to be dissolved and that the school would no longer offer this major. Declining numbers of theater majors was publicly cited as the reason. However, during this same time, plans were underway to make space for a new student center to be named after the Anderson family, then the largest single donors to a single private institution in United States history. Despite protests from senior faculty and students, the decision was made to demolish the theater and dissolve the department the same semester; though, according to the Dean of St. Thomas&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences, Marisa Kelly, the two decisions were &quot;completely unrelated&quot;.

<doc id="593231" wikidata="Q193472" url="?curid=593231" title="Trunk (botany)">
<text>In botany, the trunk (or bole) is the stem and main wooden axis of a tree, which is an important feature in tree identification, and which often differs markedly from the bottom of the trunk to the top, depending on the species.

The trunk is the most important part of the tree for timber production.

==Occurrence==
Trunks occur both in &quot;true&quot; woody plants and non-woody plants such as palms and other monocots, though the internal physiology is different in each case. In all plants, trunks thicken over time due to the formation of secondary growth, or, in monocots, pseudo-secondary growth. Trunks can be vulnerable to damage, including sunburn.

==Vocabulary==
Trunks which are cut down for making lumber are generally called logs; if they are cut to a specific length, called bolts. The term &quot;log&quot; is informally used in English to describe any felled trunk not rooted in the ground, whose roots are detached. A stump is the part of a trunk remaining in the ground after the tree has been felled, or the earth-end of an uprooted tree which retains its un-earthed roots.

== Structure of the trunk ==
The trunk consists of five main parts: The outer bark, inner bark (phloem), cambium, sapwood (live xylem), and heartwood (dead xylem). From the outside of the tree working in: 

* The first layer is the outer bark; this is the protective outermost layer of the trunk.
* Under this is the inner bark which is called the phloem. The phloem is how the tree transports nutrients from the roots to the shoots and vice versa.
* The next layer is the cambium, a very thin layer of undifferentiated cells that divide to replenish the phloem cells on the outside and the xylem cells to the inside. The cambium contains the growth meristem of the trunk.
* Directly inside of the cambium is the sapwood, or the live xylem cells. These cells transport the water through the tree. The xylem also stores starch inside the tree.
* At the center of the tree is the heartwood. The heartwood is made up of dead xylem cells that have been filled with resins and minerals; these keep other organisms from infecting and growing in the center of the tree.

<doc id="593232" wikidata="Q354371" url="?curid=593232" title="Jean-Jacques Sempé">
<text>Jean-Jacques Sempé, usually known as Sempé (; 17 August 1932 – 11 August 2022), was a French cartoonist. He is known for the series of children&#x27;s books he created with René Goscinny, &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot;, and also for his poster-like illustrations, usually drawn from a distant or high viewpoint depicting detailed countrysides or cities. For decades, he created covers for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Early life==
Sempé was born on 17 August 1932 in Pessac, near Bordeaux to a single mother. He was first raised by foster parents, but then his mother took him back in; she lived with his alcoholic stepfather, and the child experienced violence at home. He was expelled from school as a young man, and then failed to pass exams for the post office, a bank and the railways. He then found work selling tooth powder as a door-to-door salesman and also worked delivering wine by bicycle in the Gironde. 

After lying about his age, he joined the French Army in 1950, since it was &quot;the only place that would give me a job and a bed&quot;, he subsequently explained, and would occasionally get into trouble for drawing while he was supposed to be keeping watch during guard duty. Upon being disciplined for one such occurrence, his real age was discovered and he was subsequently discharged. He then moved to Paris and began working with René Goscinny. Sempé spent most of his life in Paris&#x27;s Saint-Germain-des-Prés district.

==Artistic career==

His career started in France within the context of the Franco-Belgian comics industry. His &quot;mute&quot; watercolours or single image sketches, where the characters speak in pictures or not at all (but somehow manage to convey a rich story) slowly gained international attention. He won his first award in 1952 which is given to encourage young amateur artists to turn professional.

Sempé&#x27;s full page cartoons appeared in &quot;Paris Match&quot; for many years. In the 1950s, Sempé became a friend of René Goscinny who would later create &quot;Asterix&quot;. Together, they invented the character &quot;Little Nicolas&quot; in 1959. &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; appeared from 1954 in &quot;Le Moustique&quot; and Sempé drew upon childhood influences and memories to illustrate the comic. In 1960, the comic &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; was published in &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine. It was at the time unusual modern children&#x27;s literature given that it is centred on the experience of the child, rather than an adult interpretation of the world. In general, Sempé rarely drew from life, drawing something every day, putting sketches aside when he got bored with them.

His work has appeared as the cover of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine from 1978, more than a hundred times. He illustrated Süskind&#x27;s 1991 novella &quot;Die Geschichte von Herrn Sommer&quot;. &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; was translated into 30 languages. A translation of his drawings into English, by Anthea Bell, was published in four volumes in 2006: &quot;Nothing is Simple&quot; (1962), &quot;Everything is Complicated&quot; (1963), &quot;Sunny Spells&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mixed Messages&quot; (2003). On the occasion of his 80th birthday, the Wilhelm Busch Museum held an exhibition of his work in 2012.

Based on the drawings from Sempé in the series &quot;Le Petit Nicholas&quot;, the animated film &quot;Little Nicholas: Happy As Can Be&quot; in 2022 is as a beautiful homage to Sempé and Goscinny.

==Personal life and death==
Sempé&#x27;s marriages to fellow artists Christina Courtois and Mette Ivers ended in divorce; he had a daughter from his second marriage. In 2017, he married Martine Gossieaux, his former agent.

Sempé died on 11 August 2022, at age 89. President Emmanuel Macron wrote on Twitter : &quot;Tender irony, the delicatesse of intelligence, the jazz: we will not be able to forget Sempé.&quot;

<doc id="593233" wikidata="Q1020782" url="?curid=593233" title="Trunking">
<text>In telecommunications, trunking is a technology for providing network access to multiple clients simultaneously by sharing a set of circuits, carriers, channels, or frequencies, instead of providing individual circuits or channels for each client. This is reminiscent to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches. Trunking in telecommunication originated in telegraphy, and later in telephone systems where a trunk line is a communications channel between telephone exchanges. 

Other applications include the trunked radio systems commonly used by police agencies. 

In the form of link aggregation and VLAN tagging, trunking has been applied in computer networking.

==Telecommunications==
A trunk line is a circuit connecting telephone switchboards (or other switching equipment), as distinguished from local loop circuit which extends from telephone exchange switching equipment to individual telephones or information origination/termination equipment.

Trunk lines are used for connecting a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed they can be used by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station’s telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN, PRI or SIP. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks.

In the UK and the Commonwealth countries, a &quot;trunk call&quot; was the term for long-distance calling which traverses one or more trunk lines and involving more than one telephone exchange. This is in contrast to making a local call which involves a single exchange and typically no trunk lines.

Trunking also refers to the connection of switches and circuits within a telephone exchange. Trunking is closely related to the concept of grading. Trunking allows a group of inlet switches at the same time. Thus the service provider can provide a lesser number of circuits than might otherwise be required, allowing many users to &quot;share&quot; a smaller number of connections and achieve capacity savings.

==Computer networks==
===Link aggregation===
In computer networking, port trunking is the use of multiple concurrent network connections to aggregate the link speed of each participating port and cable, also called link aggregation. Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network.

===VLAN===
In the context of Ethernet VLANs, Cisco uses the term to mean carrying multiple VLANs through a single network link through the use of a trunking protocol. To allow for multiple VLANs on one link, frames from individual VLANs must be identified. The most common and preferred method, IEEE 802.1Q, adds a tag to the Ethernet frame labeling it as belonging to a certain VLAN. Since 802.1Q is an open standard it can work with equipment from any vendor. Cisco also has a (now deprecated) proprietary trunking protocol called Inter-Switch Link which encapsulates the Ethernet frame with its own container, which labels the frame as belonging to a specific VLAN. 3Com used proprietary &quot;Virtual LAN Trunking&quot; (VLT) before 802.1Q was defined.

==Radio communications==

In two-way radio communications, trunking refers to the ability of transmissions to be served by free channels whose availability is determined by algorithmic protocols. In conventional (i.e., not trunked) radio, users of a single service share one or more exclusive radio channels and must wait their turn to use them, analogous to the operation of a group of cashiers in a grocery store, where each cashier serves his/her own line of customers. The cashier represents each radio channel, and each customer represents a radio user transmitting on their radio.

Trunked radio systems (TRS) pool all of the cashiers (channels) into one group and use a store manager (site controller) that assigns incoming shoppers to free cashiers as determined by the store&#x27;s policies (TRS protocols).

In a TRS, individual transmissions in any conversation may take place on several different channels. In the shopping analogy, this is as if a family of shoppers checks out all at once and are assigned different cashiers by the traffic manager. Similarly, if a single shopper checks out more than once, they may be assigned a different cashier each time.

Trunked radio systems provide greater efficiency at the cost of greater management overhead. The store manager&#x27;s orders must be conveyed to all the shoppers. This is done by assigning one or more radio channels as the &quot;control channel&quot;. The control channel transmits data from the site controller that runs the TRS, and is continuously monitored by all of the field radios in the system so that they know how to follow the various conversations between members of their talkgroups (families) and other talkgroups as they hop from radio channel to radio channel.

TRS&#x27;s have grown massively in their complexity since their introduction, and now include multi-site systems that can cover entire states or groups of states. This is similar to the idea of a chain of grocery stores. The shopper generally goes to the nearest grocery store, but if there are complications or congestion, the shopper may opt to go to a neighboring store. Each store in the chain can talk to each other and pass messages between shoppers at different stores if necessary, and they provide backup to each other: if a store has to be closed for repair, then other stores pick up the customers.

TRS&#x27;s have greater risks to overcome than conventional radio systems in that a loss of the store manager (site controller) would cause the system&#x27;s traffic to no longer be managed. In this case, most of the time the TRS will automatically switch to an alternate control channel, or in more rare circumstances, conventional operation. In spite of these risks, TRS&#x27;s usually maintain reasonable uptime.

TRS&#x27;s are more difficult to monitor via radio scanner than conventional systems; however, larger manufacturers of radio scanners have introduced models that, with a little extra programming, are able to follow TRS&#x27;s quite efficiently.

<text>Harvard Square is a triangular plaza at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street and John F. Kennedy Street near the center of Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The term &quot;Harvard Square&quot; is also used to delineate the business district and Harvard University surrounding that intersection, which is the historic center of Cambridge. Adjacent to Harvard Yard, the historic heart of Harvard University, the Square (as it is sometimes called, locally) functions as a commercial center for Harvard students, as well as residents of western Cambridge, the western and northern neighborhoods and the inner suburbs of Boston. The Square is served by Harvard station, a major MBTA Red Line subway station and a bus transportation hub.

The name &quot;Harvard Square&quot; can also refer to the entire neighborhood surrounding this intersection for several blocks in each direction, including Brattle Square, a block away, and the nearby Cambridge Common. The Common is a park area with a playground, baseball field, and a number of monuments, several relating to the Revolutionary War.

== Location ==
The heart of Harvard Square is the junction of Massachusetts Avenue and Brattle Street. Massachusetts Avenue enters from the southeast (a few miles after crossing the Charles River from Boston at MIT), and turns sharply to the north at the intersection, which is dominated by a large pedestrian space incorporating the current MBTA subway headhouse (entrance), an older subway headhouse building which formerly housed a newsstand, a visitor information kiosk, and a small open-air performance space (&quot;The Pit&quot;). Brattle Street and John F. Kennedy Street merge from the southwest, joining Massachusetts Avenue at 1 Brattle Street, where another newsstand used to be located. The Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society main building forms the western streetwall at the intersection, along with a bank and some retail shops.

===Nearby places===
The walled enclosure of Harvard Yard is adjacent, with Harvard University, Harvard Extension School, Harvard Art Museums, Semitic Museum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and Museum of Natural History just short walks away.

Other institutions in the general neighborhood include the Cambridge Public Library, Lesley University, the Longy School of Music, the Episcopal Divinity School, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, American Repertory Theater, the Cooper-Frost-Austin House, the Hooper-Lee-Nichols House, and the Longfellow House–Washington&#x27;s Headquarters National Historic Site.

The high pedestrian traffic makes Harvard Square and Brattle Square, a block away, a gathering place for street musicians and buskers (who must obtain a permit from the Cambridge Arts Council). Singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, who attended nearby Tufts University, is known to have played here during her college years. Amanda Palmer, of the Dresden Dolls, regularly performed here as a &quot;living statue&quot;. Another frequent performer over the years has been indie rock guitarist Mary Lou Lord. The Flying Karamazov Brothers also performed regularly in Brattle Square.

A small bronze statue of &quot;Doo Doo,&quot; a puppet created by Igor Fokin, sits at the corner of Brattle and Eliot streets, in honor of Fokin and all the street performers. Fokin performed regularly in Brattle Square after immigrating from Russa and before his untimely death.

=== Other features ===

Until 1984, the Harvard Square stop was the northern terminus of the Red Line, and it still functions as a major transfer station between subway, bus, and trackless trolley. Most of the bus lines serving the area from the north and west run through a tunnel adjacent to the subway tunnel. Originally built for streetcars (which last ran in 1958) and still used by trackless trolleys as well as ordinary buses, the tunnel lessens bus traffic in central Harvard Square, and lets buses cross the Square without encountering automobile traffic. The tunnel also allows covered access between the subway and the buses.

At the center of the Square is the old Harvard Square Subway Kiosk, which held a newsstand Out of Town News until its close in 2020. A public motion art installation, &quot;Lumen Eclipse&quot;, shows monthly exhibitions of local, national, and international artists.

In the southwest of the neighborhood, on Mount Auburn St, stands the Igor Fokin Memorial. This memorial, created by sculptor Konstantin Simun, pays tribute not only to the late puppeteer, but to all street performers that are an integral part of the square.

A number of public squares dot the surrounding streets, notably Brattle Square and Winthrop Square, hosting a wide variety of street performers throughout the year. Brattle Street itself is home to the Brattle Theater (a non-profit arthouse theater) and the American Repertory Theater. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Park, one block further down JFK Street, is on the bank of the Charles River. Cambridge Common is two blocks north.

== History ==

Although today a commercial center, the Square had famous residents in earlier periods, including the colonial poet Anne Bradstreet. 
=== Transformation ===
Discussions of how the Square has changed in recent years usually center on the gentrification of the Harvard Square neighborhood and Cambridge in general. The Square also used to be a neighborhood shopping center, including a grocery store (Sages) and a Woolworth&#x27;s five and ten. Although a hardware store (Dickson Hardware at 26 Brattle Street) survived until 2021 amid chain drug stores and bank branches, the Square is mainly a regional rather than neighborhood shopping destination, serving students and commuters.

In 1981 and 1987 the Harvard Square Theater was converted into a multiplex cinema; it later became part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain and then closed on July 8, 2012. During the late 1990s, some locally run businesses with long-time shopfronts on the Square—including the unusual Tasty Diner, a tiny sandwich shop open long hours, and the Wursthaus, a German restaurant with an extensive beer menu—closed to make way for national chains. Elsie&#x27;s Lunch, a long-popular deli, has also closed; what remained of its small corner storefront space facing Lowell House on Mount Auburn Street is now occupied by an ATM. Another long-time restaurant, the 64-year-old Leo&#x27;s Place, closed in December 2013 when the landlord of the property terminated their lease.

The student co-op, the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society (&quot;The Coop&quot;, founded in 1882) is now managed by Barnes &amp; Noble, though it is still overseen by a board elected by its membership of Harvard and MIT students and staff. Schoenhof&#x27;s Foreign Books is owned by the French Éditions Gallimard. Major bookstores Paperback Booksmith, Reading International, and Barilari Books had closed by the end of the 1990s. WordsWorth Books at 30 Brattle Street closed in 2004, after 29 years as a fixture in the Square. In the same year, the famous Grolier Poetry Bookshop announced that it would be sold (although it survived under new management). Globe Corner Bookstore converted to an exclusively online business, serving its last walk-in customer on July 4, 2011.

Following national trends, the former Harvard Trust Company has been absorbed into the national Bank of America through a series of mergers. Several establishments remain as longstanding, locally-run businesses with unique styles. Examples include Leavitt &amp; Peirce tobacconists (est. 1883), Laflamme Barber Shop (est. 1898), Harvard Book Store (est. 1932), Cardullo&#x27;s Gourmet Shoppe (est. 1950), Charlie&#x27;s Kitchen (est. 1951), the Brattle Theater (est. 1953), the Hong Kong Chinese restaurant (est. 1954), Club Passim (est. 1958), Café Pamplona (est. 1959), Mr. Bartley&#x27;s Burger Cottage (est. 1960), Million Year Picnic comics (est. 1970), Algiers Coffee House (est. 1970), and Grendel&#x27;s Den (est. 1971).

==In film and other media==
The 1969 film &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; takes place in Harvard Square near the film&#x27;s conclusion, after the Richard Benjamin character learns that his girlfriend, Brenda Potimkin (played by Ali MacGraw), an undergraduate at Radcliffe College, had left her diaphragm in the top drawer of her bureau at home for her mother to discover.
The 1970 film &quot;Love Story&quot;, by the late Harvard University alumnus and Yale University professor of classics Erich Segal, takes place almost entirely in and around Harvard Square during its first two-thirds, while Harvard undergraduates Oliver Barrett and Jenny Cavalieri meet; finish college; get married; and Oliver goes to Harvard Law School while Jenny teaches school, living in a second-story walk-up in Agassiz. The film continues to be screened annually to incoming freshmen at Harvard College during orientation week.

The 2005 documentary film &quot;Touching History; Harvard Square, the Bank, and The Tasty Diner&quot; chronicles the changing face of the Square, as a small diner (The Tasty) closes its doors to make way for a large retail space.

Ben Affleck shot portions of his film &quot;The Town&quot; (2010) in Grendel&#x27;s Den on Winthrop Street, locally famous in the 1970s for its chocolate fondue.

The 2015 game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; features Harvard Square as an in-game location. Though the layout of the surrounding area is not accurate, the Cambridge visitor&#x27;s Center kiosk is present.

===&quot;Car Talk Plaza&quot;===
The radio show &quot;Car Talk&quot;&#x27;s offices occupied the third floor of the Abbott Building from 1992 until the show&#x27;s end in 2014. At the beginning of every episode, hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi would state they were broadcasting from &quot;Car Talk Plaza&quot; in Harvard (though the show itself was recorded at the WBUR Studio in Boston). Local tourism and business leaders likewise refer to the area colloquially as &quot;Car Talk Plaza&quot;. The office&#x27;s window, which faces the square, reads &quot;Dewey Cheetham &amp; Howe&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;. Though the former office is now a yoga studio, the window signage has remained. In the early 2020s, while redeveloping the Abbott Building, the executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission ensured the sign&#x27;s preservation, calling it &quot;a character-defining feature of [the Abbott] building&quot;. In 2019, a commemorative plaque for Tom Magliozzi - who died in 2014 - was installed outside the Abbott Building beside the Harvard Red Line terminal. Harvard Square, called &quot;Car Talk Plaza&quot;, is also the setting of &quot;Click and Clack&#x27;s As the Wrench Turns&quot;, an animated television spin-off of &quot;Car Talk&quot;.

<doc id="593250" wikidata="Q7869412" url="?curid=593250" title="USS Florence Nightingale">
<text>USS &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; (AP-70) was a Maritime Commission type C3-M cargo ship built as Mormacsun for Moore-McCormack Lines. &quot;Mormacsun&quot; operated for Moore-McCormack from May 1941 until December 1941 when she came under the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for the duration of World War II. The ship operated with Moore-McCormack as the WSA agent, playing an important role in early supply of the Southwest Pacific, until transfer to the United States Navy September 1942 and commissioning as &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; whereupon she became an &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot;-class transport ship. She was named for Florence Nightingale (1820–1910), the nursing pioneer, and is one of the few United States Navy ships named after a woman. The ship was returned to WSA in 1946 and then to Moore-McCormack operating as &quot;Mormacsun&quot; until sold to operate as &quot;Japan Transport&quot; and lastly as &quot;Texas&quot;.

==Construction and pre Navy operations==

&quot;Mormacsun&quot; was launched on 28 August 1940 by Moore Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Oakland, California sponsored by Miss Carlotta S. Chapman. She was delivered to Moore-McCormack Lines in May 1941 and placed under the War Shipping Administration on 20 December 1941 at San Francisco allocated to operate under U.S. Army charter by Moore-McCormack.

The new ship, with 67 crated P-40s—more aircraft than the larger could transport, was one of six ships involved in delivery of vitally needed pursuit aircraft intended for the Philippines and diverted to Australia during early February 1942. &quot;Mormacsun&quot; departed San Francisco unescorted on 26 December 1941 loaded with aircraft, ammunition and bombs, including 9.2 million .30 caliber rounds, almost 16,500 81 mm mortar rounds, 2,952 300-pound and 13,855 100-pound bombs. Outbound the ship was attacked by friendly aircraft but escaped without damage to arrive in Brisbane 19 January 1942. The ship was drafted into the effort to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines but was under orders to go no further than the Netherlands Indies to transship cargo to smaller vessels. The transfer of cargo destined for the Philippines was actually made from &quot;Mormacsun&quot; to two smaller vessels, the British &quot;Hanyang&quot; and &quot;Yochow&quot; of The China Navigation Company, at Perth but after the Bombing of Darwin those vessels returned to Australia where the supplies were unloaded.

On 12 August 1942 in New York the ship was delivered to War Department custody awaiting bareboat charter and operation by the US Navy on 13 September 1942.

==Naval service history==
&quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; was commissioned 17 September 1942 as AP-70. The ship sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 23 October 1942 in the task force bound for the invasion of North Africa, and between 8–15 November lay off Port Lyautey, Morocco, landing troops and cargo. Returning to Norfolk on 30 November, she made two voyages to Algeria, carrying reinforcements and cargo out, and prisoners of war back, returning to New York from the second, on 11 March 1943. After brief overhaul and exercising in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; sailed from Norfolk on 8 June with troops for the invasion of Sicily, landing them through hazardous surf conditions at Scoglitti from 10 to 12 July.

Returning to New York on 3 August 1943, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; voyaged to Oran in September, and on 8 October sailed from New York for Belfast, Northern Ireland. She carried men from Glasgow, Scotland, to Iceland, before returning to Boston on 17 November to load for the first of two transport voyages to the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, from New York. Laden with soldiers and nurses, she sailed from New York on 27 February 1944 for Cardiff, where she landed her original passengers, then sailed to Belfast to embark soldiers for the Mediterranean Sea. From 21 March, she carried troops among Mediterranean bases, and took part in landing operations in preparation for the invasion of southern France, for which she sortied from Naples on 13 August. She landed her troops in the initial assault on 15 August, and returned with casualties to Naples three days later. Until 25 October, when she sailed for home, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; brought reinforcements from Oran to the fighting in southern France.

Overhauled at New York from 8 November – 18 December, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; loaded Marines at Norfolk, and with them arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945. Here she debarked the Marines and loaded soldiers and Army equipment for the Marianas. She sailed among these islands, transporting casualties, mail, and cargo to Guam, made one cargo voyage to Ulithi, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 March. On 7 April, again troop laden, she got underway for Okinawa, off which she lay to discharge reinforcements from 3–8 May, undergoing many air raids but suffering no damage.

The transport reached San Francisco from action waters on 27 May 1945, and sailed 11 days later to carry men of naval construction battalions and their equipment to Okinawa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 August to begin occupation transport duty, which found her calling at Eniwetok and Yokosuka before her return to Portland, Oregon, on 15 November.

Between 21 November and 6 December 1945 the &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; transported Project Paperclip V-2 rocket scientists, including Hans Lindenberg, from Le Havre to New York.

Between 13 December and 16 February 1946, she again voyaged to the Far East, carrying occupation troops to Korea, and returning to Long Beach, California, with servicemen eligible for discharge. At Long Beach she loaded German prisoners of war, with whom she sailed for Liverpool, England, on 26 February. Landing the homeward-bound Germans in England for further transfer, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; embarked troops at Le Havre for transportation to New York City, where she docked on 8 April 1946. The transport was decommissioned on 1 May 1946 and transferred to the War Shipping Administration the same day.

&quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

==Commercial operation==
On 1 May 1946, the ship was delivered to Moore-McCormack Lines at Hoboken, New Jersey and operated for the line until sold to Pacific Transport Lines in July 1953 and renamed &quot;Japan Transport&quot;. The ship was then sold to States Steamship Co. August 1957 and renamed &quot;Texas&quot;. The ship was traded in to the government on 20 May 1966, placed in the Olympia, Washington reserve fleet until sold for scrap to Zidell Explorations on 2 November 1970.

<doc id="593255" wikidata="Q725699" url="?curid=593255" title="Venturi effect">
<text>The Venturi effect is the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a moving fluid speeds up as it flows from one section of a pipe to a smaller section. The Venturi effect is named after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Giovanni Battista Venturi, and first published in 1797.

The effect has various engineering applications, as the reduction in pressure inside the constriction can be used both for measuring the fluid flow and for moving other fluids (e.g. in a vacuum ejector).

==Background==
In inviscid fluid dynamics, an incompressible fluid&#x27;s velocity must &quot;increase&quot; as it passes through a constriction in accord with the principle of mass continuity, while its static pressure must &quot;decrease&quot; in accord with the principle of conservation of mechanical energy (Bernoulli&#x27;s principle) or according to the Euler equations. Thus, any gain in kinetic energy a fluid may attain by its increased velocity through a constriction is balanced by a drop in pressure because of its loss in potential energy.

By measuring the pressure difference without needing to measure the actual pressures at the two points, the flow rate can be determined, as in various flow measurement devices such as Venturi meters, Venturi nozzles and orifice plates.

Referring to the adjacent diagram, using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation in the special case of steady, incompressible, inviscid flows (such as the flow of water or other liquid, or low-speed flow of gas) along a streamline, the theoretical static pressure drop at the constriction is given by

formula_1

where formula_2 is the density of the fluid, formula_3 is the (slower) fluid velocity where the pipe is wider, and formula_4 is the (faster) fluid velocity where the pipe is narrower (as seen in the figure). The static pressure at each position is measured using a small tube either outside and ending at the wall or into the pipe where the small tube is perpendicular to the flow direction. 

=== Choked flow ===
The limiting case of the Venturi effect is when a fluid reaches the state of choked flow, where the fluid velocity approaches the local speed of sound of the fluid. When a fluid system is in a state of choked flow, a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment will not lead to an increase in velocity, unless the fluid is compressed.

The mass flow rate for a compressible fluid will increase with increased upstream pressure, which will increase the density of the fluid through the constriction (though the velocity will remain constant). This is the principle of operation of a de Laval nozzle. Increasing source temperature will also increase the local sonic velocity, thus allowing increased mass flow rate, but only if the nozzle area is also increased to compensate for the resulting decrease in density.

===Expansion of the section===

The Bernoulli equation is invertible, and pressure should rise when a fluid slows down. Nevertheless, if there is a shortened expansion in the tube section, turbulence is more likely to appear, and the theorem will not hold. Generally in Venturi tubes, the pressure in the entrance is compared to the pressure in the middle section and the output section is never compared with them.

==Experimental apparatus==

===Venturi tubes===
The simplest apparatus is a tubular setup known as a Venturi tube or simply a Venturi (plural: &quot;Venturis&quot; or occasionally &quot;Venturies&quot;). Fluid flows through a length of pipe of varying diameter. To avoid undue aerodynamic drag, a Venturi tube typically has an entry cone of 30 degrees and an exit cone of 5 degrees.

Venturi tubes are often used in processes where permanent pressure loss is not tolerable and where maximum accuracy is needed in case of highly viscous liquids.

===Orifice plate===
Venturi tubes are more expensive to construct than simple orifice plates, and both function on the same basic principle. However, for any given differential pressure, orifice plates cause significantly more permanent energy loss.

==Instrumentation and measurement==
Both Venturi tubes and orifice plates are used in industrial applications and in scientific laboratories for measuring the flow rate of liquids.

===Flow rate===
A Venturi can be used to measure the volumetric flow rate, formula_5, using Bernoulli&#x27;s principle.

Since
formula_6

then
formula_7
A Venturi can also be used to mix a liquid with a gas. If a pump forces the liquid through a tube connected to a system consisting of a Venturi to increase the liquid speed (the diameter decreases), a short piece of tube with a small hole in it, and last a Venturi that decreases speed (so the pipe gets wider again), the gas will be sucked in through the small hole because of changes in pressure. At the end of the system, a mixture of liquid and gas will appear. See aspirator and pressure head for discussion of this type of siphon.

===Differential pressure===

As fluid flows through a Venturi, the expansion and compression of the fluids cause the pressure inside the Venturi to change. This principle can be used in metrology for gauges calibrated for differential pressures. This type of pressure measurement may be more convenient, for example, to measure fuel or combustion pressures in jet or rocket engines.

The first large-scale Venturi meters to measure liquid flows were developed by Clemens Herschel who used them to measure small and large flows of water and wastewater beginning at the end of the 19th century. While working for the Holyoke Water Power Company, Herschel would develop the means for measuring these flows to determine the water power consumption of different mills on the Holyoke Canal System, first beginning development of the device in 1886, two years later he would describe his invention of the Venturi meter to William Unwin in a letter dated June 5, 1888.

=== Compensation for temperature, pressure, and mass ===

Fundamentally, pressure-based meters measure kinetic energy density. Bernoulli&#x27;s equation (used above) relates this to mass density and volumetric flow:

formula_8

where constant terms are absorbed into &quot;k&quot;. Using the definitions of density (formula_9), molar concentration (formula_10), and molar mass (formula_11), one can also derive mass flow or molar flow (i.e. standard volume flow):

formula_12

However, measurements outside the design point must compensate for the effects of temperature, pressure, and molar mass on density and concentration. The ideal gas law is used to relate actual values to design values:

formula_13
formula_14

Substituting these two relations into the pressure-flow equations above yields the fully compensated flows:

formula_15

&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;n&quot; are easily isolated by dividing and taking the square root. Note that pressure-, temperature-, and mass-compensation is required for every flow, regardless of the end units or dimensions. Also we see the relations:

formula_16

==Examples==
{{excessive examples|section|date=February 2024}}

The Venturi effect may be observed or used in the following:

===Machines===
* During Underway replenishment the helmsman of each ship must constantly steer away from the other ship due to the Venturi effect, otherwise they will collide.
* Cargo eductors on oil product and chemical ship tankers
* Inspirators mix air and flammable gas in grills, gas stoves and Bunsen burners
* Water aspirators produce a partial vacuum using the kinetic energy from the faucet water pressure
* Steam siphons use the kinetic energy from the steam pressure to create a partial vacuum
* Atomizers disperse perfume or spray paint (i.e. from a spray gun or airbrush)
* Carburetors often use the effect to force gasoline into an engine&#x27;s intake air stream at the throat by the difference between the pressure there and at the upstream start of the converging wall (which is fed to the float bowl). In other carburetors ambient air pressure can be fed to the float bowl, in which case the effect comes from Bernoulli&#x27;s principle.
* Cylinder heads in piston engines have multiple Venturi areas like the valve seat and the port entrance, although these are not part of the design intent, merely a byproduct and any venturi effect is without specific function.
* Wine aerators infuse air into wine as it is poured into a glass
* Protein skimmers filter saltwater aquaria
* Automated pool cleaners use pressure-side water flow to collect sediment and debris
* Clarinets use a reverse taper to speed the air down the tube, enabling better tone, response and intonation
* The leadpipe of a trombone, affecting the timbre
* Industrial vacuum cleaners use compressed air
* Venturi scrubbers are used to clean flue gas emissions
* Injectors (also called ejectors) are used to add chlorine gas to water treatment chlorination systems
* Steam injectors use the Venturi effect and the latent heat of evaporation to deliver feed water to a steam locomotive boiler.
* Sandblasting nozzles accelerate and air and media mixture
* Bilge water can be emptied from a moving boat through a small waste gate in the hull. The air pressure inside the moving boat is greater than the water sliding by beneath.
* A scuba diving regulator uses the Venturi effect to assist maintaining the flow of gas once it starts flowing
* In recoilless rifles to decrease the recoil of firing
* The diffuser on an automobile
* Race cars utilising ground effect to increase downforce and thus become capable of higher cornering speeds
* Foam proportioners used to induct fire fighting foam concentrate into fire protection systems
* Trompe air compressors entrain air into a falling column of water
* The bolts in some brands of paintball markers
* Low-speed wind tunnels can be considered very large Venturi because they take advantage of the Venturi effect to increase velocity and decrease pressure to simulate expected flight conditions.

===Architecture===
* Hawa Mahal of Jaipur, also utilizes the Venturi effect, by allowing cool air to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
* Large cities where wind is forced between buildings - the gap between the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center was an extreme example of the phenomenon, which made the ground level plaza notoriously windswept. In fact, some gusts were so high that pedestrian travel had to be aided by ropes.
* In the south of Iraq, near the modern town of Nasiriyah, a 4000-year-old flume structure has been discovered at the ancient site of Girsu. This construction by the ancient Sumerians forced the contents of a nineteen kilometre canal through a constriction to enable the side-channeling of water off to agricultural lands from a higher origin than would have been the case without the flume. A recent dig by archaeologists from the British museum confirmed the finding.

===Nature===
* In windy mountain passes, resulting in erroneous pressure altimeter readings
*The mistral wind in southern France increases in speed through the Rhone valley.

<text>West Papua (), formerly Irian Jaya Barat (West Irian), is an Indonesian province located in Indonesia Papua. It covers most of the two western peninsulas of the island of New Guinea: the eastern half of the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula (or Doberai Peninsula) and the whole of the Bomberai Peninsula, along with nearby smaller islands. The province is bordered to the north by the Pacific Ocean, to the west by Southwest Papua Province, the Halmahera Sea and the Ceram Sea, to the south by the Banda Sea, and to the east by the province of Central Papua and the Cenderawasih Bay. Manokwari is the province&#x27;s capital and largest city. With an estimated population of 569,570 in mid-2023 (comprising 299,745 males and 269,825 females), West Papua is the least populous province in Indonesia after South Papua, following the separation off in 2022 of the western half of the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula to create the new province of Southwest Papua, containing 52% of what had been West Papua&#x27;s population. Its population density is similar to Russia.

After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Dutch remained in New Guinea until 1962 when they transferred the control of the region to the Indonesian government as a part of the New York Agreement. West Papua was legally created as a province in 1999 (out of the original Papua Province), but it was not inaugurated until 2003. Consisting until 2022 of twelve regencies and one city, the province has a special autonomous status as granted by Indonesian legislation.

West Papua has a medium Human Development Index. The Indonesian government has launched the building of ambitious infrastructure projects including the Trans-Papua Highway, airports, and other facilities. Detractors claim that these projects threaten Southeast Asia&#x27;s and Oceania&#x27;s last large regions of tropical rainforests and native cultures. According to Bank Indonesia, West Papua recorded an economic growth rate of 7.7% during 2018, which is higher than the national economic growth.

==History==
===Etymology===
There are several theories regarding the origin of the word Papua. One theory is that the name comes from the word &#x27;Papo-Ua&#x27;, named by the Tidore Sultanate, which in the Tidore language means &quot;not joining&quot; or &quot;not being united&quot;, meaning that the island had no king.&quot;&quot; Before the age of colonization, the Tidore Sultanate controlled some parts of the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula in what is now the province of Southwest Papua before expanding to also include coastal regions in the current province of Papua. This relationship played an important historical role in binding Indonesia to the Papua. Another theory is that the word Papua comes from the Malay word &#x27;papuwah&#x27;, which means &#x27;frizzled hair&#x27;. It was first mentioned in 1812 Malay Dictionary by William Marsden, although it was not found on earlier dictionaries. In the records of 16th century Portuguese and Spanish sailors, the word &#x27;Papua&#x27; is the designation for the inhabitants who inhabit the Raja Ampat Islands and the coastal parts of the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula.

The former name of the province, Irian Jaya, was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Atmoprasojo, head of bestuur school in the 1940s, Frans Kaisiepo the committee leader suggested name from Mansren Koreri myths, &quot;Iri-an&quot; from the Biak language of Biak Island, meaning &quot;hot land&quot; referring to local hot climate, but also from &quot;Iryan&quot; which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering new era. In Serui &quot;Iri-an&quot; () means &quot;pillar of nation&quot;, while in Merauke &quot;Iri-an&quot; () means &quot;rising spirit&quot; or &quot;to rise&quot;. The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of the future governor Frans Kaisiepo. The name &quot;Irian&quot; was politicized later by Marthin Indey and Silas Papare with the Indonesian acronym &#x27;Ikut Republik Indonesia Anti Nederland&#x27; (Join the Republic of Indonesia oppose the Netherlands). The name was used throughout the Suharto administration, until it was changed to &quot;Papua&quot; during the administration of President Abdurrahman Wahid.

The Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it &quot;Schouten island&quot;. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized this island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it &quot;Nieuw Guinea&quot;.

Speakers align themselves with a political orientation when choosing a name for the western half of the island of New Guinea. The official name of the region is &quot;Papua&quot; according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Independence activists refer to the region as &quot;West Papua&quot;, while Indonesian officials have also used &quot;West Papua&quot; to name the westernmost province of the region since 2007. Historically, the region has had the official names of Netherlands New Guinea (1895–1962), West Irian or Irian Barat (1962–73), Irian Jaya (1973–2002), Irian Jaya Barat (2003–2007), and Papua Barat (2007–present).

=== Pre-colonial era ===

Papuan habitation of the region is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, and show that agriculture developed gradually over several thousands of years; the banana has been cultivated in this region for at least 7,000 years. Austronesian peoples migrating through Maritime Southeast Asia settled in the area at least 3,000 years ago, and populated especially in Cenderawasih Bay. Diverse cultures and languages have developed in the island due to geographical isolation; there are over 300 languages and two hundred additional dialects in the region (&quot;see Papuan languages, Austronesian languages, Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages&quot;).

Ghau Yu Kuan, a Chinese merchant, came to Papua around the latter half of 500 AD and referred to it as &quot;Tungki&quot;, the area where they obtained spices. Meanwhile, in the latter half of 600 AD, the Sumatra-based empire of Srivijaya (7th century–13th century) referred to the island as &quot;Janggi&quot;. The empire engaged in trade relations with western New Guinea, initially taking items like sandalwood and birds-of-paradise in tribute to China, but later making slaves out of the natives. It was only at the beginning of 700 AD that traders from Persia and Gujarat began to arrive in what is now Papua and call it &quot;Dwi Panta&quot; or &quot;Samudrananta&quot;, which means &#x27;at edge of the ocean&#x27;.

The 14th-century Majapahit poem &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; mentioned Wwanin or Onin and Sran as a recognized territory in the east, today identified as Onin peninsula in Fakfak Regency in the western part of the larger Bomberai Peninsula south of the Bird&#x27;s Head region of Western New Guinea. At that time, Papua was said to be the eighth region of the Majapahit Empire.&quot;&quot; Wanin or Onin was probably the oldest name in recorded history to refer to the western part of the island of New Guinea. A transcript from the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; says the following:

: &quot;Ikang sakasanusasanusa Makasar Butun Banggawai Kuni Ggaliyao mwang i [ng] Salaya Sumba Solot Muar muwah tigang i Wandan Ambwan Athawa maloko Ewanin ri Sran ini Timur ning angeka nusatutur.&quot;

According to some linguists, the word &quot;Ewanin&quot; is another name for Onin, while &quot;Sran&quot; popularly misunderstood to refers to Seram Island in Maluku, is more likely another name for Kowiai. The local Papuan kingdom in its native language is called Sran Eman Muun which is based in Kaimana and its furthest influence extends to the Kei Islands, in southeastern Maluku. In his book &quot;Nieuw Guinea,&quot; Dutch author WC. Klein explained the beginning of the influence of the Bacan Sultanate in Papua. There he wrote: &quot;In 1569 Papoese hoof den bezoeken Batjan. Ee aanterijken worden vermeld&quot; (In 1569, Papuan tribal leaders visited Bacan, which resulted in the creation of new kingdoms). According to the oral history of the Biak people, there used to be a relationship and marriage between their tribal chiefs and the sultans of Tidore. The Biak people is the largest Melanesian tribe that spreads on the northern coast of Papua, therefore the Biak language is also the most widely used and considered the language of Papuan unity. Due to the relationship of the coastal areas of Papua with the Sultans of Maluku, there are several local kingdoms on this island, which shows the entry of the system of feudalism that does not originated from Papua itself.

Since the 16th century, apart from the Raja Ampat Islands which was contested between the Bacan Sultanate, Tidore Sultanate, and Ternate Sultanate, other coastal areas of Papua from the island of Biak to Mimika have become a vassal of the Tidore Sultanate. The Tidore Sultanate adheres to the trade pact and custom of &quot;Uli-Siwa&quot; ( federation of nine ), so there were nine trade partners led by Tidore in opposition to Ternate-led &quot;Uli Lima&quot; ( federation of five ). In administering its regions in Papua, Tidore divide them to three regions, &quot;Korano Ngaruha&quot; ( ) or Raja Ampat Islands, &quot;Papoua Gam Sio&quot; ( ) and &quot;Mafor Soa Raha&quot; ( ). The role of these kingdoms began to decline due to the entry of traders from Europe to the archipelago which marks the beginning of colonialism in the Indonesian Archipelago. During Tidore&#x27;s rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself &quot;Sultan of Tidore and Papua&quot;, during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands. Following Tidore&#x27;s defeat, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.

===Colonial era===
In 1511, Antonio d&#x27;Arbau, a Portuguese sailor, called the Papua region as &quot;Os Papuas&quot; or &quot;llha de Papo&quot;. Don Jorge de Menetes, a sailor from Spain also stopped by in Papua a few years later (1526–1527), he refers to the region as &#x27;Papua&#x27;, which was mentioned in the diary of Antonio Pigafetta, the clerk for the Magellan voyage. The name Papua was known to Pigafetta when he stopped on the island of Tidore.

On 16 May 1545, Yñigo Ortiz de Retez, a Spanish maritime explorer who in command of the &quot;San Juan de Letran&quot;, left port in Tidore, an island which was Spain&#x27;s stronghold in the Maluku Islands and going by way of the Talaud Islands and the Schoutens, reached the northern coast of New Guinea, which was coasted till the end of August when, having got to the 5°S latitude, contrary winds and currents forced a return to Tidore where he arrived on 5 October 1545. Many islands were encountered and first charted, along the northern coast of New Guinea, and in the Padaidos, Le Maires, Ninigos, Kaniets and Hermits, to some of which Spanish names were given. On 20 June 1545 at the mouth of the Mamberamo River (that was charted as &quot;San Agustin&quot;) he took possession of the land for the Spanish Crown, in the process giving the island the name by which it is known today. He called it &quot;Nueva Guinea&quot; owing to the resemblance of the local inhabitants to the peoples of the Guinea coast in West Africa. The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600 and shown 1606, Luís Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named &quot;Bahía de San Lorenzo&quot;. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island, naming it &quot;Tierra de San Buenaventura&quot;, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606. On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.

In 1606, a Duyfken expedition led by the commander Wiliam Jansen from Holland landed in Papua. This expedition consisted of 3 ships, where they sailed from the north coast of Java and stopped at the Kei Islands, at the southwestern coast of Papua. With the increasing Dutch grip in the region, the Spanish left New Guinea in 1663. In 1660, the Dutch recognized the Sultan of Tidore&#x27;s sovereignty over New Guinea. New Guinea thus became notionally Dutch as the Dutch held power over Tidore.

Dutch New Guinea in the early 19th century was administered from the Moluccas. Although the coast had been mapped in 1825 by Lieutenant Commander D.H. Kolff, there had been no serious effort to establish a permanent presence in Dutch New Guinea. The British, however, had shown considerable interest in the area, and were threatening to settle it. To prevent this, the Governor of the Moluccas, Pieter Merkus, urged the Dutch government to establish posts along the coast. An administrative and trading post established in 1828 on Triton Bay on the southwest coast of New Guinea. The post was named Fort Du Bus for the then-Governor General of the Dutch East Indies, Leonard du Bus de Gisignies. On 24 August 1828, the birthday of King William I of the Netherlands, the Dutch flag was hoisted and Dutch claimed all of western Papua, which they called &quot;Nieuw Guinea&quot;. In the ceremony, multiple tribes and kingdoms of the region was invited. The Dutch reorganized VOC vassalization system of Tidore Sultanate with the Sultan being given new rattan baton with gold head (formerly having VOC stamp). Under him, Sendawan (King of Namatota), Kassa (King of Lahakia) and Lutu (&quot;Orang Kaya&quot; from Lobo and Mawara) were recognized as leader of the regions which was symbolized by three rattan batons with silver head. Under those three, The Netherlands also recognized another twenty eight tribes or vassal kingdoms. Almost 30 years later, Germans established the first missionary settlement on an island near Manokwari. While in 1828 the Dutch claimed the south coast west of the 141st meridian and the north coast west of Humboldt Bay in 1848, they did not try to develop the region again until 1896; they established settlements in Manokwari and Fak-Fak in response to perceived Australian ownership claims from the eastern half of New Guinea.

Under Tidore hegemony around Onin Peninsula, there was three main local kingdoms Atiati, Fatagar, and Rumbati led by Bauw dynasty. In 1878, there was a war between Rumbati on one side and Fatagar and Atiati on the other side. Atiati and Fatagar moved their capitals to Ega islands. After some time there was a conflict between Atiati and Fatagar, as a result Atiati moved its capital to the mainland on the coast just across Ega island which come to be known as Atiati in modern time. Meanwhile, Fatagar moved its capital to a place called Merapi, located on the eastern side of Fakfak town in modern time.

Great Britain and Germany had recognized the Dutch claims in treaties of 1885 and 1895. At much the same time, Britain claimed south-east New Guinea, later known as the Territory of Papua, and Germany claimed the northeast, later known as the Territory of New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories. In 1901, the Netherlands formally purchased West New Guinea from the Sultanate of Tidore, incorporating it into the Netherlands East Indies.

Other local kingdoms around the area were formerly under the dominion of Rumbati kingdom but achieved kingdom status when the Netherlands achieved hegemony of the area in 1898, this includes: Patipi kingdom centered in Patipi Bay in Fakfak, Sekar kingdom in Kokas led by Rumagesan dynasty, Wertuar kingdom centered in Sisir led by Heremba dynasty, Arguni kingdom centered in Arguni islands in Kaimana.
Other kingdoms in the area include Namatota Kingdom, and Sran Kingdom.

===Modern era===
During the Indonesian National Awakening period several Indonesian nationalists were interned in the Boven-Digoel detention camp in modern-day Papua province, mostly from the failed 1926 communist uprising. This began the long interaction and formation of local Indonesian nationalist movement in Western New Guinea. Following its independence declaration from the Netherlands in 1945, Indonesia claimed all of the territory of the former Dutch East Indies, including Western New Guinea. Local figures like Silas Papare created PKII In 1946 centered in Serui to begin preparation for revolution war against the Netherlands. To counter this Netherlands formed the Papuan Council.

In 1947 Malino Conference the formation of United States of Indonesia was considered but because of pressure from local Dutch politicians hoping to create a West New Guinea country for fleeing Indo-Eurasians, they decided against including West New Guinea in United States of Indonesia. This is contrary to the local Papuan delegates in the event, Frans Kaisiepo who argued for the inclusion of West Papua with Indonesia. This is also the first time &#x27;Irian&#x27; is proposed to describe the territory as suggested by Kaisiepo. Kaisiepo was then rejected to becoming Dutch New Guinea representatives during 1949 Round-Table Conference which resulted in United States of Indonesia independence and postponement of the Western new Guinea status negotiation to the next year.

However, by 1950s Republic of Indonesia Government dissolved United States of Indonesia and many of the constituent merged to form United Republic of Indonesia. This angered the Dutch because it destroyed their influence in many of the formed republics constituent of BFO and the dissolving of Dutch-Indonesian Union. As a result, the region was still retained by the Dutch, which caused increasing tension of Netherlands with Indonesia.

By December 1957, Sukarno frustrated with the lack of progress for Western New Guinea negotiation, decided to nationalise around 246 Dutch companies dominating Indonesian economy. By early 1960s Indonesia also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet-bloc military aid. This leads to increasingly aggressive stance by Indonesia. In April 1961, Netherlands announced the formation of a Nieuw Guinea Raad, intending to create an independent Papuan state. Indonesia declared intention of military confrontation by Formation of Tri Komando Rakjat (TRIKORA) speech in Yogyakarta, on 19 December 1961. Indonesia then began to direct military incursions into the half-island, which he referred to as West Irian. By the end of 1962, 3,000 Indonesian soldiers were present throughout West Irian/West Papua. Although most of these military incursion managed to make contact with local Indonesian nationalists most were unsuccessful in taking control and were captured by Dutch authority.

United States fearing more Indonesian shift toward the Soviet bloc, formulated a plan to resolve the Western New Guinea dispute. Indonesian delegation include several Indonesian nationalists from West Papua Who managed to flee and made contact during earlier incursions, such as: Marthen Indey and Silas Papare. It was agreed through the New York Agreement in 1962 that the administration of Western New Guinea would be temporarily transferred from the Netherlands to Indonesia and that by 1969 the United Nations should oversee a referendum of the Papuan people, in which they would be given two options: to remain part of Indonesia or to become an independent nation. This vote was referred to as the Act of Free Choice. However, the vote was reportedly conducted by consensus of government-selected delegates, numbering slightly over 1,000, which represent the elite of Papuan society, mostly Papuan tribal elders and local kings such as Machmud Singgirei Rumagesan kings of Sekar, and the few local Papuans luckily to receive education during the earlier period of Dutch East Indies. The referendum was recognised by the international community and the region became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya (renamed Papua in 1999). The result of the compromised vote was rejected by West Papuan nationalists, who are mostly from the newer generation of Dutch New Guinea educated elites, who established the Free Papua Movement (OPM) which have roots in the earlier Dutch-formed Papuan Council. The independence movement for West Papua has continued, primarily through peaceful protest and international pressure, but also guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian administration.

The Papua conflict is an ongoing conflict in Western New Guinea between Indonesia and the Free Papua Movement (Indonesian: Organisasi Papua Merdeka, OPM). Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Dutch administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962 and implementation of Indonesian administration in 1963, the Free Papua Movement has conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against Indonesia through the targeting of its military, police, and civilian populations.

The province of West Papua was established out of the western portion of the province of Papua in February 2003, initially under the name of West Irian Jaya (&quot;Irian Jaya Barat&quot;). In November 2004, an Indonesian court agreed that the split violated Papua&#x27;s autonomy laws. However, the court ruled that because the new province had already been established, it should remain separate from Papua. The ruling also prohibited the creation of another proposed province, Central Irian Jaya, as that division had not yet been formalised. The split is in line with the general trend of provincial splits that is occurring in all parts of Indonesia in the post-Suharto era.

The name of the province was changed to &quot;Papua Barat&quot; in 2007. The new name applies from that date, but a plenary session of the provincial legislative council is required to legalise the change of name, and the government needed to issue an implementing regulation. Since April 18, 2007 the government has issued the implementing regulation.

In November 2022, Sorong City and West Papua&#x27;s westernmost regencies were separated off and formed into the new province of Southwest Papua, so named despite their location on the northwestern part of the island.

==Geography==

The provincial area now includes the eastern part of the Doberai Peninsula (Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula) and the whole of the Bomberai Peninsula to the south. In the north, the province is bordered by the Pacific Ocean, in the west by Southwest Papua, North Maluku province and Maluku province, in the east by Cenderawasih Bay, in the south by the Ceram Sea and in the southeast by Central Papua Province. The southeastern boundary of West Papua is almost the same as the Afdeling boundary (&quot;part&quot;) West Nieuw-Guinea (&quot;West New Guinea&quot;) in the Dutch East Indies. Since the creation of the new Southwest Papua Province, the residual West Papua Province consists of only seven regencies.

West Papua is located between 0–4 degrees South Latitude and 124–132 degrees East Longitude, just below the equator with an altitude of above sea level. The area of West Papua before the creation of Southwest Papua Province was , and is currently about .

The climate in West Papua also tends to be the same as the climate in the Papua Province, which is tropical with rainfall varying in each region.

The land condition in West Papua is almost the same as the Papua Province where the surface is in the form of cliffs and slopes. The types of soil in West Papua are latosol, resina, red and yellow medeteren, podsol, red yellow podsolic, gray red podsolic, litosol, alluvia, gray hydromorph.

The mountains in West Papua include the Arfak Mountains () in Arfak Mountains Regency, the Fak-Fak Mountains in Fak-Fak Regency, Mount Fudi () in Fak-Fak Regency, Kumafa Mountains in Fak-Fak Regency, Mount Togwomeri () in Manokwari Regency, Mount Wasada () in Manokwari Regency, Mount Wiwi () in Manokwari Regency.

Lakes in West Papua include Anggi Giji Lake in Manokwari Regency, Anggi Gita Lake in Manokwari Regency, Lake Yamur in Manokwari Regency.

The province is rich in karst areas. Many of these areas remain unexplored from a speleological point of view. Among the most important caves explored, there are the Lomo Longmot (360 metres deep) and Lomo Iono Besar (315 metres deep), respectively the second and fourth caves for depth in Indonesia. These caves were explored in the 1990s by a French speleology expedition team in the Lina Mountains region, Irameba Village, Anggi District, Manokwari Regency. Recently the karst system of the Aouk-Kladuk river has been explored. At present, it is the largest underground river explored on the planet.

==Government and administrative divisions==

Before 1999, the areas forming (since 2003) West Papua Province consisted of three regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) – Manokwari, Sorong and Fakfak. The City of Sorong was separated from Sorong Regency on 4 October 1999 and established as a regency-level administration. Five new regencies were created on 11 December 2002 - Kaimara from part of Fakfak Regency, Raja Ampat (the Raja Ampat Islands off the west coast of Papua) and South Sorong (&quot;Sorong Selatan&quot;) from further parts of Sorong Regency, and Teluk Bintuni and Teluk Wondama from parts of Manokwari Regency. In late 2008 two new regencies were created from other arts of Sorong Regency - Tambrauw on 29 October, and Maybrat on 19 December. Thus by 2009 the province was administratively divided into ten regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and the autonomous city (&quot;kota&quot;), which together were subdivided into 155 districts (&quot;distrik&quot;) at the 2010 Census. Two further new regencies were created on 25 October 2012 – South Manokwari (&quot;Manokwari Selatan&quot;) and Arfak Mountains (&quot;Pegunungan Arfak&quot;) – both from districts which were formerly parts of the Manokwari Regency, while four further districts of Manokwari Regency were added to Tambrauw Regency. However, as mentioned above, the province was split in two in late 2022, with the eastern part (containing just 48% of the existing population) retaining the name of West Papua.

All the existing regencies in the reduced province are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.

On 25 October 2013 the People&#x27;s Representative Council began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective regencies/cities (and 8 new provinces). This included a new province of Southwest Papua to be created out of the existing West Papua province, together with three new regencies and one city to be formed within the residual West Papua Province - Moskona (from Teluk Bintuni Regency), Kokas (from Fakfak Regency), and West Manokwari (from Manokwari Regency), while the new city is Manokwari (from Manokwari Regency). Except for the creation of the new province of Southwest Papua in late 2022, these projected changes have not yet (by 2024) been implemented.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The West Papua Electoral District consists of all of the 7 regencies in the province, and elects 3 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Economy==
This province has tremendous potential, both agriculture, mining, forest products and tourism. Pearls and seaweed are produced in Raja Ampat Regency while the only traditional weaving industry called Timor fabric is produced in South Sorong Regency. Fragrant nutmeg syrup can be obtained in Fak-Fak Regency as well as various other potentials. Besides that nature tourism is also one of the mainstays of West Papua, such as the Cenderawasih Bay National Park located in Teluk Wondama Regency. This National Park stretches from the east of the Kwatisore Peninsula to the north of Rumberpon Island with a coastline of 500 km, the land area reaches 68,200 ha, sea area 1,385,300 ha with details of 80,000 ha of coral reefs and 12,400 ha of ocean.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===

57.26% of the total population in West Papua are the native Papuan people. There are several tribes that inhabit West Papua Province, which are Arfak (Hatam, Meyah, Moire, and Sougb), Borai, &quot;Numfor Doreri&quot;, &quot;Irarutu&quot;, &quot;Koiwai&quot;, &quot;Kuri&quot;, Madewana, Mairasi, Maniwak, Mbaham-Matta, Miere, Moru, Moskona, Napiti, Oburauw, &quot;Roon&quot;, Roswar, Sebyar (Damban and Kemberan), Soviar, Sumuri, &quot;Wamesa&quot;, Warumba, &quot;Waruri&quot;, &quot;Wondama&quot;.

In general, when viewed from the perspective of cultural characteristics, livelihoods, and patterns of life, indigenous Papuans in West Papua can be divided into two major groups: highlander (inland or mountainous) Papuans, which are non-Austronesian, and coastal Papuans, which are Austronesian (italicized above). Though centuries of interaction have caused both groups to have mixed and influenced each other.

The remaining population is mostly migrants from other parts of Indonesia, with the largest group of migrants from Sulawesi, such as Buginese, Makassarese, Minahasan, Torajan, Butonese, followed by Javanese, and Moluccans.

===Religion===
The population of West Papua Province embraces different religions. Data in 2022 showed that the largest percentage of religious believers were Protestant Christians (54.17%), then Islam (36.74%), Catholic Christians (8.71%), Hinduism (0.19%), and Buddhism (0.19%).
Islam had been present in Papua since the 15th century, because of interaction with Muslim traders and Moluccan Muslim Sultanates especially the earliest being Bacan. Though there were many earlier theories and folk legends on origin of Islam, sometimes mixed with indigenous folk religion of Fakfak, Kaimana, Bintuni, and Wondama. These include Islamic procession of Hajj pilgrimage that do not go to Meccah, but to Nabi Mountain, near Arguni Bay and Wondama Bay. According to Aceh origins, a Samudra Pasai figure called Tuan Syekh Iskandar Syah was sent to Mesia (Kokas) to preach in Nuu War (Papua), he converted a Papuan called Kriskris by teaching him about &quot;Alif Lam Ha&quot; (Allah) and &quot;Mim Ha Mim Dal&quot; (Muhammad), he became Imam and first king of Patipi, Fakfak. Syekh Iskandar brought with him some religious texts, which were copied onto Koba-Koba leaves and wood barks. Syekh Iskandar would return to Aceh bringing the original manuscripts, but before that he would visit Moluccas specifically in Sinisore village. This corresponds with the village&#x27;s origin of Islam that instead came from Papua. A study by Fakfak government, mentioned another Acehnese figure called Abdul Ghafar who visited Old Fatagar in 1502 under the reign of Rumbati King Mansmamor. He would preach in Onin language (lingua franca of the area at the time) and was buried next to village mosque in Rumbati, Patipi Bay, Fakfak.

Meanwhile, based on oral history of Fakfak and Kaimana, a Sufi by the name of Syarif Muaz al-Qathan from Yemen constructed a mosque in Tunasgain, which was dated using the 8 merbau woods previously used as ceremonial Alif poles for the mosque around every 50 years, to be from 1587. He was also attributed of converting Samay, an Adi ruler of the royal line of Sran. Islam only grew in the coastal part of Papua especially in the bird&#x27;s head areas, and did not spread to the interior part of the island until Dutch started sending migrants in 1902 and exiled Indonesian leaders in 1910 to Merauke. Muhammadiyah figures were exiled in Papua and in their exile help spread Islam in the region. Later on to help members with education issues, Muhammadiyah only formally sent its teacher in 1933.
In the province, the city of Manokwari has come to be known as the &quot;Gospel City&quot;, as it is directly inland from Mansinam Island where the first European missionaries of Carl Ottow and Johann Geissler, under the initiative of Ottho Gerhard Heldring to reached Papua. They were under permission from Tidore Sultanate, who facilitated them with a ship, and connected them with his vassals in the area, like the later Salawati king of Muhammad Amminudin Arfan as their local guide. They entered Papua at Mansinam Island, near Manokwari on 5 February 1855. The date has become a significant local Christian holiday known as &quot;Gospel Day&quot;, celebrated annually across Indonesian Papua.

===Language===
Indonesian is the official language in the Papua Barat province, just like other provinces in Indonesia. All road signs and documents released by the provincial government are written in Indonesian. However, Papuan Malay is used as the lingua franca of the province, both as a trade language and in inter-ethnic communication. Papuan Malay is considered to be similar to Ambonese Malay and Manado Malay language, and is mutually intelligible with Indonesian though it has been highly influenced by local languages. Nevertheless, its usage is currently [when?] diminishing as the proportion of people who are more fluent in Standard Indonesian is increasing.

The number of local languages used by the native peoples of the Papua Barat province reaches 34 consisting of approximately 14 Austronesian languages and 20 Papuan languages.

Regional languages in the Papua Barat province are threatened with extinction, because there are fewer and fewer users. Most regional languages in the province are threatened with extinction, if not immediately documented and preserved. The threat of extinction is due to economic, educational and political problems. The indigenous Papuans who transact on the market will use Indonesian, because the buyers or sellers are migrants or they speak a different Papuan language. The need for children to use Indonesian daily and the lack of education in schools about regional languages largely contributes to their disuse and extinction.

==Culture==
Like the other provinces which form part of Indonesian Papua, the Papua Barat province is inhabited by different tribes.

===Traditional houses===
The traditional house of people in this province is called &quot;Rumah Kaki Seribu&quot; (Thousand Legs House) because it is a stilt house with many pillars which is the reason for its name. The roof was made of straw or sago leaves and wood as its pillars. The pillars are useful for protecting the inhabitants from enemies and the threat of people with evil intentions or black magic. Traditionally to warm the occupants, hot ember will be put below the house.

===Clothing===
The traditional clothes in the West Papua region are named &quot;Serui&quot;. Not much different from traditional clothing in Papua, the form of clothing is almost the same for both men and women. They wear clothes and lower body coverings in the same shape. They also wear ornaments on the chest and head in the form of necklaces, bracelets, ornaments of birds of paradise on the other parts of the head. Equipment worn by men at weddings usually have the groom holding a shield such as an arrow or tombah to fulfill the Papuan custom.

Another West Papuan traditional clothing is called &quot;Ewer&quot;. This garment is purely made from natural ingredients, namely dried straw. With the progress and influence of modernization, these traditional clothes were then equipped with cloth for their superiors. The following is a picture of the traditional Ewer clothing typical of West Papuans. At present, natural materials such as straw or dry fiber are only used as skirts for women. The skirt is made by taking plant fibers and arranging them using a rope at the top. This skirt is made with two layers, the inner layer is knee-length, and the outer layer is shorter. To strengthen skirt ties, belts made of bark are used in such a way. Usually the carving motif is not complicated, namely the gingham with a geometric arrangement.

As for the shirt tops, they use baju kurung made of velvet fabric with knotted tufts on the edges of the arms, neck or waist. This article is derived from outside culture and is usually only used for West Papuans who live around the city of Manokwari. Apart from clothes and skirts, West Papuan traditional clothing for women is also equipped with a variety of accessories such as bracelets, necklaces and headgear. Bracelets and necklaces are usually made from hard grains which are arranged using a piece of yarn, while the head cover is made of cassowary feathers.

For men, the West Papuan traditional clothing worn in ancient times is very different from the traditional clothes worn and introduced today. In the past, men in general only used tassel skirts, the way and materials made were the same as those worn by women. The use of tassel skirts by men is not equipped with a boss so they will only be bare-chested. Today, custom Ewer clothing for men is made of velvet fabric with a more polite model. Knee-length shorts complete with a cloth covering dangling on the front are used as subordinates, while for superiors are used vest shirts made with fabric. Each edge of a piece of men&#x27;s ewer shirt, both for pants, vests, and cloth covers is usually decorated with bright colored fabric borders. In addition, the indigenous men of West Papua also wear several other accessories to support their appearance. Necklaces and headgear, and war equipment in the form of shields, spears, chopsticks and arrows are some of what usually must be present.

===Traditional dance===

As West Papua consists of many tribes, there are many traditional dances from each tribe. However, a commonly shared dance among the Arfak tribes was what Ottow and Geissler, 19th century German missionaries in the area, called the Tumbu Tanah Dance (ground stomp dance). Previously, Hattam people called the dance &quot;Ibihim&quot;, &quot;Isim&quot; for the Moile people, &quot;Mugka&quot; for the Meyakh people, and &quot;Mayonhora&quot; for the Sough people. The dance consists of two basic movements called &quot;bihim ifiri kai cut&quot;, which is hopping while stomping the ground, imitating cuscus and &quot;namdur&quot;, and &quot;yam&quot;, which is the interlocking of dancers arms at the elbows. Then the dancers will form three formations imitating snake, &quot;jey/srem&quot;: a long line; &quot;ikrop&quot;: a half circle; and &quot;nimot&quot;: a full circle. The dance will be accompanied by music and singing either &quot;diun&quot; (songs about praising ancestors), &quot;nihet duwei&quot; (situational songs depending on the purpose of the dance), or &quot;isiap&quot; (encouraging shouts by the dancers to be ready).

Yospan dance is another dance originating from West Papua, this dance is an amalgamation of two traditional dances, namely Yosim dances originating from Sarera Bay (Serui/Yapen, Waropen) and Pancar dances originating from Biak, Numfor, and Manokwari. The musical instruments used for Yosim are usually Cuku lele (ukulele) and guitars, which shows foreign influences as these were not instruments from Papua. Included was also local bass made from three strings, with the strings made from pandan leaves. As well as Kalabasa, a dried calabash, which was then filled with beads. In Yosim dance, the women are dressed with weavings to cover the chest, and headress made from bird feathers. While the men are bare-chested and wearing the same headress. The dance movement are more energetic though simple. In Pancar dance, the music are from Tifa drums which is the universal instruments for coastal Papuans. The drum skin is usually made from soa-soa (lizards). The movements are more stiff following the Tifa beats.

Movements include Seka, this dance movement are usually from southern coast with famous version from Kaimana, Fakfak, and Timika. In Pacul Tiga, or Pancar Meneru the dancer swing forward three steps, and throw both arms and one leg to the left and right, which was then repeated for the other leg. Jef movements are influenced by rock and roll dance from 1969 to 1971, Gale-Gale movements are from Wondama Bay and Mor-Mambor islands. Pancar movements are performed by the dancers move in a circle. These movements was inspired by animals, and have four variations.

Suanggi dance is also another dance from the regions around Cendrawasih Bay on the northern coast of New Guinea. This dance is basically an exorcism ritual by a bereaved husband after his wife becomes the victim of possession by mythical creatures (angi-angi). Suanggi is an evil spirit that wanders the earth because it cannot find peace and will take possession of a woman. The dance is usually only performed when death victims are found, which prompts the tribal leaders to initiate the ritual before the tribe members start the dance.

===Weapons===
The bow and arrow is one of the main weapons typical of the tribes in Papua. These traditional weapons of bows and arrows are used for hunting and fighting. The bow is made of bamboo or wood, while the bowstring is made of rattan. The arrows are made of bamboo, wood, or kangaroo bones. Because of bow and arrow materials made from nature, special expertise is needed to use these traditional weapons. Spears are one of the traditional tribal weapons in Papua and West Papua. Traditional tribal spears in Papua are made from natural materials such as wood and stone. Each tribe has a different form of spear, including those with one spear and two spears.

In addition to bows, arrows and spears, indigenous tribes in Papua have traditional daggers made of cassowary bones or bamboo. This knife can be made from the bones of a cassowary or bamboo foot with a tapered tip, while the handle is decorated with cassowary feathers. Traditional weapons from Papua and West Papua made from the bones of cassowary birds are used as a tool in hunting and extracting forest products.

Stone axes are traditional tribal traditional weapons in Papua and West Papua. This stone ax is made of natural stone which is smashed and formed by the eyes of an ax, given a woven frame from a twist of wood fiber and forest orchids, used for cutting, picking and scraping.

==Transport==
In West Papua, the largest airport is Dominique Edward Osok Airport, located in Sorong. In addition, there are also Fakfak Airport, Rendani Airport in Manokwari and Utarom Airport in Kaimana. Major flights to the West Papua area from Jakarta, Surabaya and Makassar are usually via the airport in Sorong or Biak, then continue with smaller aircraft.

==Tourism==
In Doreri Bay there are three small islands: Mansinan Island, Lemon Island and Raimuti Island. These islands have a collection of coral reefs. It is estimated that this place has more than 20 former World War II wrecks. But what can be seen clearly is that there are around 6 ships such as Pasir Putih Wreck, a type of Navy patrol boat with a length of 12–22 meters. Pillbox Wreck, a type of commercial cargo carrier carrying around 9–16 meters of ammunition, Cross Wreck is a kind of patrol boat, Mupi Wreck and Shinwa Maru, a cargo ship.

The Cendrawasih Bay National Park have a unique geological structure and very important oceanographic history. This marine national park has extensive coral reefs of the highest quality in the world. Cendrawasih Bay National Park is in five regions and two provinces, namely Teluk Wondana Regency and Manokwari Regency in West Papua Province and Nabire Regency, Yapen Island Regency and Waropen Regency in Papua Province. Local communities living around national parks use marine resources as a source of life. Cendrawasih Bay National Park is a bay surrounded by several islands, including Biak Island, Yapen Island, and the mainland New Guinea. Administratively, the area is in two Regency, namely Teluk Wondama Regency, West Papua Province and Nabire Regency, Papua Province.

Raja Ampat is an archipelago that is administratively located in the Raja Ampat Regency, West Papua Province. This island is a destination for divers who are interested in the underwater scenery. Raja Ampat Islands is one of the 10 best waters for diving in the whole world, so it has the potential to be a tourist location, especially diving tours. In this place it is also home to 75% of the world&#x27;s coral species, in the village of Saindarek, when the tides are lowest, we can see coral reefs without diving. Some unique species that can be found while diving in Raja Ampat are several types of pygmy seahorses, wobbegongs, and Manta rays.

Sawinggrai Tourism Village is a village located in Meos Mansar Subdistrict, Raja Ampat Regency, West Papua. It is one of the place in the province to see Bird of Paradise which is still maintained today. Sawinggrai Village Tourism Sites are currently inhabited by around 36 families and some of them have the expertise to make handicrafts typical of sculpture. There are four species of Bird of Paradise that are preserved here, namely the Red bird-of-paradise (&quot;Paradisaea rubra&quot;), Magnificent bird-of-paradise (&quot;Cicinnurus magnificus&quot;), Lesser bird-of-paradise (&quot;Paradisaea minor&quot;) and Greater bird-of-paradise (&quot;Paradisaea apoda&quot;). One of the four species, the Red bird of paradise, is a typical icon of Sawinggrai Village.

<text>Jérôme Eugène Coggia (18 February 1849 – 15 January 1919) was a 19th-century French astronomer and discoverer of asteroids and comets, who was born in the Corsican town of Ajaccio.

Working at the Marseille Observatory from 1866 to 1917, Coggia discovered a number of comets, including the bright &quot;Coggia&#x27;s Comet&quot; (C/1874 H1). The periodic comet 27P/Crommelin was previously called &quot;Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes&quot;. He is also credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 5 asteroids at Marseille between 1868 and 1899.

Coggia was awarded by the French Academy of Sciences its Lalande Prize for 1873 and again for 1916.

<text>Charles Pickering (November 10, 1805 – March 17, 1878) was an American naturalist, curator, author, and physician.

==Biography==
Born on Starucca Creek, Upper Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, the grandson of Colonel Timothy Pickering, after the death of his father he was raised in the house of his esteemed grandfather in Wenham, Massachusetts. Despite his part in the student rebellion of 1823, he received a medical degree from Harvard University in 1826. A practicing physician in Philadelphia, he became active as librarian and curator at the city&#x27;s Academy of Natural Sciences.

Pickering went with the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842 as one of its naturalists. Charles Wilkes, the expedition&#x27;s commander, named Pickering Passage in honor of Charles Pickering. His journal of the Expedition was a major influence on Wilkes&#x27; &quot;Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition&quot;.

From 1842 to 1843, Pickering curated the collection from the Wilkes Expedition, which was housed at the Patent Office in Washington DC, these collections were to form the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution.

Pickering was a polygenist; he believed that different races had been created separately. In 1843, he traveled to the Middle East, Zanzibar and India to continue his research for his book on the Races of Man. In 1848, Pickering published &quot;Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution&quot;, which enumerated eleven races.

He later moved to Boston, where he resumed his medical practice, and eventually died on March 17, 1878.

He was married to Sarah Stoddard Pickering, who posthumously published his final work. He was an associate of many important figures in America&#x27;s intellectual landscape, including Asa Gray, Horatio Hale, James Dwight Dana and Louis Agassiz.

A subspecies of North American garter snake, &quot;Thamnophis sirtalis pickeringii&quot;, is named in his honor.

<text>Coke La Rock (aka Coco La Rock; born April 24, 1955) is an American rapper from New York City who is sometimes credited as being the first MC in the history of hip-hop. In 2010, he was inducted into the High Times Counterculture Hall of Fame at the annual ceremonies at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.

==Kool Herc and Coke La Rock==
La Rock was born in The Bronx, New York City on April 24, 1955, with family roots going back to North Carolina.

Coke La Rock was a friend and musical partner of DJ Kool Herc, who himself is generally considered to have laid down the foundation for hip-hop music starting in 1973. La Rock was an original member of Herc&#x27;s MC crew, the Herculoids. 

According to Herc, Coke La Rock&#x27;s MC name had various iterations, beginning as &quot;A-1 Coke,&quot; and then moving on to &quot;Nasty Coke&quot; before it was finalized as &quot;Coke La Rock&quot;.

Coke La Rock joined Kool Herc for his first party, in 1973, to celebrate Herc&#x27;s sister Cindy&#x27;s birthday. It wasn&#x27;t until about the fifth or sixth party that he took the name Coke La Rock. The name came to him in a dream. Before that time, he had no name and did his rapping out of sight from the audience, so no one knew who was doing the rapping.

His original raps were usually shout-outs to friends, but gradually the poetry emerged. He originated such phrases as &quot;You rock and you don&#x27;t stop,&quot; and &quot;Hotel, motel, you don&#x27;t tell, we won&#x27;t tell&quot; (which was immortalized on the first Sugarhill Gang single &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, although La Rock received no credit).

Coke La Rock&#x27;s raps were always purely improvisational, unlike those of later 70s-era rap groups, —such as the Furious Five and Cold Crush Brothers, who wrote down and rehearsed their rhymes and created elaborate routines. According to La Rock, while rapping &quot;at first I would just call out [my friends&#x27;] names. Then I pretended dudes had double-parked cars; that was to impress the girls. Truthfully, I wasn’t there to rap, I was just playing around.&quot;

Nonetheless, La Rock&#x27;s raps would, as with much else at Kool Herc&#x27;s parties in the mid-1970s, serve as a basic model for other hip-hop artists that would come onto the Bronx music scene by the end of the decade. La Rock himself has argued, in a reference to two pioneering New York City narcotics dealers, that &quot;me and Herc were to hip-hop what Nicky Barnes and Frank Lucas were to drugs.&quot;

==Decline in popularity and later years==
As other nascent hip-hop groups patterned themselves after Herc and La Rock and improved on their formula, the popularity of Herc and the Herculoids began to wane as early as 1977.

After Kool Herc was stabbed at a party, La Rock went looking to kill the perpetrator, who was part of the Executive Playhouse crew. He found the man&#x27;s friends in a Bronx pool hall, but they had already moved their friend down south to avoid a confrontation. After this incident, La Rock decided to step away from hip hop and let the younger generation move in. Since he&#x27;d had a long run lasting several years of being on top of the Bronx hip hop scene, La Rock didn&#x27;t want to continue if murder was going to continue to be part of the game. Also his son, Donte La Rock, had just been born, and he needed to spend more time at home.

Gary Harris, an employee of the first hip-hop record label, Sugar Hill, noted that &quot;people respected Herc and Coke, but by the early eighties those guys were like specters—they just weren’t visible on the scene anymore.&quot; In contrast to other early Bronx hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, Coke La Rock—like his partner Kool Herc—never achieved any recording success (indeed he did not record at all). However, late 2008 saw the release of what was deemed the first ever recording featuring La Rock, a song titled &quot;Hello – Merry Christmas Baby!&quot; which was released by Sedgwick &amp; Cedar as part of a special holiday compilation to pay homage to the birthplace of hip-hop.

La Rock&#x27;s place in hip-hop history was arguably immortalized in the legendary 1986 Boogie Down Productions song &quot;South Bronx&quot; (the opening salvo of the so-called &quot;Bridge Wars&quot;) wherein KRS-One raps this:
Now way back in the days when hip-hop began&lt;br&gt;
With Coke La Rock, Kool Herc, and then Bam
Coke La Rock had no association with, nor relation to, KRS-One&#x27;s DJ at the time, Scott La Rock. Nor did Coke La Rock and another influential old-school MC, T La Rock, know one another in the early days of hip-hop, and thus the name similarity is coincidental.

In 2021, after years of being absent from the hip hop scene, Coke La Rock returned to the microphone with a verse on the DJ Kay Slay posse track &quot;Rolling 110 Deep&quot;.

In 2023 he returned once again to deliver a verse on &quot;Rolling 200 Deep&quot;.

<text>One for the Kids is the third studio album by American rock band Yellowcard. It was released on April 3, 2001 on Lobster Records and is the first Yellowcard album to include Ryan Key as lead singer and guitarist. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Darian Rundall at Stall No. 2 in Redondo Beach, California. &quot;Drifting&quot; and &quot;Rock Star Land&quot; both originally appeared on the band&#x27;s previous EP, &quot;Still Standing EP&quot;.

==Background==
Yellowcard released their first two albums – &quot;Midget Tossing&quot; (1997) and &quot;Where We Stand&quot; (1999) – through guitarist Ben Harper&#x27;s label Takehold Records. Following this, vocalist Ben Dobson was replaced by Ryan Key in early 2000. Key had played shows with Yellowcard while in the high school act Modern Music; Takehold had previously released a cassette for Modern Music. Bassist Warren Cooke&#x27;s brother was close friends with Stevan Lubarsky, who ran the Californian-based label Lobster Records. On June 15, 2000, Yellowcard signed to Lobster Records, and were aiming to release their next album in early 2001. The band moved from their native Florida to Thousand Oaks, California to record the album. Sessions where held at Stall No. 2 in Redondo Beach, California, with producer and engineer Darian Rundall. He mixed the recordings, before the album was mastered by Mark Chalecki at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.

In a 2011 interview, violinist Sean Mackin described the album:
&quot;&quot;One for the Kids&quot; was a really big album for us. [...] We were just high school kids. When we decided to make a run at being in a band, we signed to a record label, Lobster Records. They had full distribution, and we started recording as a different style of band than when we first started. That was very punk-rock-focused, kind of extra adolescent? When Ryan joined the band, it brought a different kind of songwriting that allowed us to showcase our different sorts of influences. It&#x27;s an important part of Yellowcard and, really, the version of our band that most people know.&quot;

==Release==
On February 23, 2001, &quot;One for the Kids&quot; was announced for released in a month&#x27;s time. In addition to this, &quot;October Nights&quot; was made available for download through the band&#x27;s MP3.com profile. &quot;One for the Kids&quot; was initially scheduled for released in March 2001, before being eventually released on April 3, 2001. $15,000 had been spent making the album and promoting it, with the band helping the label (which consisted of two employees) stuff envelops and ship posters. After the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on their first full-length tour, alongside Rise Against and Mad Caddies. In July and August 2001, the band toured the southern states with Inspection 12. In November 2001, the band went on a two-week tour of the US west coast with Bordem. On November 18, 2003, &quot;One for the Kids&quot; was reissued as an enhanced CD. It was pressed on vinyl for the first time in 2012, as joint release between label Shop Radio Cast and Lobster Records.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was announced on November 19, 2021, that a 20th Anniversary remixed/remastered reissue of One For the Kids was in production by Lobster Records for a summer 2022 release.

==Reception==

&quot;AllMusic&quot; stated the album is &quot;full of hooks and catchy choruses as strong as any of the syrupy sweet punk bands around southern California.&quot; and compared the sound of the album to Dave Matthews Band. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; praised the band&#x27;s inclusion of the violin and stated the album was a &quot;rough draft of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;&quot;. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; also praised the band&#x27;s use of violin, stating &quot;not since FM&#x27;s Nash the Slash donned bandages has the electric violin been used so effectively in rock music.&quot; as well as stating the album had &quot;above average, melodic punk, fusing energy and enthusiasm with creative chord progressions, classically-inspired riffs and harmonies aplenty
HM included the song &quot;Something of Value&quot; on the list of essential Yellowcard songs in a retrospective career review.

<doc id="593286" wikidata="Q702510" url="?curid=593286" title="Jennifer 8. Lee">
<text>Jennifer 8. Lee (Chinese name: ; pinyin: &#x27;; [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]:&#x27;; born March 15, 1976) is an American journalist who previously worked for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She is the co-founder and president of the literary studio Plympton and a producer of &quot;The Search for General Tso&quot;, which premiered at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival.

Lee is a vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, which is responsible for making recommendations relating to emoji to the Unicode Technical Committee. Inspired by the universality of the dumpling across cultures and cuisines (e.g., jiaozi in China, ravioli in Italy, pierogi in Poland, empanadas in various Latin American countries), she helped to make the dumpling emoji a candidate. She also co-authored the proposal for a hijab emoji.

==Early life and education ==
Lee was born on March 15, 1976, in New York City, to immigrants from Kinmen, a group of islands off the coast of China&#x27;s Fujian province governed by Taiwan. Lee was not given a middle name at birth so she chose &quot;8.&quot; when she was a teenager. In Chinese culture, the number eight symbolizes prosperity and good luck. 

Lee graduated from Hunter College High School in Manhattan in 1994. She then graduated from Harvard University in 1999 with a degree in applied mathematics and economics.

==Career==
While a student at Harvard, Lee was the vice president of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; student newspaper. She interned at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; during college. She joined the &quot;Times&quot; in 2001.

Lee wrote a book about the history of Chinese food in the United States and around the world, titled &quot;The Fortune Cookie Chronicles&quot;, documenting the process on her blog. Warner Books editor Jonathan Karp struck a deal with Lee to write a book about &quot;how Chinese food is more all-American than apple pie.&quot; She appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to promote the book. Published in 2008, the book was #26 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In December 2009, Lee accepted a buyout from &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Lee attempted to popularize the term &quot;&quot; in a 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, which subsequently inspired the 2009 film &quot;I Love You, Man&quot;.

Lee has served on the advisory panel for the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation&#x27;s &quot;News Challenge&quot;, and has assisted the whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks dealing with publicity. She helped the organization with its April 2010 release of a video showing the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike. Lee serves on the board of directors of the Center for Public Integrity, the advisory board of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, and the Asian American Writers&#x27; Workshop. She is also an advisor to Upworthy.

In 2011, Lee and fellow writer Yael Goldstein Love founded a literary studio named Plympton, Inc. The studio focuses on publishing serialized fiction for digital platforms. Investors include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Y Combinator partner Garry Tan, Delicious founder Joshua Schachter, Hipmunk founder Adam Goldstein, Inkling founder Matt MacInnis, Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu, Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever, and Tony Hsieh&#x27;s Vegas Tech Fund. Its first series launched in September 2012 as part of the Kindle Serials program. Its app Rooster, launched in March 2014, is a mobile reading service for iOS7.

In 2012, Lee created NewsDiffs, a website that archives article revisions from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, CNN, &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the BBC, with two brothers who were programmers, MIT graduate student Eric Price and Tddium employee Greg Price. They built the website in 38 hours (including sleep) during the June 16–17, 2012, Knight-Mozilla-M.I.T. hackathon at the MIT Media Lab.

Lee is a producer of the documentary &quot;Artificial Gamer&quot;.

<text>Harry Vernon Quick (28 June 1941 – 19 October 2024) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1993 until 2007, representing the electorate of Franklin in Tasmania. He sat as a member of the Labor Party from 1993 to 2007, when he was expelled from the party for failing to pay his membership dues. An outspoken maverick MP, he did not contest the 2007 federal election.

==Early life==
He was a teacher, education officer and electorate officer before entering politics. He worked for Senator Michael Tate prior to being elected to the House.

==Politics==
He first entered politics in 1993 after winning the southern Tasmanian seat of Franklin in the House of Representatives. On the night of the 1993 federal election, Quick was the first member to become elected (mainly due to the daylight saving time difference), reclaiming Franklin for Labor, for the first time in 17 years. During the time he was member for Franklin the one-time Liberal stronghold became a reasonably safe Labor seat. Even in the 2004 federal election where all Tasmania n Labor members lost support, Quick&#x27;s decline was the smallest.

He also protested against the 2003 Iraq war in which Australian troops took part. He once took some Tasmanian apples into the Federal parliament in protest against legalising the import of New Zealand apples which have been banned in Australia for 80 years because of bio-security risk reasons, notably the Fireblight disease. The Speaker of the New Zealand Parliament was present on an official visit, and Speaker Neil Andrew named Quick for refusing to discard the apples as requested. He opposed the 2005 Walker Corporation planned development at Ralphs Bay, Lauderdale near Hobart that the State Labor Government had hoped for. He has always believed that politicians should take a &quot;hands on&quot; role in the community. Quick was an Opposition Whip 2001–04.

On 12 August 2005, Quick announced that he would not contest his seat at the next federal election, blaming what he called the party&#x27;s left-right factional disputes and lack of a strong leader as the reasons for his retirement. Quick caused controversy during the 2006 state election by endorsing not only fellow Labor candidates in the state equivalent of his seat, but also a Tasmanian Greens member, Nick McKim.

Quick was expelled from the ALP on 20 August 2007 for failing to pay his membership fees, and appearing with Liberal party representatives Vanessa Goodwin the candidate for Franklin and minister Joe Hockey when the preselected ALP candidate for Franklin was Tasmanian union official Kevin Harkins who Quick opposed. Harkins subsequently resigned as candidate after more controversy and Julie Collins was preselected as the candidate instead. He sat as an Independent member until his retirement.

In February 2009, Quick was reported to be seeking preselection for the Tasmanian Legislative Council division of Derwent as a representative of the Tasmanian Greens. He had joined the Greens in July 2008. Five days after announcing his intention to contest the seat held by Treasurer Michael Aird, Quick abruptly changed his mind, citing a desire to spend more time with his family.

Quick was elected in the 2014 general Tasmanian council elections to Glenorchy City Council as alderman and was elected deputy mayor of Glenorchy, but defeated for both positions in 2018. Quick was elected in the 2022 general Tasmanian council elections to Glenorchy City Council as alderman.

==Death==
Quick died in Adelaide from cancer on 19 October 2024, at the age of 83.

<doc id="593294" wikidata="Q1491810" url="?curid=593294" title="Galen Strawson">
<text>Galen John Strawson (; born 1952) is a British analytic philosopher and literary critic who works primarily on philosophy of mind, metaphysics (including free will, panpsychism, the mind–body problem, and the self), John Locke, David Hume, Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche. He has been a consultant editor at &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; for many years, and a regular book reviewer for &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He is the son of philosopher P. F. Strawson. He holds a chair in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Texas, Austin, and taught for many years before that at the University of Reading, City University of New York, and Oxford University.

==Education and career==
Strawson, the elder son of Oxford philosopher P. F. Strawson, was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford (1959–65), where he won a scholarship to Winchester College (1965–68). He left school at 16, after completing his A-levels and winning a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he read Oriental studies (1969–71), social and political science (1971–72), and moral sciences (1972–73) before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an &quot;auditeur libre&quot; (audit student) at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne as a French Government Scholar (1977–78).

Strawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as Fellow and Tutor of Jesus College, Oxford. In 1993, he was a visiting research fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a visiting professor at NYU (1997), Rutgers University (2000), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2010) and the Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales, Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, Princeton University (2011). In 2000, he moved to the University of Reading as professor of philosophy, and was also distinguished professor of philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the City University of New York Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the University of Texas, Austin, as holder of a new chair in philosophy.

==Philosophical work==

===Free will===
In the free will debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether determinism is true or not. He argues for this position with what he calls his &quot;basic argument&quot;, which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us. In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:

# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.
# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in certain crucial mental respects.
# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.
# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.

This argument resembles Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s position in &quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;, summarised by E. F. J. Payne as the &quot;law of motivation, which states that a definite course of action inevitably ensues on a given character and motive&quot;.

===Panpsychism===

Strawson has argued that what he calls &quot;realistic physicalism&quot; (or &quot;realistic monism&quot;) entails panpsychism. He writes that &quot;as a real physicalist, then, I hold that the mental/experiential is physical.&quot; He quotes the physicist Arthur Eddington in support of his position as follows: &quot;If we must embed our schedule of indicator readings in some kind of background, at least let us accept the only hint we have received as to the significance of the background—namely that it has a nature capable of manifesting itself as a mental activity. The editor of the &quot;Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot;, Anthony Freeman, has written that panpsychism is regarded by many as either &quot;plain crazy, or else a direct route back to animism and superstition&quot;. But it has a long tradition in Western thought.

<text>Sylhet (Sylheti: ꠍꠤꠟꠐ; ; ) is a metropolitan city in the north eastern region of Bangladesh. It serves as the administrative center for both the Sylhet District and the Sylhet Division. The city is situated on the banks of the Surma River and, as of 2024, has a population of 999,374 making it the fifth-largest city in Bangladesh.

Sylhet is known for its tea plantations and natural scenery. The region has been inhabited since ancient times, and since the city&#x27;s establishment in the 14th century has been ruled by various dynasties including the Mughals, the British, and the Nawabs of Bengal. The city is also home to several important landmarks, such as one of the Islamic sites in Bangladesh, the Shah Jalal Dargah, which attracts thousands of pilgrims annually. Sylhet is also the first city in the country to have a road with no overhead cable.

Sylhet is one of the most economically important cities in Bangladesh after Dhaka and Chittagong. A major commercial and financial center, Sylhet is home to several multinational companies and industries, including the tea industry, which generates a significant amount of revenue for the city. The city has a diverse population, with Bengalis, Manipuris and other ethnic groups living together. Sylhet has diverse transport infrastructure, with a modern airport, railway station, and bus terminals that connect it to other parts of the country. The city also has several educational institutions, including Sylhet Agricultural University, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology and Sylhet Cadet College.

==Etymology and names==
Sylhet is the anglicisation of (&quot;Śilhôṭ&quot;), one of the archaic native names for the city. The local name is generally thought to be directly derived from (&quot;Śrīhaṭṭa&quot;), the Sanskrit name of the city. The city of Śrīhaṭṭa takes its name from &quot;Śrīhaṭṭanātha&quot;, the tutelary deity of the Nātha dynasty who promoted the early settlement of Nāthas in the Surma and Barak valleys between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, founding the Śrīhaṭṭa &quot;janapada&quot; and establishing &quot;Śrīhaṭṭanātha&quot; idols across the region. The later Hindu monarchs of Sylhet, such as Gour Govinda, continued to pay tribute to the deity as &quot;Hāṭkeśvara&quot; or &quot;Haṭṭanātha&quot; as evident from the Devipurana and copper-plate inscriptions.

== History ==

In 1303, the Sultan of Lakhnauti Shamsuddin Firoz Shah conquered Sylhet by defeating Gour Govinda. Sylhet became a part of the Bengal Sultanate. In the 16th century, Sylhet was controlled by the Baro-Bhuiyan zamindars and later became a sarkar (district) of the Mughal Empire. Sylhet emerged after 1612 as the Mughals&#x27; most significant imperial outpost in Bengal east of Dhaka, and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century. British rule began in the 18th century under the administration of the East India Company. Sylhet became a key source of lascars in the British Empire due in part to its ancient seafaring tradition. The Sylhet municipal board was established in 1867. Originally part of the Bengal Presidency and later Eastern Bengal and Assam, the town became part of Colonial Assam in 1874. A devastating earthquake demolished almost the entire town on 12 June 1897 following which a modern and European model new town was built on the wreckage. From the beginning of the 20th century, the importance of Sylhet increased with the establishment of the tea industry.

In 1947, following a referendum and the partition of British India, Sylhet became part of East Pakistan. In 1995, the Government of Bangladesh declared Sylhet as the sixth divisional headquarters of the country. Sylhet has played a vital role in the Economy of Bangladesh. Several of Bangladesh&#x27;s finance ministers have been members of parliament from the city of Sylhet. Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran was a long time mayor of Sylhet. Humayun Rashid Choudhury, a diplomat from Sylhet, served as President of the UN General Assembly and Speaker of the Bangladesh National Parliament.

In 2001, the municipality was upgraded to the Sylhet City Corporation. It was made a metropolitan city in 2009.

== Geography and climate ==
Sylhet is located in the northeastern region of Bangladesh within the Sylhet Division, the Sylhet District, and Sylhet Sadar Upazila. Sylhet has a typical Bangladeshi tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) at higher elevations. The rainy season runs from April to October, and is generally hot and humid with heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day. The shorter dry season runs from November to February, with very warm and fairly clear weather. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of occurs between May and September.

The city is located within a topographically distinctive region of Bangladesh characterized by dramatic hills and basins. The physiography of Sylhet consists mainly of hill soils and encompasses a few large depressions known locally as &quot;beels,&quot; which are frequently oxbow lakes caused by tectonic subsidence during the earthquake of 1762.

Geologically, the region is complex and diverse; higher-elevation regions date partly to the Plio-Miocene age. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years, three major earthquakes have hit the city with magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter Scale, most recently in 1918.


== Administration ==
Robert Lindsay, who served as the District Collector of Sylhet from 1778 to 1790, mentioned Sylhet in his autobiography, &quot;Oriental Miscellanies: Anecdotes of Indian Life&quot;, as &#x27;a small bazaar (market)&#x27;. He wrote, &quot;The town was then merely a small market. The inhabitants’ houses were situated on the hills and hidden behind forests and jungles.&quot; Exactly 100 years after his tenure, in 1878, Sylhet was upgraded into a municipality with an approximate area of about 1.75 square kilometers. The civic body of Sylhet was formed according to the Sylhet City Corporation Act, 2001, which came into effect on April 10, 2001. On July 28, 2002, Sylhet Municipality board was upgraded to a City Corporation, which covered an area of 26.50 square kilometers and was divided into 27 wards. Currently, the city is administered by the &quot;Sylhet City Corporation&quot;. On August 31, 2021, a gazette notification was issued to expand the area of Sylhet City Corporation. According to the gazette, several mouzas from four unions of Sylhet Sadar Upazila and three unions of Dakshin Surma Upazila were included in the City Corporation. Subsequently, the expanded areas were reorganized and boundaries were defined on a ward basis under Sections 29 and 30 of the Local Government (City Corporation) Act, 2009. Currently, the City Corporation consists of 42 wards and covers an area of 79.5 square kilometers. At present, Sylhet is the district-headquarters as well as the divisional headquarters of the districts of Sunamganj, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sylhet District. The Sylhet City Corporation is responsible for the services that are provided within the city which includes traffic, roads, garbage collection, water supply, registrations and many others. The corporation consists of the Mayor and 22 other commissioners, and focuses on the development of the city. Sylhet is divided into 6 metropolitan &quot;thanas&quot; (police stations), 42 wards, and 1224 mahallas.

===Military===
Sylhet is strategically important for the Bangladesh Armed Forces. The Bangladesh Army&#x27;s 17th Infantry Division is based at Jalalabad Cantonment in Sylhet. The cantonment is also home of the School of Infantry and Tactics (SI&amp;T) and the 1st Para-commando Battalion, an elite commando unit of the Bangladesh Army.

===Healthcare===
Sylhet is also home to many hospitals such as the Shahid Shamsuddin Hospital District Hospital, Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, Jalalabad Ragib-Rabeya Medical College, North East Medical College, and Sylhet Women&#x27;s Medical College.

In 2018, Sylhet Medical University was established in the city, following the Prime Minister&#x27;s order to found a medical university in each division with the goal of maintaining medical standards in colleges. According to the order, Chittagong and Rajshahi Medical University have already been established, and Sylhet Medical University is the fourth Medical University of the directive.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2011 Bangladesh census, Sylhet has a population of 485,138. The population growth rate of the city is 1.73%, a decrease from 1.93% in 1991. Sylhet has a sex ratio of 861 females to 1000 males and a literacy rate of 67.8%.

The majority of the population are Bengali Muslims, while significant minority population groups include the Bengali Hindus, Bishnupriya Manipuri and others. Sylheti is spoken by the vast majority of the people, while Standard Bengali is the official language used by the state government and officials. 2,424 (0.45%) of the population are of an ethnic minority, of which 2,040 are Manipuri.

The majority of people in Sylhet are Muslims (86.5%), while other religious groups include Hindus (13.3%) and less than 0.2% of other religions, mainly Buddhists and Christians.

== Economy ==
The Sylhet Metropolitan Area is one of Bangladesh&#x27;s main business centres. Sylhet&#x27;s economy is closely linked with the Bangladeshi diaspora, especially the British Bangladeshi community. The city receives a significant portion of the country&#x27;s annual remittances, which have driven growth in real estate and construction. A number of shopping centres, restaurants and hotels have opened as a result. Sylhet also relies on religious tourism, with thousands of devotees visiting its Sufi shrines annually, as well as ecotourism in its broader natural hinterland. Nature resorts have been built in the city&#x27;s outskirts. Several important Bangladeshi companies are based in Sylhet, including Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution, Sylhet Gas Fields and Alim Industries. Biman Bangladesh Airlines operates several flights from Sylhet to the United Kingdom and the Middle East. Roads connect Sylhet with the Indian states of Meghalaya and Assam.

Sylhet&#x27;s hinterland plays a vital role in the economy of Bangladesh. It is home to the country&#x27;s largest natural gas fields, sole crude oil field, largest tea plantations, rubber, palm oil, cane, agarwood and citrus farms. Rice production in the region is one of the country&#x27;s highest. Heavy industries include power plants, fertilizer plants, cement plants and liquefied petroleum gas plants. Other major industries in the region include ceramics, machinery and equipment, ready-made garments and pharmaceuticals. Most of the tea production in Bangladesh is based around Sylhet, much of which is eventually exported internationally.

=== Utilities ===
Sylhet has high rates of electricity shortages and water shortages. According to the Power Development Board, as of 2009, Sylhet was only receiving 50 MW, half of the required demand of 100 MW. The city corporation was also supplying only 22,500 gallons of water, far less than the demand of about 65,000. The major sources of water to the city are the tube wells and the Surma River. Tests of tube wells in Sylhet District by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 1997 found that about 27.6% contained more arsenic than the acceptable limit set by Bangladesh of 50 micrograms per liter, and 49.2% contained more arsenic than the World Health Organization standard of 10 micrograms per liter. There are about 331 registered restaurants in the city, but only 15% maintain sanitary facilities and 85% have unhygienic conditions that are unsafe for the public.

The N2 connects the city with Bangladesh&#x27;s capital and largest city, Dhaka, as well as with many other parts of the country. The N2 highway is also part of the Asian Highway Network&#x27;s two longest routes, AH1 and AH2.

===Air===
Sylhet is served by Osmani International Airport, located at the north of the city. It is Bangladesh&#x27;s third busiest airport, and it became an international airport due to demand driven by expatriate Bangladeshis and their families living in the United Kingdom and the United States. The most prevalent airlines at the airport are Biman Bangladesh Airlines, US-Bangla Airlines and Novoair.

Osmani International Airport received its first international arrival on 3 November 2002, with a Biman plane arriving from Kuwait via Abu Dhabi en route to Dhaka. Sylhet&#x27;s first direct international flight arrived on 15 March 2017 when a Flydubai direct flight from Dubai landed at the airport. Work began in 2006 to upgrade the airport to international standards, including a new terminal building, a jetway, a taxiway, and expansion of the runway to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft. In May 2007, Biman announced direct Hajj flights originating from the airport later that year. As of 2020, Biman Bangladesh operates direct flight to London from Sylhet. All Bangladeshi airlines operate regular domestic flights to Dhaka and Biman operates regular domestic flights to Cox&#x27;s Bazar.

In response to the increase in passenger and cargo demand at the airport, work began in 2020 on a new international passenger terminal building, as well as a cargo building, a control tower, parking areas, and a taxiway.

<text>Donald James Randall (2 May 1953 – 21 July 2015) was an Australian politician of the Liberal Party. He represented the Division of Swan, Western Australia in the Australian House of Representatives from 1996 to 1998, as well as the Division of Canning, Western Australia, from 2001 until his death in 2015. He was born in Merredin, Western Australia, and was educated at Graylands Teachers College, Perth. He was a teacher and marketing consultant before entering politics.

Randall died of a heart attack while in office, and the 2015 Canning by-election was held in his seat.

==Electoral history==
Randall made his first run for office in 1993, when he ran in the safe state Labor seat of Belmont and was defeated by future opposition leader Eric Ripper.

He was a member of the Belmont City Council 1993–96 before running in Swan in the 1996 election. He was initially slated to run against Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley. However, with Labor sinking in the polls, Beazley transferred to the slightly friendlier seat of Brand, and Randall won with a majority of 3.9 percent. He was defeated after only one term by Labor&#x27;s Kim Wilkie.

For the next election, Randall sought to run in Canning. The Labor incumbent, Jane Gerick, had been severely hurt by a redistribution which all but erased her majority, reducing it from 3.5 percent to only 0.4 percent. Randall was elected on a swing of 0.8 percent.

Randall spent much of 2003 priming for a rematch against Gerick, but Gerick died of a cerebral brain hemorrhage in December 2003. Her replacement, Cimlie Bowden, resigned in early 2004 after accusing party insiders of undercutting her campaign. Labor then turned to former WA Deputy ALP leader Kay Hallahan, a former state MLA for Armadale, almost all of which is located in Canning. However, the instability on the Labor side crippled its chances, and Randall was reelected with a swing of 9.2 percent in his favour, technically making Canning a safe Liberal seat.

Randall was re-elected to Canning at the 2010 election, defeating high-profile Labor candidate and former Labor MP, Alannah MacTiernan, though Canning was the only seat in Western Australia to record a two-party preferred swing to Labor. Randall was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott in September 2010.

On 9 February 2015 Randall seconded a federal Liberal Party leadership spill motion (moved by Luke Simpkins). Simpkins stated that such a motion would give Liberal members of parliament and senators the opportunity to either endorse the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott or &quot;seek a new direction.&quot; The spill motion was defeated 61 votes to 39.

==Controversy==
On 13 February 2008, Randall was one of six Liberal MPs not present when a motion was passed unanimously apologising to the stolen generations of indigenous children between federation and the 1970s. The others were fellow West Australian MPs Wilson Tuckey, Dennis Jensen and Luke Simpkins (as well as Sophie Mirabella and Alby Schultz) who chose to leave the house in protest to the apology to the Stolen Generations.

On 21 October 2010, Randall referred to Australia&#x27;s public national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the &quot;Gay-BC&quot;, in response to a journalist.

On 15 June 2011 at a Friends of Mining lunch, Randall used the phrase &#x27;pussy-whipped&#x27; to describe the mining industry&#x27;s relationship with then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

===Expenses controversy===

====Melbourne travel====
On 15 September 2012 Randall travelled to Melbourne, on a trip explained as being for &#x27;sittings of Parliament&#x27; and which cost taxpayers $5300; the Australian Parliament, however, has not sat in Melbourne since 1927.

====Cairns travel====
In November 2012, Randall travelled to Cairns with his wife, for which he claimed more than $10,000 in travel expenses for &quot;electorate business&quot;. The week after his return he took possession of an investment property in Cairns.

West Australian state Liberal MP, Rob Johnson, called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to &quot;dump&quot; Randall over the trip. Prime Minister Abbott defended Randall&#x27;s travel claims, saying that Randall was conducting &quot;very important discussions&quot; with the then Chief Opposition Whip Warren Entsch. However, when quizzed by &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot;, Entsch refused to divulge the content of those discussions and admitted he did not know if they constituted &quot;electorate business&quot; as Randall had claimed.

==Death==
Randall was found dead in his car near the Boddington (WA) Golf Course, on 21 July 2015, having suffered a heart attack.

<doc id="593326" wikidata="Q761085" url="?curid=593326" title="Anaconda Plan">
<text>The Anaconda Plan was a strategy outlined by the Union Army for suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War. Proposed by Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war and likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The snake image caught on, giving the proposal its popular name.

In the early days of the Civil War, Scott&#x27;s proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features. First, all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded. Secondly, a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy. A spearhead, a relatively small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats, should advance rapidly, capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence. It would be followed by a more traditional army, marching behind to secure victories. The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans. When they fell, the river would be in US hands from its source to its mouth, and the rebellion would be cut in two.

==Origin of plan==
The Anaconda had a logical development, both in its origin and the way it played out in the experience of battle. The blockade had already been proclaimed by Lincoln. On April 19, 1861, a week after the bombardment of Fort Sumter that marked the outbreak of the war, he announced that the ports of all the seceded states, from South Carolina to Texas, would be blockaded; later, when Virginia and North Carolina also seceded, their coastlines were added. The executive order was not rescinded until the end of the war and so the blockade existed independently of Scott&#x27;s plan.

In the early days of the secession movement, the status of the border states Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware, all of which allowed slavery, was unclear. All except Delaware had strong pro-Southern interests. Missouri was torn by internal conflict that mimicked in miniature the larger war that was convulsing the nation, Maryland was kept in the Union by jailing many of the opposition faction, and Kentucky tried to keep the peace by proclaiming its neutrality by aiding neither the North nor the South if both would agree to leave the state alone.

Because Congress was not in session to authorize presidential initiatives to suppress the rebellion, the burden of raising troops for the war fell on the loyal state governments. Ohio was particularly active in doing so and early acquired the services of George B. McClellan, who was to serve as the commander of its militia, with the rank of Major General of Volunteers. In a few weeks, as the state militias were incorporated into the national service, the militias of Indiana and Illinois were added to his command. From this power base, he felt enabled on April 27, 1861, to write a letter to General Winfield Scott outlining his strategy. He proposed an immediate march on Richmond, by now the capital of the Confederacy, directed up the Kanawha River. Alternatively, if Kentucky were to leave the Union, a march directly across that state should take Nashville, and then, he would &quot;act on circumstances.&quot;

Scott&#x27;s endorsement of McClellan&#x27;s letter, which he submitted to the President, shows that he considered it but not favorably. Firstly, the Kanawha was not suited for water transport so the march on Richmond would have to be overland and thus subject to breakdowns of men, horses, and equipment. More seriously, western Virginia (West Virginia had not yet parted from Virginia) was still very much pro-Union; according to Scott&#x27;s estimate, its populace stood five out of seven opposed to secession. An invasion as proposed would alienate many of them and subject both enemies and friends to the ravages of war. The same argument could be applied to Kentucky. Perhaps most damagingly, the war as proposed would subjugate the Confederacy piecemeal, with by necessity the border states bearing most of the burden, &quot;instead of enveloping them all (nearly) at once by a cordon of ports on the Mississippi to its mouth from its junction with the Ohio, and by blockading ships on the seaboard.&quot;

The germ of Scott&#x27;s Anaconda Plan for suppressing the insurrection is seen in the endorsement. After giving the plan more thought he submitted his proposal in a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861. A second letter, dated May 21, was his final plan outline.

Scott was not able to impose his strategic vision on the government. Aged and infirm, he had to retire before the end of the year. He was replaced as General-in-Chief by McClellan.

==Development of Mississippi River==
Under McClellan and his eventual successor in the West, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck, the Mississippi became a somewhat neglected theater for operations in the West. Halleck, with McClellan&#x27;s approval, believed in turning the enemy&#x27;s Mississippi River strongholds rather than attacking them directly, so he moved away from the river. As he saw it, the Tennessee rather than the Mississippi was the &quot;great strategic line of the Western campaign.&quot;

The Navy Department, however, remained committed to the idea of opening the Mississippi. In the person of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, it decided early on the capture of New Orleans by a naval expedition from the Gulf of Mexico, after which all other towns bordering the river would fall rather than face bombardment. The task of taking New Orleans was entrusted to Captain (later Admiral) David Glasgow Farragut, who followed his own plans for the battle; running his fleet past the forts that defended the city from the south on the night of April 24, 1862, he forced the city to surrender. After repairing his ships from the damage they had suffered while passing the forts, he sent them up the river, where they successively sought and obtained the surrender of Baton Rouge and Natchez. The string of easy conquests came to an end at Vicksburg, Mississippi, however, as the Confederate position there occupied bluffs high enough to render them impregnable to the naval gunnery of the day.

Following the loss of Island No. 10 shortly before Farragut took New Orleans, the Confederates had abandoned Memphis, Tennessee, leaving only a small rear guard to conduct a delaying operation. In early June, this was swept aside at the First Battle of Memphis by the gunboats of the Western Gunboat Flotilla (soon thereafter to be transformed into the Mississippi River Squadron) and the United States Ram Fleet, and the Mississippi was open down to Vicksburg. Thus that city became the only point on the river not in Federal hands.

Again, the Army under Halleck did not grasp the opportunity that was provided. He failed to send even a small body of troops to aid the ships, and soon Farragut was forced by falling water levels to withdraw his deep-draft vessels to the vicinity of New Orleans. The Army did not attempt to take Vicksburg until November, and then the Army was under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, after Halleck had been called to Washington to replace McClellan as General-in-Chief. 

By the time Grant became commander in the West, the Confederate Army had been able to fortify Vicksburg and Port Hudson to the south. This stretch – measured along roads, somewhat longer on the river – including the confluence of the Red River with the Mississippi, became the last contact between the eastern Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi. No doubt of its importance, the government of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond strengthened both positions. Command at Vicksburg in particular passed from Brig. Gen. Martin L. Smith to Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton; the size of the defending army increased in step with the advancing rank of its commander.

The campaign for Vicksburg eventually settled into a siege, which terminated on July 4, 1863, with Pemberton&#x27;s surrender of all the forces under his command. At that time, his army numbered approximately 29,500 men.

When word of the loss of Vicksburg reached the garrison at Port Hudson, Maj. Gen. Franklin Gardner, the commander there, knew that further resistance was pointless. On July 9, 1863, he surrendered the post and its garrison to the Federal Army of the Gulf and its commander, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks. Henceforth, in the phrase of Abraham Lincoln, &quot;The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.&quot;

==Development of blockade==

The Anaconda Plan as proposed by Scott relied on the blockade, as he stated it, &quot;to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.&quot; 
Insofar as he foresaw direct combat, it was to be more or less confined to the central thrust down the Mississippi River. Almost surely he did not anticipate the level of violence that it provoked. For that matter, the blockade itself had to be modified by events, provoking much of the bloodshed that he hoped to avoid.

Scott&#x27;s proposal for the blockade was not properly a strategy although it is often referred to as such by historians. It did not estimate the forces that would be needed to guard the at least of coastline in the seceded states. It did not consider an allocation of resources. It did not set out a timeline or even name points of particular concern. Much of that was later done by the Blockade Strategy Board, a group meeting at the request of the Navy Department but also with representatives from both the Army and the Treasury Department (Coast Survey). During the summer of 1861, the board issued a series of reports recommending how best to maintain the blockade, taking into account the topography of the coast, the relative merits of the various southern ports, the opposition likely to be encountered, and the nature of the ships that would be used by both sides. The board recommendations concerning the Gulf Coast were rather rudimentary and largely ignored, but the blockade on the Atlantic coast followed their plan reasonably closely.

===Atlantic blockade===
All parties recognized from the start that the blockading ships would have to be powered by steam. The limited endurance of steamships then implied that one of the first requirements would be a possession of a harbor that would serve as a coaling station near the southern end of the blockading line, as otherwise, blockaders would spend too much of their time going to and from home port seeking replenishment. All suitable harbors south of the Chesapeake Bay, however, were held by seceded states. To establish the blockade, therefore, at least one of them would have to be taken by the Federal forces. Thus, the blockade was immediately transformed from a purely open-water operation to one of at least limited occupation of enemy territory.

Although the board recommended that Fernandina, Florida, be taken as the southern anchor of the blockade, two other positions were captured before Fernandina. A pair of minor forts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina near Cape Hatteras were taken by Union forces on August 28–29, 1861, and on November 7 a major fleet operation at Port Royal, South Carolina, resulted in the capture of a deep-water harbor midway between Savannah and Charleston. The Hatteras expedition had been planned as a raid; the plan called for it to be held only long enough to block up Hatteras Inlet. However, it was transformed into an incursion and led early in the next year to a full invasion, the so-called Burnside Expedition, which included the capture of Roanoke Island and established the Union Army permanently in eastern North Carolina. Port Royal in Union hands was soon used as a base to make the blockade of Savannah almost complete, but Charleston was not so easily sealed off. Use of its harbor by blockade runners was curtailed, but to close it completely required some of the bitterest and most persistent ground action of the war.

When Fernandina was seized in early March 1862, the war was almost a year old, and some important changes had taken place. Following the Confederate defeats at Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and Roanoke Island in North Carolina, the War Department in Richmond decided to concentrate its armies in vital interior areas, removing them from much of the coast. Only a few major ports would be defended. Only three of these were on the Atlantic seaboard: Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. Only the first two were consequential; a mere eight steam-powered blockade runners entered Georgia or northern Florida ports throughout the entire war.

The blockade of Charleston merged into the campaign against the city waged by both the Army and the Navy, not completed until the last days of the war. (See &quot;Raising the Flag at Fort Sumter&quot;.) Rather early in the war, the Federal Navy tried to block the harbor entrance by sinking ballast-laden hulks in the channels, but this proved ineffective or worse. Later, ships used in the blockade were used for the abortive assault on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863. They also provided artillery support for the infantry attacks on Battery Wagner on July 11 and July 18, 1863. After both of these attempts to take the battery failed, the ships remained active in the ensuing siege that eventually resulted in its capture. Then, the Union was able to mount its guns at the mouth of the harbor, and although the city continued to resist, it was no longer the preferred terminus for blockade runners.

While all this was going on, the local defenders were not passive. Extensive efforts to break the blockade included the use of torpedoes (mines) and armored ships to sink or otherwise render inoperative the Federal vessels. Imaginative methods to achieve the same result in the development and deployment of submarines and torpedo boats.

By contrast, the blockade of Wilmington was fairly conventional and is the focus of most debate concerning the efficacy of the blockade. After the middle of July 1863, when Charleston was largely sealed off, most of the trade between the Confederacy and northern Europe was conducted through Wilmington. The port retained its primacy until near the end of the Rebellion, when Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, was captured by Union forces in January 1865.

===Gulf blockade===
The blockade of Confederate ports on the Gulf of Mexico was less important than that on the Atlantic. Not only were they farther from the centers of blockade-running activity in Bermuda and Nassau, but ships trying to reach them from the Atlantic Ocean would have to run past the Florida Keys, which remained in Federal control throughout the war and served as the base for the Gulf (later, East Gulf) Blockading Squadron. The same decision by the Confederate War Department led to the abandonment of most of the Atlantic coast except for the major ports applied to the Gulf as well, with the result that only Mobile, New Orleans, and Galveston were defended. (Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, is a special case that will not be treated here because of its international implications.) Galveston was captured by Federal forces on October 4, 1862, but was retaken by the Rebels on New Year&#x27;s Day of the next year. It remained accessible to blockade runners for the rest of the war but, like all of the Trans-Mississippi, was rendered worthless to the Rebellion when the loss of Vicksburg completed Federal control of the Mississippi River.

The Blockade Strategy Board had recommended that Ship Island, which lies in the Gulf between Mobile and New Orleans, be taken and used as a base for the (West) Gulf Blockading Squadron. This was easily done, as on September 16, 1861, it was abandoned by its Rebel defenders, who feared that they might be cut off from the mainland. Their fears were justified; the next day, arrived and offloaded Federal troops to take possession. Almost immediately, however, the island was transformed from a base and coaling station to a more important function; it became the staging area for the approaching attack on the Mississippi River forts that shielded New Orleans. Early in 1862, the Gulf Blockading Squadron was reconfigured into two separate entities, the East Gulf Blockading Squadron (EGBS) commanded by Flag-Officer James L. Lardner and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron (WGBS) led by Flag-Officer David G. Farragut. 

After New Orleans fell to the Union fleet under Farragut on April 29, 1862, Mobile was the only serious problem for the blockade. It remained so, much like Wilmington, until late in the war. In August 1864, Farragut got permission from the Navy Department and troops from the War Department to seize the forts at the entrance to Mobile Bay. Following his famous &quot;Damn the torpedoes&quot; run past the forts, they fell and were occupied by Federal soldiers. Mobile itself remained in Confederate control, but it was no longer useful as a port. In July 1862, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, wrote a letter to the commanders of both Gulf blockading squadrons that they would need to start recruiting freed blacks to keep up with labor demands.

Although a century and a half has elapsed since the end of the Civil War, the importance of the Anaconda Plan remains to some extent a matter of debate. The war was not the relatively bloodless affair that General Scott promised in his original proposal. Most historians regard this as merely a modification of the basic strategy in the course of events. At least one historian, however, denies that there ever was anything like a coherent strategy for subduing the South. Rowena Reed contends that the central government in Washington was unable to impose its will on the field commanders so the war was a series of independent campaigns, each of which was conducted according to the whims of whatever general happened to be in charge. According to her view, the Anaconda is a later conceptual imposition on events for which order did not exist at the time that they took place.

For the historians who contend that a rational plan existed, the debate, like the plan itself, has two parts. The importance of the campaign to capture the Mississippi River and thereby lop off the Trans-Mississippi is acknowledged. Virtually all present-day historians agree that the Union&#x27;s Western campaign was at least as significant as that in the East. To the extent that fighting in the West before mid-1863 can be regarded as preparing for or culminating in the capture of Vicksburg, the Anaconda has been validated.

The worth of the Union blockade, however, remains controversial. No one seriously contends that it alone would have won the war for the North. But while it is conceded not to have been sufficient, the question remains if it was necessary, i.e. whether the South would have endured had the blockade not sapped the strength of the Rebel armies beyond the tipping point.

Those who deny the importance of the blockade advance two principal arguments. First, it was never very effective. Throughout the war, more than three-quarters of all attempts to evade the blockade were successful. The one quarter that did not get through can be written off as operational losses. That was because the blockade runners were small and built for speed, rather than capacity. 

Second and perhaps more important, the Southern armies were not hamstrung for lack of material, at least owing to the blockade. The supply problems they did face were most often caused by the poor condition of Confederate railroads. However much of the deterioration of the Southern railroads was caused by overloading due to the blockade disrupting normal coastal sea traffic and control of inland waterways by the Union Navy. 

Those who believe that the blockade was decisive argue that the Southern forces &quot;were&quot; strangled at the end. They point out that the collapse of the Army of Northern Virginia, which in 1865 was virtually all that remained of the Confederacy, followed soon after the loss of Wilmington to the Union. The timing, they contend, was not merely coincidental. Furthermore, the defeat of its armies was not the only way that the South lost. 

The blockade was not only to capture the ships that attempted to evade it but also to discourage others. The blockade runners may have been numerous, but they were built for speed rather than the ability to carry cargo. The more conventional cargo vessels, and their spacious holds, went elsewhere. As a result, Southern exports of cotton fell by 95% from pre-war levels, devaluing its currency, and wrecking its economy. Additionally, the blockade disrupted coastal trade, overloading the marginal Southern railroads and preventing the importation of salt, necessary for preserving food and tanning leather. Unable to sell goods (particularly cotton) on the world market, the Confederate government was already strained financially as early as 1862. As its economy steadily degenerated, it suffered from a general loss of confidence on the part of its citizens.

However, the blockade was less successful in preventing arms and money from being smuggled into Southern ports by blockade runners consisting of lightweight shallow draft steamships built in and operating from British shipyards, mostly in Liverpool and Glasgow. Historians estimated that 2,500–2,800 attempts were made to run the blockade, with at least an 80% success rate. It was estimated the Confederates received thousands of tons of gunpowder, half a million rifles, and several hundred cannons from British blockade runners. As a result, the blockade runners operating from Britain prolonged the war by two years, killing 400,000 additional soldiers and civilians on both sides.

<doc id="593329" wikidata="Q3015488" url="?curid=593329" title="In a Grove">
<text>, also translated as In a Bamboo Grove, is a Japanese short story by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa first published in 1922. It was ranked as one of the &quot;10 best Asian novels of all time&quot; by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2014. &quot;In a Grove&quot; has been adapted several times, most notably by Akira Kurosawa for his award-winning 1950 film &quot;Rashōmon&quot;.

The story centers on the violent death of young samurai Kanazawa no Takehiro, whose body has been found in a bamboo forest near Kyoto. The preceding events unfurl in a series of testimonies, first by passers-by, an auxiliary policeman and a relative, then by the three main protagonists – the samurai, his wife Masago, and bandit Tajōmaru – but the truth remains hidden due to the contradictory recounts given.

==Plot==
The story opens with testimonies given to a police commissioner. The first account is by a woodcutter who has found a man&#x27;s body in the bamboo groves near the road to Yamashina. The man&#x27;s chest had been pierced by a sword, and the blood from the wound and on the ground had already dried up. Asked by the commissioner, the woodcutter denies having seen any weapons or a horse. The only objects which caught his attention were a comb and a piece of rope near the body. He also comments on the trampled leaves at the site, indicating to him that there had been a violent struggle.

The second testimony is given by a traveling Buddhist priest. He says that he saw the man, who was accompanied by a woman on horseback with a veiled face, on the road from Sekiyama to Yamashina around noon the previous day. The man was carrying a sword, a bow and a black quiver with arrows. Upon request, he describes the horse as a tall, short-maned sorrel.

The next person to testify is a &quot;hōmen&quot;, an acquitted prisoner working under contract for the police. He has captured an infamous criminal named Tajōmaru. Tajōmaru had been thrown from a horse, a short-maned sorrel, which was grazing near-by. He still carried the bow and the black quiver with arrows belonging to the deceased. The hōmen reminds the commissioner of last year&#x27;s murder of two women which is attributed to Tajōmaru, and speculates what he might have done to the dead man&#x27;s wife.

The fourth testimony given to the police commissioner is from an old woman. She is the mother of the missing veiled woman, who is named Masago. She identifies the dead man as her daughter&#x27;s husband, samurai Kanazawa no Takehiro, who was on his way to Wakasa, describing him as a benign person who couldn&#x27;t have been hated by anyone. She is convinced that her daughter didn&#x27;t know any other man than Takehiro, and describes her character as strong-willed. Desperate about her daughter&#x27;s unknown fate, she begs the police to find her.

Next, the caught Tajōmaru confesses. He states that he killed the man, but not the still missing woman, not knowing of her whereabouts. Upon first seeing Masago with her husband on the road, her veiled face revealed by a gust, he decided that he was going to rape her. He awakened the man&#x27;s interest by pretending to have found a deserted grave filled with swords and mirrors, which he was willing to sell for a modest price. He first lured the man away, subdued him and tied him to a tree, stuffing his mouth with leaves. He then went back to the woman, making up a story that her husband had fallen ill. When Masago saw her tied-up husband, she pulled a dagger from her bosom and tried to stab Tajōmaru, but he managed to disarm and then violate her. Claiming that he initially had no intention of killing the man, Tajōmaru reports that after the rape, the woman clung to him, insisting that one of the two men who knew of her shame had to die, and that she would leave with the survivor. Suddenly determining that he wanted her for himself, Tajōmaru untied Takehiro and killed him in the subsequent duel. When he turned to Masago, he found that she had fled in the meantime. Tajōmaru took the man&#x27;s weapons as well as the horse, later getting rid of the sword. He closes his recount with the statement that he is accepting the most severe punishment.

The second-to-last account is by a woman at Kiyomizu-dera temple who turns out to be Masago. According to her, Tajōmaru fled after the rape, and her husband, still tied to the tree, looked at her with hate and contempt. Ashamed that she had been raped, she no longer wished to live, but wanted him to die with her. Believing that he agreed on her plan, she plunged her dagger into his chest. She then cut the rope that bound Takehiro and fled from the site. Despite repeated attempts, she found herself lacking the strength to commit suicide as planned. At the end of her confession, she cries.

The final account comes from Takehiro&#x27;s ghost, as delivered through a medium. The ghost says that after the rape, Tajōmaru persuaded Masago to leave her husband and become his own wife, declaring that everything he did was out of love for her. To Takehiro&#x27;s disdain, she not only agreed to follow him, but also ordered him to kill Takehiro. Tajōmaru, repelled by the suggestion, kicked her to the ground and asked Takehiro if he should kill her. While Takehiro still hesitated, Masago fled into the forest. Tajōmaru then freed him and ran away. Takehiro grabbed Masago&#x27;s fallen dagger and plunged it into his chest. Shortly before he died, he sensed someone creep up to him and pull the dagger from his chest.

==Style==
The story is divided into seven sections, one for each testimony, which are all given in direct speech. The first four are explicitly addressing a &quot;police commissioner&quot; or &quot;magistrate&quot; (orig. &quot;kebiishi&quot;), as written in the sections&#x27; titles. The functions of the persons addressed in the last three sections are not mentioned.

==Publication history==
&quot;In a Grove&quot; first appeared in the January 1922 edition of the monthly Japanese literature magazine &quot;Shinchō&quot;.

==Translations==
&quot;Yabu no naka&quot; was translated by Takashi Kojima as &quot;In a Grove&quot; for the 1952 English language edition published by C.E. Tuttle Company. In 1988, a translation by James O&#x27;Brien, titled &quot;Within a Grove&quot;, was released as part a collection of translated works by Akutagawa and Dazai Osamu, published by Arizona State University&#x27;s Center for Asian Studies. For the 2007 Penguin Books edition, Jay Rubin translated the story as &quot;In a Bamboo Grove&quot;.

==Influences==
Akutagawa&#x27;s influences for this story may have come from several different sources:
* A story from the classic Japanese collection &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;: In the 23rd story of the 29th volume—&quot;The Tale of The Bound Man Who Was Accompanying His Wife to Tanba&quot;—a man is tied to a tree in a bamboo grove and forced to watch helplessly as his wife gets raped by a young thief, who has stolen all of their belongings.
* &quot;The Moonlit Road&quot; by Ambrose Bierce: a short story about the murder of a woman, as told by her husband and herself (through a medium), and introduced by their son.
* &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; by Robert Browning: a narrative poem based on the true story about a murder told 12 different ways.

==Adaptations==
&quot;In a Grove&quot; has been repeatedly adapted into films, including:
* &quot;Rashomon&quot; - Japan 1950, directed by Akira Kurosawa
* &quot;The Outrage&quot; - US 1964, directed by Martin Ritt
* &quot;Iron Maze&quot; - US 1987, directed by Hiroaki Yoshida
* &quot;In a Grove&quot; - Japan 1996, directed by Hisayasu Satō
* &quot;Misty&quot; - Japan 1997, directed by Kenki Saegusa
* &quot;The Outrage&quot; - Thailand 2011, directed by M.L. Pundhevanop Dhewakul
* &quot;The Bottomless Bag&quot; - Russia 2017, directed by Rustam Khamdamov

The story was adapted into an opera titled &quot;Rashomon: The Opera&quot; (1995–99) by Alejandro Viñao. It also served, together with two other stories by Akutagawa, as the basis for Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s musical &quot;See What I Wanna See&quot;.

In 2012, Spanish author and illustrator Víctor Santos combined &quot;In a Grove&quot;, &quot;Rashomon&quot; (the other Ryūnosuke Akutagawa short story which the 1950 film was named after), and the legend of the forty-seven rōnin into one graphic novel adaptation titled &quot;Rashomon: A Commissioner Heigo Kobayashi Case&quot;. The first part of the graphic novel, Rashomon, faithfully retells &quot;In a Grove&quot;, with protagonist Commissioner Heigo Kobayashi investigating the death of the samurai Takejiro Kanazawa by interrogating the witnesses (including the victim&#x27;s mother-in-law who had been adapted out of the film version), the prime suspect Tajōmaru, the victim&#x27;s widow, and Kanazawa through the medium. The section ends with Kobayashi unable to determine who and what had killed the samurai, whose widow remarries by becoming Kira Kozukenosuke&#x27;s second wife, and Tajōmaru being executed soon after the investigation.
The second part of the graphic novel, Seppuku, takes place three years later with Kobayashi now investigating the aftermath of Kozukenosuke&#x27;s death at the hands of Asano Naganomi&#x27;s forty-seven loyal rōnin.
&quot;Rashomon: A Commissioner Heigo Kobayashi Case&quot; was first published in Spanish in 2012, with the English version published by Dark Horse Comics in 2017.

==In popular culture==
The story&#x27;s title has become an idiom in Japan, used to signify a situation where due to different views or statements of people involved, the truth remains hidden.

&quot;In a Grove&quot; is the favorite story of the titular character from the movie &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;.

The seventh episode of &quot;R.O.D the TV&quot;, titled &quot;In a Grove&quot;, deals with a similarly confusing mix of truth and lies, reality and pretense.

<text>Bernard Fernand Ripoll (born 6 January 1966) is a former Australian politician. He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016, representing the Division of Oxley, Queensland. In 2013, Ripoll was made Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Shadow Minister for Sport, on 15 September 2015 he resigned from the Shadow Cabinet position.

==Early life==
Ripoll was born on 6 January 1966 in Pézenas, France, the son of Suzanne (née Servera) and Andre Ripoll. His parents were &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot; (European Algerians) of Spanish ancestry who came to France following the Algerian Revolution.

Ripoll moved to Australia as a child, where he learned to speak English, and became an Australian citizen in 1974. He grew up in Inala, Queensland. Ripoll joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a teenager and was an apprentice aircraft electrician from 1983 to 1984. He completed his high school leaving certificate by attending night school. He subsequently worked as an electrician from 1986 to 1990, later completing the degree of Bachelor of Business at the Queensland University of Technology as a marketing major.

Before entering parliament, Ripoll worked as an organiser with the State Public Services Federation of Queensland (now known as the Queensland Public Sector Union) from 1995 to 1998.

==Political career==
At the 1998 federal election, Ripoll sought to regain Oxley for Labor. The seat had been held by Pauline Hanson, who formed One Nation after winning the normally safe Labor seat of Oxley in 1996 as an independent. Prior to the election, Oxley was divided in half, with most of the old Oxley&#x27;s more rural territory shifted to the new Division of Blair. Hanson opted to contest Blair, which contained most of her former base. Former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss had already been preselected as Labor candidate, but a brain tumour forced him to retire from politics, and Ripoll was named in his place.

Ripoll was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure in October 2004.

On 2 March 2012, Ripoll was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business from 25 March 2013.

In April 2015 Ripoll announced that he would not contest the next election, clearing the way for Milton Dick to pursue Labor party preselection. Dick was elected at the 2016 federal election.

==Subsequent activities==
 Ripoll was a director of lobbying firm SAS Group, along with former Nationals MP Larry Anthony.

<text>Åsværet is a small group of islands lying on the Arctic Circle in Dønna Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The islands lie on the south side of the Nordåsværfjord, about south of the island of Lovund and northwest of the island of Dønna. The Åsvær Lighthouse was built here in 1876. The islands are noted for their herring fishery.

<text>Bimetal refers to an object that is composed of two separate metals joined together. Instead of being a mixture of two or more metals, like alloys, bimetallic objects consist of layers of different metals. Trimetal and tetrametal refer to objects composed of three and four separate metals respectively. A bimetal bar is usually made of brass and iron.

Bimetallic strips and disks, which convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement, are the most recognized bimetallic objects due to their name. However, there are other common bimetallic objects. For example, tin cans consist of steel covered with tin. The tin prevents the can from rusting. To cut costs and prevent people from melting them down for their metal, coins are often composed of a cheap metal covered with a more expensive metal. For example, the United States penny was changed from 95% copper to 95% zinc, with a thin copper plating to retain its appearance. A common type of trimetallic object (before the all-aluminium can) was a tin-plated steel can with an aluminum lid with a pull tab. Making the lid out of aluminum allowed it to be pulled off by hand instead of using a can opener, but these cans proved difficult to recycle owing to their mix of metals.

Blades for bandsaws and reciprocating saws are often made with bimetal construction. The teeth, made of high-speed steel, are bonded (by various methods, for example, electron beam welding or laser beam welding) to the softer high-carbon steel base. Such construction makes for blades with a better combination of cutting speed and durability than shown by non-bimetal blades, because the advantages and disadvantages of each of the metals are applied in the best locations: the teeth are harder (and thus cut better), but therefore also brittler; meanwhile, the body area of the band is softer (which would make for poorer teeth), but also less brittle, and thus more resistant to cracking and breaking (which is desirable in the body area).

<doc id="593341" wikidata="Q3366167" url="?curid=593341" title="Unionest Party">
<text>The Unionest Party was a political party in Saskatchewan, Canada, in the early 1980s. The party advocated for a union between the four Western Canadian provinces—British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba—and the United States. The party&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of ‘best&#x27; and &#x27;union’.

== Party history ==
The party was founded in March 1980 by Dick Collver. Collver led the Saskatchewan Progressive Conservative Party for much of the 1970s, and has been credited with reviving the Party&#x27;s electoral prospects. Under his leadership, the party returned to the provincial legislature for the first time in more than a decade in 1975 and formed the Official Opposition in 1978. The party would go on to form a majority government in the 1982 election. However, in 1979 Collver resigned as leader of the PCs and months later announced the formation of his new party, the Unionest Party.

The Unionest Party was an expression of western alienation sentiment, or a dissatisfaction in western provinces with the state of federal politics informed by a sense that western interests were not being taken seriously. Such sentiments grew over the course of the 1970s when resource prices increased dramatically, and western provinces and the federal government—then under Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals—engaged in legal battles over control of resources and revenues. Collver&#x27;s Unionests were not the only new party advocating for secession from Canada; Western Canada Concept was a federal party building a platform on independence for the west. However, the Unionests were unique in advocating for the western provinces to join the United States.

The party was formed shortly after the 1980 federal election, which Collver argued proved that the Canadian federation was not functioning. He also argued that increased &quot;balkanization&quot; through the creation of a new western Canadian nation would weaken the position of the west in the Cold War; as such, he explained that &quot;those of us who believe in individual freedom and liberty must unite in the common cause against ever-increasing Russian domination of the world.&quot;

Days after announcing the new party, Collver recruited another PC MLA, Dennis Ham, to join the Unionest Party, giving the fledgling movement two sitting MLAs. Ham was the brother of Lynda Haverstock, who later became the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. The Party also unsuccessfully sought official status in neighbouring Alberta.

According to Saskatchewan historian Bill Waiser, the push by the party to have the province join the United States was seen as particularly treasonous. In response to the new party, the New Democratic Party government passed retroactive legislation intended to restrict third party status—and the public funding that comes with it—to a party with at least two sitting members that was registered under the &quot;Election Act&quot; on the day of the last general election. Collver responded to the legislation with a 38-hour filibuster.

The Unionest Party was not able to gain traction, and neither Collver nor Ham sought re-election in 1982. As such, the short-lived Unionest Party never contested an election.

<doc id="593343" wikidata="Q4013802" url="?curid=593343" title="Viola pedunculata">
<text>Viola pedunculata, the California golden violet, Johnny jump up, or yellow pansy, is a perennial yellow wildflower of the coast and coastal ranges in California and northwestern Baja California. The common name &quot;Johnny jump up&quot; is usually associated with &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; however, the introduced garden annual.

The plant grows on open, grassy slopes, in chaparral habitats, and in oak woodlands, from sea level to around . It prefers part shade, but will tolerate sun in many locations.

==Description==
&quot;Viola pedunculata&quot; is a perennial, growing from a spongy rhizome. The plant is often low-growing, but can reach a height of .

The leaves are long, cordate (heart-shaped) to deltate-ovate (oblong-triangular), scalloped or toothed, and glabrous or hairy. They are summer deciduous.

The fragrant flowers appear in March and April, and are a rich, saturated yellow to yellow-orange, with brown-purple nectar guides on the lower petals. The flowers are hermaphrodite, and are pollinated by native and introduced insects. Dried in air, the seeds weigh about each.

Subspecies
*&quot;Viola pedunculata&quot; ssp. &quot;pedunculata&quot; 
*&quot;Viola pedunculata&quot; ssp. &quot;tenuifolia&quot; 

==Uses==
===Culinary===
The leaves were used by the Diegueno and Luiseno indigenous people of California for food:. The young leaves were picked before the flowers appeared in the spring, then boiled, and used as greens.

The flower buds and petals are edible. As with other yellow flowers in the genus &quot;Viola&quot;, large quantities may cause diarrhea.An herbal tea or tisane can be brewed from the leaves.

==Cultivation==
The plant is cultivated as an ornamental plant by specialty plant nurseries, for planting as a drought tolerant seasonal groundcover or flowering accent plant in native plant and wildlife gardens; and as a potted plant.

They are propagated by seed or nursery/garden divisions. The plant prefers rich soil, and no irrigation water in summer, when it is dormant.

When cultivated in colder climates outside its native range where not so hardy, it is most successful when propagated in a cold frame.

<doc id="593347" wikidata="Q7243871" url="?curid=593347" title="Prince Consort Essay">
<text>The Prince Consort Essay was a surface printed printer&#x27;s sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds.

Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer&#x27;s sample stamp, or &quot;dummy stamp&quot;.

==Background==
The first essay depicted Queen Victoria, but Edwin Hill cautioned Reynolds not to make any essays with the Queen&#x27;s portrait. Therefore, Prince Albert&#x27;s portrait was used instead. It is noted that the essays have the check letters &quot;F&quot; and &quot;J&quot; and it is believed by some scholars that they are the initials of Ferdinand Joubert, who designed Britain&#x27;s first surface printed postage stamp, the 1855 Four Pence stamp printed by De La Rue, and who may have played a role in the creation of the Prince Consort Essay.

==Production==
The Prince Consort Essay was printed from electros taken from one master plate of 12. The twelve positions all have unique characteristics. The essays were printed in red, red-brown, black and blue, in sheets of 36 (3 horizontal rows of 12), in sheets of 240 and in sheets of 252 (21 panes of 12). The essays are scarce and there are approximately 25 recorded examples perforated 16 by Archer. The majority are imperforate, and there is one rouletted example in the Royal Philatelic Collection.

==Collecting==
Imperforate copies are available to collectors, typically for around several hundred pounds. There are approximately 36 perforated examples recorded and these sell for much higher prices. Of the 36 examples, 3 are in brown, three are in blue (the latest realized £38,080.00 at auction) and the remainder are in black.

<text>Schwetzingen (; ) is a German town in northwest Baden-Württemberg, around southwest of Heidelberg and southeast of Mannheim. 
Schwetzingen is one of the five biggest cities of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district and a medium-sized centre between Heidelberg and Mannheim.

The city is most famous for Schwetzingen Palace and the Schlosstheater. The palace grounds also feature a mosque, the oldest in Germany. Although not functional, it was used by Muslim prisoners in the Franco-Prussian War.

== Geography ==

Schwetzingen is located in the &quot;Rhine-Neckar-triangle&quot; in the plain of the Rhine river, lying west of the Odenwald and in the east of the Rhine. A small stream, the Leimbach, runs through the city before joining the Rhine.

=== Climate ===

Schwetzingen is located in Germany&#x27;s warmest summer region, the &quot;Rhine shift&quot;. In summer, temperatures sometimes rise up to and higher. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate), bordering closely on a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with summer months often averaging above 21 degrees (71 F).

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===

The following municipalities, listed clockwise beginning in the north, border on the city limits of Schwetzingen:
Mannheim, Plankstadt, Oftersheim, Hockenheim, Ketsch and Brühl. The municipal area of Schwetzingen is completely consolidated with Oftersheim. The limits of Plankstadt are only separated by one street from the limits of Schwetzingen.

== History ==

Schwetzingen was mentioned as &quot;Suezzingen&quot; for the first time in 766, recorded in the late twelfth-century Codex Aureus of Lorsch, but there are already traces of settlement from the Stone Age. 
Originally it consisted of two settlements, Ober- and Unterschwetzingen, that grew together in the course of the 17th and 18th century. Originally the town belonged to the diocese of Worms, but later passed to the Counts of the Palatinate in the 12th century.
The moated castle of Schwetzingen is mentioned for the first time in 1350. It was destroyed in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and in the following War of the Palatinate Succession; it was rebuilt by count Johann Wilhelm and his predecessor. From 1720 it served temporarily as the residence of the Elector Karl III Philip (1716–1742) after he moved away from Heidelberg. Later on it served as a summer residence of the Elector of the Palatinate and their court.

Schwetzingen Castle began as a simple aristocratic fishing retreat (much like Versailles and Karlsruhe which began as hunting lodges) and had an eventful architectural history, in several phases of construction, especially during the reigns of the Elector Karl III Philip and Karl IV Theodor (1742–1799) who, as their answer to Versailles, embellished the castle gardens with some of the finest and most elaborate formal water parterres in Germany gardens.

As it evolved, the high central Baroque block of the &quot;Castle&quot; was extended to either side (from 1747 onwards) in matching curved ranges of glazed arcades that were punctuated by pavilions which followed the arc of the vast garden circle. They partly enclose the circle bisected by a wide gravel axis flanked by parterres which centers on a spring-fed water-basin inspired by the &quot;bassin&quot; of Diana at Versailles, but here expressing the more appropriately water-centered Greek myth of the poet Arion and the dolphins.

On the other side at the entrance, a mulberry-tree allée stretched from the centre of the &quot;Castle&quot; to the city of Heidelberg, 10 km away on the horizon, truly a remarkable feat of autocratic landscaping.

The curving outbuildings of Schwetzingen inspired the smaller Rococo perfections of Schloss Benrath, with its quarter arcs of matching &quot;corps de logis&quot; embracing a formal sheet of water, built for Carl Theodor near Düsseldorf, 1756–1770.

In 1759 Schwetzingen received permission to host markets and was developed into a baroque city through the 18th century. In 1803 all the territories of the Palatine electorate east of the Rhine, including Schwetzingen were absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Baden and the castle became a residence of the Grand Dukes of Baden. In 1833 Schwetzingen was elevated to city status by Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden. The beginning of industrialization in Schwetzingen in the year 1850 made the city an important seat of cigar factories and canneries. Also, the cultivation of asparagus gained importance and has remained one of Schwetzingen&#x27;s claims to fame.

The theatre fell into disuse by the late 19th century, but was renovated in 1937 and given its present name after its Rococo style of architecture and used by the Festival since 1952.

<doc id="593355" wikidata="Q504314" url="?curid=593355" title="Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin">
<text>Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin (6 February 1865 – 20 September 1939) was an astronomer of French and Huguenot descent who was born in Cushendun, County Antrim, Ireland.
He was educated in England at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After a spell teaching at Lancing College he found permanent employment at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1891. He joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1888 and was its president from 1929-1931. In 1895 he joined the British Astronomical Association and was president from 1904-1906 and directed its comet section 1898-1901 and 1907-1938.

In 1910 for their studies of Halley’s Comet Crommelin and Philip Herbert Cowell jointly received the Prix Jules Janssen from the Société astronomique de France. For this work they also received the Lindemann prize of the Astronomische Gesellschaft in Germany.

In 1914 Crommelin published an introductory book on astronomy “The Star World”.

Crommelin had four children, of whom two died in a climbing accident on Pillar Rock, Ennerdale, in 1933. The de la Cherois line was succeeded through Crommelin&#x27;s daughter Andrina. The author May Crommelin was one of Andrew’s cousins.

An expert on comets, his calculation of orbits of previously identified Comet Pons 1818 II, Comet Coggia-Winnecke 1873 VII, and Comet Forbes 1928 III in 1929, showed that these were one and the same periodic comet. It thus received the rather unwieldy name &quot;Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes&quot;. In 1948, he was posthumously honored when the comet was renamed after him alone (today, in modern nomenclature, it is designated 27P/Crommelin). This is similar to the case of Comet Encke, where the periodic comet is named after the person who determined the orbit rather than the possibly-multiple discoverers and re-discoverers at each apparition. In 1937 Crommelin and Mary Proctor jointly published a book entitled &quot;Comets: Their Nature, Origin, and Place in the Science of Astronomy”.

Crommelin took part in several solar eclipse expeditions including those of 1896, 1900 and 1905. In 1919 he went to Sobral, in Brazil, and measured the amount of deflection of light caused by the gravitational field of the Sun. The results from these observations were crucial in providing confirmation of the General Theory of Relativity, which Albert Einstein had proposed in 1916.

==Named after Crommelin==
* Comet 27P/Crommelin
* Crommelin (lunar crater)
* Crommelin (Martian crater)
* Asteroid 1899 Crommelin

<doc id="593365" wikidata="Q4669907" url="?curid=593365" title="Absorptive capacity">
<text>In business administration, absorptive capacity is defined as a firm&#x27;s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends. It is studied on individual, group, firm, and national levels. Antecedents are prior-based knowledge (knowledge stocks and knowledge flows) and communication. Studies involve a firm&#x27;s innovation performance, aspiration level, and organizational learning. It has been said that in order to be innovative an organization should develop its absorptive capacity.

==Cohen and Levinthal&#x27;s model==
The concept of absorptive capacity was first defined as a firm&#x27;s &quot;ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends&quot; by Cohen and Levinthal. For them, absorptive capacity depends greatly on prior related knowledge and diversity of background. The investments a firm makes into its research and development (R&amp;D) efforts are therefore central to their model of development of absorptive capacity. The absorptive capacity is seen as cumulative, meaning that it is easier for a firm to invest on a constant basis in its absorptive capacity than investing punctually. Efforts put to develop absorptive capacity in one period will make it easier to accumulate it in the next one.

Absorptive capacity is also said to be a reason for companies to invest in R&amp;D instead of simply purchasing the results &quot;post factum&quot; (e.g. patents). Internal R&amp;D teams increase the absorptive capacity of a company. A firm&#x27;s investment in R&amp;D then impacts directly its absorptive capacity. The more a firm invests in research and development activities, the more it will be able to fully appreciate the value of new external information.

Cohen and Levinthal also stressed that diversity allows an individual to make &quot;novel associations and linkages&quot;. They therefore encourage the hiring of diverse teams in order to have a variety of individuals working together and exposing themselves to different ways of looking at things.

== Zahra and George&#x27;s model ==

Cohen and Levinthal have focused primarily on investments in R&amp;D to develop one&#x27;s absorptive capacity, but many other researchers showed later on that several other areas could be explored to develop an organization&#x27;s absorptive capacity. This led to a review of the concept by Shaker Zahra and Gerry George and a reformulation of the definition that expanded greatly the concept and further defined it as being made of two different absorptive capacities: potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Their new definition of absorptive capacity is &quot;a set of organizational routines and processes by which firms acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge to produce a dynamic organizational capability&quot;.

===Potential absorptive capacity===
Zahra and George presented the potential absorptive capacity is made of two elements. First there is knowledge acquisition which &quot;refers to a firm&#x27;s capability to identify and acquire externally generated knowledge that is critical to its operations&quot;. Second, there is assimilation capability which &quot;refers to the firm&#x27;s routines and processes that allow it to analyze, process, interpret and understand the information obtained from external sources&quot;. &quot;Potential absorptive capacity makes the firm receptive to acquiring and assimilating external knowledge.&quot;

===Realized absorptive capacity===
Realized absorptive capacity is made up of transformation capability on one hand that can be defined as &quot;a firm&#x27;s capability to develop and refine the routines that facilitate combining existing knowledge and the newly acquired and assimilated knowledge&quot;. On the other hand, realized absorptive capacity is also made of the exploitation capability of a firm which is basically the capacity of a firm to apply the newly acquired knowledge in product or services that it can get financial benefit from. &quot;Realized absorptive capacity is a function of the transformation and exploitation capabilities.&quot;

Zahra and George go on to suggest a series of indicators that can be used to evaluate each element of absorptive capacity.
* Knowledge acquisition capability (the number of years of experience of the R&amp;D department, the amount of R&amp;D investment)
* Assimilation capability (the number of cross-firm patent citations, the number of citations made in a firm&#x27;s publications to research developed in other firms)
* Transformation capability (the number of new product ideas, the number of new research projects initiated)
* Exploitation capability (the number of patent, the number of new product announcements, the length of product development cycle)

George and his colleagues (Zou, Ertug, George, 2018) conduct a meta-analysis of absorptive capacity and they find that: (1) Absorptive capacity is a strong predictor of innovation and knowledge transfer, and its effects on financial performance are fully mediated by innovation and knowledge transfer; (2) The firm size-absorptive capacity relationship is positive for small firms but negative for larger firms. The firm age-absorptive capacity relationship is negative for mature firms and not significant for young firms; (3) Social integration mechanisms, knowledge infrastructure, management support, and relational capability all have a positive and significant impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship (whereas they do not find the breadth of external search or competitive intensity to impact that relationship). Environmental dynamism has a marginally significant negative impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship; and (4) They also find that the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship is stronger when absorptive capacity is measured by surveys rather than when absorptive capacity is measured by archival proxies.

===A refined model of absorptive capacity===

A 2007 article proposed to (a) reintroduce the original first component in Cohen and Levinthal&#x27;s model. The contribution noted (b) that transformation is not a step after assimilation, but represents an alternative process. Consequently, it suggested that (c) the neat distinction between potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity does not hold any more.

ad (a): Firms often fail to identify and absorb new external knowledge; recognizing the value of new external knowledge is often biased and needs to be fostered; it is not automatic. Managers have often problems in assessing the value of new external knowledge when it is not relevant for the current demands of key customers.

ad (b): Both assimilation and transformation involve some degree of change of the new knowledge and its combination with the existing knowledge. When the new knowledge fits existing cognitive schemas well, it is assimilated. When the new knowledge cannot be assimilated, the cognitive structures must be transformed. Firms transform their knowledge structures when knowledge cannot be assimilated. Transformation does not follow assimilation, it is an alternative to it.

ad (c): As transformation is an alternative to assimilation and not sequential to assimilation, it becomes part of potential absorptive capacity in Zahra and George&#x27;s model; consequently, realized absorptive capacity simply relabels the component of exploitation. Further, without the effect of realized capacity, potential capacity cannot have any effect on a firm&#x27;s competitive advantage; potential absorptive capacity cannot be meaningful separated from realized absorptive capacity in empirical studies on value creation.

Accordingly, firms with high levels of absorptive capacity (1) recognize the value of new external knowledge, (2) acquire, (3) assimilate &quot;or&quot; transform, and (4) exploit new external knowledge.

However, Zahra and George argue that the concept has a too broad definition as well as no clear dimensions or scales, evidenced by the variations among different studies that have used the absorptive capacity theory. Bosch et al. contend that absorptive capacity should not be based only on prior related knowledge, as Cohen and Levinthal originally proposed, but rather, organizational culture and combinative capabilities should be considered as antecedents to a firm&#x27;s absorptive capacity. For example, a business culture that appreciates and supports continued learning has a higher absorptive capacity than other business cultures that do not support individual learning and development. To further clarify concepts related to the absorptive capacity theory, Wheeler introduced an application derived from the dynamic capability and absorptive capacity theories for business innovations. Wheeler&#x27;s Net-Enabled Business Innovation Cycle facilitates understanding and predicting how firms transform its prior orientation and internal resources associated with net-enablement into business innovation and economical growth.

== Other research on the subject ==

Researches on subjects related to the development of absorptive capacity have included studies focusing on research and development, knowledge management, organizational structures, human resources, external interactions, internal interactions, open innovation, social capital, supplier integration, client integration and inter-organizational fit. All those researches provide a better picture of absorptive capacity that makes it possible for any firm to develop its absorptive capacity improving different areas of their organization.

Today the theory involves organizational learning, industrial economics, the resource-based view of the firm and dynamic capabilities. This theory has undergone major refinement, and today a firm&#x27;s absorptive capacity is mostly conceptualized as a dynamic capability. As a complement to absorptive capacity in outward knowledge transfer, the notion of desorptive capacity was developed. Desorptive capacity may play a key role for managing innovation in networks. It is particularly important for networks and collaborations with mutual, bidirectional knowledge transfer.

Other concepts related to absorptive capacity are:

* Desorptive capacity: This is a complementary concept to absorptive capacity in outward knowledge transfer, following the logic of the chemical process of desorption. Desorptive capacity is defined &quot;as an organization&#x27;s ability to identify technology transfer opportunities based on a firm&#x27;s outward technology transfer strategy and to facilitate the technology&#x27;s application at the recipient&quot;. Thus, it influences the volume of knowledge transfer and comprises two process steps - identification and transfer.
* Receptivity: The firm&#x27;s overall ability to be aware of, identify and take effective advantage of technology.
* Innovative routines: Practiced routines that define a set of competencies the firm is capable of doing confidently and the focus of the firm&#x27;s innovation efforts.

In regions in the Global South, regional innovation agencies can work as knowledge gatekeepers to stimulate new technological trajectories by facilitating the acquisition, diffusion and engaging in the &#x27;tropicalization&#x27; of extra-regional knowledge to facilitate its absorption within the regional innovation system.

<doc id="593367" wikidata="Q736765" url="?curid=593367" title="De Havilland Canada Dash 8">
<text>The De Havilland Canada DHC-8, commonly known as the Dash 8, is a series of turboprop-powered regional airliners, introduced by de Havilland Canada (DHC) in 1984. DHC was bought by Boeing in 1986, then by Bombardier in 1992, then by Longview Aviation Capital in 2019; Longview revived the De Havilland Canada brand. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW150s, it was developed from the Dash 7 with improved cruise performance and lower operational costs, but without STOL performance. The Dash 8 was offered in four sizes: the initial Series 100 (1984–2005), the more powerful Series 200 (1995–2009) with 37–40 seats, the Series 300 (1989–2009) with 50–56 seats, and Series 400 (1999–2022) with 68–90 seats. The QSeries (Q for quiet) are post-1997 variants fitted with active noise control systems.
Per a property transaction made by Bombardier before the 2019 sale to DHC, DHC had to vacate its Downsview, Toronto, manufacturing facility in August 2022, and is planning to restart Dash 8 production in Wheatland County, Alberta, by 2033. At the July 2024 Farnborough International Air Show, DHC announced orders for seven Series 400 aircraft, an order for a newly introduced quick-change combi aircraft conversion kit, and a new factory refurbishment programme.

==Development==
===Initial development===


In the 1970s, de Havilland Canada had invested heavily in its Dash 7 project, concentrating on STOL and short-field performance, the company&#x27;s traditional area of expertise. Using four medium-power engines with large, four-bladed propellers resulted in comparatively lower noise levels, which combined with its excellent STOL characteristics, made the Dash 7 suitable for operating from small in-city airports, a market DHC felt would be compelling. However, only a handful of air carriers employed the Dash 7, as most regional airlines were more concerned about the operational costs (fuel and maintenance) of four engines, rather than the benefits of short-field performance.

In 1980, de Havilland responded by dropping the short-field performance requirement and adapting the basic Dash 7 layout to use only two, more powerful engines. Its favoured engine supplier, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, developed the new PW100 series engines for the role, more than doubling the power from its PT6. Originally designated the PT7A-2R engine, it later became the PW120. When the Dash 8 rolled out on April 19, 1983, more than 3,800 hours of testing had been accumulated over two years on five PW100 series test engines. The Dash 8 first flight was on June 20, 1983.

Certification of the PW120 followed on December 16, 1983.

The airliner entered service in 1984 with NorOntair, and Piedmont Airlines, formerly Henson Airlines, was the first US customer the same year.

===DHC resale===

In 1986, Boeing bought the company in a bid to improve production at DHC&#x27;s Downsview Airport plants, believing the shared production in Canada would further strengthen their bargaining position with the Canadian government for a new Air Canada order for large intercontinental airliners. Air Canada was a crown corporation at the time, and both Boeing and Airbus were competing heavily via political channels for the contract. It was eventually won by Airbus, which received an order for 34 A320 aircraft. Allegations of secret commissions paid to Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney are today known as the Airbus affair. Following its failure in the competition, Boeing immediately put de Havilland Canada up for sale. The company was eventually purchased by Bombardier in 1992.

===Q-Series, -400===

The market for new aircraft to replace existing turboprops once again grew in the mid-1990s, and DHC responded with the improved &quot;Series 400&quot; design.

All Dash 8s delivered from the second quarter of 1996 (including all Series 400s) include the Active Noise and Vibration System designed to reduce cabin noise and vibration levels to nearly those of jet airliners. To emphasize their quietness, Bombardier renamed the go-forward production of Dash 8 models as the &quot;Q&quot;-Series turboprops (Q200, Q300, and Q400).

The last Dash 8-100, a -102, was built in 2005.

In April 2008, Bombardier announced that production of the remaining classic versions (Series Q200 and Q300) would be ended, leaving the Series Q400 as the only Dash 8 still in production. Production of the Q200 and Q300 was to cease in May 2009.

A total of 672 Dash 8 classics were produced; the last one was delivered to Japan Coast Guard in August 2008. 

Continuing on with the Q400, the 1,000th Dash 8 was delivered in November 2010.

===Production===

Bombardier aimed to produce the Q400 more economically. A deal with its machinists union in June 2017 allowed the assembly of the wings and cockpit section outside Canada and searches for potential partners commenced.
Bombardier expected to produce the cockpit section in its plant in Queretaro, Mexico, outsourcing the wings to China&#x27;s Shenyang Aircraft Corp, which already builds the Q400&#x27;s centre fuselage. The Q400 components are chemically milled while older variants are assembled from bonded panels and skins.

The production of the Dash 8 Series 100 stopped in 2005, and that of the Series 200 and 300 in 2009.

=== Proposed Q400X stretch ===

Bombardier proposed the development of a Q400 stretch with two plug-in segments, called the Q400X project, in 2007.
It would compete in the 90-seat market range.
In response to this project, , ATR was studying a 90-seat stretch.

In June 2009, Bombardier commercial aircraft president Gary Scott indicated that the Q400X would be &quot;definitely part of our future&quot; for possible introduction in 2013–14, although he did not detail the size of the proposed version or commit to an introduction date.

In July 2010, Bombardier&#x27;s vice president, Phillipe Poutissou, made comments explaining the company was still studying the prospects of designing the Q400X and talking with potential customers. At the time, Bombardier was not as committed to the Q400X as it had been previously. In May 2011, Bombardier was still strongly committed to the stretch but envisioned it more likely as a 2015 or later launch. The launch date was complicated by new powerplants from GE and PWC to be introduced in 2016. In February 2012, Bombardier was still studying the issue, at least a three-year delay was envisioned.

In October 2012, a joint development deal with a government-led South Korean consortium was revealed, to develop a 90-seater turboprop regional airliner, targeting a 2019 launch date. The consortium was to have included Korea Aerospace Industries and Korean Air Lines.

===High-density, 90-seat Q400===

At the February 2016 Singapore Airshow, Bombardier announced a high-density, 90-seat layout of the Q400, which would enter service in 2018; keeping the seat pitch of the Nok Air 86-seats, an extra row of seats is allowed by changing the configuration of the front right door and moving back the aft pressure bulkhead. The payload is increased by and the aircraft maintenance check intervals are increased: 800 hours from 600 for an A-check and 8,000 hours from 6,000 for a C-check.
By August 2018, the 90-seat variant was certified before delivery to launch customer SpiceJet later in the same year.
In March 2021, EASA certified the 90-seat variant for European operations; DHC believed that there were opportunities with prospective European customers . 

===Sale to Longview, reviving the De Havilland Canada name===
On November 8, 2018, Canadian company Longview Aviation Capital Corporation, through its subsidiary Viking Air, acquired the entire Dash 8 program and the &quot;de Havilland&quot; brand from Bombardier, in a deal that would close by the second half of 2019.
Viking had already acquired the discontinued de Havilland Canada aircraft model type certificates in 2006.

By November 2018, the sales of the higher-performance Q400 were slower than the cheaper aircraft from ATR.
Bombardier announced the sale was for $300 million and expected $250 million net. The sale was projected by Bombardier to result in $250 million annual savings.

In January 2019, Longview announced that it would establish a new company in Ontario, reviving the de Havilland Aircraft Company of Canada name, to continue production of the Q400 and support the Dash 8 range.
By February, the program sale was expected to close at the end of September.

On June 3, 2019, the sale was closed with the newly formed De Havilland Canada (DHC) taking control of the Dash 8 program, including servicing the previous -100, -200, and -300 series. Production of the Q400 was planned to continue at the Downsview, Toronto production facility, under DHC&#x27;s management.
De Havilland was considering a 50-seat shrink, as North American airlines operate 870 ageing 50-seaters, mostly CRJs and Embraer ERJs.

There were 17 Dash 8s scheduled for delivery in 2021, and De Havilland planned to pause production after those, while the factory lease expired in 2023.

On February 17, 2021, DHC announced a pause in production, planned for the second half of 2021, due to a lack of Dash 8 orders from airlines. The manufacturer planned to vacate its Downsview Toronto facility and lay off 500 employees in the process. The lay-off notice resulted in Unifor, the union representing the workers, demanding a government bail-out. The company planned to restart production after the pandemic at a new location.

In July 2022, DHC announced that it would review the Dash 8 programme and supply chain later in the year, and could restart production in the middle of the decade if conditions allowed. The Calgary site, where the company produced DHC-6 Twin Otters, was originally envisioned as the venue for Dash 8 production.

Per a property transaction made by Bombardier prior to the 2019 sale to DHC, DHC decommissioned its Downsview, Toronto, manufacturing facility in August 2022, and in 2023 confirmed its plans to restart Dash 8 production in Wheatland County, Alberta, outside of Calgary, by 2033.

At the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2024, DHC announced orders for seven Series 400 aircraft, including one for Skyward Express, two for Widerøe, and one for the Tanzania Government Flight Agency. The company also announced the launch of a factory refurbishment programme, for which 28 aircraft had been purchased, along with new freighter and combi aircraft conversion kits; one of the latter had been ordered by Advantage Air, DHC said.

===Hydrogen-electric powertrain===
In December 2021, DHC entered into a partnership with ZeroAvia with a view to offering the ZA-2000 hydrogen-electric propulsion as an option for the DHC-8, as a line-fit option for new aircraft and as an approved retrofit for existing aircraft. In May 2023, ZeroAvia unveiled a DHC-8 Q400 donated by Alaska Airlines for use as a testbed aircraft.

==Design==
Distinguishing features of the Dash 8 design are the large T-tail intended to keep the tail free of prop wash during takeoff, a very high aspect ratio wing, the elongated engine nacelles also holding the rearward-folding landing gear, and the pointed nose profile.

The Dash 8 design has better cruise performance than the Dash 7, is less expensive to operate, and is much less expensive to maintain, due largely to having only two engines. It is a little noisier than the Dash 7 and cannot match the STOL performance of its earlier DHC forebears, although it is still able to operate from small airports with runways long, compared to the required by a fully laden Dash 7.

===Regional jet competition===
The introduction of the regional jet altered the sales picture. Although more expensive than turboprops, regional jets allow airlines to operate passenger services on routes not suitable for turboprops. Turboprop aircraft have lower fuel consumption and can operate from shorter runways than regional jets, but have higher engine maintenance costs, shorter ranges, and lower cruising speeds.

When world oil prices drove up short-haul airfares in 2006, an increasing number of airlines that had bought regional jets began to reassess turboprop regional airliners, which use about 30–60% less fuel than regional jets. Although the market was not as robust as in the 1980s when the first Dash 8s were introduced, 2007 had increased sales of the only two 40+ seat regional turboprops still in western production, Bombardier&#x27;s Q400 and its competitor, the ATR series of 50– to 70-seat turboprops. The Q400 has a cruising speed close to that of most regional jets, and its mature engines and systems require less frequent maintenance, reducing its disadvantage.

==Variants==

The aircraft has been delivered in four series. The Series 100 has a maximum capacity of 39, the Series 200 has the same capacity but offers more powerful engines, the Series 300 is a stretched, 50-seat version, and the Series 400 is further stretched to a maximum of 90 passengers. Models delivered after 1997 have cabin noise suppression and are designated with the prefix &quot;Q&quot;. Production of the Series 100 ceased in 2005, followed by the 200 and 300 in 2009, leaving the Q400 as the only series still in production.

===Series 100===
The Series 100 was the original 37-39 passenger version of the Dash 8 that entered service in 1984. The original engine was the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120 and later units used the PW121. Rated engine power is 1,800 shp (1,340 kW).

==Accidents and incidents==

The DHC-8 has been involved in 80 aviation accidents and incidents including 31 hull losses.
Those resulted in 180 fatalities.

===Accidents with fatalities===
===Hull losses===

* April 15, 1988: Horizon Air Flight 2658, operated by DHC-8-102 N819PH suffered an engine fire on climb-out from Seattle/Tacoma International Airport. An emergency landing was made but the aircraft struck equipment on the ground before crashing into two jetways. N819PH was destroyed by fire; there were no fatalities.
* November 23, 2009: a DHC-8-200, being operated on behalf of United States Africa Command, made an emergency landing at Tarakigné, Mali, and was substantially damaged when the undercarriage collapsed and the starboard wing was ripped off. The accident was caused by the aircraft running out of fuel 29 seconds before the crash. The captain had opted not to refuel at the previous departure airport.
* April 9, 2012: Air Tanzania Dash 8 5H-MWG was written off at Kigoma Airport, Tanzania, in an aborted take off. All 39 people on board survived.
* September 30, 2015: Luxair Flight 9562 experienced an aborted takeoff accident at Saarbrücken Airport in Germany. The Bombardier Q400 LX-LGH was damaged beyond repair when it settled back onto the runway after the gear was raised prematurely. The aircraft slid 2,400 feet and came to a stop with more than 1,100 feet remaining of the 6,562-foot paved runway. None of the 20 occupants were injured.
* May 8, 2019: Biman Bangladesh Airlines Flight 60, a Dash-8 Q400 slid off Runway 21 at Yangon International Airport, Burma, and broke into three pieces as it performed a go-around on landing. The flight originated in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Poor weather was cited as a contributing factor. At least 17 people were injured.
===Major landing gear accidents===
==== Accidents in 2007 ====


In September 2007, two separate accidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) Dash 8-Q400 aircraft. A third accident occurred in October 2007, leading to the withdrawal of the type from the airline&#x27;s fleet.

On September 9, 2007, the crew of SAS Flight 1209, en route from Copenhagen to Aalborg, reported problems with the locking mechanism of the right side landing gear, and Aalborg Airport was prepared for an emergency landing. Shortly after touchdown, the right main gear collapsed and the airliner skidded off the runway while fragments of the right propeller shot against the cabin, and the right engine caught fire. Of 69 passengers and four crew on board, 11 were sent to hospital, five with minor injuries. The accident was filmed by a local news channel (TV2-Nord) and broadcast live on national television.

Three days later, on September 12, 2007, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2748 from Copenhagen to Palanga had a similar problem with the landing gear, forcing the aircraft to land in Vilnius International Airport (Lithuania). No passengers or crew were injured. Immediately after this accident SAS grounded all 33 Q400 airliners in its fleet and, a few hours later, Bombardier recommended that all Q400s with more than 10,000 flights be grounded until further notice. This affected about 60 aircraft, out of 140 Q400s then in service.

On October 27, 2007, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2867 en route from Bergen to Copenhagen had severe problems with the landing gear during landing in Kastrup Airport. The right wing gear did not deploy properly (or partially), and the aircraft skidded off the runway in a controlled emergency landing. The Q400 was carrying 38 passengers, two infants, and four crew members on board. No injuries were reported. The next day, SAS permanently removed its entire Dash 8 Q400 fleet from service. In a press release on October 28, 2007, the company&#x27;s president said: &quot;Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft. Accordingly, with the Board of Directors&#x27; approval, I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service.&quot; The preliminary Danish investigation determined the latest Q400 incident was unrelated to the airline&#x27;s earlier corrosion problems, in this particular case caused by a misplaced O-ring found blocking the orifice in the restrictor valve.
In all, eight Q400s had landing gear failures while landing during 2007: four in Denmark, one in Germany, one in Japan, one in Lithuania, and one in South Korea. In November 2007, it was revealed that the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration had begun an investigation and found Scandinavian Airlines System culpable of cutting corners in its maintenance department. The airline reportedly made 2,300 flights in which safety equipment was not up to standard. On March 10, 2008, SAS ordered 27 more aircraft from Bombardier in a compensation deal: 14 Q400 NextGen turboprops and 13 CRJ900 jets.

==== Other landing gear accidents ====
On February 23, 2017, a Flybe Q400 suffered a right hand gear collapse while landing at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. There were no injuries. The cause was identified as a deformed righthand main landing gear brace, which had been installed the night before. It is not known when the deformation had occurred.

On November 10, 2017, a Flybe flight BE331, operated by a Q400, was scheduled to fly from George Best Belfast City Airport to Inverness Airport. The plane reported a technical problem shortly after takeoff and was diverted to Belfast International Airport, where it landed on its nose with the front gear retracted. One minor injury was reported.

On August 19, 2018, a Q400-200 of LC Perú on a flight from Lima to Ayacucho had to return to Lima airport and make an emergency landing due to a nose gear that could not be lowered. The aircraft landed without the nose gear down.

On November 15, 2018, a Q300-315 belonging to PAL Airlines was unable to lower its nose gear while trying to land at Deer Lake, Newfoundland, and diverted to Stephenville, Newfoundland, performing a nose gear up landing.

On January 18, 2024, the left main landing gear on a Q400 belonging to Ethiopian Airlines collapsed on landing at Mekelle Airport.

On December 28, 2024, A PAL Airlines Q400 operating as Air Canada Express Flight 2259 from St. Johns, Newfoundland to Halifax, Nova Scotia, suffered a collapse of its left main landing gear and caught fire while landing at Halifax International Airport.

===Propeller overspeed incidents===
On October 13, 2011, Airlines PNG Flight 1600, Dash 8-103 P2-MCJ, was on approach to Madang Airport when the first officer accidentally pulled the power levers through the flight idle setting and into the beta setting while trying to reduce airspeed. In beta, which is intended for ground operations and slowing the aircraft after landing, the variable-pitch props transition to flat pitch. High-speed airflow through the improperly configured props caused them to overspeed and drive the engines, which caused engine damage and a total loss of engine power. The aircraft crashed during the ensuing off-airport forced landing attempt; both pilots, the flight attendant, and a single passenger survived with injuries, while the other 28 passengers died.

The Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission (AIC) found that the pilots made several other serious errors, including failing to lower the landing gear and flaps, which would have slowed the aircraft and reduced the severity of the crash; however, the AIC primarily attributed the accident to the fact that it was possible to actuate beta in flight, coupled with inadequate training for flight crews to recognize and correct this situation. A beta lockout feature was available as an option for the Dash 8, but it had not been installed in P2-MCJ, and the beta warning horn had been inoperative.

On December 6, 2011, QantasLink Dash 8-315 VH-SBV, on a scheduled passenger flight to Weipa Airport, encountered turbulence while the first officer&#x27;s hand was resting on the power levers. The first officer inadvertently placed the levers in beta and the propellers began to overspeed. The beta warning horn sounded, initially confusing the pilots, but the horn together with the audible increase in propeller speed prompted them to quickly diagnose the problem and place the power levers back in flight idle before engine damage occurred. The flight landed safely without further incident.

While investigating these events, the AIC and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) determined that a number of similar inadvertent in-flight beta actuations had occurred in the Dash 8, and recommended steps be taken to prevent it, including more thorough pilot training. In 2012, in cooperation with the AIC and ATSB, Transport Canada issued an airworthiness directive (AD) mandating the installation of beta lockout on all Dash 8 aircraft that did not have it, a second AD mandating more frequent testing of the beta warning horn, and a service bulletin requiring a cockpit placard to warn pilots not to move the power levers below the flight idle setting while airborne.

<text>Rodney Weston Sawford (born 26 June 1944), is a former Australian Labor Party politician. He served as the member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1988 to November 2007, representing the Division of Port Adelaide, South Australia.

==Biography==
He was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and was educated at Western Teachers College, Adelaide. He was a teacher before entering politics, serving as the principal of the local Taperoo Primary School.

He was elected to parliament at the 1988 Port Adelaide by-election, following the resignation of Mick Young. He prided himself on the fact that he and his forebears have lived in the electorate for many generations.

He was a member of the previously dominant Centre-Left faction, which is now defunct, and is now classified as a member of the &quot;independents&quot; faction.

He spoke out against Kim Beazley when he attempted to regain the leadership from former leader Simon Crean in 2003, again when Beazley contested the leadership with Mark Latham in December 2003, and again in 2005, when Beazley reassumed the leadership following Latham&#x27;s retirement.

His electorate office was burnt down in an overnight fire in 2004.

Sawford was a Deputy Government Whip 1994–96 and a Deputy Opposition Whip 1996–2001.

He announced his retirement as of the 2007 federal election, citing an interest in running as a state independent as a protest against &quot;gutless wonders&quot; in the Rann state Labor government over long-running housing development plans at Cheltenham.

<doc id="593388" wikidata="Q954674" url="?curid=593388" title="Iron-deficiency anemia">
<text>Iron-deficiency anemia is anemia caused by a lack of iron. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague such as feeling tired, weak, short of breath, or having decreased ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has more severe symptoms, including confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out or increased thirst. Anemia is typically significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Children with iron deficiency anemia may have problems with growth and development. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.
Iron-deficiency anemia is caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. Poor absorption of iron from food may occur as a result of an intestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, or surgery such as a gastric bypass. In the developing world, parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood tests.
Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by eating a diet containing sufficient amounts of iron or by iron supplementation. Foods high in iron include meat, nuts, and foods made with iron-fortified flour. Treatment may include dietary changes, iron supplements, and dealing with underlying causes, for example medical treatment for parasites or surgery for ulcers. Supplementation with vitamin C may be recommended due to its potential to aid iron absorption. Severe cases may be treated with blood transfusions or iron infusions.
Iron-deficiency anemia affected about 1.48 billion people in 2015. A lack of dietary iron is estimated to cause approximately half of all anemia cases globally. Women and young children are most commonly affected. In 2015, anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 54,000 deaths – down from 213,000 deaths in 1990.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Iron-deficiency anemia may be present without a person experiencing symptoms. It tends to develop slowly; therefore the body has time to adapt, and the disease often goes unrecognized for some time. If symptoms present, patients may present with the sign of pallor (reduced oxyhemoglobin in skin or mucous membranes), and the symptoms of feeling tired, weak, dizziness, lightheadedness, poor physical exertion, headaches, decreased ability to concentrate, cold hands and feet, cold sensitivity, increased thirst and confusion. None of these symptoms (or any of the others below) are sensitive or specific. 

In severe cases, shortness of breath can occur. Pica may also develop; of which consumption of ice, known as pagophagia, has been suggested to be the most specific for iron deficiency anemia.

Other possible symptoms and signs of iron-deficiency anemia include:
=== Child development ===
Iron-deficiency anemia is associated with poor neurological development, including decreased learning ability and altered motor functions. This is because iron deficiency impacts the development of the cells of the brain called neurons. When the body is low on iron, the red blood cells get priority on iron, and it is shifted away from the neurons of the brain. Exact causation has not been established, but there is a possible long-term impact from these neurological issues.

==Cause==
A diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia requires further investigation into its cause. It can be caused by increased iron demand, increased iron loss, or decreased iron intake. Increased iron demand often occurs during periods of growth, such as in children and pregnant women. For example, during stages of rapid growth, babies and adolescents may outpace their dietary intake of iron which can result in deficiency in the absence of disease or a grossly abnormal diet. Iron loss is typically from blood loss. One example of blood loss is by chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, which could be linked to a possible cancer. In women of childbearing age, heavy menstrual periods can be a source of blood loss causing iron-deficiency anemia. People who do not consume much iron in their diet, such as vegans or vegetarians, are also at increased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia.

=== Parasitic disease ===
The leading cause of iron-deficiency anemia worldwide is a parasitic disease known as a helminthiasis caused by infestation with parasitic worms (helminths); specifically, hookworms. The hookworms most commonly responsible for causing iron-deficiency anemia include &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot;, &quot;Ancylostoma ceylanicum&quot;, and &quot;Necator americanus&quot;. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately two billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths worldwide. Parasitic worms cause both inflammation and chronic blood loss by binding to a human&#x27;s small-intestinal mucosa, and through their means of feeding and degradation, they can ultimately cause iron-deficiency anemia.

=== Blood loss ===
Red blood cells contain iron, so blood loss also leads to iron loss. There are several causes of blood loss, including menstrual bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, stomach ulcers, and bleeding disorders. The bleeding may occur quickly or slowly. Slow, chronic blood loss within the body – such as from a peptic ulcer, angiodysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, a colon polyp or gastrointestinal cancer (e.g., colon cancer) – can cause iron-deficiency anemia.

==== Menstrual bleeding ====
Menstrual bleeding is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia in women of childbearing age. Women with menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods) are at risk of iron deficiency anemia because they are at higher than normal risk of losing more iron during menstruation than is replaced in their diet. Most women lose about 40 mL of blood per cycle. Some birth control methods, such as pills and IUDs, may decrease the amount of blood and therefore iron lost during a menstrual cycle. Intermittent iron supplementation may be as effective a treatment in these cases as daily supplements and reduce some of the adverse effects of long-term daily supplements.

==== Gastrointestinal bleeding ====
The most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in men and post-menopausal women is gastrointestinal bleeding. There are many sources of gastrointestinal tract bleeding, including the stomach, esophagus, small intestine, and the large intestine (colon). Gastrointestinal bleeding can result from regular use of some medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin), as well as antiplatelets such as clopidogrel and anticoagulants such as warfarin; however, these are required in some patients, especially those with states causing a tendency to form blood clots. Colon cancer, which typically occurs in older individuals, is another potential cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, some bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease and polycythemia vera, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.

==== Blood donation ====
Frequent blood donors are also at risk for developing iron deficiency anemia. When whole blood is donated, approximately 200 mg of iron is lost from the body. The blood bank screens people for anemia before drawing blood for donation. If the patient has anemia, blood is not drawn. Less iron is lost if the person is donating platelets or white blood cells.

=== Diet ===

The body normally gets the iron it requires from food. If a person consumes too little iron, or iron that is poorly absorbed (non-heme iron), they can become iron deficient over time. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need dietary iron. For children, a high intake of cow&#x27;s milk is associated with an increased risk of iron-deficiency anemia. Other risk factors include low meat intake and low intake of iron-fortified products.

The National Academy of Medicine updated Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) in 2001. The current EAR for iron for women ages 14–18 is 7.9 mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19–50, and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. The RDA is 15.0 mg/day for women ages 15–18, 18.0 for 19–50, and 8.0 thereafter; for men, 8.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. (Recommended Dietary Allowances are higher than Estimated Average Requirements so as to cover people with higher than average requirements.) The RDA for pregnancy is 27 mg/day, and during lactation, 9 mg/day. For children ages 1–3 years it is 7 mg/day, 10 for ages 4–8 and 8 for ages 9–13. The European Food Safety Authority refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women the Population Reference Intake is 13 mg/day ages 15–17 years, 16 mg/day for women ages 18 and up who are premenopausal, and 11 mg/day postmenopausal; for pregnancy and lactation, 16 mg/day. For men the Population Reference Intake is 11 mg/day ages 15 and older. For children ages 1 to 14 the Population Reference Intake increases from 7 to 11 mg/day. The Population Reference Intakes are higher than the US RDAs, with the exception of pregnancy.

=== Iron malabsorption ===
Iron from food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine, primarily in the duodenum. Iron malabsorption is a less common cause of iron-deficiency anemia, but many gastrointestinal disorders can reduce the body&#x27;s ability to absorb iron. There are different mechanisms that may be present.

In coeliac disease, abnormal changes in the structure of the duodenum can decrease iron absorption. Abnormalities or surgical removal of the stomach can also lead to malabsorption by altering the acidic environment needed for iron to be converted into its absorbable form. If there is insufficient production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria can occur (often due to chronic H. pylori infections or long-term proton-pump inhibitor therapy), inhibiting the conversion of ferric iron to the absorbable ferrous iron.

Bariatric surgery is associated with an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia due to malabsorption of iron. During a Roux-en-Y anastamosis, which is commonly performed for weight management and diabetes control, the stomach is made into a small pouch and this is connected directly to the small intestines further downstream (bypassing the duodenum as a site of digestion). About 17–45% of people develop iron deficiency after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

=== Pregnant women ===
Without iron supplementation, iron-deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because their iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume and be a source of hemoglobin for the growing baby and placental development. Other less common causes are intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Iron deficiency in pregnancy appears to cause long-term and irreversible cognitive problems in the baby.

Iron deficiency affects maternal well-being by increasing risks for infections and complications during pregnancy. Some of these complications include pre-eclampsia, bleeding problems, and perinatal infections. Iron deficiency can lead to improper development of fetal tissues. Oral iron supplementation during the early stages of pregnancy, specifically the first trimester, is suggested to decrease the adverse effects of iron-deficiency anemia throughout pregnancy and to decrease the negative impact that iron deficiency has on fetal growth. Iron supplements may lead to a risk for gestational diabetes, so pregnant women with adequate hemoglobin levels are recommended not to take iron supplements. Iron deficiency can lead to premature labor and to problems with neural functioning, including delays in language and motor development in the infant.

Some studies show that women pregnant during their teenage years can be at greater risk of iron-deficiency anemia due to an already increased need for iron and other nutrients during adolescent growth spurts.

=== Children ===
Babies are at increased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia due to their rapid growth. Their need for iron is greater than they are getting in their diet. Babies are born with iron stores; however, these iron stores typically run out by 4–6 months of age. In addition, infants who are given cow&#x27;s milk too early can develop anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss.

Children who are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia include:
* Preterm infants
* Low birth weight infants
* Infants fed with cow&#x27;s milk under 12 months of age
* Breastfed infants who have not received iron supplementation after age 6 months, or those receiving non-iron-fortified formulas
* Children between the ages of 1 and 5 years old who receive more than 24 ounces (700 mL) of cow milk per day
* Children with low socioeconomic status
* Children with special health care needs
* Children of Hispanic ethnicity
* Children who are overweight

=== Hepcidin ===
Decreased levels of serum and urine hepcidin are early indicators of iron deficiency. Hepcidin concentrations are also connected to the complex relationship between malaria and iron deficiency.

==Mechanism==
Anemia can result from significant iron deficiency. When the body has sufficient iron to meet its needs (functional iron), the remainder is stored for later use in cells, mostly in the bone marrow and liver. These stores are called ferritin complexes and are part of the human (and other animals) iron metabolism systems. Men store about 3.5 g of iron in their body, and women store about 2.5 g.

Hepcidin is a peptide hormone produced in the liver that is responsible for regulating iron levels in the body. Hepcidin decreases the amount of iron available for erythropoesis (red blood cell production). Hepcidin binds to and induces the degradation of ferroportin, which is responsible for exporting iron from cells and mobilizing it to the bloodstream. Conditions such as high levels of erythropoesis, iron deficiency and tissue hypoxia inhibit hepcidin expression. Whereas systemic infection or inflammation (especially involving the cytokine IL-6) or increased circulating iron levels stimulate hepcidin expression.

Iron is a mineral that is important in the formation of red blood cells in the body, particularly as a critical component of hemoglobin. About 70% of the iron found in the body is bound to hemoglobin. Iron is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, in particular the duodenum and jejunum. Certain factors increase or decrease absorption of iron. For example, taking Vitamin C with a source of iron is known to increase absorption. Some medications such as tetracyclines and antacids can decrease absorption of iron. After being absorbed in the small intestine, iron travels through blood, bound to transferrin, and eventually ends up in the bone marrow, where it is involved in red blood cell formation. When red blood cells are degraded, the iron is recycled by the body and stored.

When the amount of iron needed by the body exceeds the amount of iron that is readily available, the body can use iron stores (ferritin) for a period of time, and red blood cell formation continues normally. However, as these stores continue to be used, iron is eventually depleted to the point that red blood cell formation is abnormal. Ultimately, anemia ensues, which by definition is a hemoglobin lab value below normal limits.

== Diagnosis ==

Conventionally, a definitive diagnosis requires a demonstration of depleted body iron stores obtained by bone marrow aspiration, with the marrow stained for iron. However, with the availability of reliable blood tests that can be more readily collected for iron-deficiency anemia diagnosis, a bone marrow aspiration is usually not obtained. Furthermore, a study published in April 2009 questions the value of stainable bone marrow iron following parenteral iron therapy. Once iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, gastrointestinal blood loss is presumed to be the cause until proven otherwise since it can be caused by an otherwise asymptomatic colon cancer. The initial evaluation must include esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for cancer or bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract.

A thorough medical history is important to the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia. The history can help to differentiate common causes of the condition such as menstruation in women or blood in the stool. A travel history to areas in which hookworms and whipworms are endemic may also help guide certain stool tests for parasites or their eggs. Although symptoms can play a role in identifying iron-deficiency anemia, they are often vague, which may limit their contribution to determining the diagnosis.

===Blood tests===

Anemia is often discovered by routine blood tests. A sufficiently low hemoglobin by definition makes the diagnosis of anemia, and a low hematocrit value is also characteristic of anemia. Further studies will be undertaken to determine the anemia&#x27;s cause. If the anemia is due to iron deficiency, one of the first abnormal values to be noted on a complete blood count, as the body&#x27;s iron stores begin to be depleted, will be a high red blood cell distribution width, reflecting an increased variability in the size of red blood cells.

A low mean corpuscular volume also appears during the course of body iron depletion. It indicates a high number of abnormally small red blood cells. A low mean corpuscular volume, a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and the corresponding appearance of red blood cells on visual examination of a peripheral blood smear narrows the problem to a microcytic anemia (literally, a small red blood cell anemia).

The blood smear of a person with iron-deficiency anemia shows many hypochromic (pale, relatively colorless) and small red blood cells, and may also show poikilocytosis (variation in shape) and anisocytosis (variation in size). With more severe iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear may show hypochromic, pencil-shaped cells and, occasionally, small numbers of nucleated red blood cells. The platelet count may be slightly above the high limit of normal in iron-deficiency anemia (termed a mild thrombocytosis), but severe cases can present with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Iron-deficiency anemia is confirmed by tests that include serum ferritin, serum iron level, serum transferrin, and total iron binding capacity. A low serum ferritin is most commonly found. However, serum ferritin can be elevated by any type of chronic inflammation and thus is not consistently decreased in iron-deficiency anemia. Serum iron levels may be measured, but serum iron concentration is not as reliable as the measurement of both serum iron and serum iron-binding protein levels. The percentage of iron saturation (or transferrin saturation index or percent) can be measured by dividing the level of serum iron by total iron binding capacity and is a value that can help to confirm the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia; however, other conditions must also be considered, including other types of anemia.

Another finding that can be used is the level of red blood cell distribution width. During haemoglobin synthesis, trace amounts of zinc will be incorporated into protoporphyrin in the place of iron which is lacking. Protoporphyrin can be separated from its zinc moiety and measured as free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, providing an indirect measurement of the zinc-protoporphyrin complex. The level of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin is expressed in either μg/dl of whole blood or μg/dl of red blood cells. An iron insufficiency in the bone marrow can be detected very early by a rise in free erythrocyte protoporphyrin.

Further testing may be necessary to differentiate iron-deficiency anemia from other disorders, such as thalassemia minor. It is very important not to treat people with thalassemia with an iron supplement, as this can lead to hemochromatosis. A hemoglobin electrophoresis provides useful evidence for distinguishing these two conditions, along with iron studies.

=== Screening ===
It is unclear if screening pregnant women for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy improves outcomes in the United States. The same holds true for screening children who are 6 to 24 months old. Even so, screening is a Level B recommendation suggested by the US Preventative Services Task Force in pregnant women without symptoms and in infants considered high risk. Screening is done with either a hemoglobin or hematocrit lab test.

== Treatment ==

Treatment should take into account the cause and severity of the condition. If the iron-deficiency anemia is a result of blood loss or another underlying cause, treatment is geared toward addressing the underlying cause. Most cases of iron deficiency anemia are treated with oral iron supplements. In severe acute cases, treatment measures are taken for immediate management in the interim, such as blood transfusions or intravenous iron.

For less severe cases, treatment of iron-deficiency anemia includes dietary changes to incorporate iron-rich foods into regular oral intake and oral iron supplementation. Foods rich in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can also be beneficial, since ascorbic acid enhances iron absorption. Oral iron supplements are available in multiple forms. Some are in the form of pills and some are drops for children. 

Most forms of oral iron replacement therapy are absorbed well by the small intestine; however, there are certain preparations of iron supplements that are designed for longer release in the small intestine than other preparations. Oral iron supplements are best taken up by the body on an empty stomach because food can decrease the amount of iron absorbed from the small intestine. The dosing of oral iron replacement therapy is as much as 100–200 mg per day in adults and 3–6 mg per kilogram in children. This is generally spread out as 3–4 pills taken throughout the day. 

The various forms of treatment are not without possible adverse side effects. Iron supplementation by mouth commonly causes negative gastrointestinal effects, including constipation, nausea, vomiting, metallic taste to the oral iron and dark colored stools. Constipation is reported by 15–20% of patients taking oral iron therapy. Preparations of iron therapy that take longer to be absorbed by the small intestine (extended release iron therapy) are less likely to cause constipation. 

It can take six months to one year to get blood levels of iron up to a normal range and provide the body with iron stores. Oral iron replacement may not be effective in cases of iron deficiency due to malabsorption, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or H. pylori infection; these cases would require treatment of the underlying disease to increase oral absorption or intravenous iron replacement.

As iron-deficiency anemia becomes more severe, if the anemia does not respond to oral treatments, or if the treated person does not tolerate oral iron supplementation, then other measures may become necessary. Two options are intravenous iron injections and blood transfusion. Intravenous can be for people who do not tolerate oral iron, who are unlikely to respond to oral iron, or who require iron on a long-term basis. For example, people receiving dialysis treatment who are also getting erythropoietin or another erythropoiesis-stimulating agent are given parenteral iron, which helps the body respond to the erythropoietin agents to produce red blood cells.

Intravenous iron can induce an allergic response that can be as serious as anaphylaxis, although different formulations have decreased the likelihood of this adverse effect. In certain cases intravenous iron is both safer and more effective than the oral route. For patients with severe anemia such as from blood loss, or who have severe symptoms such as cardiovascular instability, a blood transfusion may be considered.

Low-certainty evidence suggests that IBD-related anemia treatment with Intravenous (IV) iron infusion may be more effective than oral iron therapy, with fewer people needing to stop treatment early due to adverse effects. The type of iron preparation may be an important determinant of clinical benefit. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests response to treatment may be higher when IV ferric carboxymaltose, rather than IV iron sucrose preparation is used, despite very-low certainty evidence of increased adverse effects, including bleeding, in those receiving ferric carboxymaltose treatment. 

Ferric maltol, marketed as &quot;Accrufer&quot; and &quot;Ferracru,&quot; is available in oral and IV preparations. When used as a treatment for IBD-related anemia, very low certainty evidence suggests a marked benefit with oral ferric maltol compared with placebo. However it was unclear whether the IV preparation was more effective than oral ferric maltol. 

A Cochrane review of controlled trials comparing intravenous (IV) iron therapy with oral iron supplements in people with chronic kidney disease, found low-certainty evidence that people receiving IV-iron treatment were 1.71 times as likely to reach their target hemoglobin levels. Overall, hemoglobin was 0.71g/dl higher than those treated with oral iron supplements. Iron stores in the liver, estimated by serum ferritin, were also 224.84 μg/L higher in those receiving IV-iron. However there was also low-certainty evidence that allergic reactions were more likely following IV-iron therapy. It was unclear whether type of iron therapy administration affects the risk of death from any cause, including cardiovascular, nor whether it may alter the number of people who may require a blood transfusion or dialysis.

Ferric derisomaltose (Monoferric) was approved in the United States in January 2020, for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.

== Epidemiology ==
A moderate degree of iron-deficiency anemia affects approximately 610 million people worldwide or 8.8% of the population. It is slightly more common in females (9.9%) than males (7.8%). Up to 15% of children ages 1–3 years have iron deficiency anemia. Mild iron deficiency anemia affects another 375 million. Iron deficiency affects up to 52% of pregnant women worldwide.

The prevalence of iron deficiency as a cause of anemia varies among countries; in the groups in which anemia is most common, including young children and a subset of non-pregnant women, iron deficiency accounts for a fraction of anemia cases in these groups (25% and 37%, respectively). Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women.

Within the United States, iron-deficiency anemia affects about 2% of adult males, 10.5% of White women, and 20% of African-American and Mexican-American women. A new study in 2024 suggests that nearly 1 in 3 Americans may have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause fatigue, brain fog, and concentration problems. The analysis of data from over 8,000 U.S. adults found that 14% had low iron levels, known as absolute iron deficiency, while 15% had normal iron levels but their bodies couldn’t effectively use the mineral, a condition called functional iron deficiency.

A map provides a country-by-country listing of what nutrients are fortified into specified foods. Some of the Sub-Saharan countries shown in the deaths from iron-deficiency anemia map from 2012 are as of 2018 fortifying foods with iron.

<doc id="593391" wikidata="Q5034610" url="?curid=593391" title="Cape Breton Labour Party">
<text>The Cape Breton Labour Party was a social democratic provincial political party in Nova Scotia, Canada, which drew most of its support from Cape Breton Island, the northern part of the province of Nova Scotia.

==Founding==
The party was founded by Paul MacEwan, who had been an NDP member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for ten years, 1970 to 1980. MacEwan was kicked out of the NDP in 1980, after allegedly calling party executive Dennis Theman a Trotskyite. MacEwan ran as an independent in the 1981 election and was re-elected by a strong margin. He took this as a mandate to set up a rival party.

The Cape Breton Labour Party was founded at a convention held in Glace Bay in the fall of 1982. MacEwan was elected its provincial leader. While at first the intent was to run candidates only on Cape Breton Island, the provisions of the Nova Scotia Elections Act forced the party to run candidates also in several mainland ridings to obtain recognition as a registered political party. The party&#x27;s name was also changed to the Labour Party of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia at this time. In the end, Labour fielded a total of fourteen candidates, eleven on Cape Breton and three on the mainland.

In the 1984 election, the 14 Cape Breton Labour candidates obtained a total of 8,322 votes. MacEwan was re-elected, with 3,832 votes. He thus became the first, and so far the only, candidate sponsored by a fourth political party to gain a seat in the Nova Scotia Legislature. Labour candidates managed to retain their deposits in the constituencies of Cape Breton East and Cape Breton Centre, while the NDP vote in those areas plunged to all-time lows. Previously, New Democrats Jeremy Akerman and Buddy MacEachern had led the NDP and served as MLAs for these constituencies.

After the 1984 election, MacEwan felt that the Labour Party could not continue, as it had raised insufficient funds to meet its minimum financial requirements. He ran in the next provincial election, held in 1988, as an independent. He was re-elected and joined the Liberal Party in 1990.

==Issues==
The main issues in contention between the Labour Party and the NDP centered on how the party was to be run and in what direction. MacEwan maintained that freedom of speech was important in politics and that elected representatives should be free to represent their constituents as they best determined. The Halifax-based NDP, led by Alexa McDonough throughout this period, emphasized established party policy and expected MLAs to subscribe to this first before formulating their opinions on issues.

Much of the tussle was over geography and whether Cape Breton, or downtown Halifax, should be in control of operations. The Halifax NDP claimed that the Labour Party was &quot;separatist&quot; but never identified how. There is no mention found advocating any constitutional change for Cape Breton Island in the advertising run by the Labour Party in the 1984 election. The party issued a multi-point election platform, but its contents were confined to such traditional Cape Breton issues as &quot;proper&quot; levels of government support for the coal and steel industries, a higher minimum wage, reform of workers&#x27; compensation, and improvements to highways.

The dispute was accentuated by bad personal relations between MacEwan and McDonough, each viewing the other as unworthy. MacEwan believed that McDonough had encouraged his expulsion from the NDP for political advantage and had gained the NDP leadership by intrigue. Both criticized the other publicly: McDonough depicted MacEwan as an unrepentant enemy of all the NDP stood for, while MacEwan described McDonough and her father, industrialist Lloyd R. Shaw, as seeking to use their wealth to try to prevent democracy in Nova Scotia politics.

<doc id="593400" wikidata="Q5439868" url="?curid=593400" title="Fecal fat test">
<text>In medicine, the fecal fat test is a diagnostic test for fat malabsorption conditions, which lead to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea).

==Background==
In the duodenum, dietary fat (primarily triglycerides) is digested by enzymes such as pancreatic lipase into smaller molecules of 1,2-Diacylglycerols and free fatty acids, which can be absorbed through the wall of the jejenum of the small intestine and enter circulation for metabolism and storage. Since fat is a valuable nutrient, human feces normally contains very little undigested fat. However, a number of diseases of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract are characterized by fat malabsorption.

Examples of such diseases are:
* disorders of exocrine pancreatic function, such as chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis and Shwachman–Diamond syndrome (these are characterized by deficiency of pancreatic digestive enzymes)
* celiac disease (in which the fat malabsorption in severe cases is due to inflammatory damage to the integrity of the intestinal lining)
* short bowel syndrome (in which much of the small intestine has had to be surgically removed and the remaining portion cannot completely absorb all of the fat).
* small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome

==Microscopy==
In the simplest form of the fecal fat test, a random fecal specimen is submitted to the hospital laboratory and examined under a microscope after staining with a Sudan III or Sudan IV dye (&quot;Sudan staining&quot;). Visible amounts of fat indicate some degree of fat malabsorption.

==Quantitative==
Quantitative fecal fat tests measure and report an amount of fat. This is usually done over a period of three days, the patient collecting all of their feces into a container.

The container is thoroughly mixed to homogenize the feces, without using specific mixer equipment. A small sample from the feces is collected. The fat content is extracted with solvents and measured by saponification (turning the fat into soap).

Normally, up to 7 grams of fat can be malabsorbed in people consuming 100 grams of fat per day. In patients with diarrhea, up to 12 grams of fat may be malabsorbed since the presence of diarrhea interferes with fat absorption, even when the diarrhea is not due to fat malabsorption.

<text>Édouard Jean-Marie Stephan (31 August 1837 – 31 December 1923) was a French astronomer. His surname is sometimes spelled Stéphan in some literature, but this is apparently erroneous.

He was born in Sainte Pezenne (today one of the districts of the town of Niort) and attended the Ecole Normale Superieure, and graduated at the top of his class in 1862.

He was the director of the Marseille Observatory from 1864 to 1907 (until 1872 he was subordinate to Urbain le Verrier). In the early part of his career there, he had limited opportunities to do observations because he was preoccupied with improving the observatory. He discovered the asteroid 89 Julia in 1866. In 1867 he used the new telescope to observe a transit of Mercury.

Between 1870 and 1875, Stephan systematically studied nebulae, precisely recording their positions and discovering many new ones. His goal was to enable the exact measurement of stellar proper motions by creating a reference system of fixed objects.

In 1873, Stephan was the first person to attempt to measure the angular diameter of a star using interferometry, converting the 80 cm telescope at Marseille Observatory into an interferometer. He did this by obscuring the reflector with a mask containing two vertical slits.
The star he chose to perform this experiment was Sirius. He did not succeed in resolving any stellar disks, but by 1874 had obtained an upper limit to stellar diameters of 0.158&quot; (the true angular diameter of Sirius is 0.0059 arcseconds, and for comparison, the angular diameter of Alpha Centauri and Betelgeuse are 0.0145 and 0.05 arcseconds respectively).

In 1881 he discovered NGC 5, and he discovered the galaxy NGC 6027 the following year using the 80 cm reflector.

Among others, he discovered Stephan&#x27;s Quintet, also known as &quot;Arp 319&quot;, a group of five galaxies. Stephan made this discovery with the first telescope equipped with a reflection coated mirror.

In 1884 the French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Valz Prize (&quot;Prix Valz&quot;). His name is associated with the periodic comet 38P/Stephan-Oterma, although Jérôme Coggia saw it first.

He became a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1868 and an Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1879.

<doc id="593406" wikidata="Q2477607" url="?curid=593406" title="Ion-selective electrode">
<text>An ion-selective electrode (ISE), also known as a specific ion electrode (SIE), is a simple membrane-based potentiometric device which measures the activity of ions in solution. It is a transducer (or sensor) that converts the change in the concentration of a specific ion dissolved in a solution into an electrical potential. ISE is a type of sensor device that senses changes in signal based on the surrounding environment through time. This device will have an input signal, a property that we wish to quantify, and an output signal, a quantity we can register. In this case, ion selective electrode are electrochemical sensors that give potentiometric signals. The voltage is theoretically dependent on the logarithm of the ionic activity, according to the Nernst equation. Analysis with ISEs expands throughout a range of technological fields such as biology, chemistry, environmental science and other industrial workplaces like agriculture. Ion-selective electrodes are used in analytical chemistry and biochemical/biophysical research, where measurements of ionic concentration in an aqueous solution are required.

== General Theory of Ion-Selective Electrodes ==
When using ion-selective electrodes, a scientist wants to compare the signal of an analyte to the electrochemical potential shown by the ISE. Different types of electrodes can be used to do this, as described in the sections below. As shown in the general schematic, an ion-selective membrane (consisting of glass, crystalline, liquid, or polymers) selectively allows specific types of ions to travel through, or in other words, is selectively permeable.

All ISE measurements are made with a comparison to an internal reference electrode with a known concentration of the analyte being measured. The external reference electrode is the part of the system that is exposed to the solution. The potential is measured using the following formula:

formula_1

Eise includes the potential of the internal reference electrode and the ion-selective membrane potential, Em. The Eise is governed by analyte activity in the internal solution whereas Em is governed by the activity of the analyte on each side of the selective membrane. Furthermore, the Eref or external reference portion of the cell is dependent on the half-reaction of the electrode and the liquid junction potential Ej.

== Reference Electrodes ==
The most common types of reference electrodes used in analytical chemistry include the standard hydrogen electrode, the saturated calomel electrode, and the Ag/AgCl electrode.

The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is the primary reference electrode that has a potential of 0 volts at all temperatures and a pressure of 1 atm. The figure on the left highlights the platinum (Pt) wire electrode which is not a part of the reaction (it’s a catalyst) and can serve as either the anode or cathode. The wire is immersed in an acidic solution with an H2 (g) outlet pumping gaseous hydrogen into the solution. On the surface of the Pt electrode, a half-reaction occurs:

&lt;chem&gt;2H^+{}_{(aq)} + 2e^- &lt;=&gt; H_2{}_{(g)}&lt;/chem&gt;

The cell notation is as follows with a single line denoting a phase boundary and a double line representing a salt bridge: &lt;chem&gt;Pt | H_2 (1 atm) | H^+(1M) ||&lt;/chem&gt;

In fieldwork, the SHE is inconvenient, making the Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) the second most used reference. However, it contains mercury, making it the less preferred choice of measurement. The electrode, as shown on the right, is connected to an electrical lead. A platinum wire in a paste of Hg/Hg2Cl2 is placed in a saturated 3M KCl solution. A small hole of asbestos wire is located on the bottom of the internal electrode. A ceramic frit, acting as the salt bridge, is located on the bottom of the reference electrode. The overall half-reaction is:

&lt;chem&gt;Hg2Cl2 + 2e^- &lt;-&gt; 2Hg + 2Cl^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The notation for the cell is: &lt;chem&gt;Hg | Hg2Cl2 | KCl(xM) ||&lt;/chem&gt;

Given its toxicity, the silver chloride electrode is most frequently used even over the SCE. Within the reference electrode, an Ag/AgCl wire is immersed in a KCl-filling solution. A frit at the bottom of the reference electrode plays the role of a salt bridge. The overall half-reaction is:

&lt;chem&gt;AgCl + e^-&lt;=&gt; Ag +Cl^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The notation for the cell is: &lt;chem&gt;Ag | AgCl | KCl(xM)||&lt;/chem&gt;
==Types of ion-selective membrane==
There are four main types of ion-selective membrane used in ion-selective electrodes (ISEs): glass, solid state, liquid based, and compound electrode.

===Glass membranes===

Glass membranes are made from an ion-exchange type of glass (silicate or chalcogenide). This type of ISE has good selectivity, but only for several single-charged cations; mainly H+, Na+, and Ag+. Chalcogenide glass also has selectivity for double-charged metal ions, such as Pb2+, and Cd2+. The glass membrane has excellent chemical durability and can work in very aggressive media. A very common example of this type of electrode is the pH glass electrode.

===Crystalline membranes===
Crystalline membranes are made from mono- or polycrystallites of a single substance. They have good selectivity, because only ions which can introduce themselves into the crystal structure can interfere with the electrode response. This is the major difference between this type of electrodes and the glass membrane electrodes. The lack of internal solution reduces the potential junctions. Selectivity of crystalline membranes can be for both cation and anion of the membrane-forming substance. An example is the fluoride selective electrode based on LaF3 crystals.

===Ion-exchange resin membranes===
Ion-exchange resins are based on special organic polymer membranes which contain a specific ion-exchange substance (resin). This is the most widespread type of ion-specific electrode. Usage of specific resins allows preparation of selective electrodes for tens of different ions, both single-atom or multi-atom. They are also the most widespread electrodes with anionic selectivity. However, such electrodes have low chemical and physical durability as well as &quot;survival time&quot;. An example is the potassium selective electrode, based on valinomycin as an ion-exchange agent.

===Enzyme electrodes===
Enzyme electrodes are not true ion-selective electrodes, but are usually considered to be within the ion-selective electrode scope. Such an electrode has a &quot;double reaction&quot; mechanism - an enzyme reacts with a specific substance, and the product of this reaction (usually H+ or OH−) is detected by a true ion-selective electrode, such as a pH-selective electrodes. All these reactions occur inside a special membrane, which covers the true ion-selective electrode. This is why enzyme electrodes are sometimes considered ion-selective. An example is a glucose selective electrode.


==Alkali metal ISE==

Electrodes specific for each alkali metal ion, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ have been developed. The principle on which these electrodes are based is that the alkali metal ion is encapsulated in a molecular cavity whose size is matched to the size of the ion. For example, an electrode based on Valinomycin may be used for the determination of potassium ion concentration.

<doc id="593413" wikidata="Q2155505" url="?curid=593413" title="River Line (NJ Transit)">
<text>The River Line (stylized as River LINE) is a hybrid rail (light rail with some features similar to commuter rail) line in southern New Jersey that connects the cities of Camden and Trenton, New Jersey&#x27;s capital. It is so named because its route between the two cities is parallel to the Delaware River. 

The River Line stops at the PATCO Speedline&#x27;s Broadway station (Walter Rand Transportation Center) and the NJ Transit Atlantic City Line&#x27;s Pennsauken Transit Center, providing connections to Philadelphia. Its northern terminus is adjacent to the Trenton Transit Center in Trenton.

The line is operated for New Jersey Transit by the Southern New Jersey Rail Group (SNJRG), which originally included Bechtel and Bombardier Transportation. Now that the project is in its operational phase, Bombardier is the only member of SNJRG. In 2021, Alstom acquired Bombardier Transportation. 

==Ridership==
The River Line was exceeding final ridership estimates of 5,500 passengers per day, with an average of 9,014 weekday, 5,922 Saturday, and 4,708 Sunday average passenger trips as of the end of fiscal year 2014. During this time, there were 2,869,707 unlinked passenger trips.

In 2022 after the COVID-19 pandemic ridership was at 5,350 boardings per weekday, around 61% of pre-pandemic levels.

==History==
===Alignment===

The River Line was constructed on what originally was the Camden-Bordentown section and the Bordentown Branch of the Camden and Amboy Railroad (C&amp;A). The lines ran under the C&amp;A name between 1830 and 1871, when the line was absorbed into the Pennsylvania Railroad. Ownership proceeded under Penn Central after 1968, and Conrail from 1976 to June 1, 1999, but the original passenger service had been abandoned in 1963.

===Planning===
The path to NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line spanned at least three decades and over multiple planning agencies. An unrelated precursor to the NJ Transit River Line was the Delaware River Port Authority&#x27;s 1960 plan for rail rapid transit service to Moorestown/Mount Holly, Lindenwold, and Woodbury Heights/Glassboro, using three existing railroad corridors. Implementation of the complete plan was considered unrealistically expensive. The DRPA elected to focus its resources on the most promising corridor, the Philadelphia–Lindenwold route. Construction on the PATCO Speedline began in 1966 and was completed in 1969, re-using the 1936 Bridge Line subway and constructing a grade-separated heavy-rail line within the Atlantic City Line right-of-way. The DRPA&#x27;s original proposal did not include the alignment that became the River Line corridor, but planned to serve Burlington County via the Mount Holly alignment.

NJ Transit&#x27;s planning for the &quot;Burlington–Gloucester Transit System&quot; began in the early 1990s.

The primary goals of the BGTS were:
* Connecting South Jersey communities to Philadelphia
* Providing streetcar service to downtown Camden
* Providing regional rail transit service to Burlington and Gloucester Counties

A Major Investment Study (MIS) published in 1996 concluded that a Gloucester route was more suitable than a Burlington route based on travel demand and citizen support. This study included substantial public participation: fourteen open houses, three advisory committees, and other public outreach. The process found substantial neighborhood opposition to the Mount Holly alignment through Burlington County: county freeholders publicly opposed the possibility. Opposition was particularly strong in Moorestown Township, partly because of a potential street-running section. Meanwhile, Gloucester County leaders were largely ambivalent towards the project.

Dissatisfied with this analysis, Senator C. William Haines introduced legislation in the New Jersey State Senate requiring NJ Transit to study rail transit service along the Delaware River between Trenton, Camden, and Glassboro. Haines, a native of Moorestown, sought the benefits of rail for Burlington County without the disruption to his hometown.

Two special studies were commissioned to supplement the alternatives identified in the MIS. The second of these special studies examined the Bordentown Secondary, another Conrail corridor through Burlington County, the alignment of today’s River Line. The parallel NJ Transit local bus on U.S. Route 130 was heavily patronized, and the corridor was ripe for economic development.

In November 1996, NJ Transit&#x27;s board of directors approved a light rail transit alignment from Glassboro to Trenton with diesel-powered cars based on the findings of the special study. The board also established the initial operating corridor (IOC) to be the Trenton-Camden corridor. The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was completed in 1998, and the contract with SNJRG was finalized in 1999, permitting the system to open to the public on March 14, 2004. The entire line was 100 percent funded by the State of New Jersey from its Transportation Trust Fund. No federal capital was expended for this diesel light rail project. Former NJ Transit executive director George Warrington has described the River Line as &quot;the poster child for how not to plan and make decisions about a transit investment.&quot;

===Pennsauken Transit Center===
The lack of a direct transfer between the River Line and NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line, which crosses directly over the River Line in Pennsauken, was highly criticized at the time of the River Line&#x27;s opening. NJT subsequently reconsidered; in March 2009, NJT announced that an intermodal station linking the River Line and the Atlantic City Line would be constructed in Pennsauken. The new intermodal station would include one low-level platform for River Line trains, two high-level platforms for Atlantic City Line commuter trains, and 280 parking spaces. A ground breaking ceremony was held for the Pennsauken Transit Center on October 19, 2009. The second and final phase of construction was approved by the NJ Transit Board of Directors on July 13, 2011. NJ Transit opened the station to passenger service on October 14, 2013.

==Ownership and time sharing agreement==
Except at each end of the line, the River Line was Conrail&#x27;s Bordentown Secondary until June 1, 1999, when NJ Transit bought it for $67.5 million. NJ Transit has exclusive access to run light rail passenger service on the line from 05:30 to 22:10 Sunday through Friday, and all of Saturday night and Sunday morning. Conrail has exclusive access for freight at other times. Either agency may request to use the line at abnormal times in case of a special event or emergency.

Within a year of the River Line&#x27;s launch, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) granted permission to adjust timesharing agreement (more technically, &quot;temporal separation&quot;) terms. NJ Transit and Conrail agreed to divide the line into two segments, from Camden to Bordentown (south), and from Bordentown to Trenton (north). In the northern section, the passenger period starts at 5:45 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. Initially, these new periods allowed NJ Transit to deadhead equipment from Trenton to Bordentown and Florence at 5.45 a.m., to form the 6:08 a.m. and 6:23 a.m. northbound departures. These early morning trains provide earlier connections at Trenton for NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor services to Newark and New York City than were available previously.

===Service improvements and cutbacks===
NJ Transit has made some service improvements within the constraints of the timesharing agreement, with the construction of a mid-line yard in 2005 to permit later Burlington arrivals in the evening, and earlier departures after 6 a.m. However, most of the changes noted to facilitate late night service (after 10 p.m. on nights other than Saturdays) have been reversed, as listed. Since the River Line opened, NJ Transit has made the service enhancements listed below (some of them subsequently reversed): 
* Introduced 15-minute peak-period service in June 2004
* Enhanced Capital Connection bus service in Trenton to provide better connections for state workers with River Line trains in June 2004
* Launched new early morning service to Trenton from Florence and Roebling in September 2004, enabling customers to make earlier connections to Northeast Corridor trains
* Launched new early service from Cinnaminson to Camden in January 2005
* Launched late-night bus shuttle service between 36th Street Station in Pennsauken to Route 73/Pennsauken in 2006. This no longer operates as of 2010, although the bus route 419 does serve both locations.
* Added early-morning trips from Burlington South and Burlington Towne Centre stations in September 2006 to create additional Northeast Corridor and PATCO connections
* Added a later, 9:28 p.m. Trenton departure in September 2006 on weekdays (9:30 p.m. on Sundays) as far as Burlington South Station.
* Added late-night, seven days a week service from Camden to Pennsauken, with the last train leaving Entertainment Center Station at 12:00 a.m. &quot;This option was discontinued in 2010, although the bus route 419 does serve stations between the Walter Rand Transportation Center and Pennsauken/Route 73 as well as several other stations as far north as Riverside. The last train from Camden leaves the Walter Rand Transportation at 9:38 p.m. and arrives at Pennsauken/Route 73 at 9:47 p.m.&quot; Some late night service continues to run, on Saturdays, and, on irregular occasions, for special events on the Camden Waterfront or at the Entertainment Center in Camden. 
* Added early-morning trains for both weekdays and weekends, including a special limited-stop weekday train leaving at 5:53 a.m. from Walter Rand Transportation Center and arriving at Trenton at 6:42 a.m. (normal runs take 58 minutes, compared to the 49 minutes for the limited-stop train), allowing commuters ample time to transfer to a 6:50 scheduled New York City-bound express train.

There is no northbound late night service except on Saturdays due to budget cuts; the last northbound train leaves the Walter Rand Transportation Center at 9:38 p.m. Sundays through Fridays and goes only as far as the Pennsauken/Route 73 station. The only option to reach some stations north of the Walter Rand Transportation Center from Camden on these nights is the Route 419 bus which stops at each station as far north as Riverside while the Atlantic City Rail Line from Philadelphia and Lindenwold connects with the River Line at the Pennsauken Transit Center Station.

===Discontinuation of late night service===
Currently, there is no service on the line after 10 p.m., except on Saturdays and limited nights when there is a concert at the Entertainment Center at the southern end of the line or another special event. Two stations in Camden, which are double-tracked where the final southbound trains stop just after 10 p.m., are the only exception. This reduction in service occurred in 2010 to save money.

==Operations and signalling==
Most of the length of the project, except for street-running portion at the Camden end, is shared between non-FRA compliant light rail DMUs and heavy mainline freight trains. The 34-mile shared-track segment contains a mixture of single and double track sections.

The River Line was initially designed for commingled operations (i.e., where freight trains and light rail trains may operate on the same line controlled only by the signal systems) to provide maximum flexibility both for the freight and transit operators. The line, rebuilt under a design-build-operate-maintain (DBOM) contract, features mainline railroad signals with full centralized traffic control (CTC). River Line operating personnel use a modified version of the NORAC Rules, a standard set of railroad operating rules used by mainline railroads operating in the Northeastern U.S., including Amtrak and Conrail.

Signals set to stop for the diesel light rail cars are positively enforced via Intermittent Inductive Automatic Train Stop. The system is similar (but not identical) to the German Indusi system, where signal aspects are transmitted to moving trains from wayside devices. The inductive train stop devices are placed by the running rails in advance of the absolute signals. Train&#x27;s emergency brakes are automatically engaged if a stop signal overrun occurs and interlockings are designed with sufficient overlap for trains to come to a complete stop before conflicting with other traffic.

==Payment and ticketing==
The River Line is equivalent to a one-zone bus ride: fares cost $1.80. The River Line operates on a proof-of-payment system, as is typical of most light rail systems throughout the United States. Passengers can buy tickets at ticket vending machines (TVMs) present at all stations or via the NJ Transit App on Smartphones. Through-ticketing is available for connecting bus routes to Philadelphia. One-way, round-trip, and ten-trip tickets must then be validated, either by the app or with paper tickets, through automated validators located near the TVMs, which stamp the date and time on the ticket for 75 minutes of use. NJ Transit&#x27;s fare inspectors randomly check tickets on trains and at stations; fare evasion carries a fine of up to $100. Unused Newark City Subway and Hudson-Bergen Light Rail tickets can be used after validation at a River Line station. As of 2004, rider fares only covered 7% of costs (not including debt service). Like the rest of NJ Transit&#x27;s other transportation modes, it does not accept the SEPTA Key Card, PATCO&#x27;s Freedom Card, MTA&#x27;s MetroCard, or OMNY, although it has plans to create a new fare payment system in the future.

==Rolling stock==
The River Line fleet comprises 20 articulated Swiss-built Stadler GTW 2/6 DMU (diesel multiple unit) cars. The River Line is the first light rail system in the United States to use these instead of more typical electric vehicles.

==Stations==
All stations and rolling stock were built after 1990 and are fully ADA-compliant.
== Future service, stations and extensions ==
New Jersey Transit has proposed several possible extensions and stations to the River Line, either as parts of the initial construction plan which were deferred, or as potential future projects.

===Glassboro–Camden Line===
The Glassboro–Camden Line is a proposed diesel multiple unit (DMU) light rail system. At its northern end in Camden it will converge with the River Line, with which its infrastructure and vehicles will be compatible, and terminate at the Walter Rand Transportation Center. The plan is part of larger expansion of public transportation in South Jersey that will include bus rapid transit along the Route 42 and Route 55, improvements to the Atlantic City Rail Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.

===New Jersey State House extension===
The New Jersey State House is located approximately 0.8 miles to the northwest of the River Line&#x27;s northern terminal at Trenton Transit Center. While the line was being constructed, NJT studied an extension that would bridge this gap via a shared right-of-way on city streets. Such an extension would provide direct service to the workplaces of state employees and other workers in downtown Trenton. While the project is supported by City of Trenton officials, NJT did not elect to expand the already over-budget construction effort, but instead operates a branded &quot;Capitol Connection&quot; bus service, requiring River Line riders to transfer at Trenton Transit Center.

===West Trenton extension===
A third proposed extension would take the River Line beyond the State House through Trenton, to West Trenton station in Ewing Township, New Jersey, connecting with SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line service to Center City Philadelphia via Bucks and Montgomery counties. NJ Transit listed this extension on its 2020 Transit wish list map, but has not taken further action.

===Additional double-track service===
Much of the River Line uses double track, however, in some places, there is no room for double-track service without narrowing or removing road lanes, such as Burlington (where streets flank the single track on either side), Palmyra and Bordentown. Improving headways from the current peak level of 15 minutes would require either building additional passing sidings or removing one lane of traffic on certain local roads.

<doc id="593414" wikidata="Q1273048" url="?curid=593414" title="Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration">
<text>The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a measure of the concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cell.

It is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit. Reference ranges for blood tests are 32 to 36 g/dL (320 to 360g/L), or between 4.81 and 5.58 mmol/L. It is thus a mass or molar concentration. Still, many instances measure MCHC in percentage (%), as if it were a mass fraction (mHb / mRBC). Numerically, however, the MCHC in g/dL and the mass fraction of hemoglobin in red blood cells in % are identical, assuming an RBC density of 1g/mL and negligible hemoglobin in plasma.

==Interpretation==
A low MCHC can be interpreted as identifying decreased production of hemoglobin. MCHC can be normal even when hemoglobin production is decreased (such as in iron deficiency) due to a calculation artifact. MCHC can be elevated (&quot;hyperchromic&quot;) in hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and homozygous hemoglobin C disease, depending upon the hemocytometer. MCHC can be elevated in some megaloblastic anemias. MCHC can be falsely elevated when there is agglutination of red cells (falsely lowering the measured RBC count) or when there is opacification of the plasma (falsely increasing the measured hemoglobin). Causes of plasma opacification that can falsely increase the MCHC include hyperbilirubinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and free hemoglobin in the plasma (due to hemolysis).

==Complicating conditions==
Because of the way automated analysers count blood cells, a very high MCHC (greater than about 370 g/L) may indicate the blood is from someone with a cold agglutinin, or there may be some other problem resulting in one or more artifactual results affecting the MCHC.

For example, for some patients with cold agglutinins, when their blood gets colder than 37 °C, the red cells will clump together. As a result, the analyzer may incorrectly report a low number of very dense red blood cells. This will result in an impossibly high number when the analyzer calculates the MCHC. This problem is usually picked up by the laboratory before the result is reported. The blood can be warmed until the cells separate from each other, and quickly put through the machine while still warm.

There are four steps to perform when a suspect increased MCHC (&gt;370 g/L or &gt;37.0 g/dL) is received from the analyzer:

# Remix the EDTA tube—if the MCHC corrects, report corrected results
# Incubation at 37 °C—if the MCHC corrects, report corrected results and comment on possible cold agglutinin
# Saline replacement: Replace plasma with same amount of saline to exclude interference e.g. Lipemia and Auto-immune antibodies—if the MCHC corrects, report corrected results and comment on Lipemia
# Check the slide for spherocytosis (e.g. in hereditary spherocytosis, among other causes)

<text>The mean corpuscular hemoglobin, or &quot;mean cell hemoglobin&quot; (MCH), is the average mass of hemoglobin (Hb) per red blood cell (RBC) in a sample of blood. It is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. MCH value is diminished in hypochromic anemias. RBCs are either normochromic or hypochromic. They are never &quot;hyperchromic&quot;. If more than the normal amount of hemoglobin is made, the cells get larger—they do not become darker.

It is calculated by dividing the total mass of hemoglobin by the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood.

MCH=(Hb*10)/RBC (in millions)

A normal MCH value in humans is 27 to 33 picograms (pg)/cell. The amount of hemoglobin per RBC depends on hemoglobin synthesis and the size of the RBC.

The mass of the red cell is determined by the iron (as part of the hemoglobin molecule), thus MCH in picograms is roughly the mass of one red cell. In iron deficiency anemia the cell mass becomes lighter, thus a MCH below 27 pg is an indication of iron deficiency.

The MCH decreases when Hb synthesis is reduced, or when RBCs are smaller than normal, such as in cases of iron-deficiency anemia. Conversion to SI-units: 1 pg of hemoglobin = 0.06207 femtomole (fmol). Normal value converted to SI-units: 1.68 – 1.92 fmol/cell.

<text>The mean corpuscular volume, or mean cell volume (MCV), is a measure of the average volume of a red blood corpuscle (or red blood cell). The measure is obtained by multiplying a volume of blood by the proportion of blood that is cellular (the hematocrit), and dividing that product by the number of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in that volume. The mean corpuscular volume is a part of a standard complete blood count.

In patients with anemia, it is the MCV measurement that allows classification as either a microcytic anemia (MCV below normal range), normocytic anemia (MCV within normal range) or macrocytic anemia (MCV above normal range). Normocytic anemia is usually deemed so because the bone marrow has not yet responded with a change in cell volume. It occurs occasionally in acute conditions, namely blood loss and hemolysis.

If the MCV was determined by automated equipment, the result can be compared to RBC morphology on a peripheral blood smear, where a normal RBC is about the size of a normal lymphocyte nucleus. Any deviation would usually be indicative of either faulty equipment or technician error, although there are some conditions that present with high MCV without megaloblastic cells.

For further specification, it can be used to calculate red blood cell distribution width (RDW). The RDW is a statistical calculation made by automated analyzers that reflects the variability in size and shape of the RBCs.

==Calculation==

To calculate MCV, the hematocrit (Hct) is divided by the concentration of RBCs ([RBC])

formula_1

Normally, MCV is expressed in femtoliters (fL, or 10−15 L), and [RBC] in millions per microliter (106 / μL). The normal range for MCV is 80–100 fL.

If the hematocrit is expressed as a percentage, the red blood cell concentration as millions per microliter, and the MCV in femtoliters, the formula becomes

formula_2

formula_3

For example, if the Hct = 42.5% and [RBC] = 4.58 million per microliter (4,580,000/μL), then

formula_4

Using implied units,

formula_5

The MCV can be determined in a number of ways by automatic analyzers. In volume-sensitive automated blood cell counters, such as the Coulter counter, the red cells pass one-by-one through a small aperture and generate a signal directly proportional to their volume.
Other automated counters measure red blood cell volume by means of techniques that measure refracted, diffracted, or scattered light.

==Interpretation==
The normal reference range is typically 80-100 fL.

===High===
In pernicious anemia (macrocytic), MCV can range up to 150 femtolitres. (as are an elevated GGT and an AST/ALT ratio of 2:1). Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency has also been associated with macrocytic anemia (high MCV numbers).

===Low===
The most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency (due to inadequate dietary intake, gastrointestinal blood loss, or menstrual blood loss), thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia or chronic disease. In iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia), it can be as low as 60 to 70 femtolitres. In some cases of thalassemia, the MCV may be low even though the patient is not iron deficient.

==Worked example==
==Derivation==
The MCV can be conceptualized as the total volume of a group of cells divided by the number of cells. For a real world sized example, imagine you had 10 small jellybeans with a combined volume of 10 μL. The mean volume of a jellybean in this group would be 10 μL / 10 jellybeans = 1 μL / jellybean. A similar calculation works for MCV.

1. Measure the RBC index in cells/μL. Take the reciprocal (1/RBC index) to convert it to μL/cell.

:formula_6

2. The 1 μL is only made of a proportion of red cells (e.g. 40%) with the rest of the volume composed of plasma. Multiply by the hematocrit (a unitless quantity) to take this into account.

:formula_7

3. Finally, convert the units of μL to fL by multiplying by formula_8. The result would look like this:

:formula_9

Note: the shortcut proposed above just makes the units work out: formula_10

<doc id="593422" wikidata="Q1363819" url="?curid=593422" title="Red blood cell distribution width">
<text>Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), as well as various types thereof (RDW-CV or RCDW and RDW-SD), is a measure of the range of variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Red blood cells have an average volume of 80–100 femtoliters, but individual cell volumes vary even in healthy blood. Certain disorders, however, cause a significantly increased variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5–15.4%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause.

Deficiencies of Vitamin B12 or folate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two-thirds of all cases. However, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of both iron and B12 deficiencies, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis.

An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias. Anemia of chronic disease, hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) may all present with a normal RDW.

==Calculations==
The &quot;width&quot; in RDW is sometimes thought to be &quot;misleading&quot;, since it in fact is a measure of deviation of the &quot;volume&quot; of RBCs, and not directly the diameter. RDW-CV &quot;width&quot; refers to the width of the volume curve (distribution width), not the width of the cells. 
RDW-SD is calculated as the width (in fL) of the RBC size distribution histogram at the 20% height level. This parameter is, therefore, not influenced by the average RBC size (mean corpuscular volume, MCV).

RDW-CV (expressed in %) is calculated with the following formula:

: RDW-CV = (1 standard deviation of RBC volume ÷ MCV) × 100%.
Since RDW-CV is mathematically derived from MCV, it is therefore affected by the average RBC size (MCV).

==Pathological implications==
===Normal RDW===
Anemia in the presence of a normal RDW may suggest thalassemia. A low Mentzer Index, calculated from CBC data [MCV/RBC &lt; 13], may suggest this disorder but a hemoglobin electrophoresis would be diagnostic. Anemia of chronic diseases show normal RDW.

===High RDW===
High RDW may be a result of the presence of fragments, groups of agglutination, and/or abnormal shape of red blood cells.
* Iron-deficiency anemia usually presents with high RDW and low MCV.
* Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency anemia usually presents with high RDW and high MCV.
* Mixed-deficiency (iron + B12 or folate) anemia usually presents with high RDW and variable MCV.
* Recent hemorrhages typically present with high RDW and normal MCV.
* A false high RDW reading can occur if EDTA anticoagulated blood is used instead of citrated blood. See Pseudothrombocytopenia.

By severity, elevated RDW can be classified as follows:

<text>St. Francis Xavier University is a public undergraduate liberal arts university located in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a member of the Maple League, a group of primarily undergraduate universities in Eastern Canada.

==History==
St. Francis Xavier College was founded as Arichat College, a Roman Catholic diocesan educational institution at Arichat, Nova Scotia, in 1853. Arichat College was moved to its present location in Antigonish, and established as St. Francis Xavier College in 1855. On May 7, 1866, St. Francis Xavier College was given university status, becoming St. Francis Xavier University. The university awarded its first degrees in 1868.

In 1883 Mount St. Bernard Academy was founded for female education, with girls from primary grades to grade 12 taught by the Sisters of Notre Dame.

Architect Henry Frederick Busch designed the college building in 1888.

In 1894, the academy affiliated with St. Francis Xavier University as Mount St. Bernard College. In 1897, the school became the first co-educational Catholic university in North America to grant degrees to women. Four women were awarded university degrees in 1897.

A metal plaque in the St. Francis Xavier University Chapel is dedicated to the thirty-three members of the college, now St. Francis Xavier University, who were killed in service during the First World War (1914–18).

In February 1922, St. Francis Xavier University&#x27;s War Memorial Rink, with a brick exterior and wooden interior, opened. After the War Memorial Rink was officially closed on February 8, 2002, the building was torn down and a new science complex was built in the old rink&#x27;s place.

StFX&#x27;s extension department has engaged in community development in Antigonish since 1928 while the Coady International Institute at StFX has engaged in community development globally since 1959.

A metal plaque, unveiled on 5 May 1984, was dedicated by the university&#x27;s class of 1984, in honour of those students killed in armed conflict while defending the liberty of Canadians.

In 1985 the number of women students at St. Francis Xavier became equal to the number of men for the first time. In 1990, the women&#x27;s college existed as a residence only.

In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

The St. Francis Xavier tartan was designed as a university tartan in 1994.

In 1996 StFX implemented Canada&#x27;s first Service Learning program, which provided opportunities for international learning.

In February 2020, Dr. Andy Hakin was named the university&#x27;s 19th president and vice-chancellor by StFX&#x27;s board of governors. He began his tenure on July 1, 2020. 

==Academics==
===Profile===
&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2022 Guide to Canadian Universities ranked St. Francis Xavier seventh in the magazine&#x27;s undergraduate university category. In the same year, the university placed 34th in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; reputational survey of Canadian universities.

Between 2000 and 2004, more St Francis Xavier students, on a per capita basis, have received Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) awards for post-secondary study than any other university in Canada.

===Faculties and programs===

St Francis Xavier University is organized into the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Science, the Gerald Schwartz School of Business, Faculty of Education, the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government and the Coady Institute. Faculties are headed by a dean elected from among the constituent professors.

==Scholarships and bursaries==
St. Francis Xavier offers over $2 million annually in merit-based scholarships and financial aid to its new and current undergraduates. Applicants with a Grade 12 average of at least 85% are automatically guaranteed an entrance scholarship worth at least $5,000 ($1,250 each year for four years), and at least $7,000 for those with Grade 12 averages above 90% ($1,750 each year for four years). Applicants are also automatically considered for larger merit-based scholarships ranging from $12,000 to $32,000 (Merit, Phillip W. Oland, J.P. McArthy, Canadian, President&#x27;s). Area-specific scholarships also exist for applicants from certain provinces and the United States. In order to receive each subsequent installment of a scholarship (typically there are four installments), students must maintain a university course average of at least 80%.

StFX offers scholarships to students of Indigenous and African Nova Scotia descent thanks to support from the Jeannine Deveau Educational Equity Endowment. Deveau, a StFX graduate from 1944, created the endowment to help remove financial barriers that typically prevent students from minority racialized populations in Nova Scotia from accessing post-secondary education. The Jeannine Deveau Educational Equity Endowment has contributed $22 million toward financial aid at StFX, making it the largest single amount pledged by a StFX alumna or alumnus in the university&#x27;s history.

==X-Ring==

St. Francis Xavier University ceremonially awards to students a distinctive X&quot;-Ring&quot;. The ring is awarded on December 3 (Saint Francis Xavier&#x27;s feast day) of each year before the students&#x27; graduation. On average, more than 95% of the graduating class opt for the ring.

==Campus renewal==
Since Riley was named president in 1996, the university has undergone a $230 million campus renewal initiative to improve educational and residential opportunities throughout campus. To date, the initiative has seen the completion of eleven large-scale projects.

*The creation of Mulroney Hall, which houses the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government in addition to several university classroom spaces, was announced in October 2016. The project includes a $40 million capital investment as well as $20 million in endowment funds for the institute. Named after former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, an alumnus of the university, the centre is the first of its type at a primarily undergraduate university in Canada dedicated to issues of public policy and governance.
*Riley Hall (2014) and O&#x27;Regan Hall (2013). Named in honour of the university&#x27;s former president (1996–2014), Sean Riley, as well the late Paul O’Regan and Stephen O’Regan, founders of O’Regan&#x27;s Automotive Group, the new buildings each house over 150 students feature a mix of single and apartment-style rooms. In 2015, the new residences were ranked best university residences in Canada by UniversityHub. Each building is heated and cooled by using 26 geothermal wells, and is designed to be LEED Gold Certified for energy efficiency.
*Frank McKenna Centre for Leadership was opened on May 11, 2011. Former US president Bill Clinton attended as keynote speaker. The $12 million facility is designed to broaden the leadership environment that already exists at St. Francis Xavier. Located in the heart of St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s campus, the McKenna Centre supports targeted initiatives in the fields of public policy, business, and health, including a leadership speakers series and a leaders in residence program. The centre is home to an executive leadership training program, educating top national and international talent.
*Construction of the Gerald Schwartz School of Business building began in June 2009, after an investment of $22.7 million from the federal and provincial governments. The grand opening was held on November 5, 2011, in presence of Gerry Schwartz, president of Onex Corporation, and Frank McKenna. It was named after the businessman in recognition of his donations to the university. The school hosts 15 streams of Bachelor of Business Administration studies as well as a Bachelor of Information Systems with a major or minor. The new facility, topped by a gilt dome, houses four floors of classrooms, an auditorium, lecture halls, faculty office space, seminar rooms, student service centre, lounges, research labs and meeting areas.
*In June 2008, construction of the new Coady International Centre began. The project includes the restoration of four historic campus buildings, some as dating as far back as 1890, in order to expand the current Coady International Institute at St. Francis Xavier University.

==Athletics==

St. Francis Xavier is represented in the Atlantic University Sport conference by 12 varsity athletics teams. The X-Men teams include men&#x27;s football, basketball, cross-country, track and field, soccer, and hockey. The X-Women teams include basketball, cross country, track and field, hockey, rugby and soccer.

In 2006, the X-Women Rugby team became the first female St. Francis Xavier varsity team to win a CIS Championship, as 10-time defending AUS Rugby Champions. In 2008, the team placed 2nd at the CIS Championships in Lethbridge, Alberta after capturing their 12th consecutive AUS Championship.

==Post stamp==
On 4 April 2003 Canada Post issued &quot;St. Francis Xavier University, 1853–2003&quot; as part of the Canadian Universities series. The stamp was based on a design by Denis L&#x27;Allier, based on a photograph by Guy Lavigueur. The 48¢ stamps are perforated 13.5 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.

<text>Bora Laskin (October 5, 1912 – March 26, 1984) was a Canadian jurist who served as the 14th chief justice of Canada from 1973 to 1984 and as a puisne justice of the Supreme Court from 1970 to 1973. Before his Supreme Court service, he previously served on the Ontario Court of Appeal from 1965 to 1970. Prior to his appointment, Laskin worked as a lawyer and in academia.

==Early life and family==
Laskin was born in Fort William, Ontario (now Thunder Bay), the son of Max Laskin and Bluma Zingel. His brother, Saul Laskin, went on to become the first mayor of Thunder Bay. His other brother, Charles, was a shirt designer and manufacturer.

Laskin married Peggy Tenenbaum. The couple had two children: John I. Laskin, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a judge at the Ontario Court of Appeal, and Barbara Laskin Plumptre. His grandson (the son of his daughter) carries on his name. His nephew John B. Laskin is a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, having previously been a faculty member of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law and a prominent commercial litigator in Toronto.

==Education==
Laskin was educated as a lawyer at Osgoode Hall Law School. He initially studied at the University of Toronto, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1933. He received the degrees of Master of Arts in 1935 and earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Toronto in 1936.

While at the University of Toronto, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity.

In 1937, he received a Master of Laws from Harvard Law School. He earned a gold medal at both the University of Toronto Law School and at Harvard Law School.

==Legal career==
Despite his superior academic record, Laskin, who was Jewish, was unable to find work at any law firm of note, because of the anti-Semitism that pervaded the English-Canadian legal profession at the time. As a result, his first job after graduating was writing headnotes (&quot;i.e.&quot;, article synopses) for the Canadian Abridgement, a legal research tool.

In order to be called to the bar, it was required that he serve articles with a lawyer who was already a member of the bar. He had trouble finding a lawyer who would serve as his principal, because non-Jewish lawyers would not accept Jewish students. Through connections, he eventually found a young Jewish lawyer, Sam Gotfrid, who was willing to sign as his principal, but Gotfrid was himself only just starting out and could not provide Laskin with any work or salary. A year into his articles, Laskin found a non-Jewish lawyer, W.C. Davidson, who was willing to take him as an articling student, and he finished his articles with Davidson. In later years, Laskin would say that he articled with Davidson, not mentioning his initial start with Gotfrid.

Ultimately, Laskin decided to pursue his career in academia. In 1940, he was hired by the University of Toronto (the post had initially been offered to John Kenneth Macalister, who turned it down in favour of serving in the military). Laskin taught at the University of Toronto until 1965 (except for the period 1945–1949, when he taught at Osgoode Hall Law School). For 23 years he was an associate editor of Dominion Law Reports and Canadian Criminal Cases. He also wrote &quot;Canadian Constitutional Law&quot; and other legal texts. His interests were in labour law, constitutional law, and human rights. He was a founding member of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

===Labour lawyer and arbitrator===

Laskin&#x27;s non-academic practice involved primarily the area of labour and employment law, where he was known to have a kind heart and worked to advance the rights of trade unions. His most significant contributions were as a grievance arbitrator, where he made one of the greatest contributions to labour jurisprudence, with many of the legal concepts he developed finding their way into the broader field of law, especially human rights law which in the early days grew largely out of disputes in the workplace.

Many of Laskin&#x27;s decisions are still referenced as leading cases of Canadian labour law and the University of Toronto&#x27;s Centre for the Study of Industrial Relations awards the Bora Laskin Award in Labour Law annually to two lawyers who have made an outstanding contributions to Canadian labour law (one to union-side and one to employer-side).

==Judicial career==

===Ontario Court of Appeal===
Laskin&#x27;s career on the bench began in 1965 with his appointment to the Ontario Court of Appeal. While on the Court of Appeal, Laskin gave a decision in a divorce case, upholding the constitutional authority of the federal Parliament to include the right to spousal support under the &quot;Divorce Act&quot;. Laskin held that spousal support was ancillary to Parliament&#x27;s constitutional jurisdiction over divorce under the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;. When the Supreme Court of Canada considered the same issue three years later, it unanimously reached the same conclusion, citing Laskin&#x27;s decision from the Ontario Court of Appeal.

===Supreme Court of Canada===
On March 19, 1970, he was appointed on the advice of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to the Supreme Court of Canada, becoming the first Jewish justice to sit on that court. Again on the advice of Trudeau, Laskin was appointed Chief Justice on December 27, 1973. He held that position until his death in 1984.

Laskin&#x27;s appointment as Chief Justice generated some controversy. He was the second-most junior justice on the court, having served for only three years. The long-standing tradition was that on the retirement of the chief justice, the senior puisne justice on the court would be appointed. Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1875, this practice had been followed except on two occasions, in 1906 and 1924, when the senior puisne justices had been passed over. By that tradition, the appointment as Chief Justice would have gone to Justice Ronald Martland, who had been on the court for fifteen years. When Prime Minister Trudeau appointed Laskin, it was said that Justice Martland had been given very little notice that he would be passed over, and was upset by it. Minister of Finance John Turner was rumoured to be furious at the departure from the traditions of the court.

==Judgments==
===Judicial philosophy===
Laskin was a liberal jurist who often found himself on the minority side of decisions. His specialty was labour law and constitutional law and he had a reputation as a civil libertarian.

On matters of federalism under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, Laskin has been considered the most aggressive supporter of the federal powers of any justice since Confederation. This made for a stark contrast with fellow Justice Jean Beetz, who was known as one of the strongest supporters of provincial powers under the Constitution.

In his earlier years on the Supreme Court, Laskin was frequently in dissent. During the 1970s, Laskin frequently joined with justices Wishart Spence and Brian Dickson on cases involving civil liberties, often in dissent from the more conservative majority on the court. The grouping was colloquially referred to as the &quot;LSD connection.&quot;

Laskin often took a position that was later adopted by a majority of the court. Among his most famous dissents was his opinion in &quot;Murdoch v. Murdoch&quot;, where he was the sole judge who would have ruled in favour of a wife&#x27;s application for an equal division of property acquired during the course of the marriage. The outcome of the case was highly controversial. It triggered reforms to matrimonial laws across the country, adopting Laskin&#x27;s view of property equality between husband and wife. Years later, Laskin said that the position he took in this case was the likely cause of his promotion to Chief Justice over the more senior Ronald Martland.

===The Patriation Reference===
Laskin presided over a number of landmark constitutional cases, most notably the 1981 Patriation Reference, which considered Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s attempt to have the federal government unilaterally patriate the Constitution of Canada without the consent of the provinces. The case was a consolidated appeal of three provincial references, from Quebec, Manitoba and Newfoundland. By a 7-2 division, a majority of the court held that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally. However, by a division of 6–3, the court also held that unilateral federal action would violate a constitutional convention that had emerged since Confederation, requiring substantial provincial agreement on constitutional amendments. Laskin was one of the judges in the majority on the issue of Parliament&#x27;s legal authority to act unilaterally, but was one of the three dissenting judges who would have held that there was no constitutional convention restricting Parliament&#x27;s power to act unilaterally.

As a result of the decision in the Patriation Reference, Trudeau decided to begin a new round of negotiations with the provinces, which resulted in the patriation of the Constitution from Britain being agreed to by all provinces save Quebec. Historian Frederic Bastien suggests that Laskin may have violated the constitutional separation of powers by discussing the deliberations of the court with politicians, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the decision. However, surviving participants in the Reference process do not think that the allegations, even if true, undercut the validity of the court&#x27;s decision. Other scholars said that the patriation process violated judicial independence.

==Death==
Laskin was in poor health the last few years of his life, and died in office on March 26, 1984, at the age of 71 from pneumonia. Two weeks before his death, on March 13, 1984, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Prime Minister Trudeau offered a state funeral, but the family declined because Laskin &quot;liked things very simple.&quot; Instead, Laskin lay in state in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court building, prior to a simple funeral ceremony in Ottawa and interment at Holy Blossom Memorial Park in Toronto. His brother Saul Laskin was later buried beside him.

== In game theory ==


In game theory, a kingmaker is a player who lacks sufficient resources or position to win at a given game, but possesses enough remaining resources to decide which of the remaining viable players will eventually win.

== Contemporary usage ==

The term &quot;kingmaker&quot;, though always unofficial, has tended to gain more importance in places of power struggle—e.g., politics, sports organizations etc. Consequently, bestowal of such a title is looked upon significantly and more often as a means of indirect gratification for individuals wanting to silently dictate the affairs of the organization. The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the &quot;vote bank&quot; can most likely decide the course of an outcome.

As well as referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to institutions or think tanks whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the king) is a well-known example. Kingdoms and empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dictate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful lobbying groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues.

Citizens of West African sub-national monarchies often use the word &quot;kingmaker&quot; to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e. a &quot;maker&quot; of the king.

The term &quot;kingmaker&quot; is also used to describe situations in multi-player games where a player is either unable to win or has claimed an unassailable lead, but, in either case, plays a strong role in determining the outcome for other players.

== In fiction ==
* The character Leon Fortunato from the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of novels is often described as a kingmaker.
* Marcus Jefferson Wall, the antagonist of much of the Matador series by Steve Perry is called the Kingmaker, and controls the President of the Galactic Federation
* The character Mayvar Kingmaker from the &quot;Saga of the Exiles&quot; series of novels tests the ability of aspirants before they can be proclaimed king of the Tanu.
* Ser Criston Cole, a character from George R. R. Martin’s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, is commonly referred to as &quot;the kingmaker&quot;. In the story in which he appears The Dance of Dragons (The Blacks and the Greens,) the king dies while his eldest child and designated heir is absent from the castle, and Ser Criston, the head of the king&#x27;s bodyguard, immediately plots with other like-minded individuals to crown the king&#x27;s second child, because the king&#x27;s younger child is male, whereas the heir is female. This triggers a nationwide civil war. The Dance of Dragons draws inspiration from both The Anarchy and The War of the Roses, events in British history that each contained kingmaker figures (Henry of Blois and Richard Neville, respectively.)
* Minato Yoko, a character from &quot;Kamen Rider Gaim&quot;, considers herself a kingmaker, wanting to see who has what it takes to take the Forbidden Fruit, a fruit of great power that can essentially make a person a king. Likewise, another character, Mitsuzane Kureshima, also has traits of a kingmaker, hanging around with and manipulating events so as to put the ruler in his favor.
* Harry Leong, the ultra-rich, secretive billionaire from &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;, is revealed to be one of the kingmakers in the government of Singapore.
* One of the villains in the NBC TV series &quot;The Blacklist&quot; went under the alias &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;.
* Uhtred of Bebbanburg, from Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot; and the Netflix adaptation &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, was considered a kingmaker during the succession of King Edward of Wessex after the death of Alfred the Great.
* In the TV series &quot;Porus&quot;, Porus&#x27; uncle, Shiv Dutt, acts as a kingmaker, deposing a king and installing another king in his place.

<text>Chris Hani (28 June 194210 April 1993; born Martin Thembisile Hani ) was a South African military commander, politician and revolutionary who served as the leader of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). He was a fierce opponent of the apartheid government, and was assassinated by Janusz Waluś, a Polish immigrant and sympathiser of the Conservative opposition on 10 April 1993, during the unrest preceding the transition to democracy.

==Early life==
Martin Thembisile Hani was born on 28 June 1942 in the Xhosa village in Cofimvaba, Transkei. His father Gilbert Hani was a mine union worker and political activist who left the country to go into exile in 1962 and returned to South Africa in 1991. His mother Mary Hani was a simple person who had never attended school. He was the fifth of six children. He attended Lovedale school in 1957, to finish his last two years. He twice finished two school grades in a single year. When Hani was 12 years old, after hearing his father&#x27;s explanations about apartheid and the African National Congress (ANC), he wished to join the ANC but was still too young to be accepted. In Lovedale school, Hani joined the ANC Youth League when he was 15 years old, even though political activities were not allowed at black schools under apartheid. He influenced other students to join the ANC.

In 1959, at the University of Fort Hare in Alice, Eastern Cape, Hani studied English, Latin and modern and classical literature. He did not participate in any sport, saying: &quot;I would rather fight apartheid than play sport.&quot; Hani, in an interview on the Wankie campaign, mentioned that he was a Rhodes University graduate.

==Political and military career==
At the age of 15, he joined the ANC Youth League. As a student, he was active in protests against the Bantu Education Act. He worked as a clerk for a law firm. Following his graduation, he joined Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. Following his arrest under the Suppression of Communism Act, he went into exile in Lesotho in 1963. Because of Hani&#x27;s involvement with Umkhonto we Sizwe, he was forced into hiding by the South African government and changed his first name to Chris.

He received military training in the Soviet Union and served in campaigns in the Zimbabwean War of Liberation, also called the Rhodesian Bush War. They were joint operations between Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army in the late 1960s. The Luthuli Detachment operation consolidated Hani&#x27;s reputation as a soldier in the black army that took the field against apartheid and its allies. His role as a fighter from the earliest days of MK&#x27;s exile (following the arrest of Nelson Mandela and the other internal MK leaders at Rivonia) was an important part in the fierce loyalty that Hani later enjoyed in some quarters as MK&#x27;s Deputy Commander (Joe Modise was overall commander). In 1969, Hani co-signed, with six others, the &quot;Hani Memorandum&quot;, which was strongly critical of the leadership of Joe Modise, Moses Kotane and other comrades in the leadership.

In Lesotho, Hani organised guerrilla operations of the MK in South Africa. By 1982, he had become prominent enough to have become the target of assassination attempts, and he eventually moved to the ANC&#x27;s headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia. As head of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he was responsible for the suppression of a mutiny by dissident anti-Communist ANC members in detention camps, but denied any role in abuses including torture and murder. Many MK female operatives, such as Dipuo Mvelase, adored Chris Hani for having protected women&#x27;s rights and caring about their wellbeing at military camps.

Having spent time as a clandestine organiser in South Africa in the mid-1970s, he permanently returned to South Africa following the unbanning of the ANC in 1990, and took over from Joe Slovo as head of the South African Communist Party (SACP) on 8 December 1991. He supported the suspension of the ANC&#x27;s armed struggle in favour of negotiations.

==Assassination==

Chris Hani was assassinated on 10 April 1993 outside his home in Dawn Park, a racially mixed suburb of Boksburg. He was accosted by a Polish far-right anti-communist immigrant named Janusz Waluś, who shot him as he stepped out of his car. Waluś fled the scene but was soon arrested after Margareta Harmse, a white Afrikaner housewife, saw Waluś straight after the crime as she was driving past, and called the police. A neighbour of Hani also witnessed the crime and later identified both Waluś, and the vehicle he was driving at the time. Clive Derby-Lewis, a senior South African Conservative Party MP and Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs at the time, who had lent Waluś his pistol, was also arrested for complicity in Hani&#x27;s murder. The Conservative Party of South Africa had broken away from the ruling National Party out of opposition to the reforms of P. W. Botha. After the elections of 1989, it was the second-strongest party in the House of Assembly, after the National Party, and opposed F. W. de Klerk&#x27;s dismantling of apartheid.

Historically, the assassination is seen as a turning point. Serious tensions followed the assassination, with fears that the country would erupt in violence. Nelson Mandela addressed the nation appealing for calm, in a speech regarded as presidential even though he was not yet president of the country:

While riots followed the assassination, both sides of the negotiation process were galvanised into action, and they soon agreed that the democratic elections should take place on 27 April 1994, just over a year after Hani&#x27;s assassination.

===Assassins&#x27; conviction and amnesty hearing===
In October 1993, both Janusz Waluś and Clive Derby-Lewis were convicted for the murder and sentenced to death. Derby-Lewis&#x27;s wife, Gaye, was acquitted. Both men&#x27;s sentences were commuted to life imprisonment when the death penalty was abolished as a result of a Constitutional Court ruling in 1995.

Hani&#x27;s killers appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, claiming political motivation for their crimes and applying for amnesty on the basis that they had acted on the orders of the Conservative Party. The Hani family was represented by the anti-apartheid lawyer George Bizos. Their applications were denied when the TRC ruled that they had not acted under orders. Following several failed attempts, Derby-Lewis was granted medical parole in May 2015 after he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer; he died 18 months later, on 3 November 2016.

On 10 March 2016, the North Gauteng High Court ordered Waluś to be released on parole under bail conditions. The Department of Justice and Correctional Services lodged an appeal against the parole decision to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. The Department of Home Affairs has indicated that Waluś may have his South African citizenship revoked. On 18 August 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein overturned Waluś&#x27;s parole, a decision that was welcomed by the SACP. By October 2019, Waluś was still in prison, despite his lawyer&#x27;s claim that he is completely rehabilitated. On 16 March 2020, Waluś was again denied parole by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. On 7 December 2022, Waluś was granted parole under strict conditions by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. In 2024, the government announced that Waluś was to be deported to Poland on 6 December with the Polish government paying for the proceedings.

===Absence of conspiracy===
Hani&#x27;s assassination has attracted numerous conspiracy theories about outside involvement. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it &quot;was unable to find evidence that the two murderers convicted of the killing of Chris Hani took orders from international groups, security forces or from higher up in the right-wing echelons&quot;.

==Influence==
Hani was a charismatic leader, with significant support among the radical anti-apartheid youth. At the time of his death, he was the most popular ANC leader after his senior, Nelson Mandela. Following the legalisation of the ANC, His support for the negotiation process with the apartheid government was critical in keeping the militants in line.

==Honours==

In 1993, French philosopher Jacques Derrida dedicated &quot;Spectres de Marx&quot; (1993) to Hani.

In 1997, Baragwanath Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the world, was renamed the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in his memory. In September 2004, Hani was voted 20th in the controversial Top 100 Greatest South Africans poll.

Days after his assassination, the rock group Dave Matthews Band (whose lead singer and guitarist, Dave Matthews, is from South Africa) began playing what would become &quot;#36&quot;, with lyrics and chorus referring to Hani&#x27;s shooting.

A short opera, &quot;Hani&quot;, by composer Bongani Ndodana-Breen with libretto by film producer Mfundi Vundla, was commissioned by Cape Town Opera and the University of Cape Town, premiering at the Baxter Theatre on 21 November 2010.

A District Municipality in the Eastern Cape was named the Chris Hani District Municipality. This district includes Queenstown, Cofimvaba and Lady Frere. The Thembisile Hani Local Municipality in Mpumalanga also bears his name.

In 2009, after extension of Cape Town&#x27;s Central Line, the new terminus serving eastern areas of Khayelitsha was christened Chris Hani.

<text>Coonabarabran ()
is a town in Warrumbungle Shire that sits on the divide between the Central West and North West Slopes regions of New South Wales, Australia. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 2,387, and as of 2021, the population of Coonabarabran and its surrounding area is 3,477. Local and district residents refer to the town as &#x27;Coona&#x27;. Coonabarabran is the gateway to the Warrumbungle National Park, Siding Spring Observatory and the Pilliga Forest.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Coonabarabran&quot; is unconfirmed. It may derive from a person&#x27;s name or from the Kamilaroi language word &quot;&#x27;gunbaraaybaa&quot;&#x27; meaning &#x27;excrement&#x27;, translated earlier as meaning, &#x27;peculiar odour&#x27;, this is possibly a bowdlerisation.

Another possible meaning is derived from the Wiradjuri word for an inquisitive person, ‘&quot;gunabaraburan&quot;’. &#x27;Coolabarabran&#x27; was the name of a station owned by James Weston in 1848.

==History==
The area around Coonabarabran and the Warrumbungles has been occupied by the Kamilaroi people for approximately 7,500 years. In 1818, the area was opened up for European settlement, when the surveyor-general for the Colony of New South Wales, John Oxley, made an expedition through the north-west areas of the colony. Oxley surveyed the area around the Warrumbungles mountain range, which he named the &quot;Arbuthnot Range&quot;.

The former convict, James Weston (1800–1883), who was assigned to the Cassilis area in the Upper Hunter Region before being granted his freedom in 1843, acquired the agricultural area known as &quot;Coolabarbyan&quot; in the district in 1843. Weston was among the first permanent settlers in the district, cultivating 20 acres of wheat and constructing a water-powered mill to make flour from his crops on the southern bank of the Castlereagh River (now Neilson Park), being appointed postmaster in 1849, and establishing the first inn, the &quot;Castlereagh Inn&quot; in the early 1850s. In 1859, the town was first surveyed by Lewis Gordon, with the first sale of land recorded in 1859. European settlement continued to grow from the 1860s, as the wheat industry moved from coastal areas to further inland, encouraged by the Robertson Land Acts. A Police watch house was completed in 1857, and the first Court House was completed in 1861. The Village of Coonabarabran was gazetted on 2 May 1860. In 1870, the Public School was opened. After construction of a new stone courthouse in 1878 the original courthouse was demolished and a post and telegraph office constructed on its site in 1879.

The Coonabarabran Shire was proclaimed on 7 March 1906, with the enactment of the &quot;Local Government (Shires) Act 1905&quot;. With incorporation, the town continued to grow with the construction of the railway line through Binnaway to Coonabarabran in 1917 (extended to Baradine and Gwabegar in 1923) and the establishment of the Forestry Commission in 1916, both of which facilitated the growth of agriculture and forestry as the primary industries of the region.

In 1926–1928, a local committee organised the development of the town memorial to the First World War in the form of the Coonabarabran Memorial Clock Tower at the central town intersection of John Street and Dalgarno Street. Built from local sandstone by Edmund Pye of Gunnedah at a cost of £1,300, the clock tower was officially dedicated on 23 August 1928 by Major General Charles Frederick Cox.

<doc id="593468" wikidata="Q555195" url="?curid=593468" title="Héctor Lavoe">
<text>Héctor Juan Pérez Martínez (September 30, 1946 – June 29, 1993), better known as Héctor Lavoe, was a Puerto Rican salsa singer. Lavoe is considered to be possibly the best and most important singer and interpreter in the history of salsa music because he helped to establish the popularity of this musical genre in the decades of 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. His personality, style and the qualities of his voice led him to a successful artistic career in the whole field of Latin music and salsa during the 1970s and 1980s. The cleanness and brightness of his voice, coupled with impeccable diction and the ability to sing long and fast phrases with total naturalness, made him one of the favorite singers of the Latin public.

Lavoe was born and raised in the Machuelo Abajo barrio of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Early in his life, he attended Escuela Libre de Música de Ponce, known today as the Instituto de Música Juan Morel Campos and, inspired by Jesús Sánchez Erazo, developed an interest in music. He moved to New York City on May 3, 1963, at the age of sixteen. Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet formed by Roberto García. During this period, he performed with several other groups, including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and Johnny Pacheco&#x27;s band.

In 1967, Lavoe joined Willie Colón&#x27;s band as its vocalist, recording several hit songs, including &quot;El Malo&quot; and &quot;Canto a Borinquen.&quot; Lavoe moved on to become a soloist and formed his own band performing as lead vocalist. As a soloist, Lavoe recorded several hits including: &quot;El cantante&quot; composed by Rubén Blades, &quot;Bandolera&quot; composed by Colón, and &quot;Periódico de ayer&quot;, composed by Tite Curet Alonso. During this period he was frequently featured as a guest singer with the Fania All Stars recording numerous tracks with the band.

In 1979, Lavoe became deeply depressed and sought the help of a high priest of the Santería faith to treat his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, he relapsed following the deaths of his father, son, and mother-in-law. These events, along with being diagnosed with HIV from intravenous drug use, drove Lavoe to attempt suicide by jumping off the 9th floor of a Condado hotel room balcony in San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 26, 1988. He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on June 29, 1993, from a complication of AIDS.

==Early life==
Héctor was born on September 30, 1946 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Francisca (Pachita) Martínez and Luis Pérez, and raised in the Machuelo Abajo barrio of the city. He was inspired early in life by his musically talented family. His grandfather, Don Juan Martínez, was a singer of controversial songs, which led to physical confrontations. His uncle was well known in Ponce as a tres player. His mother Francisca, also known as Pachita, was well known by her family and townspeople for her beautiful singing voice. His father, Luis, supported his wife and eight children by singing and playing guitar with trios and big bands. He was in high demand as a guitarist for the Fiestas de Cruz celebrations and other popular religious ceremonies, and he wanted his son to receive formal musical training as a trombonist; Héctor dreamt of being a singer. Héctor was influenced by Puerto Rican singers such as Jesús Sánchez Erazo, also known as &quot;Chuíto el de Bayamón&quot; - one of the island&#x27;s most successful folk singers, and Daniel Santos. Later in his life, he would record songs with both artists.

Héctor attended the local Juan Morel Campos Public School of Music where the first instrument he learned to play was the saxophone. His classmates included José Febles and multi-instrumentalist Papo Lucca. One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt Héctor would become a superstar as a bolero singer. From the start Héctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with impeccable diction, demanded attention. Well on his way to becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto García and José Febles. At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band. He moved permanently to New York on May 3, 1963, against his father&#x27;s wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose. It would take many years before Héctor was able to reconcile with his father.

==Arrival in New York City==
Upon arriving in New York he was met by his sister Priscilla. The first thing that he did was to visit El Barrio, New York&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Harlem.&quot; Héctor was disappointed by the condition of El Barrio which he had envisioned would have &quot;fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers, and tree-lined streets.&quot; Héctor tried to earn a living as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge.

One day he reconnected with his friend Roberto García. They began to frequent Latin music and dance clubs in the Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Lower Manhattan. In 1965, Héctor met Russell Cohen, who fronted the New Yorkers - the band Héctor would first record with - the album &quot;Está de bala.&quot; Héctor was invited by his friend Roberto García, a fellow musician and childhood friend, to a rehearsal of a newly formed sextet. When he arrived, they were rehearsing the romantic bolero &quot;Tus Ojos&quot;. The lead vocalist was singing off key, and as a goodwill gesture, Lavoe demonstrated how it was supposed to sound. As a result of this selfless act, the group offered him the job of lead vocalist, which he subsequently accepted.

Later in his career he joined other salsa groups including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and Johnny Pacheco&#x27;s FANIA . To distinguish Héctor from other Latino singers, a former manager made him adopt Felipe Rodríguez&#x27;s moniker &quot;La Voz&quot; (&quot;The Voice&quot;) and turned it into a stage name, Lavoe.

In 1967, he met salsa musician and bandleader Willie Colón. Johnny Pacheco, owner of Fania Records, and as its recording musical director, suggested that Colón record with Lavoe on a track on Colón&#x27;s first album &quot;El Malo&quot;. Given the good results, Colón had Lavoe record the rest of the album&#x27;s vocal tracks. Willie never officially asked Lavoe to join his band, but after the recording, said to him: &quot;On Saturday we start at 10 p.m. at El Tropicoro Club.&quot;

The album&#x27;s success significantly transformed both Colón&#x27;s and Lavoe&#x27;s lives. Colón&#x27;s band featured a raw, aggressive, all-trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, and sense of humor. The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries. Héctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle. According to Lavoe, it happened so fast he did not know how to cope with his sudden success. With the sudden fame came love and lust and experimentation with marijuana, heroin, and cocaine.

During that year, Lavoe started a romantic relationship with Carmen Castro. She became pregnant but refused to marry him because she considered him a &quot;womanizer.&quot; Lavoe&#x27;s first son, José Alberto Pérez, was born on October 30, 1968. On the night José was baptized, Héctor received a call informing him that Nilda &quot;Puchi&quot; Román, with whom he also had a relationship during the same period he was with Castro, was pregnant. Héctor&#x27;s second son, Héctor Pérez Jr. was born on September 25, 1969. Following the birth the couple married, and at Román&#x27;s request, Lavoe had only minimum contact with Castro and José Alberto during their marriage.

==Music==

===The Willie Colón years===
Willie Colón and Lavoe made fourteen albums together. In late 1970, Colón and Lavoe recorded the first of two &quot;Asalto Navideño&quot; albums, featuring Puerto Rican folk songs such as Ramito&#x27;s jíbaro song &quot;Patria y Amor&quot;, renamed &quot;Canto a Borinquen&quot;, and original compositions.

Lavoe&#x27;s lack of professionalism was often balanced by an affable onstage presence, very much resembling that of a stand-up comedian. One famous incident involved a middle-aged audience member at a dance who requested a Puerto Rican Man danza from Colón&#x27;s band; Lavoe responded with an insult. The requester then gave Lavoe such a beating that he almost ended up in the hospital. The request was finally honored on a later Colón record, &quot;El Juicio&quot; (The Trial), when he added a danza section to the Rafael Muñoz song &quot;Soñando despierto&quot;, which Lavoe introduces with a deadpanned: &quot;¡Para ti, motherflower!&quot; - a euphemism for: &quot;This one&#x27;s for you, motherfucker!&quot;

The Colón band had other major hits, such as &quot;Calle Luna, Calle Sol&quot;, and the Santería-influenced &quot;Aguanile&quot;, a Pacheco song recorded in the studio by the band. &quot;Mi Gente&quot;, was better known for a live version Lavoe recorded later with the Fania All Stars.

===Lavoe goes solo===

In 1973, Willie Colón stopped touring to focus on record production and other business enterprises. Lavoe was given the opportunity to become the bandleader of his own orchestra. He and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer with the Fania All-Stars for several shows. One of the group&#x27;s notable performances took place in the Kinshasa province of the Zaire (modern day Democratic Republic of Congo) where the group performed as part of the activities promoting The Rumble in the Jungle, a boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman for the heavyweight championships of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association.

The Fania All Stars recorded several of their tracks during live concerts. Lavoe was part of the group when the All-Stars returned to Yankee Stadium in 1975, where the band recorded a two volume production entitled &quot;Live at Yankee Stadium&quot;. The event featured the top vocalists of Fania and Vaya records. Lavoe was included in the group along with: Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano, Justo Betancourt, Ismael Quintana, Bobby Cruz, Pete &quot;El Conde&quot; Rodriguez, Santos Colón, and Celia Cruz. Lavoe recorded songs with the band in fifteen different productions, serving as vocalist on twenty-three songs. Besides recording songs with the band, Lavoe was also present in three movies filmed and produced by Fania Records; these were: &quot;Fania All Stars: Our Latin Thing&quot;, &quot;Fania All Stars: Salsa,&quot; and &quot;Celia Cruz with the Fania All Stars: Live in Africa&quot;. His Colón-produced albums would be best sellers; cuts from these albums were hits in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America:
* Lavoe&#x27;s recording of Tite Curet Alonso&#x27;s &quot;El Periódico de Ayer&quot; was a number one hit on Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a strong hit in several Caribbean countries and South America.
* As a producer, Willie Colón had Lavoe record what would become his signature song, the Ruben Blades-authored song &quot;El Cantante&quot; against Blades&#x27; protests (Blades wanted to record the song on his own.). Blades has repeatedly acknowledged since then that Lavoe raised his song to classic status and that Lavoe&#x27;s performance was much better than what he would accomplish with it.
* In 1975 on his “La Voz” Album, Lavoe did a cover Chappottin Y Sus Estrellas’s 1957 song “Rompe Saragüey”, which became a major success.
* The Lavoe song &quot;Bandolera&quot; was a strong seller in Puerto Rico, despite vigorous protests from Puerto Rican feminists about its lyrics and soneos - Lavoe twice offers the song&#x27;s subject a beating.
* Lavoe&#x27;s recording of the classic Cuban song by Eliseo Grenet based on Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén&#x27;s poem &quot;Sóngoro Cosongo&quot;, set to salsa music, was another major hit.
* The controversial jíbaro song, &quot;Joven Contra Viejo&quot;, featured Lavoe and Daniel Santos settling their age-based differences on stage not without a heavy dose of humor and, yet again, Yomo Toro&#x27;s cuatro music as a backdrop. Another major Christmas hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; Greatest Hits for Tropical genre in 1979 includes a song from singer/composer Miguel Poventud &quot;Una Pena En La Navidad&quot; from the same album titled &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;.
* Lavoe&#x27;s final hit, &quot;El Rey de la Puntualidad&quot; (The King of Punctuality), is a humorous takeoff on Lavoe&#x27;s constant tardiness and occasional absenteeism from shows. Lavoe followed the Santeria priest&#x27;s advice and cut all communication with his family and friends for a period of two months. Following this recording Héctor, reappeared confident and apparently free of his drug addiction.

==Last years and death==

Following his rehabilitation, Lavoe&#x27;s life was plagued by tragic events, emotional turmoil, and pain. In 1987, his seventeen-year-old son Héctor Jr. was accidentally shot and killed by a friend. In the same period, his apartment in Rego Park, Queens, was destroyed in a fire. One year later, Héctor was scheduled to perform at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum in Bayamón, Puerto Rico on the night of Saturday, June 25, 1988. Sales for the concert were poor, and promoter Rick Sostre decided to cancel the concert two hours before concert time. Héctor, defiant to the end, and knowing that it would be one of the last times he would perform in Puerto Rico, decided, against the promoter&#x27;s wishes, to perform for the public who had paid to see the concert. The next day, Sunday, June 26, 1988, Héctor attempted suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the Regency Hotel Condado in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He survived the attempt, but from that day forward, would never completely recover.

In 1990, Héctor gave his last large, public performance with the Fania All Stars at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. It was meant to be his comeback concert, but Héctor could not even sing a few notes of his famous song &quot;Mi Gente&quot;. It is believed his final public performance was a brief appearance at the club S.O.B.&#x27;s in New York City, in April 1992.
On 29 June 1993, Héctor died at Saint Clare&#x27;s Hospital (Manhattan) from a complication from AIDS. He was 46. He was initially buried in Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx. In June 2002, the remains of Lavoe and his son were exhumed at his family&#x27;s request and reburied in his native Ponce, along with his widow Nilda who had died a few weeks before. His remains are at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery), in that city&#x27;s Portugués Urbano neighborhood.

==Recognition==

Lavoe&#x27;s life has inspired two biographical films. The first, &quot;El Cantante&quot;, was produced by salsa artist Marc Anthony, who played Lavoe, and Jennifer Lopez as Hector&#x27;s wife, Nilda (known as &quot;Puchi&quot; by close friends). Salsa singer La India also began production of her own biopic of Lavoe&#x27;s life entitled &quot;The Singer&quot;, with actor and singer Raulito Carbonell in the lead role. Production was suspended in August 2008 after the director, Anthony Felton, reported that it was over budget. Carbonell noted that he would reconsider his involvement if production were to resume. The movie was eventually completed, in 2011, as &quot;Lavoe: The Untold Story&quot;.

An Off-Broadway production based on Lavoe&#x27;s life titled &quot;¿Quién mató a Héctor Lavoe?&quot; (&quot;Who Killed Hector Lavoe?&quot;) was a success in the late 1990s. It starred singer Domingo Quiñones in the lead role. Carbonell&#x27;s decision to distance himself from the film directed by Felton was the direct result of his involvement in a tour of &quot;Quien Mato a Héctor Lavoe?&quot; in Puerto Rico, and, depending upon negotiations, possibly Peru and Colombia. An urban tribute album was released in late 2007 performed by several reggaeton artists such as Don Omar which sampled Lavoe&#x27;s voice.

In Ponce, he is recognized at the Park for the Illustrious Ponce Citizens. Lavoe was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2000.

La Guancha Recreational and Cultural Complex in his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico, honored Hector with a statue. The $60,000 statue is 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) tall, weighs 1 ton and portrays Lavoe with a microphone in his right hand and a pair of maracas in his left.

Tremont Avenue in the New York City&#x27;s Borough of The Bronx was renamed in his honor, and remembrance.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Lavoe at number 73 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Warren is a town in the Orana Region of New South Wales, Australia. It is located off the Mitchell Highway, 120 kilometres north west of Dubbo, and is the seat of the Warren Shire local government area. At the , Warren had a population of 1,365.
Warren is included in the Central West Slopes and Plains division of the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts.


== History ==
Before European settlement the area is said to have been occupied by the Ngiyambaa Aborigines. Explorer John Oxley camped on the present town site during his investigation of the Macquarie River in 1818. He noted an abundance of kangaroos and emus. Charles Sturt carried out further exploration in 1828–29. Cattle were grazing hereabouts by the late 1830s.

Warren station was established in 1845 by Thomas Readford and William Lawson, the son of explorer William Lawson who was a member of the first European party to breach the Blue Mountains in 1813. Some say the name derives from a local Aboriginal word, meaning &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot;. Another theory is that it represents the adoption of a contemporary English term, &quot;warren&quot;, meaning a game park - perhaps a reference to the picturesque riverside setting where the station hut was built (on what is now Macquarie Park) and to the large numbers of wildlife in the area.

A small police station was built near the hut to protect the new settlers from Aborigines but there being no disturbances the police soon moved on. The hut was located by the site of a river-crossing on the main route from Dubbo. Stockmen camped here in the bend by the river, adjacent to the Warren Hole (a natural and permanent waterhole), before crossing over on the gravel bar when the water was sufficiently low. A few stayed on and a site for a township was consequently surveyed in 1860 with land sales proceeding in 1861.

A post office opened in 1861, a bootmaker&#x27;s shop (made of bark) in 1863, a store in 1866, a school in 1867, an Anglican church in 1873, the first courthouse in 1874 and the first bridge in 1875. However, the closer settlement did not really develop until the late 1880s.

Warren was incorporated as a municipality in 1895 and the Warren Weir was established in 1896. The town benefited greatly with the arrival of the railway in 1898, making it the railhead for an enormous area. In general terms, its prosperity rose and fell with the price of wool. In the 1920s the town developed quite substantially. In the Great Depression the economy shrank, expanding again in the postwar years. The eternal water shortage was greatly eased when Burrendong Dam was opened in 1967, allowing the development of cotton and produce.

== Economy ==
Warren is one of the main centres for the wool and cotton growing industries in New South Wales. It is a well-known area for merino breeding with local studs that include Haddon Rig and Egelabra.

==Population==

According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 1,365 people in Warren.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 21.2% of the population. 
* 76.8% of people were born in Australia and 81.8% of people spoke only English at home
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 27%, Catholic 25.3% and No Religion 19%.

== Geography ==
The Macquarie River runs through Warren.

=== Climate ===
Warren experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Cfak&quot;), with hot summers and cool winters.
== Media ==
Warren is serviced by a weekly local newspaper, &quot;The Warren Star&quot;.

== Sport and recreation ==

<text>The Macquarie River or Wambuul is part of the Macquarie–Barwon catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is one of the main inland rivers in New South Wales, Australia.

The river rises in the central highlands of New South Wales near the town of Oberon and travels generally northwest past the towns of Bathurst, Wellington, Dubbo, Narromine, and Warren to the Macquarie Marshes. The Macquarie Marshes then drain into the Darling River via the lower Barwon River.

Lake Burrendong is a large reservoir with capacity of located near Wellington which impounds the waters of the Wambuul Macquarie River and its tributaries the Cudgegong River and the Turon River for flood control and irrigation.

==Name==
The Wiradjuri are the people of the three rivers, Wambuul, Kalare (Lachlan) and the Murrumbidjeri (Murrumbidgee). Wambuul means winding river, and included the tributary Fish River. It has also been spelt Wambool.

The river was first documented for the British crown near Bathurst by European explorer, George Evans in 1812, who named the river in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel Lachlan Macquarie, who served as Governor of the Colony of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821.

In December 2021, &quot;Wambuul&quot; was recognised as an official dual name by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales after support from a local movement and the Bathurst Local Aboriginal Land Council. Either or both names may be used and both are given equal status.

==Geography==
From its origin the Wambuul Macquarie River flows for and drops around over its length. Lake Burrendong at is the only dam along the length of the river. Windamere dam, on the Cudgegong River, is operated in conjunction with Burrendong.

===Sources===
The Macquarie River starts below the locality of White Rock near Bathurst at an elevation of . It is a combination of two water systems which are the overflow from Chifley Dam which is fed by the Campbells River, and the Fish River which flows into and out of the Oberon Dam.

===Tributaries===
A number of rivers and creeks flow into the Wambuul Macquarie River, with descending elevation as follows:
===Communities and bridge crossings along the river===


==Catchment==
The Macquarie system covers an area of more than . Over 72% of land is flat, with an additional 17% undulating to hilly. The remainder is steep to mountainous, rising progressively to elevations above . To the east the boundary is formed by the Great Dividing Range. This boundary extends from near Oberon in the south to Coolah in the north. A well defined ridge extends north-west from the Great Dividing Range for around , then the boundary turns north.

From Bathurst, near the formation of the river, it passes through the following geographic areas:
* Bathurst Plains, undulating country of elevation surrounded by high tablelands on all sides. This includes an extensive floodplain around Bathurst
*past Hill End Plateau, where it is joined from the east by the Turon River, the river drains a plateau extending from near Portland to Sofala. The elevation is around in the south and in the north. This area is predominantly rugged slopes.
*Burrendong Dam, the Macquarie River is joined from the east by the Cudgegong River, which rises in the hills around Rylstone with a general elevation around 
*through Wellington and Dubbo where the river is joined by the Bell and Little Rivers. The Bell River rises in flat to undulating country of the Orange plateau, which has a general elevation of with the highest point being the extinct volcanic peak of Mount Canobolas at roughly . Between Wellington and Dubbo extensive flat areas are evident.
*north of Dubbo, the Talbragar River joins the Macquarie. The Talbragar is the most important downstream tributary. This river rises in mountainous country at the junction of the Great Dividing Range and the Liverpool Range. The country through which the Talbragar River runs is broad and flat, bordered by undulating hills that disperse as the river nears Dubbo.
*north of Dubbo, the river passes through flat plains flowing north-west through Narromine and Warren. A complex series of effluent creeks connect the Macquarie, Darling and Bogan Rivers.
*Macquarie Marshes lie at the end of the river channel proper. Near Carinda, the Macquarie is joined by Marthaguy Creek which drains an area and carries spill-over water from the Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers during floods.

===Rainfall===
Rainfall varies across the catchment of the Macquarie River. Generally the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges. The Great Dividing Range area receives between and annual median rainfall. This is distributed relatively uniformly throughout the year. Where breaks in the Dividing Range allow the intrusion of moist easterly air streams inland, annual median rainfall of or more is experienced further westward. Further north-west in the Castlereagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is to .

Rainfall can vary dramatically over several years. For example, records show a variation from &gt;200% to &lt;50% of the average annual figure. Evaporation varies from less than south-east of Bathurst up to more than at Bourke.

==Statistics==
==History==
===Aboriginal history===
The Wiradjuri people are the original inhabitants of the area that includes the Macquarie River catchment. The Wiradjuri knew the river as the Wambool, which means &quot;winding river&quot;. The noted Wiradjuri warrior Windradyne came from the upper Macquarie River region, and was fatally wounded from a gun shot after a man hunt was commissioned by the crown in 1829. Near Carinda, between the Macquarie River and Marra Creek, the oldest evidence of bread making in the world (approximately 30,000 years old) was found at an ancient lake known as Cuddie Springs.

===European history===
The upper reaches of the Macquarie River were first seen by Europeans in 1813 and the river was named in honour of the then Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Major-General) Lachlan Macquarie. In 1813 Deputy Surveyor of Lands and explorer, George Evans wrote in his journal:
30 November 1813: I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off; and on 9 December 1813: I have called the Main Stream &quot;Macquarie River&quot;.

Two years later Governor Macquarie inspected the country surrounding Bathurst and the Macquarie River and wrote on 10 June 1815, on his return to Government House in Sydney: 
At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich tract of campaign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course through the plains, which can be easily traced from the high lands adjoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its bank, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clear surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude, which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by nature for the occupancy and comfort of man, create a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. 

During 1817 and 1818, explorer John Oxley was commissioned to explore the course of the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers respectively. Writing in his journal, published in 1820, Oxley described the junction of the two rivers:
The river in Wellington Valley had been swelled by the late rains, insomuch that the water below its junction with the Macquarie was quite discoloured. From the fineness of the soil, the rain had made the ground very soft, rendering it difficult for the horses to travel... Our day&#x27;s journey lay generally over an open forest country, with rich flats on either side of the river ... The river had many fine reaches, extending in straight lines from one to three miles, and of a corresponding breadth. The rapids, although frequent, offered no material obstruction to the boats. The current in the long reaches was scarcely perceptible ... The river expanded into beautiful reaches, having great depth of water, and from two to three hundred feet broad, literally covered with water-fowl of different kinds: the richest flats bordered the river, apparently more extensive on the south side. The vast body of water which this river must contain in times of flood is confined within exterior banks, and its inundations are thus deprived of mischief... The trees were of the eucalyptus (apple tree), and on the hills a few of the &quot;callitris macrocarpa&quot; [Note: &quot;Callitr. Vent decad.&quot;] were seen... The main bed of the river was much contracted, but very deep, the waters spreading to the depth of a foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all running on the same point of bearing. After going about twenty miles, we lost the land and trees: the channel of the river, which lay through reeds, and was from one to three feet deep, ran northerly. This continued for three or four miles farther, when although there had been no previous change in the breadth, depth, and rapidity of the stream for several miles, and I was sanguine in my expectations of soon entering the long sought for Australian sea, it all at once eluded our farther pursuit by spreading on every point from north-west to north-east, among the ocean of reeds which surrounded us, still running with the same rapidity as before. There, was no channel whatever among those reeds, and the depth varied from three to five feet. This astonishing change (for I cannot call it a termination of the river), of course left me no alternative but to endeavour to return to some spot, on which we could effect a landing before dark... To assert positively that we were on the margin of the lake or sea into which this great body of water is discharged, might reasonably be deemed a conclusion which has nothing but conjecture for its basis; but if an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually filling up by immense depositions from the higher lands, left by the waters which flow into it. It is most singular, that the high-lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea-coast, or not to extend to any great distance from it.

By 1828, explorer Charles Sturt was commissioned to ascertain &quot;the limits of the Colony&quot; by following the Macquarie River &quot;for the express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of that basin into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether any connection existed between it and the streams falling westerly&quot;. Navigating the marshes (later named in honour of Lachlan Macquarie), Sturt was the first European to visit the Darling River, named in honour of General Ralph Darling.

==Water management==
===Irrigation===
The Macquarie River catchment is a regulated Water Management Area and includes private irrigation as well as several public irrigation schemes located at Narromine – Trangie, Buddah Lakes, Tenandra, Trangie – Nevertire, Nevertire, and Marthaguy.

===The River is classified as over-subscribed===

===Flooding===
The Macquarie River has a history of flooding. Some significant events are listed below. After major floods, water can flow past the Macquarie Marshes and into the Barwon-Darling river system upstream of Brewarrina.
*1867devastating floods wash away the first Denison Bridge at Bathurst and also debris damages Ranken&#x27;s Bridge
*1955serious flooding of Macquarie River amongst other river systems
*1979 heavy flooding of the low lying sections along the river
*1986severe localised flooding in Bathurst
*1990severe localised flooding in Bathurst
*1998there was a large flood that affected the farming of cotton and vegetables. Bathurst was severely affected
*2010November/December saw major flooding of the lower Macquarie River following heavy rainfall events throughout Eastern Australia
*2016August/September saw moderate to major flooding along the entire river.

==Recreation==
Recreational activities are popular along the length of the river particularly in the communities it passes by.

*FishingThe following species of fresh water fish can be caught: brown trout, carp, eel-tailed catfish, golden perch, murray cod, rainbow trout, redfin, silver perch, trout cod and yabbies.
*Lake Burrendonga large dam very popular with water sports enthusiasts activities include skiing, jet skis, sailing, and general boating.
*Parksin Bathurst along the bank of the river is Bi-Centennial Park. This park is used for recreation purposes, picnics, events, bicycle riding, etc. In Warren, Macquarie Park, off Burton St, has English-style formal gardens and a monument in honour of Oxley and Sturt who traced the course of the Macquarie River. Oxley camped near Warren in 1818 and is further commemorated in the naming of Oxley Park on the other side of the river. Sturt passed by just to the north-east in 1828 and the bridge over the river is named after him. Hundreds of galahs roost in the red gums at sunset. The adjacent Red River Gum Walk follows the riverbank around to a 500-year-old river gum adjacent the Warren Hole, a natural and permanent waterhole once used for swimming and fishing.

<doc id="593481" wikidata="Q918193" url="?curid=593481" title="Catalepsy">
<text>Catalepsy (from Ancient Greek , , &quot;seizing, grasping&quot;) is a neurological condition characterized by muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to pain.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include a rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved (waxy flexibility), no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing.

==Causes==

Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and epilepsy. It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal, as well as one of the features of catatonia. It can be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics, such as haloperidol, and by the anesthetic ketamine. Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior. Unsuggested waxy catalepsy, sometimes accompanied by spontaneous anesthesia, is seen as an indicator of hypnotic trance. Suggested or induced rigid catalepsy, of extended limbs or even the entire body, sometimes tested with heavy weights, has been a staple of stage hypnosis shows and even academic demonstrations of hypnotism since the late 18th century, as proof of extraordinary physical abilities possible in trance states. Such demonstrations have also been performed by Asian martial artists and attributed to the pneumatic vital energy known as &quot;qi&quot;.

==Historical cases==
Armand D&#x27;Angour suggests that reports (such as that recounted in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;) of Socrates, in about 429 BC, standing perfectly still for hours on end during the Athenian campaign against Potidaea while seemingly deep in thought, are &quot;too extreme to be considered wholly a matter of rational choice,&quot; and that &quot;it is reasonable to suppose that it was the symptom of an underlying physiological or psychological condition&quot;, such as catalepsy.

St. Teresa of Avila experienced a prolonged bout of catalepsy that began in 1539. This episode was precipitated by the stress she experienced at the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation. Her legs became rigid, leaving her an invalid for three years. Teresa endured intermittent attacks of catalepsy from then on.

Rufina Cambaceres, an Argentine socialite, is well known in Buenos Aires for her tragic death in 1902. The 19 year-old girl experienced a bout of catalepsy on the day of her birthday, May 31, 1902. The night of her burial in the family mausoleum, the caretaker of La Recoleta Cemetery heard noises coming from her vault. He found the coffin was not in the right position, with scratch marks on the inside of the lid and the girl&#x27;s face. Rufina had been buried alive. The reason for her bout of catalepsy has never been fully clarified but it is presumed that she died of suffocation after waking up.

==Artistic depictions==
In the arts, catalepsy is often used for dramatic effect, sometimes as a plot device.

===Literature===


In William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the kindly Friar Laurence (in the course of a botched attempt to help the lovers) provides Juliet with a catalepsy-inducing potion so effective that Romeo tragically imagines his beloved&#x27;s deathlike trance to be actual death and poisons himself in despair just before she awakens from her stupor—leading her to kill herself with his dagger upon discovering his suicide.

In Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, the Abbé Faria has fits of catalepsy from time to time, before eventually dying from one.

In Eugène Sue&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot;, the villain Jacques Ferrand experiences a fit described as cataleptic in his final confrontation with Rodolphe, blinded by lamplight and hallucinating with visions of his fantasized Cecily.

In George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Silas Marner&quot;, the main character Silas Marner frequently has cataleptic fits and seizures, which adds to his uncanny reputation as a wizard or &quot;cunning man&quot; among the superstitious natives of his adopted village of Raveloe.

In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot;, a man feigns catalepsy to gain access to a neurologist&#x27;s rooms; the doctor attempts to treat him with amyl nitrite.

In Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;, the protagonist Dowell experiences catalepsy following the death of his wife.

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, the main character Valentine Michael Smith is believed to have catalepsy when he is returned to Earth.

In Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;, the narrator develops catalepsy. He fears being mistakenly declared dead and buried alive, and goes to great lengths to prevent this. In another of Poe&#x27;s short stories, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, Madeline Usher has catalepsy and is buried alive by her unstable brother Roderick. Catalepsy is also depicted in &quot;Berenice&quot;, thus becoming one of the recurrent themes in Poe&#x27;s fiction.

In Poppy Z. Brite&#x27;s &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot;, the main character—Compton, a serial killer facing a lifetime sentence—uses shamanistic techniques to induce catalepsy and, convincingly appearing deceased, is able to escape prison.

In Émile Zola&#x27;s short story &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Olivier Becaille&quot; (&quot;The Death of Olivier Becaille&quot;), the title character is buried alive and notes that &quot;I must have fallen into one of those cataleptic states that I had read of.&quot;

In Sax Rohmer&#x27;s Fu Manchu novels, Dr. Fu Manchu has a serum that induces a state of catalepsy so extreme as to be indistinguishable from death.

In Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;, Mrs. Snagsby has violent spasms before becoming cataleptic and being carried upstairs like a grand piano.

In Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy to Plato&quot;, Hegel describes Socrates as having catalepsy caused by magnetic somnambulism when in deep meditation.

In Charles Williams&#x27;s novel &quot;Many Dimensions&quot;, Sir Giles Tumulty says to Lord Arglay, the Chief Justice of England: &quot;You are a louse-brained catalept, Arglay.&quot;

In Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Now Wait for Last Year&quot;, Kathy Sweetscent becomes immobilized by withdrawal from JJ-180, an alien (and highly addictive) drug. &quot;My God, Kathy thought as she stood gazing down at the record by her feet. I can&#x27;t free myself; I&#x27;m going to remain here, and they&#x27;ll find me like this and know something&#x27;s terribly wrong. This is catalepsy!&quot;

In the second chapter of Álvares de Azevedo&#x27;s &quot;Noite na Taverna&quot;, character Solfieri rescues a woman who has catalepsy from inside a coffin.

In Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s novella &quot;The Room in the Dragon Volant&quot;, a naïve young man falls foul of a criminal gang who employ a curious, bulbocapnine-like drug which induces catalepsy, as a result of which he narrowly escapes premature burial.

In the Ted Hughes poem titled &quot;Conjuring in Heaven&quot; from &quot;Crow&quot;, the eponymous character is left in a state of catalepsy.

===Other media===
In the radio show &quot;Suspense&quot;, the episode titled &quot;Dead Ernest&quot; recounts how a man with catalepsy is wrongly believed dead when he is struck by a car.

In the movie &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1943), vampire hunter Professor Lazlo (J. Edward Bromberg) describes a vampire as being in a &quot;cataleptic state&quot; between sunrise and sunset, but practically &quot;invincible&quot; during the nighttime, to Dr. Harry Brewster (Frank Craven), as they look for answers to a number of strange situations involving Count Alucard (Lon Chaney Jr.).

In the movie &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963), John Black (Basil Rathbone) is stated to suffer from catalepsy, and is mistaken for dead several times throughout the movie.
