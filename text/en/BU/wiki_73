<text>Aubin-Edmond Arsenault (28 July 1870 – 29 April 1968) was a Prince Edward Island politician. He was the 13th premier of Prince Edward Island from 1917 to 1919.

Born in Egmont Bay, Prince County, Prince Edward Island, Arsenault&#x27;s family settled on the island in 1729, when it was a French called Île-Saint-Jean. His father, Joseph-Octave Arsenault, was a provincial politician and the first Acadian from PEI to be named to the Senate of Canada. Arsenault was educated at St. Dunstan&#x27;s College, Charlottetown, and St. Joseph University, New Brunswick. He studied law with McLeod, Morson and McQuarrie in Charlottetown and with Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen in London. He was admitted to the bar in 1898. Arsenault married Bertha, the daughter of Francis Gallant.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1908 as a Conservative. In 1912 he became Attorney-General in the government of Premier John A. Mathieson. When Mathieson left politics for a judicial appointment in 1917, Arsenault succeeded him becoming the first Acadian to be premier in any province.

Arsenault&#x27;s government repealed legislation to restrict automobile travel on the island to specific days and routes. His government also founded the PEI Travel Bureau. His government was defeated in the 1919 election, and he served as leader of the opposition until 1921 when he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island. He retired in 1946.

<text>Vaudreuil-Dorion () is a suburb of Greater Montreal, in the Montérégie region of southwestern Quebec, Canada. The result of the merger of two towns, Vaudreuil and Dorion, it is located in the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality. 

==History==
On 23 November 1702, governor of New France Louis-Hector de Callière gave a seigneury to Philippe de Vaudreuil, who was governor of Montreal at the time. Rigaud de Vaudreuil later became governor of New France.

In 1725, the region had only 38 inhabitants. About 1742 people began to be interested in the region and Vaudreuil&#x27;s population rose. 381 people lived in Vaudreuil in 1765. With the creation of the Grand Trunk Railway, people began to live in Dorion, which was called Vaudreuil Station. Dorion became a village in 1891.

Dorion was bisected by Autoroute 20 which links Downtown Montreal and Toronto via Highway 401 in Ontario. The Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway links between Toronto and Montreal are located in Dorion. Housing developments began in the 1950s and continued well into the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, housing began sprouting north and east of Dorion.

Vaudreuil and Dorion merged in 1994, becoming the City of Vaudreuil-Dorion.

==Geography==
Vaudreuil-Dorion is located on the south shores of the Lake of Two Mountains at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, just off the western edge of Île Perrot. The city consists of two non-contiguous parts: its eastern part is the larger main area along Lake of Two Mountains where the population centres of Vaudreuil and Dorion are located; the western portion is a smaller rural area that borders Rigaud, and is separated from the eastern portion by Saint-Lazare and Hudson.

<text>Hendricus Josephus Franciscus Marie Sneevliet, known as Henk Sneevliet or by the &quot;pseudonym&quot; &quot;Maring&quot; (13 May 1883 – 13 April 1942), was a Dutch communist politician who was active in both the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. As a functionary of the Communist International, Sneevliet guided the formation of both the Communist Party of Indonesia in 1914, and the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. In his native country, he was the founder, chairman, and only Representative for the Revolutionary Socialist (Workers&#x27;) Party (RSP/RSAP). He took part in the communist resistance against the occupation of the Netherlands during World War II by Nazi Germany, for which he was executed by the Germans in April 1942.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hendricus &quot;Henk&quot; Sneevliet was born on 13 May 1883 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and grew up in Den Bosch. He was the son of Anthonie Sneevliet, a cigar maker, and the former Henrica J. W. van Macklenbergh.

After finishing his education in 1900, Sneevliet moved to Zutphen and working for the Dutch railways. He became a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party (SDAP) as well as the Dutch Association of Railway and Tramway Employees (NV) in 1902. From 1906, Sneevliet was active for the SDAP in Zwolle, where he became the first social democrat city council member in the elections of 1907.

Sneevliet was very active in the NV and was elected to the union&#x27;s executive committee in 1906. In 1909 he was tapped as vice-chairman of the union and named as editor-in-chief of the union&#x27;s official journal. He became chairman of the union in 1911.

Sneevliet, as a committed socialist and militant trade unionist, was strongly supportive of an international seamen&#x27;s strike which was called in 1911 and was disgruntled by the failure of his union and political party to support the campaign. As a result, he resigned from both organizations, joining instead the more radical Social Democratic Party of the Netherlands (forerunner of the Dutch Communist Party) and writing for the Marxist magazine &quot;De Nieuwe Tijd&quot; (The New Time). Sneevliet&#x27;s alienation strengthened him in his decision to leave the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies.

===Dutch East Indies===
Sneevliet lived in the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia) from 1913 until 1918, where he quickly became active in the struggle against Dutch colonial rule. In 1914, he was a co-founder of the Indies Social Democratic Association (ISDV), in which both Dutch and Indonesian people were active.

He also returned to union work, becoming a member of the &quot;Vereeniging van Spoor- en Tramwegpersoneel&quot;, a railway union which was unique in having both Dutch and Indonesian members. Thanks to his experience as a union leader, he soon managed to turn this still fairly moderate union into a more modern and aggressive union, with a majority of Indonesian members. This union later formed the base for the Indonesian communist movement.

The ISDV was strictly anti-capitalist and agitated against the Dutch colonial regime and the privileged Indonesian elites. This led to much resistance against the ISDV and Sneevliet himself, from conservative circles and from the more moderate SDAP. In 1916 therefore he left the SDAP and joined the SDP, the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN).

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Sneevliet&#x27;s radicalism gained enough support amongst both the Indonesian population as well as Dutch soldiers and especially sailors that the Dutch authorities got nervous. Sneevliet was therefore forced to leave the Dutch East Indies in 1918. ISDV was repressed by the Dutch colonial authorities.

===Comintern functionary===
Back in the Netherlands, Sneevliet became active in the fledgling communist movement, becoming a salaried official of the party&#x27;s National Labor Secretariat (NAS) and helping to organize a major transportation strike in 1920.

The same year he was also present at the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow as a representative of the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), which was the successor to Sneevliet&#x27;s ISDV. There Sneevliet — using the pseudonym Maring — was elected a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

==== China ====
Vladimir Lenin was impressed enough by him to send him as a Communist International (Comintern) representative to China. Sneevliet lived in China from 1921 to 1923 and was present at the founding congress of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921. In addition to the pseudonym Maring, Sneevliet used the names Martin, Philips, and Sentot during this period.

Sneevliet was an advocate of cooperation with the non-communist nationalist Kuomintang, headed by Sun Yat-sen, with whom he had personally established contact on behalf of the Comintern. In 1923, Sun Yat-sen offered Sneevliet a full-time role in the Kuomintang as an adviser, but Sneevliet turned down the offer. He also rejected a separate offer from the Soviets to run the Guangzhou outpost of the Soviet state news agency ROSTA.

Early in 1924, Sneevliet returned to Moscow, his tenure as a Comintern representative to China at an end.

=== Back in the Netherlands ===
Sneevliet returned to the Netherlands from Moscow in 1924 to assume the position of secretary of the National Labor Secretariat (NAS). He joined the executive committee of the Communist Party of Holland in 1925 but the two years were marked by worsening factional relations between Sneevliet and his co-thinkers and the bulk of the CPN leadership. The denouement came in 1927, when Sneevliet broke all ties with the CPH and the Comintern.

In 1929, Sneevliet formed a new political party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). This organization concentrated on national issues, gaining some successes in organizing the unemployed movement, strike actions, and the struggle against the rise of fascism.

He remained interested in Indonesian affairs and in 1933 was sentenced to five months imprisonment for his solidarity actions for the Dutch and Indonesian sailors who took part in the mutiny on &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot;, which was put down by an air bombardment in which twenty-three sailors were killed and which at the time aroused considerable passions in the Dutch public opinion. That same year, while still imprisoned, Sneevliet was elected a member of the Lower House of parliament, a position in which he remained until 1937.

In August 1933, the RSP signed the &quot;Declaration of the Four&quot; along with the International Communist League, led by Leon Trotsky, the OSP and the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany. This declaration was intended as a step towards a new Fourth International of revolutionary socialist parties. In 1938, Sneevliet and the RSP ultimately refused to join this new international organization, however, thereby breaking with the Trotskyist movement. Instead the RSP became a part of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Unity along with the Independent Labour Party (Britain) and the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) of Spain. 

In Amsterdam, Sneevliet (as &quot;Henricus&quot; or &quot;Henryk Sneevliet&quot;) was among Ignace Reiss&#x27;s circle, which included: Henriette Roland-Holst, Hildo Krop, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, &quot;Professor Carvalho&quot; (Ricardo Carvalho Calero), and &quot;H. C. Pieck&quot; (Henri Pieck). Sneevliet had informed Victor Serge that Reiss, a leading GPU official in the Netherlands was &quot;heartbroken&quot; by the Zinoviev Trial and had crossed over to the anti-Stalinist Opposition. Sneevliet and Serge waited in Rheims to meet him on 5 September 1937, but he never arrived. In his autobiography Serge described Sneevliet that day as thus: &quot;his face wore a persistent frown amid its close lines, but he never lost heart.&quot; The train ticket to visit Sneevliet was found in his pocket when he (Reiss) was assassinated in Lausanne, Switzerland.

With James Maxton of the ILP, Sneevliet headed deputations to civil war Spain on behalf of the international campaign for socialists there persecuted after the May Days of Barcelona. &quot;They harassed Republican Ministers with their questions and protests and proceeded to knock on the doors of the Communist Party&#x27;s secret prisons.&quot; Despite expecting to hear that the POUM Executive had been summarily executed, the campaign, according to Victor Serge in the 1940s, saved their lives and was &quot;a real moral triumph&quot;.

=== Final years ===

The worsening political climate both abroad and nationally and the constant struggle against both the communist and social democratic parties, as well as government interference, took a heavy toll on Sneevliet and his small organization, however. When war broke out on 10 May 1940, Sneevliet immediately dissolved the RSAP.

Some months later with Willem Dolleman and Abraham Menist, he founded a resistance group against the German occupation, the Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg-Front (MLL-Front). This was largely engaged in producing propaganda for socialism and opposing the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and as such was heavily involved with the February strike of 1941.

== Death ==
As a known communist, Sneevliet had to go into hiding even before he started his resistance activities. In the underground he edited a clandestine newspaper called &quot;Spartakus&quot; and took part in other activities. For two years he managed to keep out of the hands of the Nazis, but in April 1942 they finally arrested him and the rest of the MLL-Front leadership. Their execution took place in the Amersfoort KZ on 12 April 1942. It was reported that they went to their deaths singing &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

<text>Albert Laurence Di Meola (born July 22, 1954) is an American guitarist. Known for his work in jazz fusion and world music, his breakthrough came after joining Chick Corea&#x27;s Return to Forever group in 1974. He launched, from 1976 afterwards, a successful and critically acclaimed solo career, noted for his technical mastery, complex compositions and explorations of Latin music. Highlights of his work are &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot;, his &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; collaboration and the &quot;World Sinfonia&quot; trilogy.

An alumnus of Berklee College of Music and a Grammy Award winner, Di Meola&#x27;s successful career includes high-profile collaborations such as Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Larry Coryell, Steve Winwood, Jaco Pastorius, Paco de Lucía, Bill Bruford, John McLaughlin, Jan Hammer, Jean-Luc Ponty, Steve Vai and others.

==Early life==
Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, into an Italian family with roots in Cerreto Sannita, a small town northeast of Benevento, Di Meola grew up in Bergenfield, where he attended Bergenfield High School. He has been a resident of Old Tappan, New Jersey.

When Di Meola was eight years old, his discovery of Elvis Presley and the Ventures inspired him to start playing guitar. Hearing The Beatles for the first time, though, was what that truly cemented his desire to become a musician. His older sister introduced them to Al on the family&#x27;s 1963 Christmas, through their &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; LP. &quot;Listening to that album really changed my life&quot;, said Di Meola. Watching their string of appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, two months later, further strengthened his drive. Di Meola started his classes with guitar teacher Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Aslanian, who directed him toward jazz standards. He was also trained in theory, reading and other useful skills. &quot;He was my biggest influence&quot;, he said of his first teacher. As a teenager, Di Meola practiced guitar eight to ten hours per day.

By the late 1960s, Di Meola became keenly aware of the rock explosion. Aside from British Invasion acts such as The Rolling Stones and The Who, he was particularly fond of the stateside acts coming from California. He was a fan of country rock acts such as The Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers and Crosby, Stills and Nash, as well as the Bay Area psychedelic rock scene, namely Moby Grape, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. &quot;I loved all those bands&quot;, he said.

One particular music group from San Francisco, said Al Di Meola, that had a definite &quot;influence on me growing up&quot; was Santana.

Although he went on to appreciate the &quot;whole package&quot; of late 1960s and early 1970s rock icons such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page and Carlos Santana, he never saw them as role models. &quot;I never thought of the rock players as having good technique&quot;, he said. Alternatively, Di Meola was inspired by jazz guitarists George Benson, Tal Farlow and Kenny Burrell, and country guitarists such as Clarence White and Doc Watson. His musical direction solidified when exposed to jazz rock pioneers Larry Coryell and John McLaughlin. Di Meola elaborates on Coryell&#x27;s influence, acknowledging that his &quot;unique approach&quot; gave him the &quot;confidence to continue in my direction.&quot; Seeing Coryell and other jazz musicians live in NYC not only was &quot;a real thrill&quot;, but also a &quot;turning point.&quot; Of McLaughlin, he praised him as &quot;the first guitarist I heard to combine tremendous amount of emotion with incredible technique.&quot;

==Career==
===1970s===

He attended Berklee College of Music in 1971. There, he practiced up to eight hours a day. At nineteen, he was hired by Chick Corea to replace Bill Connors in the pioneering jazz fusion band Return to Forever with Stanley Clarke and Lenny White. Of joining the group, he said:

Al Di Meola then compared Corea&#x27;s band to John McLaughlin&#x27;s Mahavishnu Orchestra, the group that inspired Chick Corea to take Return to Forever into a rockier, high-octane direction. He argued:

His short, two-year period with Return to Forever proved to be the group&#x27;s career peak. He recorded three albums with the quartet, helping them earn its greatest commercial success as all three albums cracked the Top 40 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart.

&quot;No Mystery&quot;&#x27;s title track won a Grammy for the Best Jazz Performance By A Group, but the band didn&#x27;t show up for the event because they firmly believed they wouldn&#x27;t win. Jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald presented the prize.

Al Di Meola recorded with Larry Coryell on Lenny White&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;Venusian Summer&quot; (1975). Di Meola and Coryell traded solos on &quot;Prince of the Sea&quot;, the album&#x27;s last track. The pairing caused a stir in the fusion community, with fans wondering who played what solo. Coryell reveals this was the only time he and Di Meola played together with electric guitars.

In early 1976, Return to Forever released an album &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot;. Debuting at #170, it peaked at #35 in May, spending three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 and a total of 15 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Fourteen years later it won a gold RIAA certification for selling an excess of 500,000 copies. The album, as a whole, has been considered Chick Corea&#x27;s answer to Rick Wakeman&#x27;s successful &quot;The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1975), either by its medieval themes or its prog rock leanings.

At the height of Return to Forever&#x27;s popularity, Chick Corea decided to break up the group. The main reason for its sudden demise was the other band members&#x27; involvement in side-projects; White, Clarke and Di Meola were already investing in their solo works, with their labels and management backing up their new career moves, which may have hampered the progress of the main band.

Chick Corea&#x27;s deep involvement with Scientology might also have played a part in the end of Return to Forever&#x27;s classic lineup. When asked, band members avoided the issue, although Clarke leaving Scientology at the time could have influenced the turn of events.

As Return to Forever was disbanding around 1976, Di Meola recorded his first solo album, &quot;Land of the Midnight Sun&quot; (1976). Former members of Return to Forever, and newcomer bassist Jaco Pastorius notably collaborated with the recording. Early on, Di Meola was noted for his technical mastery and extremely fast, complex guitar solos and compositions, and his exploration of Mediterranean cultures and acoustic genres like flamenco and the classical guitar repertoire.

To market his sophomore album, &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot; (1977), Di Meola did an American tour with Weather Report, when Jaco Pastorius had joined the band. Both his and Weather Report&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; album came out the same week on Columbia Records. Heavily promoted by the label, the tour was a success, with sold-out shows across the country. &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot; eventually went gold.

From 1976 to 1978 he played with Stomu Yamashta in the supergroup Go on three records.

===1980s===

Years after the &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot; sessions, Al Di Meola and Paco de Lucía were approached to do a tour with Leo Kottke. Weeks later, a better proposition turned up: a 2-month European tour with John McLaughlin. Di Meola became friendly with Paco, yet he never became quite close to McLaughlin. Di Meola revealed that the British guitarist was fiercely competitive, wary of being replaced as fusion&#x27;s premiere guitarist. &quot;It was like going into a boxing match and he&#x27;s out to kill you&quot;, said Di Meola of McLaughlin&#x27;s ruthless attitude. That fueled a six-stringed rivalry that largely benefited the audience.

In 1980, Al Di Meola recorded the best-selling &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; live album with John McLaughlin and Paco de Lucía. Still a popular album, it went on to sell seven million copies worldwide.

The trio reconvened in 1982 to record a studio album, &quot;Passion, Grace &amp; Fire&quot; (1983). In the Spanish remaster of the album, flamenco scholars José Manuel Gamboa and Faustino Nuñez weigh in their impressions on the liner notes. Though somewhat lacking the &quot;warmth&quot; of the live setting of their debut, &quot;Passion, Grace &amp; Fire&quot; is a more balanced effort. The three performers contributed with two compositions each.

1982 was also the year the Al Di Meola released his first live album, &quot;Tour De Force&quot;. It notably featured former Mahavishnu Orchestra keyboard player Jan Hammer on the line-up, with sidemen Anthony Jackson on bass, Mingo Lewis handling the percussion and Steve Gadd on drums. Along with music from preceding albums, it featured a previously unreleased Di Meola track (&quot;Nena&quot;) and two Hammer compositions, &quot;Advantage&quot; and &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot; from &quot;Electric Rendezvous&quot;. The studio version was marketed as a single.

Al Di Meola produced &quot;Magic Touch&quot; (1985), Stanley Jordan&#x27;s Blue Note debut. The record spent 51 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s jazz chart, and went gold almost 20 years after its release. It garnered Grammy nominations in two categories: Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist and Best Jazz Fusion Performance, Vocal Or Instrumental. Di Meola granted Stanley Jordan had a &quot;phenomenal&quot; approach to guitar tapping, taking it &quot;into another dimension.&quot;

The latter half of the 1980s came with noticeable shifts in Di Meola&#x27;s music. He now incorporated vocals, the Synclavier guitar synthesizer, weaving these it into his compositions. Also, since playing with McLaughlin and Paco de Lucía, he rethought &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;loud&quot; sets. Di Meola seemed to have left fusion definitely behind after the subdued, all-acoustic &quot;Cielo e Terra&quot; (1985). That was the start of a &quot;Brazilian&quot; phase of sorts. Already a long-time MPB enthusiast, Di Meola name-checked Egberto Gismonti and Milton Nascimento on interviews. In &quot;Cielo e Terra&quot;, he collaborated with drummer and percussionist Airto Moreira. By then, Moreira had a stellar track record in jazz fusion, having recorded and performed with Miles Davis and Chick Corea.

&quot;Tirami Su&quot; (1987) continued Di Meola&#x27;s infatuation with MPB. This time around Airto Moreira wasn&#x27;t available, which led the guitarist to a fruitful collaboration with singer and songwriter Zé Renato. The Brazilian composer spent one month in New York City jamming and recording, doing mostly non-lyrical vocalizations to the music. Zé Renato then toured with the Al Di Meola Project across Europe and the USA. &quot;Tirami Su&quot; also featured guest singer Clara Sandroni, whom Di Meola discovered through Milton Nascimento&#x27;s &quot;Encontros e Despedidas&quot; (1985).

Al Di Meola was one of the select invitees to Les Paul&#x27;s 72nd birthday celebration on June 8, 1987, at NYC&#x27;s Hard Rock Cafe. He was invited to an impromtu jam with Les Paul and Jimmy Page, who earlier played over a 12-bar blues progression with Les Pauls&#x27; sidemen, playing riffs in the vein of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit You Baby&quot;. Other attendees included Bo Diddley, John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, Robby Krieger, Jeff Beck, Nile Rodgers and Elliot Easton. The party generated a buzz that reached mainstream press, and it became a newsworthy topic for weeks to come. Les Paul&#x27;s birthday helped him became a household name once again.

===1990s===
Except for the occasional electric guitar foray on albums such as 1991&#x27;s &quot;Kiss My Axe&quot;, he spent most of the next fifteen years both exploring acoustic and world music. Di Meola stated that part (&quot;more than 50 percent&quot;) of the reason for stepping away from the electric guitar is due to hearing damage from years of playing at excessive volumes.

In the mid-1990s Al Di Meola, Stanley Clarke and Jean-Luc Ponty worked for five weeks on what became &quot;The Rite of Strings&quot; album. Their world tour included a South American leg, starting at Argentinan capital Buenos Aires, where they played for 7,000-strong crowd at the Luna Park stadium. They proceeded to visit Brazil for five dates: two on São Paulo and one each in Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Porto Alegre.

The &quot;fearsome threesome&quot; of Al Di Meola, Paco de Lucía and John McLaughlin reunited for a final time for &quot;The Guitar Trio&quot; (1996). Although the record and its tour were a successful endeavour, frequent personality clashes ensued due to musical differences. The process was especially challenging for Di Meola for he lost his mother, Theresa, in the summer of 1996. They eventually grew used to one another again, and developed a healthy competitiveness that made &quot;life on the road&quot; possible.

===2000s===
Al Di Meola continued his successful streak in Germany, being awarded yet another gold album for &quot;World Sinfonía III – The Grande Passion&quot; (2000).

&quot;Super Guitar Trio and Friends&quot; (TDK, 2001).

Al Di Meola rediscovered his love of the electric guitar in 2006, and the DVD of his concert at the Leverkusen Jazz Festival 2006 is subtitled &quot;Return to Electric Guitar&quot;.

Return to Forever reunited in 2009. The incentive initially came from Chick Corea&#x27;s participation on Al Di Meola&#x27;s &quot;Consequence of Chaos&quot; (2006). Di Meola pitched the idea to Corea, and the others came on board. Things went sour during the mixing stage of their live album, &quot;Returns&quot; (2009). Corea and Clarke mixed down Di Meola&#x27;s guitar.

===2010s===
On July 10, 2013, Al Di Meola played at the 33th edition of Spain&#x27;s &quot;Festival de la Guitarras de Córdoba&quot;. Approximately 25,000 people attended the event. Other participants included Michael Schenker, Fito y Fitipaldis, Tomatito Sexteto and Robert Cray.

Al Di Meola returned to Spain in 2017, to the &quot;IV Encuentro Internacional de Guitarra Paco de Lucía&quot;. The festival was held in Algeciras, Paco&#x27;s birthplace, from 17th to 22 July. For Di Meola&#x27;s only presentation in Spain that year, he made the &quot;World Sinfonia&quot; show.

In 2018, Di Meola was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from his alma mater, Berklee College of Music.

===2020s===
On January 11, 2023, Al Di Meola wrote a heartfelt eulogy for Jeff Beck in his official Facebook page. &quot;There was no one like Jeff&quot; he said, praising his &quot;most unique style.&quot; He reminisced how he grew up listening to &quot;Truth&quot; (1968) and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; (1969). He also remembered how he loved Beck&#x27;s 1976-1979 visits to his Hammersmith Odeon shows on London.

&quot;Twentyfour&quot; (2024).

==Personal life==
After a head injury when still a child, Al Di Meola developed a case of tinnitus. His time touring, especially with Return to Forever, worsened it. Although he had no hearing loss so far, he does experience the ringing sensation in his ears, typical of this condition, and the very high frequencies were compromised.

Al Di Meola said that middle class New Jersey &quot;was the perfect place to grow up.&quot; Living close to New York, he could go the city&#x27;s record stores and music clubs. &quot;The greatest shows any night of the week&quot;. He visited Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East in Greenwich Village to see rock bands &quot;on a weekly basis&quot;. He also went NYC&#x27;s jazz clubs and Latin clubs, &quot;soaking it all in&quot;.

In July 2016, Al Di Meola married Stephanie Kreis after meeting after a 2013 concert of his in Budapest. Al has two daughters from a previous relationship; Oriana and Valentina. He also has a daughter with Stephanie, named Ava. Additionally, he is the first-time grandfather of Orion, Valentina&#x27;s daughter.

From 2019 onwards, Di Meola and family devised the &quot;A Fine Taste and Music&quot; house events. The idea came about after a dinner with friends, when Al suggested to his wife that they livestream him cooking one of his &quot;special Italian dishes.&quot; They did, and the guitarist joked to his viewers: “If you like what you see you can come here, live in person! I&#x27;ll cook and we can talk and we can have dinner together.&quot; Much to his surprise, people from around the world - Africa, Asia, South America - took them seriously, inquiring the cost of such an event. The Di Meolas did a total of 10 dinners before putting them on hold, because of COVID-19 restrictions.

Stephanie Di Meola devised three different &quot;A Fine Taste&quot; packages. The top package - the &quot;Diamond&quot; plan - includes dinner, a private show and a jam session, where guests get to play with one of Al&#x27;s famous guitars. These encompass his black &#x27;71 Les Paul Custom, from his Return to Forever days, and the ‘59 Les Paul he used in &quot;Kiss My Axe&quot;. The setlist for the pocket show is taken from previous solo albums, Beatles songs and &quot;new stuff.&quot; According to Di Meola, &quot;it&#x27;s a chance for me to try out material in front of diehard fans. And the fans get the first shot at hearing it.&quot;

In September 2023 while performing on stage in Bucharest, Romania Di Meola suffered a heart attack. He was admitted to a local hospital where he was treated for ST elevation myocardial infarction. Dates from his &quot;The Electric Years&quot; tour, like his appearance on Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Rio Montreaux Jazz Festival&quot;, were immediately cancelled. He took some time off from performances, but began performing again in January 2024.
==Artistry==
===Songwriting===
By the time he was recording &quot;Casino&quot;, back in 1978, Al Di Meola described his music as a combination of Latin music - &quot;probably my favorite&quot; - and &quot;beautiful romantic Italian melodies&quot;. His rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll side brought in &quot;the energy&quot;, and his deep appreciation for jazz contributed to the complexity of his compositions.

While blues was a cornerstone of popular music styles of the 1960s and 1970s - psychedelic, British blues and hard rock - Al Di Meola wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the genre. &quot;I&#x27;m not into blues too much, there&#x27;s some that&#x27;ll put put you to sleep...&quot; He confided that, despite the fact that he liked rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, his lessons with Bob Aslanian made him an outsider in the burdgeoning rock scene:

Al Di Meola is known for using non-Western modes when composing. One example was &quot;Egyptian Danza&quot; - the opening track from &quot;Casino&quot; - based on a Phrygian dominant scale. Right around that time, he said he was also keen on applying &quot;elements&quot; of the dorian, myxolydian, and locrian modes on his playing.

===Speed picking &amp; Palm muting===
Besides the impressive speed and accuracy of his alternate picking, another hallmark of Al Di Meola&#x27;s style is his palm muting. In an interview to Rick Beato, Di Meola explained how he developed and practiced this technique: &quot;[...] when I was younger, and the neighbors downstairs in the next yard, I didn&#x27;t really want them to hear me play. So I would mute my strings. So I got kind of got used to the palm on the bridge and muting. But I also liked the fact that the notes popped&quot;.

Di Meola espouses the advantages of palm muting when playing the electric guitar:

===Whammy bar===
Although fond of whammy bars, they&#x27;re also notably absent from his playing style. Al Di Meola&#x27;s 1971 black Les Paul, featured on his early solo records, came with a Bigsby, which he had removed for a variety of reasons. He cited tuning issues, along with loss of tone and &quot;some sustain capabilities.&quot; In the 1980s di Meola acquired a PRS solid-body with a tremolo. He later quit using it, confessing he was &quot;afraid of the obvious comparisons to other players.&quot;

===Other techniques===
Al Di Meola advocates for the importance of picking all notes as much as possible. He steers clear from sweep picking and hammer-ons, which he deems as &quot;shortcuts&quot;. In his opinion they&#x27;re detrimental, in the long run, &quot;for playing more intricate kinds of music&quot;. For one, this makes his playing quite distinct from blues guitarists, whose regular use of hammer-ons and pull-offs are essential to the style. By avoiding sweep picking, he also sets himself apart from the 1980s shred guitar movement, which heavily relied on this technique.

Still on the subject of note picking, Al Di Meola is critical of tapping as well, a technique popularized by Eddie Van Halen in the late 1970s and 1980s. He views it as a form of &quot;cheating&quot;; an impressive way to sound fast, without being &quot;de facto&quot; fast. He then draws attention to its limited use in an acoustic context, due to the lack of sustain a classical guitar has compared to an electric. These critiques of tapping aren&#x27;t entirely warranted, though. On his minute-long &quot;tour de force&quot; &quot;Spanish Fly&quot; Van Halen proved that the technique worked fine on an acoustic guitar. It is regularly voted as one of EVH&#x27;s best solos. Shortly after, fingerstyle extraordinaire Michael Hedges showed, beyond doubt, that tapping went beyond the electric guitar. His unique approach to the instrument brought into play unorthodox tunings, guitar-body percussion and two-handed tapping.

Al Di Meola is proficient in crosspicking, a technique that meshes arpeggios with string skipping. One such example is &quot;Vertigo Shadow&quot; from &quot;Cielo e Terra&quot;, played at a 7/8 meter.

===Criticism===
The criticism of Al Di Meola&#x27;s musicianship usually focuses on the perceived lack of expression and substance, despite being praised for his virtuosity. His playing has been described as &quot;clinical&quot;, &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;soulless&quot; by some critics and musicians. John McLaughlin accused Di Meola of minimizing his American influences and &quot;playing cultural hopscotch&quot; in the track &quot;Egyptian Danza&quot; from the &quot;Casino&quot; album. Irish guitar hero and former Thin Lizzy member Gary Moore admired Di Meola, but declared the following in a 1983 interview to &quot;Music U.K.&quot; magazine:

In February 1981, &quot;Jazz Journal&quot; described Di Meola&#x27;s solo set, in a trio performance at the Royal Albert Hall with McLaughlin and Paco de Lucía, as a &quot;one long and structureless amalgam of crudely connected passages&quot; and considered Di Meola as &quot;a rare breed of musicians who make virtuosity seem like a severe handicap.&quot;

On this type of critique, Di Meola defended himself, stating:

==Legacy==
Al Di Meola made an impression on a whole generation of hard rock and heavy metal guitar heroes. The list includes Mr. Big&#x27;s Paul Gilbert, Extreme&#x27;s Nuno Bettencourt and Dream Theater&#x27;s John Petrucci. The late Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Randy Rhoads, at one point, declared that di Meola was his favorite guitarist. Neoclassical legends Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony MacAlpine and Jason Becker also sang praises for him. MacAlpine said, back in 1987:

Al Di Meola&#x27;s influence extends to other genres of as well. Toto guitarist and session musician Steve Lukather said Al was &quot;incredible&quot; and that his &quot;sound and style [...] smacked me in the face&quot;. Along John McLaughlin, he was one of the 12 guitar players that shaped Lukather&#x27;s style.

Al Di Meola has been inducted for &quot;Guitar Player&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Gallery Of The Greats&quot; by winning 5 times in one or more categories of the magazine&#x27;s Annual Readers Poll. He has been awarded 14 times so far, on four different categories: &quot;New Talent&quot; (1975), &quot;Jazz&quot; (1977–1981), &quot;Guitar LP&quot; (1977, 1978, 1980, 1981) and &quot;Acoustic Steel-String&quot; (1983–1987).

&quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine included Al Di Meola on their top 50 fastest &quot;shredders&quot; of all-time list. He was featured alongside other rock and jazz luminaries, such as Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Marty Friedman, Allan Holdsworth, Frank Gambale and others. Di Meola personally dislikes the term, though, which he finds limiting. He sees himself as more of a composer than a virtuoso.

Al Di Meola, along with former bandmates Return to Forever, received in 2008 the BBC Jazz &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; by Beatles producer George Martin. They performed &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot;&#x27;s title track at the event. In the same year he received an honorary doctorate degree from his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the Berklee College of Music.

Al Di Meola was notably absent from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;250 Greatest Guitar Players of All Time&quot; list, a list which stirred great controversy. Other notable omissions included Peter Frampton, Neal Schon, Gary Moore, Joe Bonamassa, Guthrie Govan and Eric Gales. Rick Beato called the list &quot;idiotic&quot; and hit hard on its questionable ranking: Pat Metheny at #157 and John McLaughlin at #72, for example.

==Gear and equipment==
===Guitars===
Al Di Meola favored Gibson guitars on most of his career. He also advertised the L6-S model for Gibson in the late 1970s.

On September 23, 2008, PRS Guitars unveiled their Al DiMeola signature model: the Al Di Meola Prism. It was the first PRS to have such a rich color scheme. The Prism was designed after the original Modern Eagle guitar, a cutting-edge midway between a Gibson Les Paul and a Fender Stratocaster. It features a 25&quot; neck, a tremolo bridge and 1957/2008 humbucker pickups, similar to vintage PAF pickups. The guitarist went on the 2008 Return to Forever reunion tour with it.

===Pickups===
Al Di Meola was an early DiMarzio user. He&#x27;s in an ad for the pickup company on the February 23rd, 1978 edition of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine.

<text>Thane Alexander Campbell, (July 7, 1895 – September 28, 1978) was a Prince Edward Island politician and jurist, who served as the 19th premier of Prince Edward Island from 1936 to 1943.

==Early life==
Born in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, the son of Alexander and Clara (Muttart) Campbell, Campbell was educated at Summerside Public School and Prince of Wales College. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Dunstan&#x27;s University and Master of Arts from Dalhousie University. A Rhodes Scholar, he received a Master of Arts degree from Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Returning to PEI in 1922, he read law with A. C. Saunders in Summerside.

==Politics==
Campbell first ran for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in a 1930 by-election as the Liberal candidate in 2nd Prince but lost. In 1930, he was appointed Attorney General of Prince Edward Island. He was elected for 1st Prince in 1931 and re-elected in 1935 and was appointed Attorney and Advocate General in Premier Walter Lea&#x27;s cabinet.

When Premier Lea died in 1936, Campbell succeeded him. Campbell&#x27;s government organised the provincial police, passed the province&#x27;s first law governing the public service and established a national park. With the beginning of World War II, Campbell&#x27;s government committed itself to organising the province for the war effort.

==Judicial career==
In 1943, Campbell left politics to become Chief Justice on the island&#x27;s Supreme Court and, in 1970, became head of the Foreign Claims Commission. While Chief Justice he saw his son, Alexander B. Campbell, sworn in as premier in 1966.

==Curling==
A curler, he joined the Summerside Curling Club in 1928. He was President of the PEI Curling Association in 1936. He served as President of the Dominion Curling Association from 1941 to 1942. In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the Prince Edward Island Curling Hall of Fame and Museum. In 1974, he was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in the builder category.

==Honours==
In 1973 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

==Family life==
He married Cecilia Bradshaw (1906–1968) on 28 February 1930. They had four children: Virginia; Alex; Harriet; and J. Melville.

<text>John Walter Jones (April 14, 1878 – March 31, 1954) was a politician and farmer in Prince Edward Island, Canada. An agronomist, he was instrumental in introducing the potato crop to the island, which was to become a staple of the economy. In 1935, he received the King George V medal as the best farmer in the province.

Born in Pownal, he first ran for public office in the 1921 federal election as a Farmer-Progressive candidate, but failed to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada.He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island as a Liberal in 1935. In 1943, he became the 20th premier of the province when Thane A. Campbell was appointed Chief Justice of the PEI Supreme Court.

The government of &quot;Farmer Jones&quot; repealed strict prohibition, and created the PEI Liquor Control Commission to regulate the sale of liquor. He had to proceed by order-in-council because the lieutenant governor, as a prohibitionist, refused to give Royal Assent to the necessary legislation. In 1947, his government broke a strike at Canada Packers, a meat-packing plant, by seizing the plant, employing strike-breakers and outlawing trade union affiliation with national or international unions in the name of &quot;protect(ing) the farm interest&quot;.

He left provincial politics in 1953 to accept an appointment to the Senate of Canada.

<doc id="603216" wikidata="Q7274723" url="?curid=603216" title="R40 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R40 was a New York City Subway car model built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1967 to 1969 for the IND/BMT B Division. There were 400 cars in the R40 fleet, arranged in married pairs. Two versions of the R40 were manufactured: the original 200-car R40 order built in 1967–1968, and the supplementary 200-car R40A order built in 1968–1969, with the last 100 cars of the supplementary order re-designed with straight ends. The 200 original R40s and the first 100 R40As were unique for their futuristic 10-degree slanted end (designed by the firm Raymond Loewy and Associates, and William Snaith Inc.) and were nicknamed the R40 Slants or simply Slants. Due to safety concerns, the final 100 cars of the R40A order were re-designed with traditional straight-ends by Sundberg-Ferar and became known unofficially as the &quot;R40M&quot; (M for modified).

The first R40s entered service on March 23, 1968. Various modifications were made over the years to the R40 fleet, including a complete overhaul from 1987–1989 by Sumitomo Corp. of America. The R160 subway car order replaced all of the R40s and R40As from 2007 to 2009; the last slant-ended train ran on June 12, 2009, while the last straight-ended R40As ran on August 28, 2009. After being retired, most R40s and R40As were stripped and sunk into the Atlantic Ocean as artificial reefs, but a pair of R40 slants and several straight-ended R40As have survived.

==Description==
There were two versions of the R40: the original order from 1967 to 1968, and the second order, the R40As, built from 1968 to 1969. The R40s were originally numbered 4150–4249 and 4350–4449. In 1970, cars 4350–4449 were renumbered to 4250–4349. The slant-ended R40As were originally numbered 4450–4549, and the straight-ended R40As were originally numbered 4250–4349; these cars were later renumbered to 4350–4449 and 4450–4549, respectively.

Like the R38 order, the R40 was manufactured with stainless steel car-bodies, fiberglass end-caps, and carbon steel underbodies. 

The width of the doors was increased from , which would become standard until the R142 on the A division and R211 on the B division. 

The R40 was the second of four subway car types built in succession by the St. Louis Car Company for the NYCTA, in a period that spanned from 1965–1973. As the straight-ended R40As and the subsequent R42 order were nearly identical, they were often operated together in mixed-consists.

=== Signage ===
Compared to the preceding R38 order, route signage on the R40s differed significantly, being the first order to enter service after the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection in 1967. Located on the upper part of the middle set of windows, the new arrangement originally used a single sign that displayed the service and termini on the outside, and a route diagram on the inside. This was later replaced by a three-sign system, with a square sign that displayed the route bullet on the left side and rectangular signs displaying the line&#x27;s terminal stations on the right side when viewed from the exterior, with the orientation being reversed when viewed from the interior. In addition, the cab ends of the cars now featured a single roll-sign, located on the opposite side of the driver&#x27;s cabin, that displaying the route. When first introduced, this was a very large sign with a background corresponding to the service&#x27;s color, but had been replaced with smaller signs only displaying the bullet around 1978. This replaced the overhead twin roll-signs that displayed both the route bullet and directional terminal station. This pattern became standard for all subsequent roll-signs, albeit with slight placement and design variations, until the R142 and R142A orders in 1999, which switched to a single red LED sign up front with the route, and the sides signs displaying the current destination and the line all in yellow with LEDs and LCDs, which that became standard for the first “generation” of New Technology Trains. A hybrid of the three styles was then introduced on the R211 order in 2021, with the route bullet in full color LEDs up front, the destination up top, and the side signs using a full-color LED route bullet and the destination with white LEDs.

Moreover, the R40s and slant-ended R40As were the last subway cars to feature distinctive &quot;EXP&quot; (express) and &quot;LOCAL&quot; marker lights on the cab ends, albeit centered. When the straight-ended R40As arrived, the use of these marker lights was discontinued.

==History==
In December 1965, the NYCTA contracted Raymond Loewy and Associates along with William Snaith Inc. to design a new subway car that would be &quot;dramatically different in exterior and interior&quot;, with the firms conceiving a unique and futuristic 10-degree slanted end for the new cars. The more attractive design was intended to beautify the subway and was part of an effort to convince people to abandon their cars for mass-transit. On September 20, 1966, the NYCTA announced plans to order 400 subway cars with this new design. In addition to the slanted ends, the new cars were to have wider doors and windows, easier-to-read signage, and improved interiors with light colors. Bids were opened to the public on October 1, 1966. In November 1966, the St. Louis Car Company was awarded the contract at $114,000 per car. The new cars cost a total of $46,172,041, with the cost to be split evenly between the Federal Government and the City of New York.

The first incomplete pair of R40s (cars 4350–4351) arrived on TA property in November 1967 for promoting of the Transportation Bond issue on Election Day. They were then returned to the assembly plant in St. Louis for completion and delivered in January 1968. On March 23, 1968, the R40 fleet entered service on the . All 300 slanted R40s were delivered as of January 24, 1969, with the first modified R40As delivered in January 1969.

At the cost of an additional $14,000 per car, the 300 R40As were delivered new with the same successful Stone-Safety 10 ton air conditioning systems/units found on the last ten R38 cars. From this point forward, air conditioning became standard equipment on all future subway car orders. Due to the placement of the air conditioning system, the standee poles were arranged in an alternating pattern rather than the straight-line pattern seen in the R40s, which lacked air conditioning systems/units until their overhauls. In addition, the exterior of an air-conditioned R40A could be told apart by its non air-conditioned R40 counterpart by examining the roof-line; cars equipped with air conditioning had significantly thinner air intakes.

Notably, the R40s were the final subway cars ordered prior to the 1968 merger between the New York City Transit Authority and the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

===Safety Concerns and Controversies===
Within months of the first cars being delivered, safety concerns and controversies surrounded the new slant-ended design. Due to the lack of handholds on the slant-ends, concerns were raised that passengers walking in between cars could fall onto the tracks. As a temporary fix, the NYCTA ordered conductors to lock the doors at the slant ends of each car. Meanwhile, the director of design at Raymond Loewy claimed that there was to be no passage between subway cars; the doors were to be locked and thus the safety features would have been unneeded. In November 1968, the NYCTA began modifying the slant-ended fleet at a cost of $400,000 with large grab rails and pantograph gates, which effectively destroyed Loewy&#x27;s design, but allowed passengers to travel safely between cars. Moreover, a transit union newspaper reported that the modifications were necessary as &quot;there is reason to believe&quot; the cars would be deformed if they bumped, and re-iterated that the slant ends posed a danger to passengers walking in between cars. 

As an even more drastic measure, the NYCTA announced that the remaining 100 R40A cars on order would be redesigned. As a result, the last 100 R40As were built with a modified straight-ended style designed by Sundberg-Ferar (nicknamed the R40M), a design that would be used on the subsequent (and nearly identical) R42 order.

In 1977, pantograph gates, salvaged from retired R1 through R9 cars, were modified and then installed on the front ends of the straight-ended R40A and R42 cars. Since the straight-ended R40As came factory equipped with baloney coiled spring type inter car safety barriers on their blind ends, they did not need such installations that the R42s received.

===Mishaps and Overhaul===
Pair 4200–4201 was badly damaged in a rear-end accident on the North Channel Bridge on September 12, 1970 and subsequently scrapped. On February 12, 1974, pair 4420–4421 was damaged when they were rear-ended by R6 # 1236, which also suffered extensive damage due to brake failure at Church Avenue station on the southbound express track between 7th Ave and Church Ave. Due to the damage sustained in the incidents above, both pairs were scrapped prior to the rebuilding of the R40/R40A fleet.

From 1987–1989, the R40s and R40As were rebuilt by Sumitomo Corp. of America in Elmira Heights, New York. All cars now sported an unpainted silver exterior and new interior designs. In addition, air conditioning was retrofitted into the slant-ended cars that were not equipped with it from the factory. Lastly, the distinctive &quot;EXP&quot; (express) and &quot;LOCAL&quot; marker lights on the slant-ended cars were also removed.

Car number 4259 was struck by an train led by R42 car 4918 near 9th Avenue on 2/5/1995. It was partially repaired, but never returned to service and was ultimately sunken as an artificial reef in January 2008.

Car number 4260 derailed in the tunnel near 9th Avenue on 8/15/1994 and was scrapped in 2001. Its nose was used to rebuild straight-ended R40A number 4461 into a slant-ended car.

Car numbers 4427 and 4428 collided at the Bushwick Avenue–Aberdeen Street station on the route on 1/8/1996 and sustained severe damage. They were both scrapped in 2001.

Cars 4258 and 4261, as well as cars 4426 and 4429, all of which had lost their mates in the above incidents, were mated as pairs.

On June 5, 1995, R42 number 4664 was rear-ended by straight-ended R40A number 4461 on the Williamsburg Bridge. The R42 was written off as it had sustained major damage, while the R40A was repaired and rebuilt into a slant-ended car. It was temporarily numbered 4260, as it was intended to be mated to R40 number 4259, but never returned to service (see below). Meanwhile, straight-ended R40A number 4460 and R42 number 4665 became paired with each other. This pair today survives as part of the museum fleet.

===Retirement===
The R160 subway car order replaced all of the R40s and R40As from 2007 to 2009. The R40s and slant-ended R40As were retired from October 2007 to June 12, 2009, when the last slant-ended train made its final trip on the . The straight-ended R40As were retired from January 2009 until August 28, 2009, when the last pair ran on the in a mixed-consist with four R42 pairs.

After retirement, most cars were stripped and sunk as artificial reefs in the Atlantic Ocean. The last R40/R40A cars to be removed from property by barge were R40 4272 and straight-ended R40As 4474–4475, which were reefed on April 17, 2010. However, R40 pair 4162–4163 and slant-ended R40A pairs 4392–4393 and 4442–4443 were retained as school cars until 2013. These cars were eventually decommissioned and trucked to Sims Metal Management in Newark, New Jersey, from April 2013 to October 1, 2013, for scrapping, as the reefing program had ended in April 2010.

R40s 4280–4281 (originally numbered 4380–4381) are preserved for the New York Transit Museum. They were restored to operating status in 2013–2014 and have been operating on New York City Transit Museum-sponsored excursions since August 2014, specifically on the &quot;Train of Many Metals&quot; (&quot;TOMM&quot;). Before cars 4280–4281 were selected for preservation, cars 4192–4193 were temporarily displayed at the New York Transit Museum in 2008, but they were later stripped and reefed.

In addition to the R40 pair, several straight-ended R40As have survived. The full list includes:
* 4460 (and its R42 mate 4665) – preserved by the Railway Preservation Corporation and stored at Coney Island Yard.
* 4461 (rebuilt into a slant-ended car and renumbered to 4260) – currently at the Randall&#x27;s Island FDNY Facility, used with R62s 1366 and 1370 as training cars.
* Pair 4480–4481 – preserved by the New York Transit Museum. The cars were stored at the Concourse Yard until 2014, when they were moved to the 207th Street Yard.

<text>Joseph Hillis Miller Jr. (March 5, 1928 – February 7, 2021) was an American literary critic and scholar who advanced theories of literary deconstruction. He was part of the Yale School along with scholars including Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, and Geoffrey Hartman, who advocated deconstruction as an analytical means by which the relationship between literary text and the associated meaning could be analyzed. Through his career, Miller was associated with the Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, and University of California, Irvine, and wrote over 50 books studying a wide range of American and British literature using principles of deconstruction.

== Early life ==
Miller was born in Newport News, Virginia, on March 5, 1928, to Nell Martin (née Crizer) and J. Hillis Miller Sr. His mother was a homemaker and his father a Baptist minister who was professor of psychology at the College of William &amp; Mary, and would go on to serve as the president of the University of Florida.

Miller graduated from Oberlin College (BA &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, 1948) switching his major of study from Physics to English. He moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to start his masters at Harvard University. During this time, he contracted polio and was noted to have completed his dissertation writing with his left hand, having lost the ability to use his right hand. He completed his masters from the university in 1949 and his PhD in 1952.

== Career ==
Miller started his career as a member of the faculty at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in 1953. During this time, Miller was heavily influenced by fellow Johns Hopkins professor and Belgian literary critic Georges Poulet and the Geneva School of literary criticism, which Miller characterized as &quot;the consciousness of the consciousness of another, the transposition of the mental universe of an author into the interior space of the critic&#x27;s mind.&quot; This was also the time that was introduced to Paul de Man who was a member of a faculty and Jacques Derrida, a visiting professor, with whom he would remain associated.

In 1972, he joined the faculty at Yale University where he taught for fourteen years. At Yale, he worked alongside prominent literary critics Paul de Man and Geoffrey Hartman, where they were collectively known as the Yale School of deconstruction, in contention with prominent Yale influence theorist Harold Bloom.

By this time, Miller had emerged as an important humanities and literature scholar specializing in Victorian and Modernist literature, with a keen interest in the ethics of reading and reading as a cultural act. At a time, he was supervising at least 14 doctoral dissertations studying Victorian literature and novels.

In 1986, Miller left Yale to work at the University of California Irvine, where he was later followed by his Yale colleague Derrida. During the same year, he served as president of the Modern Language Association, and was honored by the MLA with a lifetime achievement award in 2005. In 2004, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Both at Yale and UC Irvine, Miller mentored an entire generation of American literary critics including noted queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. He was Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California Irvine until 2001.

After his retirement, he wrote over 15 books and many articles in journals and was also active on the international lecturing circuit. He was also served on dissertation committees in his retirement supervising dissertations and doctoral theses works at UC Irvine, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Queensland.

=== Role as a deconstructionist ===
Miller was associated with a group of scholars including Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, and Geoffrey Hartman, collectively referred to as the Yale School, who advanced deconstruction, an analytical approach of associating and drawing linkages between literary text and the associated meaning. The theory espoused that words and texts had linkages to other expressed words and texts. These built on ideas and themes that Derrida and de Man had brought along from Europe, while Miller joined them. He applied these techniques to a range of American and British works, including prose as well as poetry. Throughout his career, he would go on to write over 35 books and many articles in journals advancing these themes.

Miller defined the movement as searching for &quot;the thread in the text in question which will unravel it all&quot;, and said that there are multiple layers to any text, both its clear surface and its deep countervailing subtext: On the one hand, the &quot;obvious and univocal reading&quot; always contains the &quot;deconstructive reading&quot; as a parasite encrypted within itself as part of itself. On the other hand, the &quot;deconstructive&quot; reading can by no means free itself from the metaphysical reading it means to contest.Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Critic as Host&quot; could be viewed as a reply to M. H. Abrams, who presented a paper, &quot;The Deconstructive Angel,&quot; at a session of the Modern Language Association in December 1976, criticizing deconstruction and the methods of Miller. Miller presented his paper just after Abrams&#x27;s presentation at the same session. He made the case that words and text lacking objective outside or providing meaning didn&#x27;t mean they were the &quot;prison-house of language,&quot; but, instead, they were a &quot;place of joy&quot; where the critics had the freedom to associate and provide various possibilities eventually guiding the meaning. The movement continued to gain popularity through the next decade, presenting a paper called &quot;Triumph of Theory&quot; at the 1986 session of the Modern Language Association. He was also noted to have made the topic of deconstruction more accessible to a wider audience by publishing in magazines including &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot; The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

He was also a defender of the movement in the late 1980s when the field was losing some of its popularity. He leaned on ideas that he termed &#x27;ethics of learning&#x27; where he countered critics by arguing that it was the reader&#x27;s obligation to try and find meaning in the text even when it appeared impossible.

== Personal life ==
Miller married Dorothy James in 1949, and remained married until her death in January 2021. The couple had two daughters and a son. Miller died from COVID-19 on February 7, 2021, the month after Dorothy&#x27;s death, at his home in Sedgwick, Maine; he was 92.

Magliola, pp. 176–187, demonstrates deconstructive literary criticism as it was practiced in the U.S.A. circa 1970s-1980s, but also argues that J. Hillis Miller seems not to exploit the full implications of Derridean deconstruction (see in particular pp. 176–77 and 186-87).

<text>Six-man football is a variant of gridiron football played with six players per team, instead of the standard eleven or twelve. It is generally played by high schools in rural areas of the United States and Canada.

==History==
Six-man football was developed in 1934 by Stephen Epler in Chester, Nebraska, as an alternative means for small high schools to field a football team during the Great Depression. The first game was played on Thursday, September 27, 1934, at the Hebron, Nebraska Athletic Gridiron, with a crowd of almost 1000 watching. This game was played so that coaches all over Kansas and Nebraska could see if they wanted to try this new game of six-man. The two teams playing in the game were the combined team from Hardy-Chester (&quot;Hard-Chests&quot;) and a combined team from Belvidere-Alexandria (&quot;Belvalex&quot;). The two teams had two weeks to practice prior to this game; the two teams played to a 19-19 tie. After that night, rules for the game were distributed to about 60,000 coaches in the United States.

On October 5, 1940, Windham High School from Windham, Ohio, defeated Stamford Collegiate of Niagara Falls, Ontario, 39-1 in the first international six-man football game.

==Notable players==
Jack Pardee (April 19, 1936 – April 1, 2013) began his football career as a teenager in Christoval, Texas, where he excelled as a member of the six-man football team.[1] He was an All-American linebacker at Texas A&amp;M University and a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971). He was one of the few six-man players to ever make it to the NFL, and his knowledge of that wide-open game served him well as a coach. Pardee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. Following his playing career, Pardee went on to coach, becoming the only head coach to helm a team in college football, the National Football League, the United States Football League, the World Football League, and the Canadian Football League.

Ed Sprinkle (September 3, 1923 – July 28, 2014) played six-man football at Tuscola High School in 1939, and became known to many as &quot;The Meanest Man in Pro Football&quot;, nicknamed &quot;the Claw&quot;. Prior to his NFL career, Sprinkle won three letters in football and two in basketball and earned All-Border Conference while at Hardin–Simmons University in the early 1940s. He earned all-Eastern honors in 1943 while attending the United States Naval Academy. He played for twelve seasons with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League and is credited with calling attention to the NFL&#x27;s defensive players. At first, he played on both defense and offense. He caught 32 passes for 451 yards and seven touchdowns during his professional career. His ability to rush opposing quarterbacks, however, made him a defensive specialist, earning four Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Game play==

There are two versions of six-man football, one American and one Canadian.

Six-man American football is played on an 80-yard-long (73-m) by 40-yard-wide (37-m) field in most circumstances; the high school rulebook allows games to be held on a normal 100-yd (91-m) by 53-yd (48.8-m) field used in eleven-man football if the teams and leagues so choose. Furthermore, the game specifies a 15-yard distance (14-m) from the line of scrimmage to gain a first down, instead of the normal 10 yards (9 m).

Six-man Canadian football is similar, but the length of the field can be either 100 or 110 yards long by 40 yards wide. End zones can be either 10 yards or up to 20 yards deep. Normal twelve-man Canadian fields are 110 yards long and 65 yards wide, with 20-yard end zones and ten yards to gain a first down, with the offense provided three downs to gain sufficient yardage rather than four downs as in the American game; this remains unchanged in the six-man variant.

All six players are eligible to be receivers in the American game, while in the Canadian game, the player in the centre of the offensive line is ineligible. On offense, three linemen are required on the line of scrimmage at the start of the play. The player to whom the ball is snapped cannot advance the ball past the line of scrimmage (thus eliminating such plays as the bootleg or scramble); however, if the ball is tossed to another player, that player can run or throw the ball and the player to whom the ball was snapped is still an eligible receiver. All forward passes to the player who snapped the ball (center) must travel at least 1 yard (1 m) in flight.

==Scoring==
Six-man American football scoring is the same as for eleven men, except on the point after touchdown (PAT) attempt and the field goal. A point-after kick is worth two points, while a conversion made by running or passing the ball is worth one point. A field goal is worth four points instead of three. These rule changes were made because of the difficulty of successfully getting a kick off with so few blockers on the line compared to the number of defenders. Six-man Canadian football also inverts the point values of PATs and conversions, but retains the three-point field goal and, additionally, retains the one-point rouge that is unique to the Canadian game.

In both University Interscholastic League and Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools competition, a 45-point &quot;mercy rule&quot; exists to prevent lopsided scoring deficits (no such rule exists in the standard Texan game). The game is ended under this rule if a team is losing by 45 or more points at halftime or at any point after. The mercy rule is alluded to in the title of the David Morse film about six-man football, &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot;. In Canada, a 35-point mercy rule is used that changes the clock to be constantly running rather than ending the game immediately.

Scoring tends to be much higher in six-man games, which have exceeded 100 points several times per season.

==Modernity==
As of the 2017–2018 alignments from UIL, TAPPS, TAIAO, TCAF, and T-CAL, the state of Texas has 262 six-man football teams (69 in UIL Division I, 69 in UIL Division II, 52 in TAPPS 19 in TAIAO, 18 in TCAF and 17 in T-CAL).

Texas Charter School Academic and Athletic League (TCSAAL) held its inaugural Six-Man Football Varsity State Championship on November 20, 2015, at East View High School in Georgetown, Texas, in which Inspired Vision Academy defeated West Columbia Charter School for the championship.

TCSAAL held its second annual Six-Man Football State Championship on November 14, 2016, at Warrior Stadium at South Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie. Inspired Vision Academy lost to UME Preparatory Academy 999-0 (the scoreboard could only display three digits) for their second consecutive TCSAAL Six-Man Varsity State Championship.

The state of Florida has 32 teams playing six-man football in the Florida Christian Association of Private and Parochial Schools. FCAPPS comprises small Christian or private schools and at least one home-school cooperative. Teams in the conference are as far south as the Florida Keys to as far north as Jacksonville.

The state of Alabama has eight teams playing as part of the Christian Football Association (www.cfafootball.org) which is a sister organization to the Alabama Christian Education Athletic Association (ACEAA).

The state of Colorado has 23 teams currently playing six-man football, with the majority of teams being from small towns located in eastern Colorado.

As of 2013, Idaho has two teams that play six-man football; they play against makeshift junior varsity teams or teams in Montana. Idaho has not sanctioned six-man football, but approved it for a pilot program. It was made particularly for schools that were small and too far removed geographically to have a reasonable co-operative program with a neighboring school. Idaho did play six-man football in the 1940s.

The sport is also played by high schools in Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, and Wyoming, and in parts of Canada.

As of 2013, no leagues (professional, semiprofessional, or amateur) play the game past the high-school level. The last one, the San Antonio-based Texas Sixman Football League, converted to eight-man football after the 2012 season. The Central Florida-based Southeastern Christian Association of Sixman Football ceased operations in the late 2000s, and the Pennsylvania 6-Man Football League also converted to eight-man around the same time.

Currently, a women&#x27;s league is playing six-(wo)man football – the Independent Women&#x27;s Football League.

In 2024, The Arena League launched a professional league under the six-man format. The Arena League plays on a standard indoor American football field but without goalposts (and thus no kicking). In 2025, TAL shifted to a seven-on-seven format, stating that it felt that the seven-man format would be more palatable to a broader audience.

==Literature==
In 2005, coach C.H. Underwood authored what is considered to be the definitive strategy and play book for the game, &quot;Six Man Football&quot;, published by Bright Sky Press. A player during the 1960s and coach of the first Texas State Six-Man Championship team in 1972, Underwood provides a thorough dissertation on the small-town sport from both analytical and historical perspectives.

Another Bright Sky Press book, published in 2003, &quot;Grit and Glory: Six-Man Football&quot;, is a collection of photographs that capture the spirit of the game and its players. &quot;Grit and Glory&quot; exclusively showcases the work of art photographer Laura Wilson, mother of actors Owen, Luke, and Andrew Wilson.

In 2009, Dee Kelly, wrote a fictional book, &quot;A Good Man&#x27;s Sin&quot;, based on a boy moving from the city to the country and playing six-man football in Indian Gap, Texas, before making it to the NFL. It explains the rules of the game and small-town football. It portrays the mid-1970s six-man football teams in central Texas consistently to the teams of that time when Cherokee and Marathon were powerhouses.

==Film==
&quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot;, released in 2002, used six-man football as played in Montana as the backdrop for an examination of the relationship between a fatherless renegade football player and his loner coach. The film contains a brief but adequate explanation of how the game of six-man football is played, as well as footage of actual game sequences. The title refers to a rule in which a game is called in the second half if one team gains a 45-point advantage over the other. In other states, it is referred to as the mercy rule. When invoked, one team is said to have &quot;45ed&quot; the other.

&quot;Six Man, Texas&quot;, released in 2008, is a documentary film that explores six-man football as identity in the public high schools of the 160 small towns in Texas that play it.

&quot;The Seventh Man&quot;, released in 2003, documents two years in the lives of the Panther Creek Panthers, one of the storied programs in Texas six-man football. It features the narration of Val Kilmer.

A Texas-6 CBS documentary looks at the 2019 Strawn, Texas Greyhounds, who had won four titles and were trying to repeat with the coach who made it all happen.

<doc id="603255" wikidata="Q1065887" url="?curid=603255" title="Return to Forever">
<text>Return to Forever was an American jazz fusion band that was founded by pianist Chick Corea in 1972. The band has had many members, with the only consistent bandmate of Corea&#x27;s being bassist Stanley Clarke. Along with Weather Report, The Headhunters, and Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever is often cited as one of the core groups of the jazz-fusion movement of the 1970s. Several musicians, including Clarke, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira and Al Di Meola, came to prominence through their performances on Return to Forever albums.

After playing on Miles Davis&#x27;s jazz-fusion albums &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; (1969) and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1970), Corea formed an avant-garde jazz band called Circle with Dave Holland, Anthony Braxton and Barry Altschul. In 1972, after converting to Scientology, Corea decided he wanted to communicate better with his audience. This meant performing a more accessible style of music than avant-garde jazz.

Return to Forever first disbanded in 1977 after five years and seven studio albums. The band never released another studio album, but occasionally reunited for live performances until Corea&#x27;s death in 2021.

==History==
===First group (1972–1973)===
The first edition of Return to Forever performed primarily Latin-oriented music. This initial band consisted of singer and percussionist Flora Purim, her husband Airto Moreira (both Brazilians) on drums and percussion, Corea&#x27;s longtime musical co-worker Joe Farrell on saxophone and flute, and the young Stanley Clarke on bass. Within this first line-up in particular, Clarke played acoustic double bass in addition to electric bass. Corea&#x27;s Fender Rhodes electric piano formed the basis of this group&#x27;s sound; he had yet to discover synthesizers, his trademark sound in the group&#x27;s later years. Clarke and Farrell were given ample solo space themselves. While Purim&#x27;s vocals lent some commercial appeal to the music, many of their compositions were also instrumental and somewhat experimental in nature. The music was composed by Corea with the exception of the title track of the second album which was written by Stanley Clarke. Lyrics were often written by Corea&#x27;s friend Neville Potter, and were quite often Scientology-themed.

Their first album, titled simply &quot;Return to Forever&quot;, was recorded for ECM Records in 1972, and was initially released only in Europe. This album featured Corea&#x27;s now famous compositions &quot;Crystal Silence&quot; and &quot;La Fiesta&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Corea, Airto, Clarke and Tony Williams formed the band for Stan Getz&#x27;s album &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (1974), which featured Corea&#x27;s compositions, including some from the first and second Return to Forever albums. Their second album, &quot;Light as a Feather&quot; (1973), was released by Polydor and included the song &quot;Spain&quot;, which also became quite well known.

===Jazz rock era (1973–1976)===

After the second album, Farrell, Purim and Moreira left the group to form their own bands, and guitarist Bill Connors, drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Mingo Lewis were added. However, Gadd was unwilling to tour with the band and risk his job as an in-demand session drummer. Lenny White (who had played with Corea in Miles Davis&#x27;s band) replaced Gadd and Lewis on drums and percussion, and the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy&quot; (1973), was then re-recorded (the first recording, featuring Gadd on drums, was never released and has since disappeared).

The nature of the group&#x27;s music had by now completely changed into jazz-rock, and had evolved into a similar vein to that which the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, and some progressive rock bands were performing at the time. Their music was still relatively melodic, relying on strong themes, but the jazz element was by this time almost entirely absent, replaced by a more direct, rock oriented approach. Over-driven, distorted guitar had also become prominent in the band&#x27;s new sound, and Clarke had by then switched almost completely to the electric bass. A replacement on vocals was not hired, and all the songs were now instrumentals. This change did not lead to a decrease in the band&#x27;s commercial fortunes however, Return to Forever&#x27;s jazz rock albums instead found their way onto US pop album charts.

In the September 1988 &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine interview with Chick Corea by Josef Woodward, Josef says (page 19), &quot;There is this general view ... that ... Miles [Davis] crystallized electric jazz fusion and that he sent his emissaries out.&quot; Chick responds, &quot;Nah, that&#x27;s Disneyland. Miles is definitely a leader ... But there were other things that occurred that I thought were equally as important. What John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. ... John&#x27;s band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair move.&quot;

While their second jazz rock album, &quot;Where Have I Known You Before&quot; (1974) was similar in style to its immediate predecessor, Corea now played synthesizers in addition to electric keyboards (including piano), and Clarke&#x27;s playing had evolved considerably- now using flange and fuzz-tone effects, and with his signature style beginning to emerge. After Bill Connors left the band to concentrate on his solo career, the group also hired new guitarists. Although Earl Klugh played guitar for some of the group&#x27;s live performances, he was soon replaced by the then 19-year-old guitar prodigy Al Di Meola, who had also played on the album recording sessions.

Their following album, &quot;No Mystery&quot; (1975), was recorded with the same line-up as &quot;Where Have I Known You Before&quot;, but the style of music had become more varied. The first side of the record consisted primarily of jazz-funk, while the second side featured Corea&#x27;s acoustic title track and a long composition with a strong Spanish influence. On this and the following album, each member of the group composed at least one of the tracks. &quot;No Mystery&quot; went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group.

The final album by this longest-lasting &quot;classic&quot; lineup of the group, which had by this time left Polydor for Columbia Records, was &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot; (1976), the best selling of all Return to Forever&#x27;s efforts, eventually reaching gold disc status. &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot; continued their experiments in the realms of jazz-rock and related musical genres, and was lauded by critics for both the technically demanding style of its compositions as well as for its accomplished musicianship.

After the release of &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot; and Return to Forever&#x27;s subsequent tour in support (as well as having in addition signed a multimillion-dollar contract with CBS), Corea shocked Clarke by deciding to change the lineup of the group and to not include either White or Di Meola.

===Final album (1977)===
The final incarnation of Return to Forever featured Corea, Clarke and Joe Farrell as well as a four-piece horn section and Corea&#x27;s wife Gayle Moran on vocals, but recorded only one studio album, &quot;Musicmagic&quot; (1977).

In 1978, after issuing a live album of the tour titled &quot;Return to Forever Live: The Complete Concert&quot; (a four-LP set, also released in edited form as a single LP and later as a double CD), Chick Corea officially disbanded the group.

=== Reunions ===
In 1982, the Corea/Clarke/White/Di Meola lineup reunited to record a ten-minute track, &quot;Compadres&quot;, which was issued on Corea&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Touchstone&quot;. 
Also, they played at The Wolf &amp; Rissmiller&#x27;s Country Club, Reseda, California, with Joe Henderson on April 7, 1982.

In 1983, the same Return to Forever lineup played a short reunion tour of the U.S. and Japan, and the live recording in Japan was released in 2021. The repertoire for the tour included some new material by Corea, including one piece titled &quot;Overture&quot; that was later recorded by the Chick Corea Elektric Band for the live various artists double album &quot;GRP Super Live in Concert&quot; (1992), and another titled &quot;The Phantom&quot; that Di Meola later recorded on his album &quot;Kiss My Axe&quot; (1991).

Twenty-six years later, Corea, Clarke, White, and Di Meola reunited a second time for a tour of the United States and Europe that began in the summer of 2008. A boxed set of remixed and digitally remastered tracks from the albums &quot;Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Where Have I Known You Before&quot;, &quot;No Mystery&quot;, and &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot; was released to coincide with the tour.

Corea, Clarke, and White (minus Di Meola) performed an acoustic tour in 2009 and released a live album in 2011 titled &quot;Forever&quot;. It included guest appearances by Bill Connors, Chaka Khan, and Jean-Luc Ponty.

In February 2011 the group began a world tour in Australia. The lineup for this tour was Corea, Clarke, White, Ponty, and guitarist Frank Gambale of the Chick Corea Elektric Band. Many dates included Dweezil Zappa&#x27;s Zappa Plays Zappa band as an opening act with Corea occasionally appearing in Zappa&#x27;s band on keyboards, as well as Jean-Luc Ponty performing some of the songs that he had performed with Frank Zappa.

Corea died of cancer on February 9, 2021.

<doc id="603257" wikidata="Q379339" url="?curid=603257" title="Let It Bleed">
<text>Let It Bleed is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 28 November 1969 by London Records in the United States and on 5 December 1969 by Decca Records in the United Kingdom. Released during the band&#x27;s 1969 American Tour, it is the follow-up to &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968), and like that album is a return to the group&#x27;s more blues-oriented approach that was prominent in the pre-&quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966) period of their career. Additional sounds on the album draw influence from gospel, country blues and country rock.

The album was recorded during a period of turmoil in the band; Brian Jones, the band&#x27;s founder and original leader, had become increasingly unreliable in the studio due to heavy drug use, and during most recording sessions was either absent, or so incapacitated that he was unable to contribute meaningfully. He was fired in the midst of recording sessions for this album, and replaced by Mick Taylor. Jones died within a month of being fired; he contributed to only two songs, playing backing instruments.

Taylor had been hired after principal recording was complete on many of the tracks, and appears on two songs, having recorded some guitar overdubs. Keith Richards was the band&#x27;s sole guitarist during most of the recording sessions, being responsible for nearly all of the rhythm and lead parts. The other Stones members (vocalist Mick Jagger, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts) appear on nearly every track, with contributions by percussionist Jimmy Miller (who also produced the album), keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart (himself a former member of the band), and guest musicians including Ry Cooder.

The album reached top ten positions in several markets, including reaching number one in the UK and number three in the US. While no high-charting singles were released from the album, many of its songs became staples of Rolling Stones live shows and on rock radio stations, including &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, both of which frequently appear on lists of the greatest songs ever. The album was voted number 40 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd edition (2000). In 2005, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and is on various iterations of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

== Recording ==
Although the Rolling Stones had begun the recording of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; in November 1968, before &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; had been released, recording for &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; began in earnest in February 1969 and continued sporadically until early November. Brian Jones, the band&#x27;s original leader and founder, had, over the course of the recording of the previous two albums, become increasingly detached from the group. Though present in the studio, he was frequently too intoxicated to contribute meaningfully, and after a motorcycle accident in May 1969, missed several recording sessions whilst recovering. Always a talented multi-instrumentalist, Jones had previously contributed extensively on guitar, forming an integral part of the dual-guitar sound that was central to the band&#x27;s chemistry. He was fired from the band during the recording of &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, having performed on only two tracks: playing autoharp on &quot;You Got the Silver&quot;, and percussion on &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;. A month after being fired, Jones was found at the bottom of his swimming pool at his home. The coroner&#x27;s report stated this was a drowning, later revised to &quot;death by misadventure&quot;.

As with the previous album, most of the guitar parts were recorded instead by the band&#x27;s other guitarist, Keith Richards, during the period of principal recording. Jones&#x27;s replacement, Mick Taylor, appears on just two tracks, &quot;Country Honk&quot; and &quot;Live with Me&quot;, having contributed some overdubs during the May 1969 London Olympic Studios recording sessions. He also appears on &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, a stand-alone single recorded during the &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; sessions.

Richards sang his first solo lead vocal on a Rolling Stones recording with &quot;You Got the Silver&quot;, having previously sung harmony and background vocals with primary vocalist Mick Jagger on &quot;Connection&quot; and shared alternating lead vocals with Jagger on parts of &quot;Something Happened to Me Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. Additional vocals were provided by the London Bach Choir, who sang on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;. The choir distanced themselves from their contribution, however, citing what author Stephen Davis terms its &quot;relentless drug ambience&quot;. Bassist Bill Wyman appears on every track except for two, on which Richards played bass. Drummer Charlie Watts performed on all of the tracks except for &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;; he struggled to attain the sought-after rhythm, so producer Jimmy Miller filled in for him instead.

&quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was originally scheduled for release in July 1969. Although &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; was released as a single that month, the album itself was delayed and eventually released in December 1969, after the band&#x27;s US tour had completed. The majority of the album was recorded at Olympic Studios in London, with further work taking place at Elektra Sound Recorders Studios in Los Angeles, California, while the Stones prepared for the tour. The Los Angeles-recorded portions included overdubs by guest musicians Merry Clayton (on &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;), Byron Berline (on &quot;Country Honk&quot;), and Bobby Keys and Leon Russell (on &quot;Live with Me&quot;).

==Musical style==
As with &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; the previous year, the album marks a return to the group&#x27;s more blues-based approach that was prominent in the pre-&quot;Aftermath&quot; period of their career. The main inspiration during this string of albums was American roots music and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; is no exception, drawing heavily from gospel (evident in &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;), Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers (&quot;Country Honk&quot;), Chicago blues (&quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;), as well as country blues (&quot;You Got the Silver&quot;, &quot;Love in Vain&quot;) and country rock (&quot;Let It Bleed&quot;).

Don Heckman, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, felt that &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was a &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;passionately erotic&quot; album of hard rock and blues, influenced by African-American music. Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, said it &quot;extends the rock and blues feel of &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; into slightly harder-rocking, more demonically sexual territory&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s James McNair felt the record had an emphasis on &quot;earthy&quot; country blues.

Through their experimentation during the mid-1960s, the band had developed an eclectic approach to arrangements. Slide guitar playing is prominent (played entirely by Richards, except &quot;Country Honk&quot;, which was performed by Taylor), and is featured on all songs except &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, &quot;Live with Me&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, giving the album an authentic blues feel throughout. In addition, an array of session musicians embellish the songs with various instruments. Alongside the piano performances (Ian Stewart, Nicky Hopkins), the record included fiddle (Byron Berline), mandolin (Ry Cooder), organ and French horn (Al Kooper), as well as vibraphone (Wyman) and autoharp (Wyman and Jones). Of more importance, however, was the debut of both renowned saxophonist Bobby Keys on &quot;Live with Me&quot;, a musician who was integral at giving the group&#x27;s arrangements a soul/jazz background, and Taylor, who took on lead guitar duties with technically proficient playing, giving the band a harder rock sound during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

=== Lyrics ===
Jann Wenner, in a 1995 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with Jagger, describes the album&#x27;s songs as &quot;disturbing&quot; and the scenery as &quot;ugly&quot;. When asked if the Vietnam War played a role in the album&#x27;s worldview, Jagger said: &quot;I think so. Even though I was living in America only part time, I was influenced. All those images were on television. Plus, the spill out onto campuses&quot;.

== Release ==
The album was released in the US as an LP record, reel-to-reel tape, audio cassette and 8-track cartridge in 1969, and as a remastered CD and chrome cassette tape in 1986. In August 2002, it was reissued in a remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records, and once more in 2010 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese only SHM-SACD version. A mono version was included in the 2016 box-set &quot;The Rolling Stones in Mono&quot;. In September 2019, a remastered 50th anniversary edition of &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was announced for release by ABKCO on November 15. It comes with two 180g vinyl LPs with the album in both stereo and mono. Bob Ludwig remastered &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; for its 50th anniversary reissue.

=== Packaging ===
Jagger asked artist M. C. Escher to design a cover for the album, but he declined. Robert Brownjohn then designed the cover, which displays a surreal sculpture. The image consists of the &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; record being played by the tone-arm of an antique phonograph, and a record-changer spindle supporting several items stacked on a plate in place of a stack of records: a film canister labelled &quot;Stones – Let It Bleed&quot;, a clock dial, a pizza, a bicycle tire and a cake with elaborate icing topped by figurines representing the band. The cake parts of the construction were prepared by then-unknown cookery writer Delia Smith. The reverse of the LP sleeve shows the same &quot;record-stack&quot; melange in a state of disarray. The artwork was inspired by the working title of the album, which was &quot;Automatic Changer&quot;.

The album cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010.

== Reception ==

Released in December, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart (temporarily demoting the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot;) and number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the US, where it was eventually certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, music critic Greil Marcus said that the middle of the album has &quot;great&quot; songs, but &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; &quot;seem to matter most&quot; because they &quot;both reach for reality and end up confronting it, almost mastering what&#x27;s real, or what reality will feel like as the years fade in.&quot; Robert Christgau named it the fourth-best album of 1969 in his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics poll. In later commentaries, he has said the album &quot;still speak[s] to me with startling fullness and authority&quot;, with the quality of the &quot;playing&quot; alone &quot;fantastic&quot;, and that despite some &quot;duff moments&quot; on side two, every song &quot;stands up&quot;.

In a retrospective review, &quot;NME&quot; magazine said that the album &quot;tugs and teases&quot; in various musical directions and called it &quot;a classic&quot;. In his 2001 Stones biography, Stephen Davis said of the album &quot;No rock record, before or since, has ever so completely captured the sense of palpable dread that hung over its era.&quot; In a five-star review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004, Gavin Edwards praised Richards&#x27; guitar playing throughout the album, and stated: &quot;Whether it was spiritual, menstrual or visceral, the Stones made sure you went home covered in blood.&quot; Jason McNeil of PopMatters wrote that &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; are &quot;the two greatest albums the band&#x27;s (or anyone&#x27;s) ever made&quot;. In Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was one in the Stones&#x27; series of four studio LPs—including &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968), &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971) and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972)—that was &quot;the greatest run of albums in history&quot;.

The album was included in a &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked it at number 28 in its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; at 24th on their &quot;100 Greatest Albums of R &#x27;n&#x27; R&quot; survey. In 1997, it was voted the 27th-best album ever by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 32 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot; It maintained the rating in a 2012 revised list, and was ranked at number 41 in a 2020 revised list. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2005.

== Track listing ==
The track listing on the back of the album jacket did not follow the one on the album itself. According to Brownjohn, he altered it purely for visual reasons; the correct order was shown on the record&#x27;s label. Additionally, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; is rendered as &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; on the jacket. Some releases have &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; on the cover, the inner sleeve and the LP label.

<text>Walter Russell Shaw, (December 20, 1887 – May 29, 1981) was a politician from Prince Edward Island.

A native of West River, Shaw was educated at Prince of Wales College, the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and the University of Toronto. On his return to Prince Edward Island, he farmed for several years, becoming a noted livestock breeder. Shaw worked as a civil servant in the provincial department of agriculture from 1934 to 1954, rising to the position of deputy minister. He also helped found the PEI Federation of Agriculture serving as its first general secretary. He entered politics in 1957 when he was chosen leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He led the party to victory in the 1959 election becoming the 22nd premier at the age of 71.

The Shaw government supported the expansion of the province&#x27;s food processing industry, instituted a regional system of high schools and revamped the employment system and pay scale for the civil service. Despite its support for the farming industry, Shaw&#x27;s government failed to reverse the decline in the number of family farms and was unable to successfully diversify the economy. His government was defeated by the Liberal Party in 1966.

Shaw stepped down as party leader in 1968, and was succeeded by George Key, although as Key was not a sitting member of the legislature Shaw continued to serve as leader of the opposition until 1970, when he retired at the age of 82.

In 1971, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Shaw was inducted into the Canadian Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1980.

<doc id="603273" wikidata="Q675287" url="?curid=603273" title="Magnification">
<text>Magnification is the process of enlarging the apparent size, not physical size, of something. This enlargement is quantified by a size ratio called optical magnification. When this number is less than one, it refers to a reduction in size, sometimes called de-magnification.

Typically, magnification is related to scaling up visuals or images to be able to see more detail, increasing resolution, using microscope, printing techniques, or digital processing. In all cases, the magnification of the image does not change the perspective of the image.

==Examples of magnification==
Some optical instruments provide visual aid by magnifying small or distant subjects.

* A magnifying glass, which uses a positive (convex) lens to make things look bigger by allowing the user to hold them closer to their eye.
* A telescope, which uses its large objective lens or primary mirror to create an image of a distant object and then allows the user to examine the image closely with a smaller eyepiece lens, thus making the object look larger.
* A microscope, which makes a small object appear as a much larger image at a comfortable distance for viewing. A microscope is similar in layout to a telescope except that the object being viewed is close to the objective, which is usually much smaller than the eyepiece.
* A slide projector, which projects a large image of a small slide on a screen. A photographic enlarger is similar.
* A zoom lens, a system of camera lens elements for which the focal length and angle of view can be varied.

==Size ratio (optical magnification)==
Optical magnification is the ratio between the apparent size of an object (or its size in an image) and its true size, and thus it is a dimensionless number. Optical magnification is sometimes referred to as &quot;power&quot; (for example &quot;10× power&quot;), although this can lead to confusion with optical power.

===Linear or transverse magnification===
For real images, such as images projected on a screen, &quot;size&quot; means a linear dimension (measured, for example, in millimeters or inches).

===Angular magnification===
For optical instruments with an eyepiece, the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece (virtual image at infinite distance) cannot be given, thus &quot;size&quot; means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point (angular size). Strictly speaking, one should take the tangent of that angle (in practice, this makes a difference only if the angle is larger than a few degrees). Thus, angular magnification is given by:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle subtended by the object at the front focal point of the objective and formula_3 is the angle subtended by the image at the rear focal point of the eyepiece.

For example, the mean angular size of the Moon&#x27;s disk as viewed from Earth&#x27;s surface is about 0.52°. Thus, through binoculars with 10× magnification, the Moon appears to subtend an angle of about 5.2°.

By convention, for magnifying glasses and optical microscopes, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: from the eye.

==By instrument==

===Single lens===
The linear magnification of a thin lens is

formula_4

where formula_5 is the focal length, formula_6 is the distance from the lens to the object, and formula_7 as the distance of the object with respect to the front focal point. A sign convention is used such that formula_8 and formula_9 (the image distance from the lens) are positive for real object and image, respectively, and negative for virtual object and images, respectively. formula_5 of a converging lens is positive while for a diverging lens it is negative.

For real images, formula_11 is negative and the image is inverted. For virtual images, formula_11 is positive and the image is upright.

With formula_13 being the distance from the lens to the image, formula_14 the height of the image and formula_15 the height of the object, the magnification can also be written as:

formula_16

Note again that a negative magnification implies an inverted image.

The image magnification along the optical axis direction formula_17, called longitudinal magnification, can also be defined. The Newtonian lens equation is stated as formula_18, where formula_7 and formula_20 as on-axis distances of an object and the image with respect to respective focal points, respectively. formula_17 is defined as 

formula_22

and by using the Newtonian lens equation, 

formula_23

The longitudinal magnification is always negative, means that, the object and the image move toward the same direction along the optical axis. The longitudinal magnification varies much faster than the transverse magnification, so the 3-dimensional image is distorted.

===Photography===
The image recorded by a photographic film or image sensor is always a real image and is usually inverted. When measuring the height of an inverted image using the cartesian sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for will be negative, and as a result will also be negative. However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is &quot;real is positive, virtual is negative&quot;. Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always and positive. When the focal length is positive the image&#x27;s height, distance and magnification are and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image&#x27;s height, distance and magnification are and negative. Therefore, the &quot;&quot; formulae are traditionally presented as

formula_24

===Magnifying glass===
The maximum angular magnification (compared to the naked eye) of a magnifying glass depends on how the glass and the object are held, relative to the eye. If the lens is held at a distance from the object such that its front focal point is on the object being viewed, the relaxed eye (focused to infinity) can view the image with angular magnification

formula_25

Here, formula_5 is the focal length of the lens in centimeters. The constant 25 cm is an estimate of the &quot;near point&quot; distance of the eye—the closest distance at which the healthy naked eye can focus. In this case the angular magnification is independent from the distance kept between the eye and the magnifying glass.

If instead the lens is held very close to the eye and the object is placed closer to the lens than its focal point so that the observer focuses on the near point, a larger angular magnification can be obtained, approaching

formula_27

A different interpretation of the working of the latter case is that the magnifying glass changes the diopter of the eye (making it myopic) so that the object can be placed closer to the eye resulting in a larger angular magnification.

===Microscope===
The angular magnification of a microscope is given by

formula_28

where formula_29 is the magnification of the objective and formula_30 the magnification of the eyepiece. The magnification of the objective depends on its focal length formula_31 and on the distance formula_32 between objective back focal plane and the focal plane of the eyepiece (called the tube length):

formula_33

The magnification of the eyepiece depends upon its focal length formula_34 and is calculated by the same equation as that of a magnifying glass:

formula_35

Note that both astronomical telescopes as well as simple microscopes produce an inverted image, thus the equation for the magnification of a telescope or microscope is often given with a minus sign.

===Telescope===
The angular magnification of an optical telescope is given by

formula_36

in which formula_31 is the focal length of the objective lens in a refractor or of the primary mirror in a reflector, and formula_34 is the focal length of the eyepiece.

====Measurement of telescope magnification====
Measuring the actual angular magnification of a telescope is difficult, but it is possible to use the reciprocal relationship between the linear magnification and the angular magnification, since the linear magnification is constant for all objects.

The telescope is focused correctly for viewing objects at the distance for which the angular magnification is to be determined and then the object glass is used as an object the image of which is known as the exit pupil. The diameter of this may be measured using an instrument known as a Ramsden dynameter which consists of a Ramsden eyepiece with micrometer hairs in the back focal plane. This is mounted in front of the telescope eyepiece and used to evaluate the diameter of the exit pupil. This will be much smaller than the object glass diameter, which gives the linear magnification (actually a reduction), the angular magnification can be determined from

formula_39

==Maximum usable magnification==
With any telescope, microscope or lens,
a maximum magnification exists beyond which the image looks bigger but shows no more detail. It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see. Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called &quot;empty magnification&quot;.

For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by diffraction. In practice it is considered to be 2× the aperture in millimetres or 50× the aperture in inches; so, a diameter telescope has a maximum usable magnification of 120×.

With an optical microscope having a high numerical aperture and using oil immersion, the best possible resolution is corresponding to a magnification of around 1200×. Without oil immersion, the maximum usable magnification is around 800×. For details, see limitations of optical microscopes.

Small, cheap telescopes and microscopes are sometimes supplied with the eyepieces that give magnification far higher than is usable.

The maximum relative to the minimum magnification of an optical system is known as zoom ratio.

==&quot;Magnification&quot; of displayed images==

Magnification figures on pictures displayed in print or online can be misleading. Editors of journals and magazines routinely resize images to fit the page, making any magnification number provided in the figure legend incorrect. Images displayed on a computer screen change size based on the size of the screen. A scale bar (or micron bar) is a bar of stated length superimposed on a picture. When the picture is resized the bar will be resized in proportion. If a picture has a scale bar, the actual magnification can easily be calculated. Where the scale (magnification) of an image is important or relevant, including a scale bar is preferable to stating magnification.

<doc id="603274" wikidata="Q2832907" url="?curid=603274" title="Alex Campbell (politician)">
<text>Alexander Bradshaw Campbell (born December 1, 1933) is a former politician of Prince Edward Island, Canada. He is the son of former premier Thane A. Campbell and Cecilia L. Bradshaw. He entered politics by winning a seat in the legislature through a 1965 by-election in 5th Prince. Later the same year he was elected leader of the PEI Liberal Party and, in 1966 took the party to power becoming, at 32, one of the youngest premiers ever elected in Canada. He also held the position of Attorney-General from 1966 until 1969.

== Education ==
Campbell attended Dalhousie University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a law degree, and, in 1959, he passed the bar in Prince Edward Island. In 1971 he was recognized as a &quot;Significant Sig&quot; by the Sigma Chi fraternity, of which he is a member.

== Political career ==
Campbell&#x27;s government attempted to strengthen the province&#x27;s economy and improve social conditions by instituting programs such as assistance to homeowners and homebuilders. His government also revamped the educational system and established the PEI Heritage Foundation. He also started the Land Development Corporation and the PEI Lending Authority to help develop the economy. The government also brought in controls on absentee ownership of land.

== Legal career ==
Campbell left politics in 1978 to sit on the province&#x27;s Supreme Court. Campbell delivered judgment in &quot;Government of P.E.I. v Walker&quot; in 1992, whose 1995 appeal has been cited in more than fifty subsequent cases.

== Personal life ==
A long-time resident of his hometown of Summerside, Campbell was a member of Scouts Canada and later served as a Scout Leader. In his retirement, Campbell now resides in Stanley Bridge during the summer months and is a part-time winter resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, where he has organized a &quot;Prince Edward Island Picnic&quot; at Desoto Park on the second Sunday of March every year since 2000.

Campbell was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2013.

<text>Nanosensors are nanoscale devices that measure physical quantities and convert these to signals that can be detected and analyzed. There are several ways proposed today to make nanosensors; these include top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly, and molecular self-assembly. There are different types of nanosensors in the market and in development for various applications, most notably in defense, environmental, and healthcare industries. These sensors share the same basic workflow: a selective binding of an analyte, signal generation from the interaction of the nanosensor with the bio-element, and processing of the signal into useful metrics.

== Characteristics ==
Nanomaterials-based sensors have several benefits in sensitivity and specificity over sensors made from traditional materials, due to nanomaterial features not present in bulk material that arise at the nanoscale. Nanosensors can have increased specificity because they operate at a similar scale as natural biological processes, allowing functionalization with chemical and biological molecules, with recognition events that cause detectable physical changes. Enhancements in sensitivity stem from the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials, as well as novel physical properties of nanomaterials that can be used as the basis for detection, including nanophotonics. Nanosensors can also potentially be integrated with nanoelectronics to add native processing capability to the nanosensor.

In addition to their sensitivity and specificity, nanosensors offer significant advantages in cost and response times, making them suitable for high-throughput applications. Nanosensors provide real-time monitoring compared to traditional detection methods such as chromatography and spectroscopy. These traditional methods may take days to weeks to obtain results and often require investment in capital costs as well as time for sample preparation.

One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well suited for use in nanosensors, as compared to bulk or thin-film planar devices. They can function both as transducers and wires to transmit the signal. Their high surface area can cause large signal changes upon binding of an analyte. Their small size can enable extensive multiplexing of individually addressable sensor units in a small device. Their operation is also &quot;label free&quot; in the sense of not requiring fluorescent or radioactive labels on the analytes. Zinc oxide nanowire is used for gas sensing applications, given that it exhibits high sensitivity toward low concentration of gas under ambient conditions and can be fabricated easily with low cost.

There are several challenges for nanosensors, including avoiding drift and fouling, developing reproducible calibration methods, applying preconcentration and separation methods to attain a proper analyte concentration that avoids saturation, and integrating the nanosensor with other elements of a sensor package in a reliable manufacturable manner. Because nanosensors are a relatively new technology, there are many unanswered questions regarding nanotoxicology, which currently limits their application in biological systems.

Potential applications for nanosensors include medicine, detection of contaminants and pathogens, and monitoring manufacturing processes and transportation systems. By measuring changes in physical properties (volume, concentration, displacement and velocity, gravitational, electrical, and magnetic forces, pressure, or temperature) nanosensors may be able to distinguish between and recognize certain cells at the molecular level in order to deliver medicine or monitor development to specific places in the body. The type of signal transduction defines the major classification system for nanosensors. Some of the main types of nanosensor readouts include optical, mechanical, vibrational, or electromagnetic.

As an example of classification, nanosensors that use molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) can be divided into three categories, which are electrochemical, piezoelectric, or spectroscopic sensors.  Electrochemical sensors  induce a change in the electrochemical properties of the sensing material, which includes charge, conductivity, and electric potential. Piezoelectric sensors either convert mechanical force into electric force or vice versa. This force is then transduced into a signal. MIP spectroscopic sensors can be divided into three subcategories, which are chemiluminescent sensors, surface plasmon resonance sensors, and fluorescence sensors. As the name suggests, these sensors produce light based signals in forms of chemiluminescence, resonance, and fluorescence. As described by the examples, the type of change that the sensor detects and type of signal it induces depend on the type of sensor
== Mechanisms of operation ==
There are multiple mechanisms by which a recognition event can be transduced into a measurable signal; generally, these take advantage of the nanomaterial sensitivity and other unique properties to detect a selectively bound analyte.

Electrochemical nanosensors are based on detecting a resistance change in the nanomaterial upon binding of an analyte, due to changes in scattering or to the depletion or accumulation of charge carriers. One possibility is to use nanowires such as carbon nanotubes, conductive polymers, or metal oxide nanowires as gates in field-effect transistors, although as of 2009 they had not yet been demonstrated in real-world conditions. Chemical nanosensors contain a chemical recognition system (receptor) and a physiochemical transducer, in which the receptor interacts with analyte to produce electrical signals. In one case, upon interaction of the analyte with the receptor, the nanoporous transducer had a change in impedance which was determined as the sensor signal. Other examples include electromagnetic or plasmonic nanosensors, spectroscopic nanosensors such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, magnetoelectronic or spintronic nanosensors, and mechanical nanosensors.

Biological nanosensors consist of a bio-receptor and a transducer. The transduction method of choice is currently fluorescence because of the high sensitivity and relative ease of measurement. The measurement can be achieved by using the following methods: binding active nanoparticles to active proteins within the cell, using site-directed mutagenesis to produce indicator proteins, allowing for real-time measurements, or by creating a nanomaterial (e.g. nanofibers) with attachment sites for the bio-receptors. Even though electrochemical nanosensors can be used to measure intracellular properties, they are typically less selective for biological measurements, as they lack the high specificity of bio-receptors (e.g. antibody, DNA).

Photonic devices can also be used as nanosensors to quantify concentrations of clinically relevant samples. A principle of operation of these sensors is based on the chemical modulation of a hydrogel film volume that incorporates a Bragg grating. As the hydrogel swells or shrinks upon chemical stimulation, the Bragg grating changes color and diffracts light at different wavelengths. The diffracted light can be correlated with the concentration of a target analyte.

Another type of nanosensor is one that works through a colorimetric basis. Here, the presence of the analyte causes a chemical reaction or morphological alteration for a visible color change to occur. One such application, is that gold nanoparticles can be used for the detection of heavy metals. Many harmful gases can also be detected by a colorimetric change, such as through the commercially available Dräger Tube. These provide an alternative to bulky, lab-scale systems, as these can be miniaturized to be used for point-of-sample devices. For example, many chemicals are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and require extensive testing to ensure contaminant levels are within the appropriate limits. Colorimetric nanosensors provide a method for on-site determination of many contaminants.

==Production methods==
The production method plays a central role in determining the characteristics of the manufactured nanosensor in that the function of nanosensor can be made through controlling the surface of nanoparticles. There are two main approaches in the manufacturing of nanosensors: top-down methods, which begin with a pattern generated at a larger scale, and then reduced to microscale. Bottom-up methods start with atoms or molecules that build up to nanostructures.

=== Top-down methods ===

==== Lithography ====
It involves starting out with a larger block of some material and carving out the desired form. These carved out devices, notably put to use in specific microelectromechanical systems used as microsensors, generally only reach the micro size, but the most recent of these have begun to incorporate nanosized components. One of the most common method is called electron beam lithography. Although very costly, this technique effectively forms a distribution of circular or ellipsoidal plots on the two dimensional surface. Another method is electrodeposition, which requires conductive elements to produce miniaturized devices.

==== Fiber pulling ====
This method consists in using a tension device to stretch the major axis of a fiber while it is heated, to achieve nano-sized scales. This method is specially used in optical fiber to develop optical-fiber-based nanosensors.

==== Chemical etching ====
Two different types of chemical etching have been reported. In the Turner method, a fiber is etched to a point while placed in the meniscus between hydrofluoric acid and an organic overlayer. This technique has been shown to produce fibers with large taper angles (thus increasing the light reaching the tip of the fiber) and tip diameters comparable to the pulling method. The second method is tube etching, which involves etching an optical fiber with a single-component solution of hydrogen fluoride. A silica fiber, surrounded with an organic cladding, is polished and one end is placed in a container of hydrofluoric acid. The acid then begins to etch away the tip of the fiber without destroying the cladding. As the silica fiber is etched away, the polymer cladding acts as a wall, creating microcurrents in the hydrofluoric acid that, coupled with capillary action, cause the fiber to be etched into the shape of a cone with large, smooth tapers. This method shows much less susceptibility to environmental parameters than the Turner method.

=== Bottom-up methods ===
This type of methods involve assembling the sensors out of smaller components, usually individual atoms or molecules. This is done by arranging atoms in specific patterns, which has been achieved in laboratory tests through use of atomic force microscopy, but is still difficult to achieve en masse and is not economically viable.

==== Self-assembly ====
Also known as “growing”, this method most often entails an already complete set of components that would automatically assemble themselves into a finished product. Accurately being able to reproduce this effect for a desired sensor in a laboratory would imply that scientists could manufacture nanosensors much more quickly and potentially far more cheaply by letting numerous molecules assemble themselves with little or no outside influence, rather than having to manually assemble each sensor.

Although the conventional fabrication techniques have proven to be efficient, further improvements in the production method can lead to minimization of cost and enhancement in performance. Challenges with current production methods include uneven distribution, size, and shape of nanoparticles, which all lead to limitation in performance. In 2006, researchers in Berlin patented their invention of a novel diagnostic nanosensor fabricated with nanosphere lithography (NSL), which allows precise control oversize and shape of nanoparticles and creates nanoislands. The metallic nanoislands produced an increase in signal transduction and thus increased sensitivity of the sensor. The results also showed that the sensitivity and specification of the diagnostic nanosensor depend on the size of the nanoparticles, that decreasing the nanoparticle size increases the sensitivity.

Current density is influenced by distribution, size, or shape of nanoparticles. These properties can be improved by exploitation of capillary forces. In recent research, capillary forces were induced by applying five microliters of ethanol and, as result, individual nanoparticles have been merged in a larger islands (i.e. 20 micrometer-sized) particles separated by 10 micrometers on average, while the smaller ones were dissolved and absorbed. On the other hand, applying twice as much (i.e. 10 microliters) of ethanol has damaged the nanolayers, while applying too small (i.e. two microliters) of ethanol has failed to spread across them.

==Applications==
One of the first working examples of a synthetic nanosensor was built by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1999. It involved attaching a single particle onto the end of a carbon nanotube and measuring the vibrational frequency of the nanotube both with and without the particle. The discrepancy between the two frequencies allowed the researchers to measure the mass of the attached particle.

Since then, increasing amounts of research have gone into nanosensors, whereby modern nanosensors have been developed for many applications.  Currently, the applications of nanosensors in the market include: healthcare, defense and military, and others such as food, environment, and agriculture.
=== Defense and military ===
Nanoscience as a whole has many potential applications in the defense and military sector- including chemical detection, decontamination, and forensics. Some nanosensors in development for defense applications include nanosensors for the detection of explosives or toxic gases. Such nanosensors work on the principle that gas molecules can be distinguished based on their mass using, for example, piezoelectric sensors. If a gas molecule is adsorbed at the surface of the detector, the resonance frequency of the crystal changes and this can be measured as a change in electrical properties. In addition, field effect transistors, used as potentiometers, can detect toxic gases if their gate is made sensitive to them.

In a similar application, nanosensors can be utilized in military and law enforcement clothing and gear. The Navy Research Laboratory&#x27;s Institute for Nanoscience has studied quantum dots for application in nanophotonics and identifying biological materials. Nanoparticles layered with polymers and other receptor molecules will change color when contacted by analytes such as toxic gases. This alerts the user that they are in danger. Other projects involve embedding clothing with biometric sensors to relay information regarding the user&#x27;s health and vitals, which would be useful for monitoring soldiers in combat.

Surprisingly, some of the most challenging aspects in creating nanosensors for defense and military use are political in nature, rather than technical. Many different government agencies must work together to allocate budgets and share information and progress in testing; this can be difficult with such large and complex institutions. In addition, visas and immigration status can become an issue for foreign researchers - as the subject matter is very sensitive, government clearance can sometimes be required. Finally, there are currently not well defined or clear regulations on nanosensor testing or applications in the sensor industry, which contributes to the difficulty of implementation.

=== Food and the environment ===
Nanosensors can improve various sub-areas within food and environment sectors including food processing, agriculture, air and water quality monitoring, and packaging and transport.  Due to their sensitivity, as well as their tunability and resulting binding selectivity, nanosensors are very effective and can be designed for a wide variety of environmental applications. Such applications of nanosensors help in a convenient, rapid, and ultrasensitive assessment of many types of environmental pollutants.

Chemical sensors are useful for analyzing odors from food samples and detecting atmospheric gases. The &quot;electronic nose&quot; was developed in 1988 to determine the quality and freshness of food samples using traditional sensors, but more recently the sensing film has been improved with nanomaterials. A sample is placed in a chamber where volatile compounds become concentrated in the gas phase, whereby the gas is then pumped through the chamber to carry the aroma to the sensor that measures its unique fingerprint. The high surface area to volume ratio of the nanomaterials allows for greater interaction with analytes and the nanosensor&#x27;s fast response time enables the separation of interfering responses. Chemical sensors, too, have been built using nanotubes to detect various properties of gaseous molecules. Many carbon nanotube based sensors are designed as field effect transistors, taking advantage of their sensitivity. The electrical conductivity of these nanotubes will change due to charge transfer and chemical doping by other molecules, enabling their detection. To enhance their selectivity, many of these involve a system by which nanosensors are built to have a specific pocket for another molecule. Carbon nanotubes have been used to sense ionization of gaseous molecules while nanotubes made out of titanium have been employed to detect atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen at the molecular level. Some of these have been designed as field effect transistors, while others take advantage of optical sensing capabilities. Selective analyte binding is detected through spectral shift or fluorescence modulation. In a similar fashion, Flood et al. have shown that supramolecular host–guest chemistry offers quantitative sensing using Raman scattered light as well as SERS.

Other types of nanosensors, including quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, are currently being developed to detect pollutants and toxins in the environment. These take advantage of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that arises at the nanoscale, which results in wavelength specific absorption. This LSPR spectrum is particularly sensitive, and its dependence on nanoparticle size and environment can be used in various ways to design optical sensors. To take advantage of the LSPR spectrum shift that occurs when molecules bind to the nanoparticle, their surfaces can be functionalized to dictate which molecules will bind and trigger a response. For environmental applications, quantum dot surfaces can be modified with antibodies that bind specifically to microorganisms or other pollutants. Spectroscopy can then be used to observe and quantify this spectrum shift, enabling precise detection, potentially on the order of molecules. Similarly, fluorescent semiconducting nanosensors may take advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to achieve optical detection. Quantum dots can be used as donors, and will transfer electronic excitation energy when positioned near acceptor molecules, thus losing their fluorescence. These quantum dots can be functionalized to determine which molecules will bind, upon which fluorescence will be restored. Gold nanoparticle-based optical sensors can be used to detect heavy metals very precisely; for example, mercury levels as low as 0.49 nanometers. This sensing modality takes advantage of FRET, in which the presence of metals inhibits the interaction between quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, and quenches the FRET response. Another potential implementation takes advantage of the size dependence of the LSPR spectrum to achieve ion sensing. In one study, Liu et al. functionalized gold nanoparticles with a Pb2+ sensitive enzyme to produce a lead sensor. Generally, the gold nanoparticles would aggregate as they approached each other, and the change in size would result in a color change. Interactions between the enzyme and Pb2+ ions would inhibit this aggregation, and thus the presence of ions could be detected.

The main challenge associated with using nanosensors in food and the environment is determining their associated toxicity and overall effect on the environment. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge on how the implementation of nanosensors will affect the soil, plants, and humans in the long-term. This is difficult to fully address because nanoparticle toxicity depends heavily on the type, size, and dosage of the particle as well as environmental variables including pH, temperature, and humidity. To mitigate potential risk, research is being done to manufacture safe, nontoxic nanomaterials, as part of an overall effort towards green nanotechnology.

=== Healthcare ===
Nanosensors possess great potential for diagnostic medicine, enabling early identification of disease without reliance on observable symptoms. Ideal nanosensor implementations look to emulate the response of immune cells in the body, incorporating both diagnostic and immune response functionalities, while transmitting data to allow for monitoring of the sensor input and response. However, this model remains a long-term goal, and research is currently focused on the immediate diagnostic capabilities of nanosensors. The intracellular implementation of nanosensor synthesized with biodegradable polymers induces signals that enable real-time monitoring and thus paves way for advancement in drug delivery and treatment.

One example of these nanosensors involves using the fluorescence properties of cadmium selenide quantum dots as sensors to uncover tumors within the body. A downside to the cadmium selenide dots, however, is that they are highly toxic to the body. As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less toxic material while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells.

Another application of nanosensors involves using silicon nanowires in IV lines to monitor organ health. The nanowires are sensitive to detect trace biomarkers that diffuse into the IV line through blood which can monitor kidney or organ failure. These nanowires would allow for continuous biomarker measurement, which provides some benefits in terms of temporal sensitivity over traditional biomarker quantification assays such as ELISA.

Nanosensors can also be used to detect contamination in organ implants. The nanosensor is embedded into the implant and detects contamination in the cells surrounding the implant through an electric signal sent to a clinician or healthcare provider. The nanosensor can detect whether the cells are healthy, inflammatory, or contaminated with bacteria. However, a main drawback is found within the long term use of the implant, where tissue grows on top of the sensors, limiting their ability to compress. This impedes the production of electrical charges, thus shortening the lifetime of these nanosensors, as they use the piezoelectric effect to self-power.

Similarly to those used to measure atmospheric pollutants, gold-particle based nanosensors are used to give an early diagnosis to several types of cancer by detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, as tumor growth is associated with peroxidation of the cell membrane. Another cancer related application, though still in mice probing stage, is the use of peptide-coated nanoparticles as activity-based sensors to detect lung cancer. The two main advantages of the use of nanoparticles to detect diseases is that it allows early stage detection, as it can detect tumors the size in the order of millimeters. It also provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use, portable, and non-invasive diagnostic tool.

A recent effort towards advancement in nanosensor technology has employed molecular imprinting, which is a technique used to synthesize polymer matrices that act as a receptor in molecular recognition. Analogous to the enzyme-substrate lock and key model, molecular imprinting uses template molecules with functional monomers to form polymer matrices with specific shape corresponding to its target template molecules, thus increasing the selectivity and affinity of the matrices. This technique has enabled nanosensors to detect chemical species. In the field of biotechnology, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) are synthesized receptors that have shown promising, cost-effective alternatives to natural antibodies in that they are engineered to have high selectivity and affinity. For example, an experiment with MI sensor containing nanotips with non-conductive polyphenol nano-coating (PPn coating) showed selective detection of E7 protein and thus demonstrated potential use of these nanosensors in detection and diagnosis of human papillomavirus, other human pathogens, and toxins. As shown above, nanosensors with molecular imprinting technique are capable of selectively detecting ultrasensitive chemical species in that by artificially modifying the polymer matrices, molecular imprinting increases the affinity and selectivity. Although molecularly imprinted polymers provide advantages in selective molecular recognition of nanosensors, the technique itself is relatively recent and there still remains challenges such as attenuation signals, detection systems lacking effective transducers, and surfaces lacking efficient detection. Further investigation and research on the field of molecularly imprinted polymers is crucial for development of highly effective nanosensors.

In order to develop smart health care with nanosensors, a network of nanosensors, often called nanonetwork, need to be established to overcome the size and power limitations of individual nanosensors. Nanonetworks not only mitigates the existing challenges but also provides numerous improvements. Cell-level resolution of nanosensors will enable treatments to eliminate side effects, enable continuous monitoring and reporting of patients’ conditions.

Nanonetworks require further study in that nanosensors are different from traditional sensors. The most common mechanism of sensor networks are through electromagnetic communications. However, the current paradigm is not applicable to nanodevices due to their low range and power. Optical signal transduction has been suggested as an alternative to the classical electromagnetic telemetry and has monitoring applications in human bodies. Other suggested mechanisms include bioinspired molecular communications, wired and wireless active transport in molecular communications, Forster energy transfer, and more. It is crucial to build an efficient nanonetwork so that it can be applied in fields such as medical implants, body area networks (BAN), internet of nano things (IoNT), drug delivery and more. With an adept nanonetwork, bio implantable nanodevices can provide higher accuracy, resolution, and safety compared to macroscale implants. Body area networks (BAN) enable sensors and actuators to collect physical and physiological data from the human body to better anticipate any diseases, which will thus facilitate the treatment. Potential applications of BAN include cardiovascular disease monitoring, insulin management, artificial vision and hearing, and hormonal therapy management. The Internet of Bio-Nano Things refers to networks of nanodevices that can be accessed by the internet. Development of IoBNT has paved the way to new treatments and diagnostic techniques. Nanonetworks may also help drug delivery by increasing localization and circulation time of drugs.

Existing challenges with the aforementioned applications include biocompatibility of the nano implants, physical limitations leading to lack of power and memory storage, and bio compatibility of the transmitter and receiver design of IoBNT. The nanonetwork concept has numerous areas for improvements: these include developing nanomachines, protocol stack issues, power provisioning techniques, and more.

There are still stringent regulations in place for the development of standards for nanosensors to be used in the medical industry, due to insufficient knowledge of the adverse effects of nanosensors as well as potential cytotoxic effects of nanosensors. Additionally, there can be a high cost of raw materials such as silicon, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes, which prevent commercialization and manufacturing of nanosensors requiring scale-up for implementation. To mitigate the drawback of cost, researchers are looking into manufacturing nanosensors made of more cost-effective materials. There is also a high degree of precision needed to reproducibly manufacture nanosensors, due to their small size and sensitivity to different synthesis techniques, which creates additional technical challenges to be overcome.

<doc id="603286" wikidata="Q237211" url="?curid=603286" title="Anita Roddick">
<text>Dame Anita Lucia Roddick (23 October 1942 – 10 September 2007) was a British businesswoman, human rights activist and environmental campaigner, best known as the founder of The Body Shop, now The Body Shop International Limited, a cosmetics company producing and retailing natural beauty products which shaped ethical consumerism. The company was one of the first to prohibit the use of ingredients tested on animals in some of its products and one of the first to promote fair trade with developing countries.

Roddick was involved in activism and campaigning for environmental and social issues, including involvement with Greenpeace and &quot;The Big Issue&quot;. In 1990, Roddick founded Children on the Edge, a charitable organisation which helps disadvantaged children in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. She believed that business should offer a form of moral leadership, being a more powerful force in society than religion or government.

In the late 1990s, she became involved in advocating for the Angola Three, African-American prisoners at the Louisiana State Penitentiary who had already been held in solitary confinement for decades. She helped raise international awareness and funds to aid in their appeals of flawed trials.

==The Body Shop==

Roddick opened her first Body Shop in Brighton, England in 1976, with the goal of earning an income for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away in South America. She wanted to provide quality skincare products in refillable containers and sample sizes, all marketed with truth rather than hype. She opened her second shop six months later. On her husband&#x27;s return, he joined the business.

In a May 2002 article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jon Entine reported that Roddick had copied the name, concept and original brochures from the original Body Shop which was started in Berkeley, California in 1970 and had three stores when Roddick visited the Bay Area in the early 1970s. Roddick&#x27;s original brochures were verbatim copies of material produced by the Berkeley-based Body Shop. When Roddick decided to expand her multinational corporation into the United States, she bought the rights to the Body Shop name for $3.5 million from the original shop owners, who were required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time. As a consequence the original Body Shop renamed itself Body Time and remained in business until April 2018.

By 1991, the Body Shop had 700 branches, and Roddick was awarded the 1991 World Vision Award for Development Initiative. In 1996 she told &quot;Third Way&quot;:
In 1997, Roddick developed the Body Shop&#x27;s most successful campaign ever, creating Ruby, the size 16 doll, who was thought to bear a passing resemblance to Barbie. The campaign evolved from positioning developed by ethical communications consultancy Host Universal. They created the image of the naked red-haired doll, hands behind her head and wind in her hair, that became the embodiment of the campaign. The photographer was Steve Perry.

By 2004, the Body Shop had 1980 stores, serving more than 77 million customers throughout the world. It was voted the second most-trusted brand in the United Kingdom, and 28th top brand in the world.

On 17 March 2006, L&#x27;Oréal purchased Body Shop for £652 million. Some controversy and criticism was raised, as L&#x27;Oréal was known to use animal testing and the company was part-owned by Nestlé. The latter had been criticised for its treatment of third-world producers. Roddick addressed the issues directly in an interview with &quot;The Guardian.&quot; It reported that: 
...she sees herself as a kind of &#x27;Trojan horse&#x27; who by selling her business to a huge firm will be able to influence the decisions it makes. Suppliers who had formerly worked with the Body Shop will in future have contracts with L&#x27;Oréal, and whilst working with the company 25 days a year Roddick was able to have an input into decisions.

==Charitable work==

Roddick was known for her campaigning work on environmental issues and was a member of the advisory council for the think tank, Demos. However, despite Roddick&#x27;s high profile statements regarding The Body Shop&#x27;s charitable mission, it did not make charitable donations for its first 11 years of operation. After the company entered the stock exchange in 1984, the first sponsorship, which was made possible by the wealth generated by the IPO, was for Greenpeace posters in 1985.

In 1990 Roddick founded Children on the Edge (COTE), in response to her visits to Romanian orphanages. She created COTE to help manage the crisis of poor conditions in the overcrowded orphanages and worked to de-institutionalise the children over the course of their early life. COTE&#x27;s mission is to help disadvantaged children affected by conflicts, natural disasters, disabilities, and HIV/AIDS.

In the late 1990s, Roddick became involved in the case of the Angola Three, African-American men who had been held for more than two decades in solitary confinement at Louisiana State Penitentiary. She helped raise international awareness of their case and funds to support appeals of their flawed convictions.

On 13 December 2005, the &quot;National Post&quot; reported that Roddick had announced that she intended to use her fortune for philanthropy; it was estimated at £51 million ($104 million). This was before her sale of her business to L&#x27;Oreal.

Roddick wrote the book &quot;Take It Personally.&quot; She encouraged equality and an end to the exploitation of workers and children in underdeveloped countries.

After her death in 2007, her husband, Gordon Roddick, founded 38 Degrees in her memory. He said, &quot;I knew what would make Anita really laugh would be to cause a lot of trouble.&quot;

Between 2009 and 2014, the Roddick Foundation gave four grants totalling £120,000 to CAGE, an organisation led by Mozzam Begg, that aimed &quot;to raise awareness of the plight of the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and other detainees held as part of the War on Terror&quot;. The Foundation, along with two other charities, agreed to cease funding CAGE under pressure from the Charity Commission, which had expressed concern that funding CAGE risked damaging public confidence in charity. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government&#x27;s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: &quot;I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners. I have concerns about the group&quot;.

In 2015, the charity commission agreed to cease to interfere with charities&#x27; right to fund CAGE, if they wished, following a judicial review. The judicial review heard testimony that a British Cabinet Minister and US intelligence had applied pressure on the charity commission to investigate CAGE.

Roddick was a close friend of Littlehampton Community School. In 2003, it successfully applied to become a Business and Enterprise specialist school. Much of the money required was donated by Roddick. As a result of this donation, a new building built with this money was named The Roddick Enterprise Centre (normally abbreviated to &#x27;REC&#x27;). The Littlehampton College also hosts &#x27;Roddick Days&#x27; such as &#x27;Day of Action&#x27; and &#x27;One World&#x27;; these events allow students to give something back to their local community and learn about what is happening around them.

==Illness==
In 2004, Roddick was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis due to long-standing hepatitis C. She did not reveal her illness until 14 February 2007. She said, &quot;I have hepatitis C. It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer, but you groan and move on&quot;. She subsequently promoted the work of The Hepatitis C Trust, and campaigned to increase awareness of the disease. On 30 August 2007, less than two weeks before her death, she was a special guest in an episode of the live television programme &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. She discussed hepatitis C with the presenter and general practitioner, Mark Porter.

Roddick explained that her hepatitis C was unexpectedly diagnosed in 2004, following a blood test that was part of a medical examination needed for a life insurance policy. The blood test indicated abnormal liver function and subsequent blood tests diagnosed hepatitis C. She said that she had a large blood transfusion in 1971, after the birth of her younger daughter, and that she was convinced that the transfusion had infected her with hepatitis C. Blood donors in the United Kingdom were not screened for hepatitis C until the mid-1990s.

She reported that she had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and that her main symptoms were itching and poor concentration. She briefly mentioned that medical treatment with interferon did not suit her. She said that she kept fit and active, and that she attended biannual out-patient hospital appointments in Southampton, as well as being under review by the liver transplant team at the Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge.

==Death ==
Roddick died of a massive stroke at about 6:30pm on 10 September 2007, after being admitted to St Richard&#x27;s Hospital, Chichester the previous evening suffering from a severe headache. As promised earlier, she left her estate to charities rather than to her family and friends. When details of her estate were published, it was disclosed that she had donated all of her £51 million fortune upon her death.

==Chemistry==
* The fullerene Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is first intentionally prepared by Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean O&#x27;Brien, Robert Curl and Richard Smalley at Rice University in the United States.

==Computer science==
* March – The &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot;, written by Richard Stallman, is first published.
* March 15 – The first commercial Internet domain name, in the top-level domain &quot;.com&quot;, is registered in the name &quot;symbolics.com&quot; by Symbolics Inc., a computer systems firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
* November 20 – Microsoft Windows operating system released.

==Environment==
* May 16 – Scientists of the British Antarctic Survey announce discovery of the ozone hole.

==Exploration==
* September 1 – The wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; (1912) in the North Atlantic is located by a joint American-French expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard (WHOI) and Jean-Louis Michel (Ifremer) using side-scan sonar from RV &quot;Knorr&quot;.

==Mathematics==
* March – Louis de Branges de Bourcia publishes proof of de Branges&#x27;s theorem.
* September – Dennis Sullivan publishes proof of the No wandering domain theorem.
* December – Publication of the &quot;ATLAS of Finite Groups&quot;.
* Jean-Pierre Serre provides partial proof that a Frey curve cannot be modular, showing that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would imply Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.
* Leonard Adleman, Roger Heath-Brown and Étienne Fouvry prove that the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem holds for infinitely many odd primes &quot;p&quot;.

==Physics==
* September – Physicist Carl Sagan&#x27;s hard science fiction novel &quot;Contact&quot; is published in the United States, introducing the concept of a traversable wormhole devised by Kip Thorne.
* Portugal joins CERN.

==Physiology and medicine==
* February 19 – Artificial heart patient William J. Schroeder becomes the first such patient to leave hospital.
* March 4 – The United States Food and Drug Administration approves a blood test for AIDS infection, used since this date for testing all U.S. blood donations.

<text>A producer price index (PPI) is a price index that measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output. Formerly known as the wholesale price index between 1902 and 1978, the index is made up of over 16,000 establishments providing approximately 64,000 price quotations that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) compiles each month to represent thousands of different goods and services.

Its importance is being reduced by the steady decline in manufactured goods as a share of spending. When manufacturers face increased production costs (input costs), businesses must reconsider their pricing approach by either:

# Absorbing higher manufacturing costs, which may maintain customer satisfaction but can impact the company&#x27;s profitability.
# Transferring those costs to consumers, which may boost business profits, but means customers will face higher prices for the goods and services.

== Coverage ==
The PPI system encompasses the production of all industries in the sectors involved in manufacturing goods:

* Mining
* Manufacturing
* Agriculture
* Fishing
* Forestry
* Gas
* Electricity
* Waste
* Scrap materials

Imports are excluded, but locally produced goods that are transported between businesses owned by the same corporation are included. Items produced domestically specifically for the military are also included.

== Calculation ==
The PPI is determined by taking the average weighted price of goods and services produced in the U.S. for the current month and year, dividing it by the average weighted prices of goods and services produced in the U.S. during a base month and year, and then multiplying the outcome by 100.

For example, if the average weighted price of goods and services in the U.S. during July 2023 is $120, and the average weighted price during the base month, January 2022, is $100, the PPI for July 2023 would be calculated as follows:

PPI = (Average Weighted Price in July 2023 / Average Weighted Price in January 2022) x 100 = ($120 / $100) x 100 = 120

Thus the PPI for July 2023 would be 120.

== Related measures ==
A number of countries that now report a producer price index previously reported a wholesale price index.

== By country ==

=== United States ===

In the US, the PPI was known as the &quot;wholesale price index&quot;, or WPI, up to 1978. The PPI is one of the oldest continuous systems of statistical data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as one of the oldest economic time series compiled by the Federal Government. The origins of the index can be found in an 1891 U.S. Senate resolution authorizing the Senate Committee on Finance to investigate the effects of the tariff laws &quot;upon the imports and exports, the growth, development, production, and prices of agricultural and manufactured articles at home and abroad&quot;.

=== India ===

The Indian wholesale price index (WPI) was first published in 1902, and the country now uses CPI. No PPI is formulated in India.

<text>Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP (November 4, 1806 – February 23, 1864) was a pioneer Italian Dominican friar and Catholic missionary priest who helped bring the Church to the Iowa-Illinois-Wisconsin tri-state area. He founded several parishes in the area and was the architect for several parish buildings. Additionally, Mazzuchelli established several schools throughout the region, some of which have developed into local Catholic colleges. As part of this effort, he founded the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters.

==Life==
===Early life===
He was born Carlo Gaetano Samuele Mazzuchelli on November 4, 1806, in Milan—then under French control, the 16th of 17 children of a prominent family. At the age of 17, he entered the Dominican Order, which was still recovering from the devastation wrought on the Catholic Church institutions in Italy under the French Revolutionary Army. After his period of novitiate, when he changed his name to Friar Samuel, he went to Rome to prepare for ordination. He was ordained a subdeacon in 1827 in the Lateran Basilica, around which time he was recruited to serve in new Diocese of Cincinnati, still missionary territory for the Church.

After spending some time in France to perfect his French, in 1828, Mazzuchelli set out for the United States, where he arrived in Cincinnati and was welcomed by the bishop, fellow Dominican friar, Edward Fenwick.

===Missionary priest===
After obtaining a dispensation from the Holy See due to his being underage, Mazzuchelli was ordained a priest by Fenwick on September 5, 1830. Shortly after that, he was sent to serve at Sainte Anne Church on Mackinac Island and later in northern Wisconsin, After about five years there, Mazzuchelli arrived in the Dubuque area. During his time, he faced a number of challenges, such as hostility from other Christian denominations.

While in what would later become Dubuque, Iowa, he reorganized the parish and named it Saint Raphael, which later became the Cathedral parish when the Dubuque Diocese was formed in 1837. He assisted Bishop Mathias Loras during the first few years after the founding of the diocese. He worked extensively in what would eventually become the Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin. There he founded over 30 parishes and designed and built over 20 church buildings and several civic buildings. Three of those parishes were named after the three Archangels: Saint Raphael&#x27;s in Dubuque, St. Michael&#x27;s in Galena, Illinois, and Saint Gabriel&#x27;s in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. In 1846, he founded Sinsinawa Mound College. 

In May 1843 Mazzuchelli accompanied Bishop Loras to the Provincial Council of Bishops in Baltimore. After the sessions ended, he was advised to return to Italy to restore his weakened health. He sailed to Europe, going home to Milan and his welcoming family after an absence of 22 years. While there he recruited missionaries, raised funds, and wrote a memoir full of details of frontier life.

Upon his return, he founded the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters in 1847. In 1848, he founded St. Clara Female Academy (now Dominican University), a frontier school for young women, which he entrusted to the Dominican Sisters. 

Many remembered Mazzuchelli as a kind and gentlemanly priest. He was able to break down the cultural barriers that existed and appeal to many different ethnic groups. The Irish he ministered to called him &quot;Father Matthew Kelly.&quot; He died of a severe case of pneumonia, on February 23, 1864, after attending a sick call. Mazzuchelli was buried at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cemetery in Benton.

==Veneration==
The cause for elevating him to Sainthood started in 1964 when William Patrick O&#x27;Connor, the first Bishop of Madison, established a Diocesan Historical Commission to determine if documents available were sufficient for the Church to proceed with initial steps required in the process of beatification. The process progressed and was accepted by the Holy See for further investigation. In 1993, Pope John Paul II declared Mazzuchelli Venerable.

In August 2008, an official inquiry into a presumed miracle performed through the intercession of Mazzuchelli was completed in the Diocese of Madison. Robert Uselmann, a resident of Monona, Wisconsin, had gone to Sinsinawa Mound with his family in 2001 to pray for Mazzuchelli&#x27;s intercession in curing him of cancer. While there, he prayed with the Sisters, using Mazzuchelli&#x27;s penance chain. Uselmann later discovered that a cancerous tumor had disappeared from his lung.

Robert C. Morlino, Bishop of the Diocese of Madison, opened a diocesan tribunal at the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters&#x27; request, which concluded its investigation and sent the results to Rome. 

==Legacy==
In 2006 a new middle school built by the Holy Family Catholic School System in Dubuque was named after Mazzuchelli. The school opened for the 2006–2007 academic year.

<doc id="603318" wikidata="Q13363" url="?curid=603318" title="Menominee language">
<text>Menominee , also spelled Menomini (In Menominee language: ) is an endangered Algonquian language spoken by the Menominee people of what is now northern Wisconsin in the United States. The federally recognized tribe has been working to encourage revival of use of the language by intensive classes locally and partnerships with universities. Most of the fluent speakers are elderly. Many of the people use English as their first language.

The name of the tribe, and the language, derived from , comes from the word for &#x27;wild rice&#x27;. The tribe has gathered and cultivated this native food as a staple for millennia. The Ojibwa, their neighbors to the north who are one of the Anishinaabe peoples and also speak an Algonquian language, also use this term for them.

The main characteristics of Menominee, as compared to other Algonquian languages, are its extensive use of the low front vowel , its rich negation morphology, and its lexicon. Some scholars (notably Bloomfield and Sapir) have classified it as a Central Algonquian language based on its phonology.

Good sources of information on the Menominee tribe and their language include Leonard Bloomfield&#x27;s 1928 bilingual text collection, his 1962 grammar (considered a landmark study), and Skinner&#x27;s earlier anthropological work.

== Usage and revitalization efforts ==
Menominee is a highly endangered language, as there are only a handful of fluent speakers left. According to a 1997 report by the Menominee Historic Preservation Office, 39 people spoke Menominee as their first language, all of whom were elderly; 26 spoke it as their second language; and 65 others had learned some of it for the purpose of understanding the language and/or teaching it to others.

The Menominee Language &amp; Culture Commission was established by the Menominee Nation to promote the continued use of the language. In the 21st century, residents of the Menominee reservation at Keshena have held intensive classes for learners of all ages, and have worked with linguists from the University of Wisconsin–Madison to document the language and to develop curriculum and learning materials. A Menominee dictionary project, led by Monica Macaulay, has resulted in the publication of modern dictionaries of the language in support of revitalization efforts.

In 1977, Menominee High School, founded when &quot;the Indians of the Menominee Reservation separated from the Shawano-Gresham School District to open their own district,&quot; began to offer Menominee language, drumming, and tribal dance in addition to its academic program.

Classes in the Menominee language are available locally at preschool, high school and adult levels, and at the College of Menominee Nation and University of Wisconsin–Green Bay.

In 2012, the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay issued an apology to &quot;a seventh-grader who was punished after using her native Menominee language in the classroom&quot; in Shawano, Wisconsin.

As of 2013, there are &quot;six or seven people ... able to be conversational in the language,&quot; according to an article on the Menominee Place Names Map, a collaborative project at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point.

==Orthography and phonology==
Below are the basic orthography and phonemes (represented in IPA) of Menominee.

===Consonants===

* is postdental.
*The unvoiced sibilant can range between and .
* and do not appear initially, except sometimes as the on-glide of a vowel. Final after is sometimes dropped and sometimes replaced with , as in .

Consonants, including nasals, are palatalized before front vowels and labialized before back vowels.

Menominee does not make contrasts between voiced and voiceless stops and voicing from a following vowel may set in before the opening is complete.

===Vowels===


*Long or is labialized if the preceding syllable contains a back vowel or when it is followed by a palatalized consonant. The same is true for 
*Short is particularly open when found before and .
* is consistently lengthened before .
* and are treated like long vowels in the assignment of stress. They contrast with and . For example, (&#x27;he uses it&#x27;) is distinct from (&#x27;fish egg&#x27;). Final after becomes primarily bilabial. The syllable can alternate with for some speakers.
* &amp; , which are usually written ⟨ae a͞e⟩, can also be written as ⟨æ ǣ⟩
Vowels are slightly nasalized before or after or .

===Syllable structure and stress===

Syllable structure in Menominee is typically VC(C) or C(C)VC(C); syllables do not end in vowels. Any consonant can begin or end a syllable except and . The only clusters which can occur at the end of a syllable are and . The only cluster which can begin a syllable is .

Primary stress occurs on every long vowel or diphthong that is in the next-to-last syllable of a word. Most compounds and inflected forms are treated as single words in assigning stress. Rhetorical stress comes on the last syllable.

===Pitch===

In an interrogative sentence which uses a question word, there is a rising and then falling of pitch near the beginning and a drop at the end. In yes–no questions, there is a sharp rise in pitch at the end of the sentence. The modulations of pitch for expressing exclamations, quotations, etc. is generally much more pronounced in Menominee than in English.

==Grammar – general==
===Lexical categories===
Bloomfield states there are five overarching categories in Menominee: noun, pronoun, negator, verb, and particle. Nouns, pronouns, negators, and verbs all take inflection whereas particles do not carry any morphology.

=== Agreement ===
Agreement morphology in Menominee can be fusional, e.g. animacy and number (nouns), are indicated within the same affix.

====Animacy====
All nouns are split into two categories and are inflected for animacy and are classified as either animate or inanimate. Animacy in Menominee is a grammatical construct for noun classification and not a reflection of the noun&#x27;s status as &quot;living&quot; or &quot;non-living.&quot; Therefore, some semantically inherently inanimate objects are grammatically animate.

==== Number ====
All nouns are required to be inflected if they are plural. Nouns which are singular are unmarked.

==== Person marking ====
Menominee has four grammatical persons: first, second, third, and indefinite.

== Grammar – nouns ==

=== Agreement morphology ===
Noun classes are split based on grammatical gender into two categories: animate and inanimate. Additionally, all nouns must be marked for plurality. Plurality agreement are suffixes that attach to noun stems. Singular forms are unmarked (represented by zero morpheme ∅) and plural has two forms, as shown in the table below.

These suffixes are attached directly to noun stems or to possessed themes. Examples below show singular and plural inflections of both animate and inanimate nouns:

There are four personal prefixes used to modify nouns and in personal pronouns:

*1st person: 
*2nd person: (also used for inclusive 1st person plural)
*3rd person: 
*indefinite: 

Certain nouns occur only in possessed forms, typically referring to body parts or relatives, such as , &#x27;son&#x27;; , &#x27;your (s.) foot&#x27;; , &#x27;someone&#x27;s foot&#x27;. These affixes are used to indicate possession (e.g. &#x27;my older sister&#x27;; , &#x27;my stone&#x27;). They are also used in the inflection of verbs to indicate the actor.

The personal pronouns formed by these prefixes are as follows:
Nouns and nearly all pronouns are inflected for singular and plural. Some nouns occur only as singulars, typically denoting liquids or other uncountable substances (e.g. , &#x27;coffee&#x27;). The singular is often used for a representative meaning, e.g. , &#x27;the way the Menomini lives&#x27;.

Nouns can also be inflected for locality:

* , &#x27;house&#x27;
* , &#x27;in a house&#x27;
* , &#x27;this&#x27;
* , &#x27;right here&#x27;

Diminutives can be formed from any noun by suffixing .

Agent nouns (i.e., nouns that mean one who does the action of the verb, such as &quot;worker&quot; from &quot;work&quot;, &quot;talker&quot; from &quot;talk&quot;, in English) are homonymous with the third person inflected verb. So,

* , &#x27;he works&#x27; or &#x27;worker&#x27;
* , &#x27;he whittles&#x27; or &#x27;carpenter&#x27;

== Grammar – verbs ==

Menominee displays inflectional reference. Nouns, verbs, and objects are inflected to agree in gender, person, and number of their possessor, actor, or transitive verb, respectively.

Intransitive verbs typically occur in two forms: one for animate actors, the other for inanimate actors:

* , &#x27;he falls&#x27;
* , &#x27;it falls&#x27;

Transitive verbs can be used with either animate or inanimate actors. Transitive verbs contain inflectional reference both to their subject and to the object. One form of the verb exists for animate objects and another for inanimate objects:

* , &#x27;he fears him&#x27;
* , &#x27;he fears it&#x27;

Impersonal verbs occur with no identifiable actor and in the singular inflection:

* , &#x27;it is cold&#x27;
* , &#x27;it is raining&#x27;

The negator typically precedes the verb: , &#x27;it is not raining&#x27;. The negator also inflects for certain elements of modal inflection: , &#x27;why, it isn&#x27;t raining anymore!&#x27; It can be used alone to answer a yes–no question. The particle is used to negate imperatives: , &#x27;don&#x27;t be too late&#x27;.

Bloomfield distinguishes five modes of the verb in Menominee, which are reflected in the verb, negator, personal and demonstrative pronouns, and auxiliary verbs:

*Indicative: , &#x27;he comes&#x27;
The indicative makes statements. In the first-person plural, it is used as a hortatory (first person plural imperative: , &#x27;let&#x27;s set out&#x27;

*Quotative: , &#x27;it is said that he comes&#x27;
**The quotative typically ends in and is used when the speaker is stating something learned from another person or from a dream or vision. It is the mode used in traditional narrative.
*Interrogative: , &#x27;is he coming?&#x27;
**The interrogative is used for yes–no questions.
*Present: , &#x27;so he is coming&#x27;
**The present mode, typically ending in or , puts an emphasis on the fact that the event is taking place in the present, as opposed to the past or in contrast with expectation.
*Preterit: , &#x27;he did formerly come&#x27;
**The preterit, typically ending in or , puts an emphasis on the fact that the event took place in the past, as opposed to in the present or in contrast with expectation.

==Language family==
Menominee is one of the Algonquian languages, which are part of the larger family of Algic languages. Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999) classify it with the Central and Plains Algonquian languages along with languages like Blackfoot, Arapaho, Cheyenne, the Cree languages, and Eastern Great Lakes languages like Ojibwe.

<text>In linguistics, the topic, or theme, of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the comment (rheme or [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]) is what is being said about the topic. This division into old vs. new content is called information structure. It is generally agreed that clauses are divided into topic vs. comment, but in certain cases the boundary between them depends on which specific grammatical theory is being used to analyze the sentence.

The topic of a sentence is distinct from the grammatical subject. The topic is defined by pragmatic considerations, that is, the that provides meaning. The grammatical subject is defined by syntax. In any given sentence the topic and grammatical subject may be the same, but they need not be. For example, in the sentence &quot;As for the little girl, the dog bit her&quot;, the subject is &quot;the dog&quot; but the topic is &quot;the little girl&quot;.

Topic being what is being talked about and the subject being what is doing the action can, also, be distinct concepts from the concept agent (or actor)—the &quot;doer&quot;, which is defined by semantics, that is, by the contextual meaning of the sentence in the paragraph. In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition &quot;by&quot;. For example, in the sentence &quot;The little girl was bitten by the dog&quot;, &quot;the little girl&quot; is the subject and the topic, but &quot;the dog&quot; is the agent.

In some languages, word order and other syntactic phenomena are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as topic-prominent languages. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

== Definitions and examples ==

The sentence- or clause-level &quot;topic&quot;, or &quot;theme&quot;, can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are
*the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about,
*a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear.

In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):
#&quot;The dog&quot; bit the little girl.
#&quot;The little girl&quot; was bitten by the dog.

These clauses have different topics: the first is about &quot;the dog&quot;, and the second about &quot;the little girl&quot;.

In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:
*&quot;As for the little girl&quot;, the dog bit her.
*&quot;It&quot; was the little girl &quot;that the dog bit.&quot;

The case of expletives is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:

*It is raining.
*There is some room in this house.
*There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length.

In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive (&quot;it&quot; or &quot;there&quot;), whose sole purpose is satisfying the extended projection principle, and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined pragmatically. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part.

The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in Rhetorical Structure Theory-Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as &quot;a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic&quot;. For example: &quot;[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]&quot;

== Realization of topic–comment ==
Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially (&quot;topic fronting&quot;) is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning
of a clause regardless of whether it is marked or not. Again, linguists disagree on many details.

Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics.

When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects. In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show pro-drop.

=== In English ===
In English the topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.

English is quite capable of using a topic-prominent formulation instead of a subject-prominent formulation when context makes it desirable for one reason or another. A typical pattern for doing so is opening with . Pedagogically or expositorily this approach has value especially when the speaker knows that they need to lead the listener&#x27;s attention from one topic to another in a deftly efficient manner, sometimes actively avoiding misplacement of the focus of attention from moment to moment. But whereas topic-prominent languages might use this approach by default or obligately, in subject-prominent ones such as English it is merely an option that often is not invoked.

=== In other languages===

* In Japanese and Korean, the topic is usually marked with a postposition such as or 는/은, &quot;-(n)eun&quot; respectively, which comes after the noun or phrase that is being topicalized.
* In Côte d&#x27;Ivoire French, the topic is marked by the postposition &quot;là&quot;. The topic can be, but is not necessarily a noun or a nominal group, for example: « Voiture-là est jolie deh » (&quot;That car is pretty&quot;); « Aujourd&#x27;hui-là il fait chaud » (&quot;It&#x27;s hot on that day&quot;); « Pour toi-là n&#x27;est pas comme pour moi hein » (&quot;For you it&#x27;s not the same as for me, huh&quot;); and « Nous qui sommes ici-là, on attend ça seulement » (&quot;We who are here, we are waiting for that only&quot;).
* So-called free word order languages such as Russian, Czech, and to some certain extent Chinese and German, use word order as the primary means, and the topic usually precedes the focus. For example, in some Slavic languages such as Czech and Russian, both orders are possible. The order with the comment sentence-initial is referred to as &quot;subjective&quot; (Vilém Mathesius invented the term and opposed it to &quot;objective&quot;) and expresses certain emotional involvement. The two orders are distinguished by intonation.
* In Modern Hebrew, a topic may follow its comment. For example, the syntactic subject of this sentence is an expletive זה (&quot;ze&quot;, lit. &quot;this&quot;):

* In American Sign Language, a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the referent, and the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that referent.

== Practical applications ==
The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture). There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for information retrieval and automatic summarization.

==History==
The distinction between subject and topic was probably first suggested by Henri Weil in 1844. He established the
connection between information structure and word order. Georg von der Gabelentz distinguished psychological subject (roughly topic) and psychological object (roughly focus). In the Prague school, the dichotomy, termed topic–focus articulation, has been studied mainly by Vilém Mathesius, Jan Firbas, František Daneš, Petr Sgall and Eva Hajičová. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. Mathesius also pointed out that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of Michael Halliday in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his systemic functional linguistics model for English.

<text>Fritzlar () is a small town (pop. 15,000) in the Schwalm-Eder district in northern Hesse, Germany, north of Frankfurt, with a storied history.

The town has a medieval center ringed by a wall with numerous watch towers. Thirty-eight meters (125 ft) high, the &quot;Grey Tower&quot; (&quot;Grauer Turm&quot;) is the highest remaining urban defense tower in Germany. The city hall, first documented in 1109, with a stone relief of St. Martin, the town&#x27;s patron saint, is the oldest in Germany still in use for its original purpose. The Gothic church of the old Franciscan monastery is today the Protestant parish church, and the monastery&#x27;s other buildings have been converted into a modern hospital. Many houses in the town center, notably around the market square, date from the 15th to 17th centuries and have been carefully maintained or restored. The town is dominated by the imposing Romanesque-Gothic Church of St. Peter from the 12th-14th centuries.

In 1974, the town hosted the 14th &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival.

== Geography ==
Fritzlar lies in northern Hesse, mainly on the north bank of the Eder river. Ten villages in the surrounding area were incorporated into the town in 1974, among them the former town of Züschen. The area is characterized by fertile farmland and mostly wooded basalt peaks, many of which are topped by mediaeval castles or castle ruins. Examples of these can be found at Gudensberg, Homberg, Felsberg, Heiligenberg, Altenburg, Jesberg, and Naumburg, among others.

== History ==


===Saint Boniface===
The Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface, apostle of the Germans, established a church and monastery dedicated to Saint Peter in Fritzlar in 724. The current Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, constructed in the 11th century, is accompanied by a monument to Boniface.

Boniface also established the first bishopric in Germany outside the boundaries of the old Roman Empire on a hill (&quot;Büraburg&quot;) across the Eder river, where a Frankish fortress and town provided protection, but after the death of Witta, its first and only bishop, in 747 the bishopric was incorporated into the diocese (later archdiocese) of Mainz by Lullus, the disciple and successor of Boniface as archbishop of Mainz. The Benedictine monastery founded by Boniface in Fritzlar in 724 gained prominence as a center of religious and worldly learning under its first abbot, Saint Wigbert, who built the original stone basilica of 732 on the site of Boniface&#x27;s wooden chapel. In 782 emperor Charlemagne granted it imperial protection and substantial territory, and this triggered the rapid development of the town around it. The monastery was converted into a college of secular canons (&quot;Chorherrenstift&quot;) in 1005, its members no longer living in monastic union and simplicity, but maintaining their own, and generally rather well-to-do, households in town in the vicinity of the church. Several imposing stone residences (&quot;Curias&quot;) built by wealthy canons during the 14th century survive to this day in the old part of the town. The canons&#x27; college was dissolved only in 1803.

===Birthplace of the German Kingdom===
Located at the crossroads of several important trade routes and site of an imperial residence since Charlemagne, Fritzlar was a frequent site of royal visits and of assemblies and synods of the German princes and church leaders during the early Middle Ages. Undoubtedly the most important of these was the Reichstag of 919 when Henry I (&quot;Henry the Fowler&quot;), duke of Saxony, was elected King of the Germans to succeed Charlemagne&#x27;s Frankish successors on the throne of what had become known as the East Frankish Empire. This event marked the end of bitter rivalry between the two large German tribes of the Franks and the Saxons and the beginning of the German Empire that lasted until the Napoleonic wars. King Conrad I of Germany, duke of Franconia, had died in December 918 without a son and urged his brother, margrave Eberhard, who was to succeed him as Duke of Franconia, to nominate Henry as king, although they had been at odds with each other from 912 to 915 over the title to lands in Thuringia. Conrad&#x27;s choice was respected by the Reichstag of 919, where Henry was proclaimed king by the leaders of the Franks and Saxons. Burchard I, Duke of Swabia quickly swore allegiance as well, but Duke Arnulf of Bavaria did not submit to Henry until the latter advanced with an army into Bavaria in 921.

Conrad himself had risen to the position of duke of Franconia only after defeating the rival Babenberg counts in a battle near Fritzlar in 906, in which his father, Conrad, Duke of Thuringia the Elder, was killed.

=== Developments during the Middle Ages ===
In 1079 Fritzlar ceased to be a crown possession when it was given to the archbishop of Mainz by Emperor Henry IV in the aftermath of his submission to the Pope at Canossa. It thus became a pivotal pillar in the long-lasting feuds between Mainz and the landgraves of Thuringia and later of Hesse for territorial supremacy in northern Hesse.

Located in the border area between Frankish and Saxon territories and, following Martin Luther&#x27;s Reformation, a Roman Catholic enclave owned by the Archbishop of Mainz in the midst of Protestant Hesse, the town was frequently embattled, by Saxons and Franks, by Protestant and Catholic princes, and repeatedly sacked and rebuilt.

The first major devastation occurred in 774, during Charlemagne&#x27;s Saxon Wars. While the king was in Italy, the Saxons invaded Hesse and besieged Büraburg, where the population of Fritzlar had sought refuge. Failing to take the fortress, the Saxons destroyed Fritzlar, but not St. Wigbert&#x27;s stone basilica. This gave rise to the legend that two angels had appeared to chase away the invaders and protect the church.

The next happened in 1079. Emperor Henry IV, who frequently resided in Fritzlar, was faced with an insurrection led by the pretender king Rudolf of Swabia (Rudolf of Rheinfelden), who had been supported by the Pope. Having submitted to the Pope at Canossa in 1077, Henry had gone to Fritzlar. A papal legate was not able to arrange an end to the dispute, and in early 1079 an army of Saxons, partisans of Rudolf, attacked Henry in Fritzlar. He fled, and town and church were sacked and destroyed.

Between about 1085 and 1118, a new and larger basilica was built at the site of St. Wigbert&#x27;s church. It was the site of the imperial synod of 1118 at which the papal interdict of Henry V, who again had opposed the pope on the matter of investiture of bishops, was announced and ratified and where Saint Norbert of Xanten, founder of the order of the Premonstratensians (Norbertines) and later archbishop of Magdeburg, successfully defended himself against charges of heresy. At the same synod, prince-bishop Otto of Bamberg was suspended for having remained loyal to Henry V during his quarrels with the papacy.

This second basilica was radically reconstructed between 1180 and 1200, essentially in the form in which it is still found today, although a number of smaller additions and alterations have been made throughout the centuries since then. During the same period, from 1184 to 1196, the town was fortified by the construction of the first wall around its periphery.

The next devastating blow was the sack of the town by Thuringian landgrave Conrad in 1232, when much of the population was killed and the town plundered. Mainz responded by immediately rebuilding and further fortifying the town, adding numerous towers to the walls and building seven watch towers and fortified refuges on strategic hills in the surrounding countryside.

In the early 13th century, the Franciscans (&quot;Friars Minor&quot;) established a monastery in the town. They obtained permission to build their church and quarters directly up against the town wall, thereby obliterating the watch walk on the inside of the wall that was crucial for quickly moving defenders from one part of the wall to another. In exchange they had to agree to defend their part of the town&#x27;s fortification in the event of a siege. The Franciscans were forced to leave when the Lutheran Reformation was introduced in 1522. Following the Counterreformation, Jesuits moved in during 1615, followed by the return of the Franciscans in 1619. The monastery was dissolved in 1811. Its splendid Gothic church, completed in 1244, today serves as the parish church for the town&#x27;s Protestant Christians who purchased it in 1817/1824.

The Thirty Year War (1618–1648) inflicted serious damage on Fritzlar and the neighboring villages, culminating with an outbreak of the black plague. The town&#x27;s population dropped from about 2000 to merely 600, and it took 200 years before the inhabitants again numbered 2000. During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) the town was occupied by French troops and parts of its fortifications were destroyed, along with the vineyards on the steep slope above the Eder river.

In the early 18th century, the order of Ursuline nuns established a nunnery and school for girls.

In 1803, when all ecclesiastic states in Germany were abolished, Fritzlar was incorporated, together with Naumburg, as the nominal Principality of Fritzlar into the Electorate (principality) of Hesse-Kassel (Kurhessen or Hesse-Cassel). In 1821 it became the administrative center of the district (Kreis) Fritzlar. Hesse-Kassel in turn was annexed by Prussia in 1866, following the Austro-Prussian War in which the Elector had sided with Austria. In 1932 the district was merged with the neighboring district of Homberg to form the district of Fritzlar-Homberg.

Between 1933 and 1945, the systematic marginalization, segregation, expulsion, and murder of the Jewish community of Fritzlar is documented in &quot;Der antijüdische Rassenwahn Hitlers, Juden in Fritzlar und seinen Ortsteilen und ihre wenigen Freunde: Erweiterte Auflage Aug 15, 2014&quot; by Paulgerhard Lohmann

In 1974, the three districts of Fritzlar-Homberg, Melsungen and Ziegenhain were combined into the new district Schwalm-Eder, with its administrative seat in Homberg (Efze).

Today, Fritzlar is a service and market center for the surrounding area, with schools, hospital, and a sizeable military garrison with airfield which is the homebase of the Luftbewegliche Brigade 1 (1st Air Mobile Brigade) and the Kampfhubschrauberregiment 36 Kurhessen (Attack Helicopter Regiment 36) of the German Army.

== Politics ==

Town council consists of 37 councillors. As of the last municipal election held on 31 March 2021, the seats are apportioned thus:

The town executive (&quot;Magistrat&quot;) consists of 10 members and the mayor. The current makeup of the Magistrat appears to be unavailable online.

Mayor Hartmut Spogat (CDU) was reelected on 28 January 2018 with a 78.48% share of the vote. The FWG candidate Gert Rohde got 21.52% of the vote.

=== Coat of arms ===
The civic coat of arms shows two red wheels joined by a cross of the same colour and the whole set from upper left to lower right (or upper right to lower left, heraldically speaking) on a silver background. As such, it bears a keen likeness to Mainz&#x27;s civic coat of arms, simply having the colours reversed but showing the same &quot;Double Wheel of Mainz&quot;, and this recalls the centuries-long allegiance that Fritzlar owed the Archbishopric of Mainz.

<text>Ray Milton Dolby (; January 18, 1933 – September 12, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor of the noise reduction system known as Dolby NR. He helped develop the video tape recorder while at Ampex and was the founder of Dolby Laboratories.

==Early life and education==
Dolby was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Esther Eufemia (née Strand) and Earl Milton Dolby, an inventor. He attended Sequoia High School (class of 1951) in Redwood City, California. As a teenager in the decade following World War II, he held part-time and summer jobs at Ampex in Redwood City, working with their first audio tape recorder in 1949. While at San Jose State College and later at Stanford University (interrupted by two years of Army service), he worked on early prototypes of video tape recorder technologies for Alexander M. Poniatoff and Charlie Ginsburg.

In 1957, Dolby received his B.Sc. in electrical engineering from Stanford. He subsequently won a Marshall Scholarship for a Ph.D (1961) in physics from the University of Cambridge, England, where he was a Research Fellow at Pembroke College and completed his PhD, &quot;Long wavelength X-ray microanalysis&quot; under the supervision of Ellis Cosslett.

== Career ==
As a non degree-holding &quot;consultant&quot;, Dolby played a key role in the effort that led Ampex to unveil their prototype Quadruplex videotape recorder in April 1956 which soon entered production.

After Cambridge, Dolby acted as a technical advisor to the United Nations in India until 1965, when he returned to England, where he founded Dolby Laboratories in London with a staff of four. In that same year, 1965, he invented the Dolby noise-reduction system, a form of audio signal processing for analog tape recorders. His first U.S. patent application was made in 1969, four years later. The system was first used by Decca Records in the UK.

The Dolby B consumer noise-reduction system works by compressing (boosting) low-level high-frequency sounds during recording and expanding (decreasing) them symmetrically during playback, which also decreases inherent tape noise. This reduces the audible level of tape hiss. The professional Type A system operates on four different frequency bands, and the final SR system on ten.

After his pioneering work with audiotape noise reduction, Dolby sought to improve film sound. As Dolby Laboratories&#x27; corporate history explains:

: Upon investigation, Dolby found that many of the limitations in optical sound stemmed directly from its significantly high background noise. To filter this noise, the high-frequency response of theatre playback systems was deliberately curtailed… To make matters worse, to increase dialogue intelligibility over such systems, sound mixers were recording soundtracks with so much high-frequency pre-emphasis that high distortion resulted.

The first film with Dolby sound was &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), which used Dolby noise reduction on all pre-mixes and masters, but a conventional optical sound track on release prints. &quot;Callan&quot; (1974) was the first film with a Dolby-encoded optical soundtrack. The first true LCRS (Left-Center-Right-Surround) soundtrack was encoded on the movie &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in 1976. In fewer than ten years, 6,000 cinemas worldwide were equipped to use Dolby Stereo sound.

Dolby then developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the cinema. Dolby Stereo Digital (now simply called Dolby Digital) was first featured on the 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Dolby Digital is now found in the HDTV (ATSC) standard of the United States, DVD players, and many satellite-TV and cable-TV receivers.

Dolby was a Fellow and past president of the Audio Engineering Society.

==Death and legacy==
Dolby died of leukemia on September 12, 2013, at his home in San Francisco at the age of 80. Dolby was survived by his wife Dagmar, two sons, Tom and David, and four grandchildren. Kevin Yeaman, president and chief executive of Dolby Laboratories, said, &quot;Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary.&quot; Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said Dolby had &quot;changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years&quot; and that Dolby&#x27;s &quot;technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers, ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come.&quot;

In his will, Dolby bequeathed £35 million to Pembroke College, Cambridge, reportedly the largest single donation received by any college in the university&#x27;s history. In December 2017 it was announced that his family had donated a further £85m from his estate to Cambridge University&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory which funded a physics professorship and the building of the Ray Dolby Centre, to be completed in 2024. In 2022, the Dolby Family Fund for Excellence in Physics was expected to fund further academic posts and PhD studentships, as well as an annual symposium.

<text>Sobhuza II (; also known as Nkhotfotjeni, Mona; 22 July 1899 – 21 August 1982) was &quot;Ngwenyama&quot; (King) of Swaziland (now Eswatini) for 82 years and 254 days, the longest verifiable reign of any monarch in recorded history. 

Sobhuza was born on 22 July 1899 at Zombodze Royal Residence, the son of Lomawa Ndwandwe and King Ngwane V. When he was only four months old, his father died suddenly while dancing incwala. Sobhuza was chosen king soon after that and his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge led the Swazi nation until his maturity in 1921. Sobhuza was acknowledged as King by the British in 1967, and Swaziland achieved independence in 1968. Sobhuza continued to reign until his death in 1982. He was succeeded by Mswati III, his young son with Inkhosikati Ntfombi Tfwala, who was crowned in 1986.

==Early life and education==

Ingwenyama Sobhuza was born in Zombodze on 22 July 1899. He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Ngwane V, as King of Swaziland on 10 December 1899, when he was only four months old. He was educated at the Swazi National School, Zombodze, and at the Lovedale Institution in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, before assuming the Swazi throne as King at the age of twenty-two. His grandmother, Labotsibeni Mdluli, served as regent throughout his youth, formally transferring power to the &quot;Ngwenyama&quot; on 22 December 1921. Before assuming his royal duties, he studied anthropology in England.

==Kingship==

Sobhuza&#x27;s direct reign would endure more than 60 years (1921–1982), during which he presided over Swaziland&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1968, after which the British government recognised him as &quot;King of Swaziland&quot; (Eswatini). Early in his reign, Sobhuza sought to address the problem of land that had been occupied by white settlers in 1907. He did so by first leading a delegation to London to meet with King George V and petition him to restore the lands to the Swazi people. He again took his case on the land issue in 1929 to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He was defeated by the terms of the &quot;Foreign Jurisdictions Act 1890&quot;, which effectively placed the actions of British administrations in protectorates beyond the reach of the British courts. Sobhuza&#x27;s role during this colonial period was for the most part ceremonial, but he still had major influence as a traditional head of the Swazi nation. In 1934, he received the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London.

In the early 1960s Sobhuza played a major role in events that led to independence for his country in 1968. He opposed the post-colonial Westminster constitution proposed by the British government, in which he was assigned the role of constitutional monarch. As a consequence, acting through his advisory council, he formed the &quot;Imbokodvo National Movement&quot;, a political party, which contested and won all seats in the 1967 pre-independence elections. He became recognized by the British as King of Swaziland in 1967 when Swaziland was given direct rule. Independence was achieved on 6 September 1968. Following this, Sobhuza skilfully blended appeal to tribal custom with a capacity to manage economic and social change for his kingdom. On 12 April 1973, the king repealed the constitution and dissolved parliament, henceforth exercising power as an absolute ruler. In 1978 a new constitution was promulgated which provided for an elaborate reversion to a tribal mode of rule involving an electoral college of eighty members chosen by forty local councils known as tinkhundla, dominated by tribal elements. The Swazi economy prospered under Sobhuza&#x27;s leadership. Swaziland is rich in natural resources, and much of the land and mineral wealth originally owned by non-Swazi interests was brought under indigenous control during Sobhuza&#x27;s reign.

==Later life and death==

Sobhuza celebrated his Diamond Jubilee in 1981. At this time, he had successfully restored and indeed strengthened the monarch&#x27;s role as the chief arbiter of decision-making in his kingdom. In the early 1980s King Sobhuza attempted to acquire control over KaNgwane, a Bantustan set up by the South African government in an attempt to reunite all Swazi people separated by the colonial boundary. He died on 21 August 1982 at Embo State house at the age of 83.

Sobhuza&#x27;s official incumbency of 82 years and 254 days is the longest precisely dated monarchical reign on record and the world&#x27;s longest documented reign of any sovereign since antiquity. Only Min Hti of the Burmese Kingdom of Arakan, Pepi II Neferkare of Ancient Egypt and Taejo of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo are claimed to have reigned longer, though these claims are disputed.

==Family and succession==

Known by the honorific &quot;Bull of the Swazi&quot; by virtue of his numerous progeny, King Sobhuza continued the tribal practice of maintaining many consorts. According to the Swaziland National Trust Commission, King Sobhuza II had 70 wives, who gave him 210 children between 1920 and 1970. About 180 children survived infancy, and 97 sons and daughters were reported living as of 2000. At his death he had more than 1,000 grandchildren.

Sobhuza died in 1982, having appointed Prince Sozisa Dlamini to serve as &#x27;Authorized Person&#x27;, advising a regent. Selection of a successor was confirmed only after King Sobhuza&#x27;s death, a regent being necessary if the heir remained under age at that time. By tradition, the regent would be one of the queens consort who had borne the late king a son. The first regent was Queen Dzeliwe, but after a power struggle Sozisa deposed her and she was replaced by Queen Ntfombi. During this period Andy Warhol boosted her renown, and that of Swaziland, by including her portrait along with those of Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth Realms, Beatrix of the Netherlands and Margrethe II of Denmark in his &quot;Reigning Queens&quot; series. Ntombi reigned on behalf of her young son by King Sobhuza, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini, who was designated as Crown Prince or &quot;Umntfwana&quot;. He was crowned King Mswati III in 1986.

One of Sobhuza&#x27;s sons-in-law was the late Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, King of the Zulus of South Africa, who married the Swazi king&#x27;s daughter, Princess Mantfombi (born at Siteki in 1956, betrothed in 1973), at Nongoma in June 1977. Another in-law is Zenani Mandela, the daughter of former South African President Nelson Mandela, who belonged to a cadet branch of the Thembu dynasty which reigns as paramount chiefs in the Transkei. She wed Sobhuza&#x27;s son, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini, who, although an older half-brother of Mswati and Mantfombi, did not inherit the Swazi throne, instead launching, with his wife, an enterprise in the United States.

<text>The year 1983 in science and technology involved many significant events, as listed below.

==Anthropology==
* New Zealand anthropologist Derek Freeman publishes &quot;Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth&quot;, critical of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (1928) by Margaret Mead (d. 1978).

==Astronomy and space science==
* June 13 – &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; passes the orbit of Neptune, becoming the first man-made object to travel beyond the major planets of the Solar System.
* September 26 – The &quot;Soyuz T-10-1&quot; mission ends in a pad abort at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, when a pad fire occurs at the base of the Soyuz U rocket during the launch countdown. The escape tower system, attached to the top of the capsule containing the crew and Soyuz spacecraft, fires immediately pulling the crew safe from the vehicle, six seconds before the rocket explodes, destroying the launch complex.

==Biology==
* April – Kary Mullis discovers polymerase chain reaction.
* May 20 – First reports of HIV as a possible cause of AIDS, by independent virology teams led by Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo.
* June – First report of using a monoclonal antibody as a medical test.
* July – Determination of the first sequences of type I and type II keratins and prediction of the α-helical domain structure of intermediate filament proteins.
* November 3 – Michael Berridge and colleagues publish their discovery that inositol trisphosphate acts as a second messenger system in cell signaling.
* December 31 – Publication of an issue of &quot;Australian Journal of Herpetology&quot; begins the Wells and Wellington affair.

==Computer science==
* January 1 – The ARPANET officially changes to use the Internet Protocol, creating the Internet.
* August – Specification for a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (originally devised by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits) published.
* September 27 – Richard Stallman announces the GNU Project.
* October 25 – Word processor software &quot;Multi-Tool Word&quot;, soon to become Microsoft Word, is released. It is primarily the work of programmers Richard Brodie and Charles Simonyi. Free demonstration copies on disk are distributed with the November issue of &quot;PC World&quot; magazine.
* November 10 – Fred Cohen demonstrates a self-replicating source code which his academic adviser at the University of Southern California, Leonard Adleman, likens to a virus.
* December – Yugoslav popular science magazine &quot;Galaksija&quot; releases a special (January 1984) issue, &quot;Računari u vašoj kući&quot;, with complete instructions on how to build a full-featured home computer, Galaksija.
* The suffix automaton data structure is introduced.
* The US Federal Government standardizes Ada (programming language), a strongly typed, comb-structured computer language, with exception handlers, for general-purpose programming.

==History of science==
* Keith Thomas publishes &quot;Man and the Natural World: changing attitudes in England, 1500–1800&quot;.

==Mathematics==
* Daniel Gorenstein (with Richard Lyons) proves the trichotomy theorem for finite simple groups of characteristic 2 type and rank at least 4, and announces that proof of the classification of finite simple groups is complete (although that for quasithin groups has not been demonstrated at this time).

==Medicine==
* July 25 – World&#x27;s first dedicated hospital ward for HIV/AIDS patients opens at San Francisco General Hospital.

==Metrology==
* October 21 – At the seventeenth General Conference on Weights and Measures, the length of a metre is redefined as the distance light travels in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

==Paleontology==
* January – First skeleton of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; discovered in the Weald Clay formation of Surrey, England, the most complete dinosaur skeleton discovered in the UK at this date, becoming the holotype specimen of &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot;, named by palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner in 1986.

==Psychology==
* Howard Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; presents his theory of multiple intelligences.
* Gísli Guðjónsson creates the Gudjonsson suggestibility scale.

==Technology==
* April – 3D printing patents are filed by Alain Le Mehaute, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André in France and by Chuck Hull in the United States.

==Organizations==
* Spain re-joins CERN after having left in 1969 (originally joined for the first time in 1961).

==Awards==
* Nobel Prizes
** Physics – Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, William Alfred Fowler
** Chemistry – Henry Taube
** Medicine – Barbara McClintock
* Turing Award – Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie

<text>The year 1982 in science and technology involved many significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy==
* January 17 – Allan Hills A81005, the first lunar meteorite found on Earth, is discovered in the Allan Hills at the end of the Transantarctic Mountains by John Schutt and Ian Whillans during the ANSMET meteorite gathering expedition.
* March 10 – Syzygy: all 9 planets align on the same side of the Sun.
* October 14 – Halley&#x27;s Comet: First spotted in the sky after 70 year return.

==Biology==
* September – First report of anti-human monoclonal antibody production.

==Computer science==
* January 7 – The Commodore 64 8-bit home computer is launched by Commodore International (released in August); it becomes the all-time best-selling single personal computer model.
* January 30 – First computer virus, the Elk Cloner, written by 15-year-old Rich Skrenta, is found in the wild. It infects Apple II computers via floppy disk.
* July 9 – Sci-fi movie &quot;Tron&quot; is the first feature film to use computer animation extensively.

==Earth sciences==
* December 13 – 1982 North Yemen earthquake, the first instrumentally recorded event to be detected on global seismograph networks.

==History of science==
* &quot;Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist&quot; is published by Russell McCormmach. McCormmach uses the novel to present a historiographic point meant to reinforce Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s conception of a non-linear scientific development.

==Mathematics==
* Michael Freedman proves the Poincaré conjecture in dimensions equal to 4.
* Gerhard Frey draws attention to the property of the elliptic curve which becomes known as the Frey curve.
* Brazilian mathematician Celso Costa gives a mathematical description of Costa&#x27;s minimal surface, the first embedded minimal surface discovered in more than a century.
* Alexander Merkurjev and Andrei Suslin prove the norm residue isomorphism theorem in Milnor K2-theory for the case and ℓ arbitrary, with applications to the Brauer group.

==Medicine==
* July 20 – Allen Hill and colleagues at the University of Oxford develop a glucose biosensor.
* September 9 – George Brownlee and colleagues at the University of Oxford publish their results of cloning human clotting factor IX.
* November – Helen House, the world’s first children’s hospice, is set up by Sister Frances Dominica in Oxford, England.
* December 2 – At the University of Utah, 61-year-old retired dentist Barney Clark becomes the first person to receive a permanent artificial heart; he lives for 112 days with the device.
* Janet Balaskas establishes and names the active birth movement.
* Working Formulation adopted as a standard classification for non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
* Atomic Energy of Canada creates Therac-25, a radiation treatment for cancer patients to remove tumors; however the treatment causes 6 deaths between 1985-87 after people are seriously burned by the number of rads: the correct dose of rads is 200-1,000 rads but Therac-25 has 15,000-20,000 rads which is fatal. It is no longer used after 1987.

==Physics ==
* The Sakuma–Hattori equation is first proposed by Fumihiro Sakuma, Akira Ono and Susumu Hattori.

==Psychology==
*&quot;The Foundations of Ethology&quot; is published by Konrad Lorenz.

==Awards==

<doc id="603351" wikidata="Q607552" url="?curid=603351" title="Project Daedalus">
<text>Project Daedalus (named after Daedalus, the Greek mythological designer who crafted wings for human flight) was a study conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the British Interplanetary Society to design a plausible uncrewed interstellar probe. Intended mainly as a scientific probe, the design criteria specified that the spacecraft had to use existing or near-future technology and had to be able to reach its destination within a human lifetime. Alan Bond led a team of scientists and engineers who proposed using a fusion rocket to reach Barnard&#x27;s Star 5.9 light years away. The trip was estimated to take 50 years, but the design was required to be flexible enough that it could be sent to any other target star.

All the papers produced by the study are available in a BIS book, &quot;Project Daedalus: Demonstrating the Engineering Feasibility of Interstellar Travel&quot;.

==Concept==
Daedalus would be constructed in Earth orbit and have an initial mass of 54,000 tonnes including 50,000 tonnes of fuel and 500 tonnes of scientific payload. Daedalus was to be a two-stage spacecraft. The first stage would operate for two years, taking the spacecraft to 7.1% of light speed (0.071 &quot;c&quot;), and then after it was jettisoned, the second stage would fire for 1.8 years, taking the spacecraft up to about 12% of light speed (0.12 &quot;c&quot;), before being shut down for a 46-year cruise period. Due to the extreme temperature range of operation required, from near absolute zero to 1600 K, the engine bells and support structure would be made of molybdenum alloyed with titanium, zirconium, and carbon, which retains strength even at cryogenic temperatures. A major stimulus for the project was Friedwardt Winterberg&#x27;s inertial confinement fusion drive concept, for which he received the Hermann Oberth gold medal award.

This velocity is well beyond the capabilities of chemical rockets or even the type of nuclear pulse propulsion studied during Project Orion. According to Dr. Tony Martin, controlled-fusion engine and the nuclear–electric systems have very low thrust, equipment to convert nuclear energy into electrical has a large mass, which results in small acceleration, which would take a century to achieve the desired speed; thermodynamic nuclear engines of the NERVA type require a great quantity of fuel, photon rockets have to generate power at a rate of 3 W per kg of vehicle mass and require mirrors with absorptivity of less than 1 part in 106, interstellar ramjet&#x27;s problems are tenuous interstellar medium with a density of about 1 atom/cm3, a large diameter funnel, and high power required for its electric field. Thus the only suitable propulsion method for the project was thermonuclear pulse propulsion.

Daedalus would be propelled by a fusion rocket using pellets of a deuterium/helium-3 mix that would be ignited in the reaction chamber by inertial confinement using electron beams. The electron beam system would be powered by a set of induction coils trapping energy from the plasma exhaust stream. 250 pellets would be detonated per second, and the resulting plasma would be directed by a magnetic nozzle. The computed burn-up fraction for the fusion fuels was 0.175 and 0.133 producing exhaust velocities of 10,600 km/s and 9,210 km/s respectively. Due to scarcity of helium-3 on Earth, it was to be mined from the atmosphere of Jupiter by large hot-air balloon supported robotic factories over a 20-year period, or from a less distant source, such as the Moon.

The second stage would have two 5-metre optical telescopes and two 20-metre radio telescopes. About 25 years after launch these telescopes would begin examining the area around Barnard&#x27;s Star to learn more about any accompanying planets. This information would be sent back to Earth, using the 40-metre diameter second stage engine bell as a communications dish, and targets of interest would be selected. Since the spacecraft would not decelerate, upon reaching Barnard&#x27;s Star, Daedalus would carry 18 autonomous sub-probes that would be launched between 7.2 and 1.8 years before the main craft entered the target system. These sub-probes would be propelled by nuclear-powered ion drives and would carry cameras, spectrometers, and other sensory equipment. The sub-probes would fly past their targets, still travelling at 12% of the speed of light, and transmit their findings back to the Daedalus&#x27; second stage, mothership, for relay back to Earth.

The ship&#x27;s payload bay containing its sub-probes, telescopes, and other equipment would be protected from the interstellar medium during transit by a beryllium disc, up to 7 mm thick, weighing up to 50 tonnes. This erosion shield would be made from beryllium due to its lightness and high latent heat of vaporisation. Larger obstacles that might be encountered while passing through the target system would be dispersed by an artificially generated cloud of particles, ejected by support vehicles called dust bugs about 200 km ahead of the vehicle. The spacecraft would carry a number of robot wardens capable of autonomously repairing damage or malfunctions.

==Specifications==
Overall length: 190 metres

Payload mass: 450 tonnes

==Variants==
A quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating variation on Project Daedalus was published in 1980 by Robert Freitas. The non-replicating design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. Use the probe to deliver a seed factory, with a mass of about 443 metric tons, to a distant site. Have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself on-site, to increase its total manufacturing capacity, then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct probes, with a seed factory on board, over a 1,000-year period. Each REPRO would weigh over 10 million tons due to the extra fuel needed to decelerate from 12% of lightspeed.

Another possibility is to equip the Daedalus with a magnetic sail similar to the magnetic scoop on a Bussard ramjet to use the destination star heliosphere as a brake, making carrying deceleration fuel unnecessary, allowing a much more in-depth study of the star system chosen.

<text>In macroeconomics and modern monetary policy, a devaluation is an official lowering of the value of a country&#x27;s currency within a fixed exchange-rate system, in which a monetary authority formally sets a lower exchange rate of the national currency in relation to a foreign reference currency or currency basket. The opposite of devaluation, a change in the exchange rate making the domestic currency more expensive, is called a &quot;revaluation&quot;. A monetary authority (e.g., a central bank) maintains a fixed value of its currency by being ready to buy or sell foreign currency with the domestic currency at a stated rate; a devaluation is an indication that the monetary authority will buy and sell foreign currency at a lower rate.

However, under a floating exchange rate system (in which exchange rates are determined by market forces acting on the foreign exchange market, and not by government or central bank policy actions), a decrease in a currency&#x27;s value relative to other major currency benchmarks is instead called &quot;depreciation&quot;; likewise, an increase in the currency&#x27;s value is called &quot;appreciation&quot;.

Related but distinct concepts include &quot;inflation&quot;, which is a market-determined decline in the value of the currency in terms of goods and services (related to its purchasing power). Altering the face value of a currency without reducing its exchange rate is a redenomination, not a devaluation or revaluation.

==Historical usage==
Devaluation is most often used in a situation where a currency has a defined value relative to the baseline. Historically, early currencies were typically coins, struck from gold or silver by an issuing authority, which certified the weight and purity of the precious metal. A government in need of money and short on precious metals might decrease the weight or purity of the coins without any announcement, or else decree that the new coins have equal value to the old, thus devaluing the currency. Later, with the issuing of paper currency as opposed to coins, governments decreed them to be redeemable for gold or silver (a gold standard). Again, a government short on gold or silver might devalue by decreeing a reduction in the currency&#x27;s redemption value, reducing the value of everyone&#x27;s holdings.

==Causes==
Fixed exchange rates are usually maintained by a combination of legally enforced capital controls and the central bank standing ready to purchase or sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. Under fixed exchange rates, persistent capital outflows or trade deficits will involve the central bank using its foreign exchange reserves to buy domestic currency, to prop up demand for the domestic currency and thus to prop up its value. However, this activity is limited by the amount of foreign currency reserves the central bank owns; the prospect of running out of these reserves and having to abandon this process may lead a central bank to devalue its currency in order to stop the foreign currency outflows.

In an open market, the perception that a devaluation is imminent may lead speculators to sell the currency in exchange for the country&#x27;s foreign reserves, increasing pressure on the issuing country to make an actual devaluation. When speculators buy out all of the foreign reserves, a balance of payments crisis occurs. Economists Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld present a theoretical model in which they state that the balance of payments crisis occurs when the real exchange rate (exchange rate adjusted for relative price differences between countries) is equal to the nominal exchange rate (the stated rate). In practice, the onset of crisis has typically occurred after the real exchange rate has depreciated below the nominal rate. The reason for this is that speculators do not have perfect information; they sometimes find out that a country is low on foreign reserves well after the real exchange rate has fallen. In these circumstances, the currency value will fall very far very rapidly. This is what occurred during the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico.

==Economic implications==
There are significant economic consequences for the country that devalues its currency to address its economic problems. A devaluation in the exchange rate lowers the value of the domestic currency in relation to all other countries, most significantly with its major trading partners. It can assist the domestic economy by making exports less expensive, enabling exporters to more easily compete in the foreign markets. It also makes imports more expensive, providing a disincentive for domestic consumers to purchase imported goods, leading to lower levels of imports (which can benefit domestic producers), but which reduces the real income of consumers. Devaluation tends to improve a country&#x27;s balance of trade (exports minus imports) by improving the competitiveness of domestic goods in foreign markets while making foreign goods less competitive in the domestic market by becoming more expensive. The combined effect will be to reduce or eliminate the previous net outflow of foreign currency reserves from the central bank, so if the devaluation has been to a great enough extent the new exchange rate will be maintainable without foreign currency reserves being depleted any further. However, the devaluation increases the prices of imported goods in the domestic economy, thereby fueling inflation. This, in turn, increases the costs in the domestic economy, including demands for wage increases, all of which eventually flow into exported goods. These dilute the initial economic boost from the devaluation itself. Also, to combat inflation, the central bank would increase interest rates, hitting economic growth. A devaluation could also result in an outflow of capital and economic instability. In addition, a domestic devaluation merely shifts the economic problem to the country&#x27;s major trading partners, which may take counter-measures to offset the impact on their economy arising out of a loss of trade income arising from the initial devaluation.

==Devaluations in modern economies==
===UK economy===

====1949 devaluation====
At the outbreak of World War II, in order to stabilise sterling, the pound sterling was pegged to the United States dollar at the rate of $4.03 with exchange controls restricting convertibility volumes. This rate was confirmed by the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944.

After the war, US Lend-Lease funding, which had helped finance the UK&#x27;s high level of wartime expenditure, abruptly ended and the Anglo-American loan was conditional upon progress towards sterling becoming fully convertible into US dollars, thereby aiding US trade. In July 1947, sterling became convertible but the resultant drain on the UK&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves of US dollars was such that 7 weeks later, convertibility was suspended, rationing tightened and expenditure cuts made. The exchange rate reverted to its pre-convertibility level, a devaluation being avoided by the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps, choking off consumption by increasing taxes in 1947.

By 1949, in part due to a dock strike, the pressure on UK reserves supporting the fixed exchange rate mounted again at a time when Cripps was seriously ill and recuperating in Switzerland. Prime Minister Clement Attlee delegated a decision on how to respond to three young ministers whose jobs included economic portfolios, namely Hugh Gaitskell, Harold Wilson and Douglas Jay, who collectively recommended devaluation. Wilson was despatched with a letter from Attlee to tell Cripps of their decision, expecting that the Chancellor would object, which he did not. On 18 September 1949, the exchange rate was reduced from $4.03 to $2.80 and a series of supporting public expenditure cuts imposed soon afterwards.

====1967 devaluation====
When the Labour Government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson came to power in 1964, the new administration inherited an economy in a more precarious state than expected with the estimated balance of payments deficit for the year amounting to £800 million, twice as high as Wilson had predicted during the election campaign. Wilson was opposed to devaluation, in part due to the bad memories of the 1949 devaluation and its negative impact on the Attlee government, but also because he had repeatedly asserted that Labour was not the party of devaluation. Devaluation was avoided by a combination of tariffs and raising $3bn from foreign central banks.

By 1966, pressure on sterling was intensifying, due in part to the seamen&#x27;s strike, and the case for devaluation being articulated in the higher echelons of government, not least by the deputy prime minister George Brown. Wilson resisted and eventually pushed through a series of deflationary measures in lieu of devaluation including a 6 month wage freeze.

After a brief period in which the deflationary measures relieved sterling, pressure mounted again in 1967 as a consequence of the Six-Day War, the Arab oil embargo and a dock strike. After failing to secure a bail-out from the Americans or the French, a devaluation from US$2.80 to US$2.40 took effect on 18 November 1967. In a broadcast to the nation the following day, Wilson said, &quot;Devaluation does not mean that the value of the pound in the pocket in the hands of the … British housewife … is cut correspondingly. It does not mean that the pound in the pocket is worth 14% less to us now than it was.&quot; This wording is often misquoted as &quot;the pound in your pocket has not been devalued.&quot; Nevertheless the devaluation forced James Callaghan to resign as Chancellor of the Exchequer, making way for Roy Jenkins.

===Other economies===
The People&#x27;s Bank of China devalued the renminbi twice within two days by 1.9% and 1% in July 2015 in response to slowing economic growth, leading to the 2015–2016 Chinese stock market turbulence. Although the devaluation was welcomed by the International Monetary Fund, it led the United States Department of the Treasury to label China as a currency manipulator in 2019. On 5 August 2019, China devalued its currency in response to the imposition of trade tariffs by the United States against China.

India devalued the Indian rupee by 35% in 1966.

Mexico devalued the Mexican peso against the United States dollar in 1994 in preparation for the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to the Mexican peso crisis.

On January 11, 1994, France decided to devaluate the CFA Franc in 14 African countries in Central Africa and West Africa.

<text>Kuala Terengganu (; Terengganu Malay: &quot;Kole Tranung&quot;), colloquially referred to as KT, is the administrative, economic and royal city of the state of Terengganu, Malaysia. Kuala Terengganu is also the city of Kuala Terengganu District. It is also the only royal capital among the nine royal states of the country to bear its state&#x27;s name. Kuala Terengganu is located about 440 kilometres northeast of Kuala Lumpur on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The city is situated at the estuary of Terengganu River, facing the South China Sea.

As a district, Kuala Terengganu is the smallest in terms of area, but it and Kuala Nerus District that together form the city area has the largest population in Terengganu. The city population was 406,317 in 2010 and grew to 375,424 in 2020. City status was awarded to Kuala Terengganu with the title &quot;Bandaraya Warisan Pesisir Air&quot; (English: Waterfront Heritage City) on 1 January 2008.

Besides being a major political and economic centre to the state, the city is also the main gateway to many of the state&#x27;s tourist destinations. The attractions in and around the city include Kampung Cina, Pasar Besar Kedai Payang, Terengganu State Museum, and Batu Buruk Beach. Even though the city is not spared from modernity and development, Kuala Terengganu still retains strong Malay influences that are intermixed with other cultures from its long history as a port.

==Etymology==
In Malay, &quot;kuala&quot; can have the meanings of &quot;river mouth&quot;, &quot;estuary&quot;, or &quot;confluence&quot;. Thus, the name &quot;Kuala Terengganu&quot; is roughly translated as &quot;the confluence/estuary of Terengganu&quot;, referring to the broad expanse of the Terengganu River estuary which empties into the South China Sea. There are several theories regarding the name &quot;Terengganu&quot;. One such theory attributes the name&#x27;s origin to &quot;terang ganu&quot;, Malay for &#x27;bright rainbow&#x27;. Another story, which is considered to be the most popular version, is said to have been originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu, Baginda Omar. It tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered &quot;taring anu&quot; (Malay: &#x27;fang of something&#x27;). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where did they source their riches, to which they replied, from the land of &quot;taring anu&quot;, which later evolved into Terengganu.

==History==
Among the earliest references of Terengganu are in Chinese historical sources. A Chinese writer&#x27;s note during the Sui dynasty has mentioned about a state named &quot;Tan-Tan&quot; that sent tributes to China. The state was presumably located somewhere in Terengganu. Tan-Tan sent tributes to Sui dynasty and then to the Tang dynasty after Sui dynasty has collapsed. It ceased to send tributes to China after it came under the dominance of the Srivijaya during the 7th century. Chinese history books such as &quot;Lingwai Daida&quot; written by Zhou Qufei (周去非) in 1178 and the book &quot;Zhu fan zhi&quot; (also romanised as Chu-fanchi) written by Zhao Rugua (趙汝适; also romanised as Chau Ju-Kua) in 1226 mentioned &quot;Teng-ya-nu&quot; and &quot;Teng-ya-nung&quot; respectively, as being a vassal state of &quot;San-fo-ts&#x27;i&quot; (三佛齊), which is thought to be Srivijaya. After Srivijaya fell during the 13th century, Terengganu came under the influence of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Majapahit was vying with Ayutthaya Kingdom and the nascent Malacca Sultanate for the control of the Malay Peninsula. Malacca Sultanate prevailed and Terengganu then came under its influence. When the Malacca Sultanate fell in 1511 to the Portuguese, the newly established Sultanate of Johor exerted its influence on most of the former territories of the Malacca Sultanate, including Terengganu. Terengganu was briefly under the influence of the Aceh Sultanate during the early 17th century, but Johor managed to exert its influence again on Terengganu in the late 17th century.

=== Establishment of the Sultanate ===
The present Sultanate of Terengganu was established in the 1708. The first Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Zainal Abidin I established his court near Kuala Berang, then he moved his court a few more times until he settled near Bukit Keledang, Kuala Terengganu. During the early 18th century, Kuala Terengganu was still a small town. It was described as having about one thousand houses that were scattered around the town. The Chinese were already present in Kuala Terengganu at that time. Half of the population were Chinese and they were engaged in agriculture and trading. After the death of Sultan Daud in 1831, a brief civil war erupted between two claimants to the throne, namely Tengku Mansur and Tengku Omar. Tengku Omar was based at Bukit Puteri while Tengku Mansur was based at Balik Bukit. Tengku Omar was defeated by Tengku Mansur and he fled from Terengganu. Tengku Mansur became the next Sultan as Sultan Mansur II. His son, Sultan Muhammad succeeded him as the next Sultan after his death in 1837. However, in 1839, Tengku Omar returned to Terengganu with his entourage to reclaim the throne. He defeated Sultan Muhammad and forced Sultan Muhammad to flee. Tengku Omar reoccupied his fort at Bukit Puteri and was throned as the next Sultan, Sultan Omar.
In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British requested that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad. Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but they have yet to follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, under the command of Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam, and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in August 1883. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan&#x27;s palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace.
Kuala Terengganu continued to be Terengganu&#x27;s capital when it was still a vassal state of Siam and during the early years of British colonisation of Malaya.

=== British Colonial Period ===
Terengganu fell under the administration of Britain through the Bangkok Treaty of 1909 and was forced to accept a resident &quot;British advisor&quot;. Terengganu, along with four other states were grouped under the term of Unfederated Malay States. British maintained its rule on Terengganu until the Japanese occupation in World War II.

=== World War II ===
On 18 December 1941, Japanese forces from Kota Bahru would advance towards Kuala Terengganu. On 18 October 1943, Terengganu was annexed by Thailand as part of an agreement with the Japanese. After the war, the British regained control of Terengganu.

=== Modern History ===
In 1957, Malaya achieved its independence, and subsequently in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo (now the state of Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore merge to form Malaysia. On 18 January 1979, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was established to oversee the development of the town. The Municipal Council was upgraded to Kuala Terengganu City Council on 1 January 2008.

==Governance==

The city is administered by Kuala Terengganu City Council, which covers the whole area of Kuala Terengganu district as well as Kuala Nerus district. The district&#x27;s location at the estuary of Terengganu River divided the district into two parts, &quot;Kuala Terengganu Utara&quot; (North Kuala Terengganu), now known as Kuala Nerus, and &quot;Kuala Terengganu Selatan&quot; (South Kuala Terengganu), which is considered to be Kuala Terengganu proper. As the capital, the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state. It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings, housing the offices of many ministries&#x27; departments and governmental bodies, such as the Immigration and Customs Department, State Economic Planning Unit, Pos Malaysia Kuala Terengganu General Post Office, Terengganu State Library, and many others. As the administrative capital of Terengganu, the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman, the state secretariat building. Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state, being the site of the Sultan&#x27;s many palaces, for example Istana Badariah and Istana Maziah.

The Election Commission of Malaysia has divided Kuala Terengganu into eleven state assembly districts which covers the constituencies of Hulu Terengganu, Marang, Setiu, Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu, which are:
* N8 – Batu Rakit
* N9 – Tepuh
* N10 – Buluh Gading
* N11 – Seberang Takir
* N12 – Bukit Tunggal
* N13 – Wakaf Mempelam
* N14 – Bandar
* N15 – Ladang
* N16 – Batu Buruk
* N17 – Alur Limbat
* N22 – Manir
Kuala Terengganu was first designated as a local government area in 1928 through &quot;the Municipal and Health Enactment 1928&quot;. At this time, the area only covered a small part of the current city border, specifically the historic core around the river mouth. The area, nevertheless, was enlarged slowly. In 1950, the town was administered by Kuala Terengganu Town Board under section 51(1), &quot;the Local Authority Election Ordinance 1950&quot;. Like many other town boards at that time, the process of town planning was carried out according to &quot;the Town Board Enactment 1930&quot;. Until 1979, the town continued to be managed by Kuala Terengganu Town Board that governed an area of 5.4 square miles (1,398.6 hectares), with a population of around 53,300 people. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council (MPKT) was established due to the development that spilled over to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the former Town Board. MPKT was established on 18 January 1979 under the enforcement of &quot;the Local Government Act 1976&quot;. MPKT was created through the amalgamation of Kuala Terengganu Town Board and four local councils (North KT, South KT, West KT, and Central KT) with an area of 18,712 hectares covering 21 &quot;mukim&quot; or sub-districts, including some parts of Northern Kuala Terengganu.
On 1 January 1985, the sub-districts of Bukit Palos and Alor Limbat were removed from the council and placed under the administration of Marang District Council. With these changes, the area under the council&#x27;s administration was reduced to 16,806 hectares. On 16 December 1996, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was extended to cover the entire area of Kuala Terengganu district back then, including the resort island, Redang Island. With that, the number of the sub-districts increased to 23 while the area increased dramatically to 60,528 hectares. On 1 January 2008, a declaration was made by the state government and Kuala Terengganu became the first city on the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia to achieve city status. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council changed its name to Kuala Terengganu City Council (MBKT) to reflect the change of its status. On 18 September 2014, the northern part of Kuala Terengganu (formerly called as Northern Kuala Terengganu) was declared as the state&#x27;s newest district with the name of Kuala Nerus. This however does not mean a creation of a new local government area as Kuala Nerus is still under the jurisdiction of MBKT.

As the local council for the districts of Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus, and an agency under the Terengganu state government, MBKT is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning and beautification, environmental protection and building control, social, economic and tourism development, and general maintenance and constructions of urban infrastructure. The MBKT main headquarters is located at Menara Permint in Jalan Sultan Ismail. There are two districts that are administered by MBKT. They are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus. Kuala Nerus was formerly a part of Kuala Terengganu district, but on 18 September 2014, the sixth Malaysian Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak declared this northern part of Kuala Terengganu district as the eighth and newest district in Terengganu state.

With a population or over 300,000 and a size of 39,890 hectares, it comprises a substantial part of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district. Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times. The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include Gong Badak and Batu Rakit. Among major education institutions located in this district are Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, The Institute of Teacher Education Dato Razali Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute. The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) Teaching Hospital is now under construction, thus providing this district with a new establishment. The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district, as is the multipurpose Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own, since both of them are under the administration of the same local government, this makes MBKT among the few local governments in Malaysia to manage two different districts e.g. Alor Setar, Penang Island and Seberang Perai.

==Geography==

The eastern part of Terengganu district that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu River basin, Nerus River basin, Ibai River basin, and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests. Hills between 200 and 600 metres mostly dominate the western part of the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees.

===Climate===

As a part of Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28 °C to 30 °C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea somehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.

There are two main types of monsoons in the state. The southwest monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind.


==Demographics==
===Ethnicity and religion===
In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier working for the East India Company, estimated the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but this was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also a considerable number of Arabs and their descendants in Kuala Terengganu.

According to The Malaysian Census 2010, Kuala Terengganu has a population of 406,317. The city population mainly consists of Malays with a population of 319,813. Chinese residents are the second biggest ethnic group (11,617). Other residents include non-Malaysian citizens (4,326), other Bumiputras (643), Indians (867) and others (287). The same census shows that the population of Kuala Terengganu by religion is 96.9% Muslim, 2.5% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Christian, and 0.2% follower of other religions, Sikhs, or non-religious. All Malays are Muslim. The Chinese of Kuala Terengganu are made up of Hokkien speakers and they practise Buddhism, Taoism, Islam or Christianity. A small number of Hindus and Sikhs also exist. By 2020, the total population for the entire area under Kuala Terengganu City Council jurisdiction had risen to around 375,424 people.

===Languages===
Terengganu Malay is the most widely spoken and main lingua franca in the city and is spoken by the Malays in Kuala Terengganu. Some Malays also speak Kelantanese, especially those who came from Besut, northern Setiu and Kelantan. The Chinese mostly use Hokkien with some using Teochew and Mandarin. Most Indians in Kuala Terengganu speak Tamil. Standard Malay and English are widely spoken and understood.

==Economy==
Kuala Terengganu was a major fishing port and one of the important trading ports in Malaya. The chief export commodities were coffee, gambier, gold, ivory, pepper and tin. They were mainly traded for rice, tobacco, cotton goods and opium.

The economic sector in Kuala Terengganu is mostly made up of small-scale manufacturing industries such as the traditional textile making, local food industries, arts and craft factories, and agriculture, with most of them centred around residential areas or villages. There are two main industrial estates catered to bigger industries, one in Chendering and the other one in Gong Badak. Factories such as those that produce bricks or timber products are located further away from the main city areas. As the principal gateway for tourists to the state, tourism remains as one of economic source for Kuala Terengganu.

==Public facilities and infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Public transport====
Transport facilities that are available in Kuala Terengganu include the taxicab and Kuala Terengganu Bus Terminal where the local bus services and interstate coaches to all major cities and towns in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore operate. There is a limited service tourist bus that plies back and forth to tourist areas such as the Nor Arfa batik outlet south of the city, and the jetty for ferries to the island resorts at Redang and Perhentian islands. Kuala Terengganu has its own special bus service known as &quot;Bas Bandar&quot; or Town Bus, operated by the state-owned firm &quot;Cas Ligas Sdn. Bhd.&quot; The buses have the characteristics of a traditional old Malay house through the unique roof design to reflect the state cultural identity. The buses cover three lines in and out of the city. A token fare of MYR1 should be paid for each ride.

The BAS.MY initiative in Kuala Terengganu, launched under the *Stage Bus Service Transformation (SBST)* program since February 2025, provides reliable and affordable public transportation for residents. Operated by the Land Public Transport Agency (APAD) and funded by the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, the service covers key routes such as T100 (City Feeder), T20 (Kuala Terengganu to Bukit Payung), and T30 (Kuala Terengganu to Marang Terminal), with buses departing hourly from 6:00 AM to 7:30 PM daily. The service features a vibrant pink livery and offers fare exemptions for students (aged 7–17), seniors (60+), and persons with disabilities, alongside a flat monthly pass of RM50 for unlimited rides.

There are also trishaw services although this service is dying fast and is not as extensive as the ones in the states of Malacca and Penang. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu. The city&#x27;s only taxi rank stands nearby to the city&#x27;s bus terminal.

As with the rest of Terengganu, Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) does not serve Kuala Terengganu. Nevertheless, this is about to change as the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, has commenced and is slated to connect Kuala Terengganu with Tumpat and Kota Bharu in Kelantan, Kuantan in Pahang, and Gombak in Kuala Lumpur by 2026.

Kuala Terengganu is also the first city in the East Coast to have a public bicycle-sharing system. This service is provided the Singaporean operator, oBike. Like all other cities with oBike, the system has no docking stations. Instead the bikes have a built-in Bluetooth lock and can therefore be left anywhere at the end of a journey. Users use a smartphone app to locate and hire bikes.

====Land====

The Sultan Mahmud Bridge, a three-kilometre bridge over the Terengganu River, provides the main road link between the two banks of the river (connecting Kuala Nerus to Kuala Terengganu) and Duyong Island. Two other bridges that straddles the river to connect both sides of the city are Manir Bridge and Pulau Sekati Bridge. A new fourth bridge, Kuala Terengganu Drawbridge, was completed in mid-2019 and fully opened for traffic in August. The bascule bridge, which is the first of its kind in Malaysia, spans 638 metres and has four 15-storey towers with skybridges. It connects the city centre with Seberang Takir via Muara Utara, a reclaimed land slated for future developments. The city and suburbs are relatively easy to negotiate by car. Kuala Terengganu is connected to other towns via a good network of roads that are accessible from many major towns and cities in Peninsula Malaysia. The East Coast Expressway (LPT) E8, which starts from Gombak until Kuala Terengganu, has shorten the time for travellers to drive from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It takes four hours to drive from Kuala Lumpur to reach the city via the LPT. Visitors can also drive to Kuala Terengganu by using the Federal Route 3 from Kuantan (besides using the LPT), Kota Bharu, and Johor Bahru that offers a more scenic view of the coastline and villages. From the north of the peninsula, Kuala Terengganu is reachable via East-West Highway 4 and Second East–West Highway 185.

====Air====

The nearest airport which serve the city is the Sultan Mahmud Airport (IATA: TGG, ICAO: WMKN) serving domestic and international routes located in the neighbouring Kuala Nerus District. The airlines serving this airport are Malaysia Airlines, Firefly, AirAsia, and Malindo Air. Until December 2014, the airport was connected by 5 cities which operated daily and weekly flights from/to Kuala Lumpur–International, Kuala Lumpur-Subang, Medan, Miri, and Singapore. Malaysia Airlines also brings passengers to Mecca via Jeddah and Medina during the hajj season. In 2013, the airport handled 699,310 passengers with 11,402 aircraft movements. The terminal was designed to handle 2 million passengers every year.

====Water====
The city also has water transportation that ply the Terengganu River. The lifeline between the north and south parts of the city are the water taxis more popularly known as &quot;bot penambang&quot;. Bot penambang are engined, roofed wooden boats made to carry passengers from Seberang Takir Jetty and Pulau Duyong Kecil Jetty to Kuala Terengganu Jetty. It is the easiest and shortest way to get to the city. There are also ferry services to the resort island of Redang and other small islands, although these services are mainly carried out by modern express ferries. The ferries dock at Syahbandar Jetty, just in front of the General Post Office.

===Courts of law and legal enforcement===

All types of courts in Kuala Terengganu can be found in Jalan Sultan Mohamad. The High Court, Sessions Court, and the Magistrate Court are housed under one building complex. Another type of court, the Syariah Court is situated not far from the Terengganu Courts Complex. The headquarters of the Royal Malaysia Police&#x27;s Terengganu Police Contingent and the Kuala Terengganu District Police Contingent are at Jalan Sultan Omar. Other small police stations are located in and around the two districts that make up the city. There is no prison complex in the district, but temporary lock-up cells are to be found in most police stations here. The main fire station is at Jalan Kemajuan, near Bukit Kecil. This is the biggest fire station in Kuala Terengganu. Another fire station is located just beside Pasar Payang in the city centre. The headquarters of the Malaysian Civil Defence Department, the civil defence services agency in Malaysia, is at Jalan Lapangan Terbang, near to Terengganu Sports Complex. The 18th Battalion of the Royal Malay Regiment of the Malaysian Army has its camp in the northern part of the district at Kem Sri Pantai in Seberang Takir, near to the airport and Teluk Ketapang Beach. The camp is currently undergoing restoration and upgrading processes.

Unlike other major cities, Kuala Terengganu does not have a lot of hospitals. The main hospital is Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital (HSNZ), formerly known as Kuala Terengganu General Hospital, the largest hospital in the state with 821 beds. This is a public government hospital that began to provide its services during the 1920s. Kuala Terengganu Specialist Hospital is the first and largest private hospital in the state, operating since September 2006. Another private hospital that operates in the city is SALAM Specialist Hospital. There are other types of clinics such as private and public health clinics, village clinics, and 1Malaysia clinics operating in the district.

===Religious institutions===

There are no shortages of mosques or Muslim prayer buildings. The most famous among the religious buildings and considered as tourist attractions include Abidin Mosque (built during the reign of the late Sultan Zainal Abidin II between 1793 and 1808) and Tengku Tengah Zaharah Mosque, also known as the &#x27;floating mosque&#x27; due to its structure that was built above water. Another old mosque in the city is the Hiliran Mosque, which was constructed in 1874.

==Tourism and culture==
===Attractions and recreation spots===

====Historical====

The Terengganu State Museum is located in Kampung Losong. It is acclaimed to be one of the largest museum complexes in Malaysia and South East Asia with an area of 27 hectares. The architecture is based on the traditional Terengganu Malay house known as &quot;rumah tele&quot;. It has eight different galleries and other open air exhibits such as Petronas Gallery, Maritime Gallery, Islam Gallery, exhibits of traditional Terengganuese houses, and many others. The museum is also the home of the Terengganu Inscription Stone, the oldest artefact with Jawi writing in this country.

Near the museum is the Islamic Heritage Park (Malay: Taman Tamadun Islam). This park is an educational entertainment park that showcases various replicas of famous mosque from all over the world. Among the replicas are Al-Masjid al-Haram, Qol Sharif Mosque, and Masjid Negara. The Crystal Mosque is also located here. Boat cruise services along Terengganu River are also provided for the visitors.

A small hill known as Bukit Puteri can be found nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is located near the banks of Terengganu River and because of its strategic location, it was used as a fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, a graveyard, and monuments can be found on top of the hill. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a century-old brass bell known as &quot;genta&quot; will be rung to signify that it is time for iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.

====Cultural====

The Chinatown of Kuala Terengganu (Malay: Kampung Cina, Simplified Chinese: 唐人坡, local pronunciation: Teng-lang-po) is the centre of the Peranakan Chinese in the city. One of the main tourist attractions of Kuala Terengganu, this settlement consists of two rows of shophouses from the prewar era, with some of them dating back from the 1700s. Most of the houses are 2 stories high, mainly made of bricks or concrete, with wooden flooring for the second storey.

<text>Jerk were an Australian industrial metal band formed in 1998. They released a sole album, &quot;When Pure Is Defiled&quot; (April 2003), with the line-up of Charles Cilia, Leeno Dee, Johnathan Devoy and Lamar Lowder, which peaked at No. 38 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Their song &quot;Sucked In&quot; was used in the video games, &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; and &quot;NHL 2004&quot;. Jerk supported gigs by Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Killing Joke and Disturbed on their respective tours.

==History==
Jerk were formed in 1998 in Sydney as an industrial goth rock band by vocalist Michael Matral, drummer Lamar Lowder, guitarist Johnathan Devoy and bass player Ross Empson (later in Tourettes). They contributed the track &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; to the Mushroom Records soundtrack to the Australian horror feature film, &quot;Cut&quot;, in 2000. In June 2000, Jerk had a line-up change with Devoy now on lead vocals and Lowder still on drums, joined by guitarist Charles Cilia and former Candy Harlots bass guitarist Leeno Dee.

In 2001, Jerk released a self-titled six-track extended play with three accompanying music videos, directed by Lowder. These led to an appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra late in the year. In April 2002 Jerk signed to Sony Records.

In 2003, Jerk with the line-up of Cilia, Dee, Devoy and Lowder, issued their full-length album &quot;When Pure Is Defiled&quot;, which was co-produced by Sean Beavan and Lamar Lowder. The album reached No. 38 on the ARIA Albums Chart in April, as well as No. 8 on the ARIA Australasian Artists Albums and No. 6 on the ARIA Heavy Rock &amp; Metal Albums charts. Lowder had also produced work by Chainsuck and Engines of Aggression.

It included their 2002 single, &quot;I Hate People Like That&quot;, which peaked at No. 83 on the ARIA Singles Chart in November. Music videos were subsequently provided for &quot;I Hate People Like That&quot;, &quot;Just What You Need&quot; and the Lowder-directed &quot;My Friends All Lie&quot;.

Jerk embarked on a national tour in 2003 to promote the album and performances included support slots for Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Killing Joke and Disturbed at the Sydney gig of their Australian tours. Jerk received exposure in the North American market when their song, &quot;Sucked In&quot;, was used in the video games, &quot;NHL 2004&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;.

Devoy stepped down, and was replaced by vocalist, Mario Spate, early in 2004, but the band broke up by the end of the year. Lowder returned to music production and song writing. In January 2006 Cilia, Dee and Devoy formed another band called Ink, which dropped the industrial sound. Ink subsequently released two EPs, &quot;Lead… or Follow&quot; (2007) and &quot;Black Water Reign&quot; (2008). On 21 July 2013 Cilia, Dee and Devoy reunited for a one-off acoustic, Jerk gig.

<text>Robert Norman Thompson (May 17, 1914 – November 16, 1997) was a Canadian politician, chiropractor, and educator. He was born in Duluth, Minnesota, to Canadian parents and moved to Canada in 1918 with his family. Raised in Alberta, he graduated from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1939 and worked as a chiropractor and then as a teacher before serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II.

== Early political career ==
Thompson supported the Social Credit Party of Alberta from its creation. His age prevented him from running as a candidate in the 1935 provincial election. Instead he became youth leader of the party.

== Ethiopia ==
In 1944, Thompson was sent to Ethiopia to serve as the founding commander of the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force and head up nation&#x27;s air force academy. He became a confidant of Emperor Haile Selassie I and, after the war, became deputy minister of education and helped to rebuild the nation&#x27;s public school system.

== Return to Canada and Social Credit ==
Thompson returned to Canada in 1958 and resumed his activities with Social Credit. He soon became president of the national Social Credit Party of Canada and did much to rebuild the party after it was shut out of Parliament in the massive Progressive Conservative (PC) landslide of 1958.

Alberta Premier Ernest Manning saw Thompson as the ideal person to succeed Solon Low as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada and backed him in a hotly-contested leadership vote against Réal Caouette, the movement&#x27;s leader in Quebec, which was won by Thompson. Years later, Caouette claimed that he would have won, but Manning told him to tell the Quebec delegates to vote for Thompson because the West would never accept a francophone Catholic as party leader.

Under Thompson&#x27;s leadership, the Socreds returned to the Commons in the 1962 federal election. Thompson himself was elected from Red Deer, Alberta. However, he was one of only four Socreds elected from English Canada, and 26 came from Quebec led by Caouette. Under the circumstances, Thompson was all but forced to name Caouette as the party&#x27;s deputy leader. Thompson was re-elected in the 1963 and 1965 elections.

The 1962, 1963, and 1965 elections produced minority parliaments in which no one party had a majority of seats (the PCs won the largest plurality in the first election, the Liberals in the other two). That meant that the government had to rely on smaller parties such as Social Credit to pass legislation and remain in power.

== Divisions ==
The Social Credit Party was sharply divided after 1962. Most Socred MPs came from Quebec and regarded Caouette as their leader. The number of Socreds from English Canada was declining, as was made sharply clear at the 1962 election. Additionally, the party&#x27;s English wing, including Thompson, had largely abandoned social credit theory in favour of fiscal conservatism. In contrast, Caouette and other Quebec Socreds still held fast to the theory.

Despite the massive linguistic imbalance in his caucus, Thompson refused to cede the leadership of the party to Caouette. That caused the party to split, and most of the party&#x27;s Quebec MPs followed Caouette into his new Ralliement créditiste in 1963.
== Move to the Progressive Conservatives ==
Thompson was frustrated by the lack of support that the national party enjoyed from the provincial Social Credit parties in Alberta and British Columbia, where they formed the governments and ran powerful political machines. Additionally, Manning was becoming concerned with the leftward trajectory of both the federal Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. He encouraged Thompson to try to bring about a merger of the federal Social Credit and Progressive Conservative parties.

Negotiations failed, but with the backing of both Manning and Robert Stanfield, Thompson decided to cross the floor to the PCs in hopes of influencing that party. He resigned as leader of Social Credit in March 1967 by citing the lack of support for the federal Social Credit Party from its provincial wings. He then sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for his old seat. Despite vehement opposition from the local riding association, he won the nomination and was re-elected in 1968.

== British Columbia ==
Prior to the 1972 election, Thompson moved to British Columbia to teach and tried to win a seat from that province, Surrey—White Rock but was defeated in his attempt. He retired from politics and taught political science at Trinity Western University in British Columbia through the 1970s. At various times he also served as chairman of the university&#x27;s board of governors and vice president of development at the school.

In the late 1980s, Thompson was on the executive board of the World Anti-Communist League.

In his last years, Thompson was instrumental in bringing the former Emperor Haile Sellassie&#x27;s children out of Ethiopia and to safety in the west after the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution. His intervention probably saved them from death.

<doc id="603385" wikidata="Q1187952" url="?curid=603385" title="Noblesse oblige">
<text>La noblesse oblige (; ; literally &quot;nobility obliges&quot;) is a French expression that means that nobility extends beyond mere entitlement, requiring people who hold such status to fulfill social responsibilities; the term retains the same meaning in English. For example, a primary obligation of a nobleman could include generosity towards those around him. As those who lived on the nobles&#x27; land had obligations to the nobility, the nobility had obligations to their people, including protection at the least.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term suggests &quot;noble ancestry constrains to honourable behaviour; privilege entails responsibility.&quot; The &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; defines it thus:

# Whoever claims to be noble must conduct himself nobly.
# (Figuratively) One must act in a fashion that conforms to one&#x27;s position and privileges with which one has been born, bestowed and/or has earned.
&quot;OED&quot; and others cite the source of the phrase as &quot;Maxims&quot; (1808) by Pierre Marc Gaston de Lévis, Duke of Lévis.

== Meaning and variants ==
&quot;Noblesse oblige&quot; is generally used to imply that wealth, power, and prestige come with responsibilities. In ethical discussion, the term is sometimes used to summarize a moral economy wherein privilege must be balanced by duty towards those who lack such privilege or who cannot perform such duty. Recently, it has been used to refer to public responsibilities of the rich, famous and powerful, notably to provide good examples of behaviour or exceed minimal standards of decency. It has also been used to describe a person taking the blame for something in order to solve an issue or save someone else.

==History and examples==
 
An early instance of this concept in literature may be found in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Book XII, the hero Sarpedon delivers a speech in which he urges his comrade Glaucus to fight with him in the front ranks of battle. In Pope&#x27;s translation, Sarpedon exhorts Glaucus thus:

&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace
The first in valour, as the first in place;
That when with wondering eyes our confidential bands
Behold our deeds transcending our commands,
Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
Whom those that envy dare not imitate!&lt;/poem&gt;

In Luke 12:48, Jesus says: &quot;Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.&quot;

During the Hellenistic period, a similar practice of benevolence and benefaction in funding public institutions and distributing wealth, known as euergetism, used private, focused urbanization and investment to engineer a reciprocal relationship predicated on tradition and established societal norms. These customs bounded the civic elite to economic intervention through these social expectations and the populace to loyalty in subordinating them to dependents sustaining themselves through philanthropy.

On a larger scale, this mutual interdependence can be observed in the symbiotic relationship between a tributary state and its overlord: Alexander the Great formalized this policy in seeking to portray his conquests and subjugations as a form of liberation by directing funding into recently acquired polities.

Similarly, patron-client relationships in ancient Roman society and the mutual paternalistic obligations the patrician class maintained towards plebeians existed for a similar purpose: to reinforce traditional social hierarchies and imbue loyalty. Within the Roman colonies, a similar expectation existed surrounding the collective maintenance of the outpost by its Roman inhabitants.

In &quot;Le Lys dans la Vallée&quot;, written in 1835 and published in 1836, Honoré de Balzac recommends certain standards of behaviour to a young man, concluding: &quot;Everything I have just told you can be summarized by an old word: &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;!&quot; His advice included &quot;others will respect you for detesting people who have done detestable things.&quot;

The phrase is carved into Bertram Goodhue&#x27;s Los Angeles Public Library on a sculpture by Lee Lawrie as part of Hartley Burr Alexander&#x27;s iconographic scheme for the building.

In the song &quot;The Life I Lead&quot; from the 1964 Disney film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, the character Mr. Banks (played by David Tomlinson) uses the phrase: &quot;I&#x27;m the lord of my castle! The sovereign! The liege! I treat my subjects, servants, children, wife, with a firm but gentle hand—&quot;noblesse oblige&quot;.&quot;

==Critique==
Jurists Mickey Dias and Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld have pointed out that rights and duties are &quot;jural corelatives&quot;, which means that if someone has a right, &quot;someone else&quot; owes them a duty. Dias&#x27;s reasoning was used in &quot;Murphy v Brentwood District Council&quot; (1991) to disapprove Alfred Denning&#x27;s judgment in &quot;Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council&quot; (1972).

<doc id="603387" wikidata="Q333628" url="?curid=603387" title="Lord George Hamilton">
<text>Lord George Francis Hamilton (17 December 1845 – 22 September 1927) was a British Conservative Party politician of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who served as First Lord of the Admiralty and Secretary of State for India.

==Background==
Hamilton was born in Brighton into the aristocracy, the third son of James, Marquess of Abercorn (later the Duke of Abercorn) and Lady Louisa, daughter of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. His parents were &quot;long remembered as the handsomest and most distinguished couple of their time.&quot; 

He was educated at Harrow. He served with the Rifle Brigade and Coldstream Guards, achieving the rank of lieutenant. 

==Political career==
Hamilton was Member of Parliament for Middlesex between 1868 and 1885 and for Ealing between 1885 and 1906. He served under Benjamin Disraeli as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1874 to 1878 and as Vice-President of the Committee on Education from 1878 to 1880 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1878.

He entered the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty under Lord Salisbury in 1885, a post he held until 1886 and again between 1886 and 1892. In 1894 he was elected as Chairman of the London School Board, standing down after one year when the Unionists won the general election and he became Secretary of State for India under Salisbury, which he remained until 1903, the last year under the premiership of Arthur Balfour. He was appointed a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in the 1903 Durbar Honours, and was knighted and invested with the decoration by King Edward VII on 28 January 1903, during a visit to Windsor Castle.

In 1916 he was part of the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry.

==Other public appointments==
For a number of years, Hamilton was a member of the board of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which ran the majority of London&#x27;s Underground lines. He served as the company&#x27;s chairman between 1915 and 1919, following the resignation of Sir Edgar Speyer in 1915.

Hamilton also held the honorary posts of Captain of Deal Castle (1899–1923) and Major of Deal (1909) and received the degree of honorary LLD from Glasgow University and of honorary DCL from the University of Oxford. He was also a Justice of Peace for Middlesex and Westminster. Hamilton was a Founder of the London School Board Masonic Lodge No. 2611 in 1896

He was also President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1910 to 1912 and from 1915 to 1916.

==Family and children==
Hamilton married Lady Maud Caroline, daughter of Henry Lascelles, 3rd Earl of Harewood, in 1871. They had three sons:

*Ronald James Hamilton OBE (1872–1958), who fought in the First World War, was wounded and in 1919 invested an OBE. He was awarded with the decoration of the Order of the Crown (Belgium). He served as First Secretary in the Diplomatic Service. In 1915 he married Florence Marguerite (Sarah Brooke) Hanna (d. 1959). They had one daughter:
**Maud Sarah Hamilton (1917–1995). In 1939 she married Squadron Leader Count Manfred Maria Edmund Ralph Beckett Czernin von und zu Chudenitz, DFC, DSO, MC, RAF (1913–1962). With him she had one son and one daughter.
*Major Anthony George Hamilton (1874–1936), who fought in the First World War with the East Kent Regiment. He died unmarried and without issue.
*Vice-Admiral Robert Cecil Hamilton (1882–1947), who fought in the First World War. In 1911 he married Edith Maud Paley (d. 1967), daughter of the barrister Algernon Herbert Paley.

Hamilton died in September 1927, aged 81, at his house in Portman Square, London. His wife survived him by eleven years and died in April 1938.

<text>The Eder is a major river in Germany that begins in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia and passes in to Hesse, where it empties into the River Fulda.

== History ==
The river was first mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. In his Annals, he describes the Roman campaign against the Chatti under the command of Germanicus in 15 AD. Forty-five thousand soldiers of the Roman army destroyed the major centre of the Chatti, Mattium, directly after they crossed the &quot;Adrana&quot; (Eder).

In the Middle Ages, the river was known by the names Aderna, Adarna and Adrina.

On the banks of the Eder, in the town of Schwarzenau, near Bad Berleburg, a religious (Anabaptist) group was founded in August 1708; the Schwarzenau Brethren. Eight adults were completely baptised thrice in the Eder. This group emigrated to America where they are still to be found.

As late as up to the end of the 19th century, the river was also known in local dialect as &quot;Edder&quot;. For instance, in Felsberg-Gensungen, the pharmacy is known as the &quot;Edder-Apotheke&quot;.

== Gold in the Eder ==
Sediments of the Eder contain a proportion of gold. The majority of this gold is said to originate from Eisenberg (Korbach), which contains one of the largest reserves of gold in Middle Europe. Gold is eroded out of the Eisenberg, for example, by the Itter stream, which, since the Edersee dam was built, flows into the Edersee lake.

Gold panning in the Eder has been known since 1308. The main historical area for panning the gold is between Affoldern and Fritzlar. In the 14th century, the Teutonic Order panned gold out of the Eder sediments near Obermöllrich. In the 18th century, even ducats were minted from Eder gold; they are collector&#x27;s items today.

Up to the 1970s, school children from Duisburg, who stayed at a nearby holiday camp, together with a teacher from Marienhagen, part of the town of Vöhl, went panning for gold in the sediments of the River Itter. Panning for gold along the Eder is still popular.

== Course ==
The river rises from the Ederkopf mountain in the Rothaar mountain range in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, near the springs of the Lahn and Sieg rivers. However, unlike the Lahn and Sieg, which are both tributaries of the Rhine, the Eder flows east and north, into the river Fulda at Edermünde, south of Kassel. The Fulda then converges with the Werra River at Hann. Münden to form the Weser River, which flows in to the North Sea.


== Edersee Dam ==
The Edersee Dam is situated below the town of Waldeck. It is constructed of rock and concrete, and is high and long. It was completed in 1914; in 2014 its 100th birthday was celebrated. It forms the Edersee lake, which is long and contains 200 million cubic metres of water. This is used to generate hydroelectricity and to regulate water levels for shipping on the Weser river.

At low water in late summer, and during dry years, the remnants of three villages (Asel, Bringhausen, and Berich) and a bridge across the original river bed, which was submerged when the lake was filled in 1914, can be seen. Descendants of those buried there go to visit the graves of their ancestors.

== Destruction of the Eder dam ==

On the night of the 17 May 1943, Avro Lancaster bombers of the RAF 617 Squadron used specially-developed bouncing bombs (codename: Upkeep) that were engineered by Barnes Wallis. They were used to destroy the Möhne and Eder dams, as part of Operation Chastise. The dam was repaired and in use again before the end of the year. The story of the raid was documented by the 1955 film called &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;.

== Tributaries of the Eder ==


The most important tributaries of the Eder are (listed first in Eder-kilometres from source to the Fulda):

<doc id="603390" wikidata="Q954204" url="?curid=603390" title="Korg M1">
<text>The Korg M1 is a synthesizer and music workstation manufactured by Korg from 1988 to 1995. It is one of the bestselling synthesizers in history, selling an estimated 250,000 units. The M1 was widely used in popular music and stock music in the late 80s and early 90s. The piano and organ presets were used in 1990s house music, beginning with Madonna&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Vogue&quot;.

==Development==
Korg&#x27;s chief engineer, Junichi Ikeuchi, led the hardware engineering design of the M1. Whereas previous synthesizers had shipped with sounds chosen for different markets, the Korg chairman, Tsutomu Kato, and his son Seiki decided that their synthesizers should use the same sounds internationally. Korg assembled an international team to develop the sounds for the M1. To create a deep blown bottle sound, the team played a pan flute over a large sake bottle.

== Features ==
The M1 features a 61-note velocity- and aftertouch-sensitive keyboard, 16-note polyphony, a joystick for pitch-bend and modulation control, an eight-track MIDI sequencer, separate LFOs for vibrato and filter modulation, and ADSR envelopes. Data can be stored on RAM and PCM cards.

The M1 has a ROM with four megabytes of 16-bit PCM tones — a large amount at the time — including instruments that had not been used extensively in mainstream music. The sounds include sampled attack transients, loops, sustained waveforms and percussive samples. The timbres include piano, strings, acoustic guitar, woodwinds, sitar, kalimba, wind chimes and drums. &quot;Fact&quot; described the sounds as &quot;wonderfully, endearingly wonky ... each one managed to sound simultaneously realistic and synthetic all at once&quot;.

The M1 also features effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, tremolo, EQ, distortion, and Leslie simulation, an innovative inclusion at the time. According to &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, none of the M1&#x27;s features were unique, but were implemented and combined in a new way.

== Reception ==
The M1 was released in 1988 and was manufactured until 1995, selling an estimated 250,000 units. Reviewing it for &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; in 1988, Tony Hastings wrote that it was &quot;destined to be big, very big&quot;, with &quot;sensational&quot; sounds and extensive features that outperformed its competitors. It was widely used in popular music and stock music in the late 80s and early 90s. The piano and organ presets were used in 1990s house music, beginning with Madonna&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Vogue&quot;.

In 2002, the &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; journalist Mark Vail wrote that the M1 was the bestselling synthesizer in history, though he noted that Korg had not verified the sales figures. Both &quot;Sound and Sound&quot; and &quot;Fact&quot; described it as the most popular synthesizer of all time. &quot;Fact&quot; attributed the success to its sampling and sequencer features, which allowed musicians to produce entire tracks without a studio before the rise of digital audio workstations.

== Variants ==

Following the success of the M1, Korg expanded its lineup with several series of new workstations, including the T-series in 1989, the 01-series in 1991, the X-series in 1993, and the N-series in 1996. The 01/W built upon the M1’s AI synthesis with the enhanced AI2 system, which introduced additional effects and digital waveshaping. Rack-mountable versions of the M1 include the M1R and the more affordable M3R. Additionally, Korg released the M1EX and the M1REX rackmount, both featuring sounds from the T-series.

Korg released a software version of the M1 in 2006 as part of the Korg Legacy Collection. This digital version features 8-part multitimbrality, 256-note polyphony and presets from all 19 optional ROM cards. A free update added the entire preset collection from the T-series workstations to the M1 plugin.

<text>Edward Adolphus St. Maur, 12th Duke of Somerset, (20 December 180428 November 1885), styled Lord Seymour until 1855, was a British Whig aristocrat and politician, who served in various cabinet positions in the mid-19th century, including that of First Lord of the Admiralty.

==Background and education==
Somerset was the eldest son of Edward St. Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset, and Lady Charlotte, daughter of Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton. He was baptized on 16 February 1805 at St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.

He owned 25,000 acres, mostly in Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire.

==Political career==
Somerset sat as Member of Parliament as Lord Seymour for Okehampton between 1830 and 1831 and for Totnes between 1834 and 1855. He served under Lord Melbourne as a Lord of the Treasury between 1835 and 1839, as Joint Secretary to the Board of Control between 1839 and 1841 and as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between June and August 1841 and was a member of Lord John Russell&#x27;s first administration as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between 1849 and 1851, when the office was abolished. He served on the Royal Commission on the British Museum (1847–49). In August 1851 he was appointed to the newly created office of First Commissioner of Works by Russell. In October of the same year, he entered the cabinet and was sworn of the Privy Council. He remained First Commissioner of Works until the government fell in February 1852.

Somerset succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1855 and entered the House of Lords. He did not serve in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s first administration, but when Palmerston became Prime Minister for the second time in 1859, Somerset was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet. He held this post until 1866, the last year under the premiership of Russell. He refused to join William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first ministry in 1868, but gave independent support to the chief measures of the government.

He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1862 and in 1863 he was created Earl St. Maur, of Berry Pomeroy in the County of Devon. &quot;St. Maur&quot; was supposed to have been the original form of the family name and &quot;Seymour&quot; a later corruption. From some time in the early 19th century until 1923, &quot;St. Maur&quot; was used as the family name, but since 1923 the dukes have again used the familiar &quot;Seymour&quot;.

Somerset was also the author of &quot;Christian Theology and Modern Scepticism&quot; (1872), and &quot;Monarchy and Democracy&quot; (1880). Between 1861 and 1885 he served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon.

==Family==
Somerset married in Grosvenor Square, London, on 10 June 1830, Jane Georgiana Sheridan, who was the &quot;Queen of Beauty&quot; at the Eglinton Tournament of 1839. The Somersets had two sons and three daughters:
*Lady Jane Hermione Seymour (1 January 18324 April 1909) she married Sir Frederick Ulric Graham, 3rd Baronet, of Netherby, on 26 October 1852. They had eight children, including the Countess of Verulam and the Duchess of Montrose.
*Lady Ulrica Frederica Jane Seymour (12 January 183326 or 28 January 1916) she married the Rt Hon. Lord Henry Frederick Thynne on 1 June 1858. They had six children.
*Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur (17 July 183530 September 1869) he had two illegitimate children by Rosina Swan.
*Lord Edward Percy Seymour (19 August 184120 December 1865) was a diplomat and died after being mauled by a bear.
*Lady Helen Guendolen Seymour (14 November 184614 August 1910) she married Sir John William Ramsden, 5th Baronet on 2 August 1865. They had four children. Lady Guendolen Ramsden inherited the Bulstrode estate.

Her Grace died on 14 December 1884. The Duke of Somerset survived her by less than a year and died on 28 November 1885, aged 80, and was buried with her in St James&#x27;s Churchyard at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. As his two sons both died in his lifetime, the family titles (except the Earldom of St. Maur, which became extinct) devolved on his younger brother, Archibald Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset.

The 12th Duke left his London residence, Somerset House in Park Lane, to his eldest daughter Lady Hermione Graham.

<doc id="603400" wikidata="Q694460" url="?curid=603400" title="Etrich Taube">
<text>The Etrich &quot;Taube, also known by the names of the various later manufacturers who built versions of the type, such as theRumpler &quot;Taube, was a pre-World War I monoplane aircraft. It was the first military aeroplane to be mass-produced in Germany.

The Taube was very popular prior to the First World War, and it was also used by the air forces of Italy and Austria-Hungary. Even the Royal Naval Air Service operated at least one Taube in 1912. On 1 November 1911, Giulio Gavotti, an Italian aviator, dropped the world&#x27;s first aerial bomb from his Taube monoplane over the Ain Zara oasis in Libya. Once the war began, it quickly proved inadequate as a warplane and was soon replaced by other designs.

==Design and development==

The Taube was designed in 1909 by Igo Etrich of Austria-Hungary, and first flew in 1910. It was licensed for serial production by Lohner-Werke in Austria and by Edmund Rumpler in Germany, now called the &quot;Etrich-Rumpler-Taube&quot;. Rumpler soon changed the name to &quot;Rumpler-Taube&quot;, and stopped paying royalties to Etrich, who subsequently abandoned his patent.

Despite its name (&quot;&quot; means &quot;dove&quot;), the &quot;Taube&#x27;s&quot; unique wing form was not modeled after a dove, but was copied from the seeds of &quot;Alsomitra macrocarpa&quot;, which may glide long distances from their parent tree. Etrich had tried to build a flying wing aircraft based on the Zanonia wing shape, but the more conventional &quot;Taube&quot; type, with tail surfaces, was much more successful.

Etrich adopted the format of crosswind-capable main landing gear that Louis Blériot had used on his Blériot XI cross-channel monoplane for better ground handling. The wing has three spars and was braced by a cable-braced steel tube truss (called a &quot;bridge&quot;, or &quot;Brücke&quot; in German) under each wing: at the outer end the uprights of this structure were lengthened to rise above the upper wing surfaces, to form kingposts to carry bracing and warping wires for the enlarged wingtips. A small landing wheel was sometimes mounted on the lower end of this kingpost, to protect it for landings and to help guard against ground loops.

Later Taube-type aircraft from other manufacturers replaced the Bleriot type main gear with a simpler V-strut main gear design, and also omitted the underwing &quot;bridge&quot; structure to reduce drag.

Like many contemporary aircraft, especially monoplanes, the Taube used wing warping rather than ailerons for lateral (roll) control, and also warped the rear half of the stabilizer to function as the elevator. Only the vertical, twinned triangular rudder surfaces were usually hinged.

==Operational history==

In civilian use, the Taube was used by pilots to win the Munich-Berlin Kathreiner prize. On 8 December 1911, Gino Linnekogel and Suvelick Johannisthal achieved a two-man endurance record for flying a Taube 4 hours and 35 minutes over Germany.

The design provided for very stable flight, which made it extremely suitable for observation. The translucent wings made it difficult for ground observers to detect a &quot;Taube&quot; at an altitude above 400 meters. The first hostile engagement was by an Italian &quot;Taube&quot; in 1911 in Libya, its pilot using pistols and dropping grenades during the Battle of Ain Zara. The &quot;Taube&quot; was also used for bombing in the Balkans in 1912–13, and in late 1914 when German bomblets and propaganda leaflets were dropped over Paris. &quot;Taube&quot; spotter planes detected the advancing Imperial Russian Army in East Prussia during the World War I Battle of Tannenberg.

==World War I==
While initially there were two &quot;Taube&quot; aircraft assigned to Imperial German units stationed at Qingdao, China, only one was available at the start of the war due to an accident. The Rumpler Taube piloted by Lieutenant Gunther Plüschow had to face the attacking Japanese, who had with them a total of eight aircraft. On 2 October 1914, Plüschow&#x27;s Taube attacked the Japanese warships blockading Tsingtao with two small bombs, but failed to score any hits. On 7 November 1914, shortly before the fall of Qingdao, Plüschow was ordered to fly top secret documents to Shanghai, but was forced to make an emergency landing at Lianyungang in Jiangsu, where he was interned by a local Chinese force. Plüschow was rescued by local Chinese civilians under the direction of an American missionary, and successfully reached his destination at Shanghai with his top secret documents, after giving the engine to one of the Chinese civilians who rescued him.

Poor rudder and lateral control made the Taube difficult and slow to turn. The aeroplane proved to be a very easy target for the faster and more agile Allied Scouts of the early part of World War I, and just six months into the war, the &quot;Taube&quot; had been removed from front line service to be used to train new pilots. Many future German aces would learn to fly in a Rumpler &quot;Taube&quot;.

==Variants==
Due to the lack of licence fees, 14 companies built a large number of variations of the initial design, making it difficult for historians to determine the exact manufacturer based on historical photographs. An incomplete list is shown below. The most common version was the Rumpler &quot;Taube&quot; with two seats.

==Survivors and flyable reproductions==

The Technisches Museum Wien has the only remaining Etrich-built &quot;Taube&quot;, which has a four-cylinder engine. 

Other original Taubes exist, such as one in Norway, which was the last original &quot;Taube&quot; to fly under its own power, in 1922.

The Museum of Flight in Seattle features a reproduction of a Rumpler &quot;Taube&quot;. 

The Owl&#x27;s Head Transportation Museum in Owls Head, Maine, US has a reproduction which has been flying since 1990, using a Ranger L-440 inline-6 air-cooled engine.

<doc id="603407" wikidata="Q368119" url="?curid=603407" title="Modernism in the Catholic Church">
<text>Modernism in the Catholic Church describes attempts to reconcile Catholicism with modern culture, specifically an understanding of the Bible and Sacred Tradition in light of the historical-critical method and new philosophical and political developments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The term &quot;modernism&quot;—generally used by its critics rather than by adherents of positions associated with it&lt;section end=&quot;Modern&quot; criticism=&quot; of=&quot; the=&quot; catholic=&quot; church=&quot; transclusion=&quot; /&gt;—came to prominence in Pope Pius X&#x27;s 1907 encyclical &quot;Pascendi Dominici gregis&quot;, where he condemned modernism as &quot;the synthesis of all heresies&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; in 1911, the Jesuit Arthur Vermeersch gave a definition of modernism in the perspective of the Catholic heresiology of his time:&quot;In general we may say that modernism aims at that radical transformation of human thought in relation to God, man, the world, and life, here and hereafter, which was prepared by Humanism and eighteenth-century philosophy, and solemnly promulgated at the French Revolution.&quot;The modernist movement was influenced and accompanied by Protestant theologians and clergy like Paul Sabatier and Heinrich Julius Holtzmann. On the other hand, modernist theologians were critical of Protestant theology and engaged in Catholic apologetics against a Protestant understanding of Christianity, as in the famous attack of Alfred Loisy in &quot;L&#x27;Évangile et l&#x27;Église&quot; (1902) on Adolf von Harnack&#x27;s &quot;Das Wesen des Christentums&quot; (1900). The modernist movement has a parallel in the Church of England where the journal &quot;The Modern Churchman&quot; was founded in 1911.

The controversy on modernism was prominent in French and British intellectual circles and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, but, in one way or another, concerned most of Europe and North America. Pope Pius X saw modernism as a universal threat which required a global reaction.

==Dimensions of the controversy over modernism==

Although the so-called modernists did not form a uniform movement, they responded to a common grouping of religious problems which transcended Catholicism alone around 1900: first of all the problem of historicism, which seemed to render all historical forms of faith and tradition relative; secondly, through the reception of modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant, Maurice Blondel, and Henri Bergson, the neo-scholastic philosophical and theological framework set up by Pope Leo XIII had become fragile. The assertion that objective truth is received subjectively is fundamental for the entire controversy. This focus on the religious subject engendered a renewed interest in mysticism, sanctity and religious experience in general. The aversion against a religious &quot;extrinsicism&quot; also led to a new hermeneutics for doctrinal definitions which were seen as secondary formulations of an antecedent (immanent) religious experience (George Tyrrell; cfr. also the Christian personalism of Lucien Laberthonnière).
The controversy was not restricted to the field of philosophy and theology. On the level of politics, Christian Democrats like the layman Marc Sangnier in France and the priest Romolo Murri in Italy, but also the left wing of the Centre Party and the Christian Unions in Germany, opted for a political agenda which was no longer completely controlled by the hierarchy. Pope Pius X reacted by excommunicating Murri in 1909, by dissolving Sangnier&#x27;s &quot;Le Sillon&quot; movement in 1910, and by issuing the encyclical in 1912 which clearly favoured the German Catholic workers&#x27; associations over and against the Christian Unions. Furthermore, antimodernists like Albert Maria Weiss , and the Swiss Caspar Decurtins, which were both favoured by Pius X, would even find &quot;literary modernism&quot; on the field of the Catholic &quot;belles-lettres&quot; which did not meet their standards of orthodoxy.

In the eyes of the antimodernist reaction, the &quot;modernists&quot; were a uniform and secret sect within the Church. From a historical perspective, one can discern networks of personal contacts between &quot;modernists&quot;, especially around Friedrich von Hügel and Paul Sabatier. On the other hand, there was a great diversity of opinions within the &quot;movement&quot;, from people ending up in rationalism (e.g. Marcel Hébert, Albert Houtin, Alfred Loisy, Salvatore Minocchi, and Joseph Turmel) to a mild religious reformism, even including neo-scholastic theologians like Romolo Murri. This perception of a broad movement from left to right was already shaped by the protagonists themselves.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;Liberal Catholicism&quot; originally designated a current of thought within the Catholic Church that was influential in the 19th century, particularly in France, that aimed to reconcile the church with liberal democracy. It was largely identified with French political theorists such as Felicité Robert de Lamennais, Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes René de Montalembert. In the second half of the 19th century the term was also applied to theologians and intellectuals like Ignaz von Döllinger, St. George Jackson Mivart, John Zahm, and Franz Xaver Kraus who wanted to reconcile the Catholic faith with the standards of modern science and society in general.

In 1881, the Belgian economist Charles Périn, a conservative Catholic layman, published a volume titled (&quot;Modernism in the Church according to the unpublished letters of La Mennais&quot;). Périn was the first author to use the term &quot;modernism&quot; in a Catholic context – before him the Dutch Calvinist Abraham Kuyper had attacked the rationalist German theology of the Protestant Tübingen School as &quot;modernism&quot; (, 1871). For Périn, &#x27;modernism&#x27; was a label for the attempts of Liberal Catholics to reconcile Catholicism with the ideals of the French Revolution and of democracy in general. He saw a danger that humanitarian tendencies in secular society would be received within the Catholic Church. This &quot;social&quot; definition of Catholic modernism would be taken up again later by Integralism. Périn&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;modernism&quot; was accepted by the Roman journal of the Jesuits, the semi-official , which added the aspect of an exaggerated trust in modern science to this concept. When five exegetical books of the French theologian Alfred Loisy were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in December 1903, the Holy See’s official paper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; distinguished between &quot;modernity&quot; and &quot;modernism&quot;, which entailed heresy in religion, revolution in politics, and error in philosophy. The term &quot;modernism&quot; now began to replace older labels like &#x27;Liberal Catholicism&#x27; or (especially in Germany) &#x27;Reform Catholicism&#x27;.
The connection between &#x27;Liberal Catholicism&#x27; and &#x27;modernism&#x27; has been subject to controversial discussion. In 1979, Thomas Michael Loome stressed the continuity between the two and talked of a &quot;vertical dimension&quot; of the modernist controversy. This &quot;invention of tradition&quot; was criticized – amongst others – by Nicholas Lash. It is clear, however, that the Joint Pastoral of the English episcopate against &quot;Liberal Catholicism&quot; (December 1900) did not only react on St. George Jackson Mivart, but also on the writings of the later &quot;modernist&quot; George Tyrrell. The letter had been prepared in Rome and was inspired by Rafael Merry del Val who became Tyrrell&#x27;s chief opponent under Pius X. Furthermore, &quot;modernists&quot; like Tyrrell compared their own difficulties after the publication of with the difficulties of &quot;liberal Catholics&quot; like Ignaz von Döllinger after Vatican I. In December 1907, Tyrrell wrote to a German correspondent: &quot;Is it not time to reconsider the pseudo-council of 1870 and to ask whether the Alt-Katholiks were not, after all, in the right? etc. [&quot;You will know them by their fruits&quot;; Matthew 7:16] may surely be used as a criterion of Ultramontanism. Individuals, like myself, can afford to stand aloof as Döllinger did. But can multitudes live without sacraments and external communion? And yet now no educated man or woman will be able to remain in communion with Pius X.&quot; Tyrrell was also inspired by the posthumous publication of Lord Acton&#x27;s &quot;History of Freedom and Other Essays&quot; in 1907.

==History of the modernist controversy==
Although the so-called &quot;Modernist Crisis&quot; is usually dated between 1893 (the publication date of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical ) and 1914 (the death of Pope Pius X), the controversy had, and continues to have, both a pre-history and a post-history.

===Pre-history: Liberal Catholicism in the 19th century===

With notable exceptions like Richard Simon or the Bollandists, Catholic studies in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries had tended to avoid the use of critical methodology because of its rationalist tendencies. Frequent political revolutions, the bitter opposition of &quot;liberalism&quot; to the Church and the expulsion of religious orders from France and Germany had made the church understandably suspicious of the new intellectual currents.

Following the French Revolution and the subsequent coming to power of the Conservative Order, the Magisterium had enacted harsh condemnations against liberalism, rationalism, pantheism, panentheism, deism, indifferentism, socialism, communism and other popular philoosophies. Non-Catholic Bible translations and interpretations had been met with similar scorn.

In 1863, Ernest Renan published (Life of Jesus). Renan had trained for the priesthood before choosing a secular career as a philologist and historian. His book described Jesus as – a man, no doubt extraordinary, but only a man. The book was very popular, but cost him his chair of Hebrew at the Collège de France. Among Renan&#x27;s most controversial ideas was that &quot;a miracle does not count as a historical event; people believing in a miracle does.&quot; Renan&#x27;s Jesus is a man of simple piety and almost unimaginable charisma whose main historical significance was his legion of followers.

In the same year, Church historian Ignaz von Döllinger invited about 100 German theologians to meet in Munich (, 1863) to discuss the state of Catholic theology. In his address, &quot;On the Past and Future of Catholic Theology&quot;, Döllinger advocated greater academic freedom of theology within the Church, formulating a critique of neo-scholastic theology and championing the historical method in theology. Döllinger&#x27;s friend Charles de Montalembert gave two powerful speeches at the Catholic Congress in Malines that year too, insisting that the church had to reconcile itself with civil equality and religious freedom.

On 8 December 1864 Pope Pius IX issued the encyclical , decrying what he considered significant errors afflicting the modern age. It condemned certain propositions such as: &quot;the people&#x27;s will, manifested by what is called public opinion[...] constitutes a supreme law, free from all divine and human control&quot;; on civil law alone depend all rights of parents over their children, and especially that of providing for education; and that religious orders have no legitimate reason for being permitted. Some of these condemnations were aimed at anticlerical governments in various European countries, which were in the process of secularizing education and taking over Catholic schools, as well as suppressing religious orders and confiscating their property. Attached to the encyclical was a , which had been condemned in previous papal documents, requiring recourse to the original statements to be understood. The &quot;Syllabus&quot; reacted not only to modern atheism, materialism, and agnosticism, but also to Liberal Catholicism and the new critical study of the Bible. It was also a direct reaction to Döllinger&#x27;s speech in Munich and Montalembert&#x27;s speeches in Malines. Among the propositions condemned in the &quot;Syllabus&quot; were:

* &quot;7. The prophecies and miracles set forth and recorded in the Sacred Scriptures are the fiction of poets, and the mysteries of the Christian faith the result of philosophical investigations. In the books of the Old and the New Testament there are contained mythical inventions, and Jesus Christ is Himself a myth.&quot;
* &quot;13. The method and principles by which the old scholastic doctors cultivated theology are no longer suitable to the demands of our times and to the progress of the sciences.&quot; – Letter to the Archbishop of Munich, , December 21, 1863.
* &quot;15. Every man is free to embrace and profess the Religion he shall believe true, guided by the light of reason.&quot; – Apostolic Letter, , 10 June 1851. Allocution , 9 June 1862.

The First Vatican Council was held from December 1869 to October 1870. The council provoked a degree of controversy even before it met. In anticipation that the subject of papal infallibility would be discussed, many bishops, especially in France and Germany, expressed the opinion that the time was &quot;inopportune&quot;. Ignaz von Döllinger led a movement in Germany hostile to the definition of infallibility. In Döllinger&#x27;s view, there was no foundation for this definition in Catholic tradition. After the definition, Döllinger was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Munich Gregor von Scherr in 1871. Montalembert died before the end of the Council.

The dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith, , tried to steer a middle way between rationalism and fideism. It presented a concept of revelation which highlighted the aspect of divine instruction by revelation. The dogmatic Constitution addressed the primacy of the pope and rejected the idea that decrees issued by the pope for the guidance of the church are not valid unless confirmed by the secular power. It also declared papal infallibility when speaking &quot;ex cathedra&quot; on matters of faith and morals. Other matters were deferred when the Italian infantry entered Rome and the Council was prorogued. The Council remained formally open until 1960, when it was officially closed by Pope John XXIII, in order to convene the Second Vatican Council.

The First Vatican Council&#x27;s decisions were so controversial that they even caused a schism of some German, Swiss, Austrian and Dutch liberal Catholics, who broke away from the Vatican and merged with the Jansenists, who had maintained a somewhat precarious hierarchy in the Netherlands, into the Old Catholic Church, which exists to this day.

===The beginning of the modernist controversy under Leo XIII===
Pope Leo XIII, Pius IX&#x27;s successor, wanted to advance what he understood as the true Christian science in every way: he worked for a revival of Thomism as Christian philosophy, he encouraged the study of history and archaeology, and in 1881 he opened up the Vatican Archives for researchers. In 1887 he encouraged the study of the natural sciences, and in 1891 opened a new Vatican Observatory. Leo&#x27;s response to the rationalist trend to undermine the authority of sacred scripture was for the Church to have its own trained experts. In 1893, with , Pope Leo gave the first formal authorization for the use of critical methods in biblical scholarship. “Hence it is most proper that Professors of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master those tongues in which the sacred Books were originally written, and have a knowledge of natural science.” He recommended that the student of scripture be first given a sound grounding in the interpretations of the Fathers such as Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary, Ambrose, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, Augustine and Jerome, and understand what they interpreted literally, and what allegorically; and note what they lay down as belonging to faith and what is opinion.

Although tried to encourage Catholic biblical studies, it also created problems. In the encyclical, Leo XIII excluded the possibility of restricting the inspiration and inerrancy of the bible to matters of faith and morals. Thus, he interfered in the lively discussion about biblical inspiration in France, where Maurice d&#x27;Hulst, founder of the &quot;Institut Catholique de Paris&quot;, had opted for a more open solution in his article on . Not only exegetes of this &quot;école large&quot; were now in trouble, but also the prominent French theologian Alfred Loisy who worked for a thoroughly historical understanding of the Bible, in order to open up spaces for theological reform. The Roman Congregation of the Index began to prepare a censuring of Loisy&#x27;s main works, but until the death of Leo XIII in 1903 no decision was taken, as there was also considerable resistance within the Roman Curia against a premature judgment on matters of biblical interpretation.

On the whole, official Catholic attitudes to the study of Scripture at the turn of the 20th century were of cautious advance, and a growing appreciation of what had promise for the future. In 1902, Pope Leo XIII instituted the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which was to adapt Catholic Biblical studies to modern scholarship and to protect Scripture against attacks.

===Marie-Joseph Lagrange===
In 1890 the École Biblique, the first Catholic school specifically dedicated to the critical study of the bible, was established in Jerusalem by Dominican Marie-Joseph Lagrange. In 1892 Pope Leo XIII gave his official approval. While many of Lagrange&#x27;s contemporaries criticized the new scientific and critical approach to the Bible, he made use of it. Lagrange founded the , and his first articles drew sharp criticism, but Pope Leo was not inclined to discourage new ideas. As long as Pope Leo lived, Lagrange&#x27;s work quietly progressed, but after Leo&#x27;s death, an ultra-conservative reaction set in. The historical-critical method was considered suspect by the Vatican. Père Lagrange, like other scholars involved in the 19th-century renaissance of biblical studies, was suspected of being a modernist. In 1912 Lagrange was given an order for the to cease publication and to return to France. The École itself was closed for a year, and then Lagrange was sent back to Jerusalem to continue his work.

=== Duchesne and Loisy ===

Louis Duchesne was a French priest, philologist, teacher, and amateur archaeologist. Trained at the École pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, he applied modern methods to church history, drawing together archaeology and topography to supplement literature and setting ecclesiastical events within the contexts of social history. Duchesne held the chair of ecclesiastical history at the Institut Catholique de Paris, and was frequently in contact with like-minded historians among the Bollandists, with their long history of critical editions of hagiographies. Duchesne gained fame as a demythologizing critical historian of the popular, pious lives of saints produced by Second Empire publishers. However, his , 1906–1911 (translated as &quot;Early History of the Christian Church&quot;) was considered too modernist by the church at the time, and was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1912.
Alfred Loisy was a French Catholic priest, professor and theologian generally credited as the &quot;father of Catholic Modernism&quot;. He had studied at the Institut Catholique under Duchesne and attended the course on Hebrew by Ernest Renan at the Collège de France. Harvey Hill says that the development of Loisy&#x27;s theories have to be seen also in the context of France&#x27;s Church-State conflict, which contributed to Loisy&#x27;s crisis of faith in the 1880s. In November 1893, Loisy published the last lecture of his course, in which he summed up his position on biblical criticism in five propositions: the Pentateuch was not the work of Moses, the first five chapters of Genesis were not literal history, the New Testament and the Old Testament did not possess equal historical value, there was a development in scriptural doctrine, and Biblical writings were subject to the same limitations as those by other authors of the ancient world. When his attempts at theological reform had failed, Loisy came to regard the Christian religion more as a system of humanistic ethics than as divine revelation. He was excommunicated in 1908.

=== The climax of the controversy under Pius X ===
Pope Pius X, who succeeded Leo XIII in August 1903, engaged almost immediately in the ongoing controversy. Reacting on pressure from the Parisian Archbishop Cardinal François-Marie-Benjamin Richard, he transferred the censuring of Loisy from the Congregation of the Index to the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. Already in December 1903, Loisy&#x27;s main exegetical works were censured. At the same time the Holy Office began to prepare a syllabus of errors contained in the works of Loisy. Due to ongoing internal resistance, especially from the Master of the Sacred Palace, the papal theologian Alberto Lepidi , this Syllabus was published only in July 1907 as the decree , which condemned sixty-five propositions from the field of biblical interpretation and the history of dogma. did not mention the term &quot;modernism&quot;, and it seems that Pius X and his close collaborators like Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val and Cardinal José de Calasanz Vives y Tutó were not satisfied with the document.

Therefore, in the summer of 1907, another document was prepared in a small circle around the Pope and already in September 1907, Pius X promulgated the encyclical , which formulated a synthesis of modernism and popularized the term itself. The encyclical condemned modernism as embracing every heresy. described the &quot;modernist&quot; in seven &quot;roles&quot;: as purely immanentist philosopher, as believer who relies only on their own religious experience, as theologian who understands dogma symbolically, as historian and biblical scholar who dissolves divine revelation by means of the historical-critical method into purely immanent processes of development, as apologete who justifies the Christian truth only from immanence, and as reformer who wants to change the church in a radical way. Agnosticism, immanentism, evolutionism and reformism are the keywords used by the Pope to describe the philosophical and theological system of modernism. The encyclical describes the modernist as an enemy of scholastic philosophy and theology and resistant to the teachings of the Magisterium; their moral qualities are curiosity, arrogance, ignorance, and falsehood. Modernists deceive the simple believers by not presenting their entire system, but only parts of it. Therefore, the encyclical wants to reveal the secret system of modernism. contained also disciplinary measures for the promotion of scholastic philosophy and theology in the seminaries, for the removal of suspect professors and candidates for the priesthood, for a more rigid censuring of publications and for the creation of an antimodernist control group in every diocese. All bishops and superiors of religious orders had to report regularly on the execution of these measures.

Pius frequently condemned the movement, and was deeply concerned that its adherents could go on believing themselves strict Catholics while understanding dogma in a markedly untraditional sense (a consequence of the notion of evolution of dogma). Therefore, in 1910, he introduced an anti-modernist oath to be taken by all Catholic priests.

To ensure enforcement of these decisions, Monsignor Umberto Benigni organized, through his personal contacts with theologians and laymen in various European countries, a secret network of informants who would report to him those thought to be teaching condemned doctrine or engaging in political activities (like Christian Democratic Parties, Christian Unions) which were also deemed to be &quot;modernist&quot; because they were not controlled by the Catholic hierarchy. This group was called the , i.e. Fellowship of Pius (V), with the code name of . Its frequently overzealous and clandestine methods often hindered rather than helped the Church combat modernism. Benigni also published the journal /, which initiated press campaigns against practical and social modernism throughout Europe. Benigni fell out with Cardinal Secretary of State Rafael Merry del Val in 1911. The was eventually dissolved in 1921. Recent research has stressed the antisemitic character of Benigni&#x27;s antimodernism.

=== In America ===
With his slogan &quot;Church and Age unite!&quot;, Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, became the hero of reformers in France (Félix Klein), Italy and Germany (Herman Schell) in the 1890s. The modernist controversy in the United States was thus initially dominated by the conflict on &quot;Americanism&quot;, which after was also presented as a &quot;forerunner&quot; of modernism in Catholic heresiology. &quot;Americanism&quot; was perceived as an influence of classical liberalism in the Catholic Church in the United States, particularly regarding the concept of separation of Church and State. Such tendencies alarmed Pope Leo XIII, who condemned them, at the urging of Archbishop Ireland&#x27;s old opponent from Minnesota Archbishop John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti, in the apostolic letter (1899). Archbishop Ireland had to be extremely careful to avoid condemnation for his views.

Following the issuing of , the antimodernist measures were especially felt in the Archdiocese of New York: The &quot;New York Review&quot; was a journal produced by Saint Joseph&#x27;s Seminary. It printed papers by leading Catholic Biblical experts who were part of the newly emerging schools of Biblical criticism, which raised eyebrows in Rome. Around 1908, the &quot;Review&quot; was discontinued, ostensibly for financial reasons, although there is strong evidence that it was suppressed for modernist tendencies. Despite his support for modernization, Archbishop Ireland actively campaigned against modernism following the encyclical: this apparently inconsistent behavior stemmed from Ireland&#x27;s concept of a &quot;golden mean&quot; between &quot;ultraconservatism&quot;, rendering the Church irrelevant, and &quot;ultraliberalism,&quot; discarding the Church&#x27;s message.

=== Post-history in the 20th and 21st centuries ===
After the pontificate of Pius X, there was a gradual abatement of attacks against modernists. The new Pope Benedict XV, who was elected to succeed Pius X in 1914, once again condemned modernism in his encyclical , but also urged Catholics to cease condemning fellow believers. Nevertheless, theological antimodernism continued to influence the climate within the Church. The Holy Office, until 1930 under the guidance of Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, continued to censure modernist theologians and rationalist exegesis was once again condemned by the Pontiff in his encyclical .

In the 1930s, Loisy&#x27;s &quot;opera omnia&quot; (“all works”) were placed on the . During World War I, French propaganda claimed that the Catholic Church in Germany was infested with modernism. Already in 1913 it had been claimed by the French academic Edmond Vermeil that the Catholic Tübingen School in the mid-19th century, with its interest for the &quot;organic development&quot; of the church in history, was a &quot;forerunner&quot; of &quot;modernism&quot; – a claim which has been debated ever since.

Between World War I and the Second Vatican Council, Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange was a &quot;torchbearer of orthodox Thomism&quot; against modernism. Garrigou-Lagrange, who was a professor of philosophy and theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, , is commonly held to have influenced the decision in 1942 to place the privately circulated book (Étiolles-sur-Seine 1937) by Marie-Dominique Chenu on the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;Index of Forbidden Books&quot; as the culmination of a polemic within the Dominican Order between the supporters of a speculative scholasticism and the French revival Thomists who were more attentive to historical hermeneutics, such as Yves Congar 

At the beginning of the 1930s, Congar read the of Loisy and realised that modernism had addressed problems in theology which were still not resolved by neo-scholastic theology. Chenu and Congar, two protagonists of the , began to prepare a dossier on this topic. In 1946, Congar wrote to Chenu that neo-scholastic theology had already begun to &quot;liquidate&quot; itself on a daily basis and that the Jesuits were among the fiercest &quot;liquidators&quot;. Congar&#x27;s was also suspected of modernism because its methodology derived more from religious experience than from syllogistic analysis. 

A first relaxation of the strict anti-modernist measures imposed on biblical scholars by Pius X came in 1943: on that year, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical , regulating the issue of Biblical exegesis. The encyclical inaugurated the modern period of Roman Catholic Biblical studies by encouraging the study of textual criticism (or &#x27;lower criticism&#x27;), pertaining to text of the Scriptures themselves and transmission thereof (for example, to determine correct readings) and permitted the use of the historical-critical method (or &#x27;higher criticism&#x27;) to be informed by theology, Sacred Tradition, and ecclesiastical history on the historical circumstances of the text, hypothesizing about matters such as authorship, dating, and similar concerns. Catholic Biblical scholar Raymond E. Brown described the encyclical as a &quot;Magna Carta for biblical progress&quot;.

Despite his cautious openings on the issue of biblical criticism, Pius XII was suspicious of the new theological trends, which he feared could cause a modernist revival: in 1950, he published the encyclical &quot;Humani generis&quot;, in which he condemned &quot;certain new intellectual currents&quot; in the Church, accusing them of relativism and attacking them for reformulating dogmas in a way that was not consistent with Church tradition and for following biblical hermeneutics that deviated from the teachings of &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot;, &quot;Spiritus Paraclitus&quot; and &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;. The encyclical specifically accused these new &quot;trends&quot; of having embraced the modernist heresy condemned by Pius X in &quot;Pascendi Dominici gregis&quot;. The encyclical did not mention any particular theologian but was widely interpreted as a condemnation of the &quot;Nouvelle théologie&quot; and was followed by an anti-modernist purge in &quot;Le Saulchoir&quot; and Fourvière.

Following the election of Pope John XXIII and the calling of the Second Vatican Council, anti-modernist polemics declined and many theologians associated with the &quot;Nouvelle théologie&quot; were gradually rehabilitated and many of them took part in the Council with the qualification of &quot;peritus&quot;. However, Pope Paul VI once again condemned modernism in his encyclical &quot;Ecclesiam Suam&quot; (1964), calling it &quot;an error which is still making its appearance under various new guises, wholly inconsistent with any genuine religious expression&quot; and described it as &quot;an attempt on the part of secular philosophies and secular trends to vitiate the true teaching and discipline of the Church of Christ&quot;. Despite this, the Oath Against Modernism was abolished on 17 July 1967 by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with the approval of Paul VI.

Following the Council, the more conservative supporters of &quot;Nouvelle théologie&quot; had important careers in the Church: Hans Urs von Balthasar, Jean Daniélou , Yves Congar and Henri de Lubac were made cardinals by Pope John Paul II, while Joseph Ratzinger was elected as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. The same could not be said for the more liberal members, who were gradually marginalised due to their extreme views: Hans Küng was stripped from his theological license by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1979 for questioning papal infallibility, while Edward Schillebeeckx was repeatedly condemned by the Congregation and even by Pope Paul VI himself (encyclical &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot;) due to his heterodox views about Christology and the eucharist.

References to modernism continue to be frequent among conservative and traditionalist Catholics.

==In popular culture==
* Irish comedian Dermot Morgan parodied the Modernist trend of the Post-Vatican II Catholic Church in Ireland while appearing on the RTÉ television show &quot;The Live Mike&quot; between 1979 and 1982. On the show, Morgan played a range of comic characters, including Father Trendy, a trying-to-be-cool hippie-priest, who wore an Elvis haircut, a leather jacket and who was given to drawing ludicrous parallels between religious and non-religious life in two-minute &#x27;sermons&#x27; to the camera. Morgan created the character as a satire of Father Brian D&#x27;Arcy, a left-wing Passionist priest who was trying to be the chaplain to the show business community in Dublin.
* In the episode &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Gambit&quot; of the British TV series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (season 1, episode 7), Prime Minister Jim Hacker discusses candidates for an Anglican bishopric with Cabinet Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby. The Church Commissioners have suggested a candidate who is a &quot;modernist&quot;. Sir Humphrey later explains to the PM that &quot;modernist&quot; is ecclesiastical code for an atheist and Marxist Anglican clergyman.

<doc id="603413" wikidata="Q5497491" url="?curid=603413" title="Frederick Campbell, 3rd Earl Cawdor">
<text>Frederick Archibald Vaughan Campbell, 3rd Earl Cawdor, (13 February 1847 – 8 February 1911), styled Viscount Emlyn from 1860 to 1898, was a British Conservative politician. He served briefly as First Lord of the Admiralty between March and December 1905.

==Background and education==

Cawdor was the eldest son of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor and Sarah Cavendish, daughter of General Hon. Henry Cavendish, son of 1st Earl of Burlington and heiress Lady Elizabeth Compton. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He was brought up on the family estates in south Wales and his coming of age in 1868 was a major event in the town of Llandeilo. In 1874 he was appointed to be Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Inverness. 

By 1880s, his father&#x27;s estate brought an annual income of £45,000 a year.

==MP for Carmarthenshire==
Cawdor was Conservative Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire from 1874 to 1885. In 1885 the constituency was divided in two and Emlyn decided to contest the new West Carmarthenshire constituency, although most of his family property lay in the eastern part of the county. His chances there appeared to be negligible given the growing industrial population which had been a key factor in the triumph of the Liberal candidate, Edward Sartoris at the 1868 General Election. Emlyn was opposed by the other sitting member, the Liberal W.R.H. Powell, himself a former Conservative supporter, who had first declared his support for the Liberals at the 1874 election. Powell now proclaimed that he had a duty to the Liberal cause to oppose Emlyn.

It was reported that the Conservatives were confident of their chances in West Carmarthenshire, on the grounds that it was largely an agricultural division. However, the electorate had more than doubled in the county, and the 1885 electorate in the Western Division alone exceeded that of the combined county seat in 1880. Powell&#x27;s victory ended Emlyn&#x27;s career in Carmarthenshire politics.

==Later political career==
He succeeded in the earldom in 1898 and served briefly under Arthur Balfour as First Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Cawdor took a leading part in the Conservative opposition to Lloyd George&#x27;s budget of 1909 and in drafting resolutions for the reform of the House of Lords in 1910. He also notably opposed the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909.

He was also involved in Pembrokeshire local affairs, and as Chairman of the Great Western Railway from 1895 to 1905 greatly improved the service. In 1903 he was described by Joseph Chamberlain as “the best chairman now living&quot;. In 1904 he was elected unopposed as a member of Pembrokeshire County Council to represent the Castlemartin ward.

Lord Cawdor was an officer in the Royal Carmarthen Artillery, a Militia unit, where he was lieutenant-colonel in command from 24 September 1892 until he retired on 5 November 1902. During these years he was promoted to colonel and appointed an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII.

==Family==

Lord Cawdor married Edith Georgiana Turnor, daughter of Christopher Turnor and Lady Caroline Finch-Hatton, daughter of 10th Earl of Winchilsea, on 16 September 1868 at Stoke Rochford Hall. They predominantly live in London at 74 South Audley Street. They had ten children: 

# Lady Edith Campbell m. Charles Ferguson
# Hugh Campbell, 4th Earl Cawdor born at Cawdor Castle m. Joan Thynne, granddaughter of Lord John Thynne
# Nigel Campbell m. Violet Kerr, great granddaughter of William Kerr, 6th Marquess of Lothian
# Lady Mabel Campbell m. Sir Henry Beresford-Peirse, 4th Baronet
# Ralph Campbell m. Marjorie Theophila Fowler
# Lady Lilian Campbell m. Richard Beresford-Peirse, son of 3th Baronet
# Elidor Campbell m. Violet Bulwer-Marsh
# Ian Campbell m. Marion Stirling
# Eric Campbell
# Lady Muriel Campbell

They settled in Golden Grove, before moving to their larger seat Stackpole Court. The 1891 census recorded the family at Stackpole with 23 servants, by the 1901 it had increased to 25 servants.He died in February 1911, aged 63, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son Hugh. Lady Cawdor died in 1926.

<text>Fort Ross (, , Kashaya: ) is a former Russian establishment on the west coast of North America in what is now Sonoma County, California. Owned and operated by the Russian-American Company, it was the hub of the southernmost Russian settlements in North America from 1812 to 1841. Notably cosmopolitan, different ethnic groups settled in and around the fort: Native Californians, Native Alaskans, Russians, Finns, Swedes. It has been the subject of archaeological investigation and is a California Historical Landmark, a National Historic Landmark, and on the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of California&#x27;s Fort Ross State Historic Park.

==Etymology==
The present name of Fort Ross appears first on a French chart published in 1842 by Eugène Duflot de Mofras, who visited California in 1840. The name of the fort is said to derive from the Russian word rus or &quot;ros&quot;, the same root as the word &quot;Russia&quot; (, &quot;Rossiya&quot;) (Fort Ross (Russian: Форт-Росс, Kashaya &quot;mé·ṭiʔni&quot;), originally Fortress Ross (pre-reformed Russian: Крѣпость Россъ, &quot;Krepostʹ Ross&quot;). According to William Bright, &quot;Ross&quot; is a poetic name for a Russian in the Russian language.

==History==
Beginning with Columbus in 1492, the Spanish presence in the Western Hemisphere traveled west across the Atlantic Ocean, then around or across the Americas to reach the Pacific Ocean. The Russian expansion, however, moved east across Siberia and the northern Pacific. In the early nineteenth century, Spanish and Russian expansion met along the coast of Spanish Alta California, with Russia pushing south and Spain pushing north. By that time, British and American fur trade companies had also established a coastal presence, in the Pacific Northwest, and Mexico was soon to gain independence. Mexico ceded Alta California to the United States following the Mexican–American War (1848). The history of the Russian Fort Ross settlement began during Spanish rule and ended under Mexican rule.

=== Earliest people ===
The earliest people known to have lived at the site were there during the Upper Archaic period (1000 B.C. – A.D. 500) and the Lower Emergent period (A.D. 1000–1500), but the main occupation began at A.D. 1500 and continued through 1812. Archaeological and ethnographic evidence suggest that the Native Californians lived in large and mostly permanent villages. In summer months, they had &quot;special purpose camps&quot; they would go to in order to get certain resources. This area was one of such camps, used for its access to tidal and marine resources.

Ethnographic evidence suggests that the area where Fort Ross would be located was a large part of Kashaya Pomo territory. Their name for the site was &quot;Metini&quot;. Their exact arrival date is unknown, but according to linguistic and archaeological data, they moved to Metini sometime between 1,000 and 500 B.C. Archaeological data shows that the Kashaya Pomo increased their subsistence activities upon arrival at this site and gained greater diversity in their tool kits.

===Russian-American Company===

Russian personnel from the Alaskan colonies initially arrived in California aboard American ships. In 1803, American ship captains already involved in the sea otter maritime fur trade in California proposed several joint venture hunting expeditions to Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, on half shares using Russian supervisors and native Alaskan hunters to hunt fur seals and otters along the Alta and Baja Californian coast. Subsequent reports by the Russian hunting parties of uncolonized stretches of coast encouraged Baranov, the Chief Administrator of the Russian-American Company (RAC), to consider a settlement in California north of the limit of Spanish occupation in San Francisco. In 1806 the Russian Ambassador to Japan, and RAC director Nikolay Rezanov, undertook an exploratory trade mission to California to establish a formal means of procuring food supplies in exchange for Russian goods in San Francisco. While guests of the Spanish, Rezanov&#x27;s captain, Lt. Khvostov, explored and charted the coast north of San Francisco Bay and found it completely unoccupied by other European powers. Upon his return to Novoarkhangelsk (New Archangel), Rezanov recommended to Baranov, and the Emperor Alexander, that a settlement be established in California.

Fort Ross was established by Commerce Counselor Ivan Kuskov of the Russian-American Company. In 1808 Baranov sent two ships, the &quot;Kad&#x27;yak&quot; and the &quot;Sv. Nikolai&quot;, on an expedition south to establish settlements for the RAC with instructions to bury &quot;secret signs&quot; (possession plaques). Kuskov, on the &quot;Kad&#x27;yak&quot;, was instructed to bury the plaques, with an appropriate possession ceremony, at Trinidad, Bodega Bay, and on the shore north of San Francisco, indicating Russian claims to the land. After sailing into Bodega Bay in 1809 on the &quot;Kad&#x27;yak&quot; and returning to Novoarkhangelsk with beaver skins and 1,160 otter pelts, Baranov ordered Kuskov to return and establish an agricultural settlement in the area. After a failed attempt in 1811, Kuskov sailed the brig &quot;Chirikov&quot; back to Bodega Bay in March 1812, naming it the Gulf of Rumyantsev or Rumyantsev Bay (, &quot;Zaliv Rumyantseva&quot;) in honor of the Russian Minister of Commerce Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantzev. He also named the Russian River the Slavic River (, &quot;Slavyanka&quot;). On his return, Kuskov found American otter hunting ships and otter now scarce in Bodega Bay. After exploring the area they ended up selecting a place north that the native Kashaya Pomo people called &quot;Mad shui nui&quot; or &quot;Metini&quot;. &quot;Metini&quot;, the seasonal home of the Kashaya Pomo, had a modest anchorage and abundant natural resources and would become the Russian settlement of Fortress Ross.

Fort Ross was established as an agricultural base from which the northern settlements could be supplied with food, while also continuing trade with Alta California. Yet during its initial ten years of operations the post &quot;provided the company with nothing but heavy expenses for its maintenance.&quot; Fort Ross itself was the hub of a number of smaller Russian settlements comprising what was called &quot;Fortress Ross&quot; on official documents and charts produced by the Company itself. Colony Ross referred to the entire area where Russians had settled. These settlements constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The colony included a port at Bodega Bay called Port Rumyantsev (), a sealing station on the Farallon Islands out to sea from San Francisco, and by 1830 three small farming communities called &quot;ranchos&quot; (): Chernykh (, &quot;Rancho Egora Chernykh&quot;) near present-day Graton, Khlebnikov (, &quot;Rancho Vasiliya Khlebnikova&quot;) a mile north of the present day town of Bodega in the Salmon Creek valley, and Kostromitinov (, &quot;Rancho Petra Kostromitinova&quot;) on the Russian River.
===Local enterprise===
In addition to farming and manufacturing, the Company carried on its fur-trading business at Fort Ross, but by 1817, after 20 years of intense hunting by Spanish, American and British ships—followed by Russian efforts—sea otters had been practically eliminated from the area.
Fort Ross was the site of California&#x27;s first windmills and shipbuilding. Russian scientists associated with the colony were among the first to record California&#x27;s cultural and natural history. The Russian managers introduced many European innovations such as glass windows, stoves, and all-wood housing into Alta California. Together with the surrounding settlement, Fort Ross was home to Russian subjects (which during the 19th and early 20th century included Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, Belarusians, Finns, Baltic Germans, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Georgians, Circassians, Tatars, and numerous other nationalities and ethnic groups of the Russian Empire), as well as North Pacific Natives, Aleuts, Kashaya (Pomo), and Alaskan Creoles. The native populations of the Sonoma and Napa County regions were affected by smallpox, measles and other infectious diseases that were common across Asia, Europe, and Africa. One instance can be traced to the settlement of Fort Ross. The first vaccination in California history was carried out by the crew of the &quot;Kutuzov&quot;, a Russian-American Company vessel arriving from Callao, Peru which brought vaccine to Monterey in August 1821. The &quot;Kutuzov&#x27;s&quot; surgeon vaccinated 54 people. Another instance of disease prevention was when a visiting Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company hunting party was refused entry to the Colony in 1833, when it was feared that a malaria epidemic which had devastated the Central Valley was carried by its members. In 1837 a very deadly epidemic of smallpox that came from this settlement via New Archangel wiped out most native people in the Sonoma and Napa County regions.

=== Mexican response ===

Between 1824 and 1836 the Mexicans found during every exploratory effort north of present-day San Rafael and west of Sonoma increasing evidence of Russian presence. They discovered at least three Russian farms that had been established inland from Fort Ross. Governor José Figueroa wanted to counter the Russians&#x27; gradual encroachment in Northern California. In 1834, he granted Rancho Petaluma to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. In 1835 he appointed Vallejo as Comandante of the Fourth Military District and Director of Colonization of the Northern Frontier, the highest military command in Northern California, and encouraged him to build the Presidio of Sonoma. To extend the settlements in the direction of Fort Ross, Vallejo granted his brother-in-law, Captain John B. R. Cooper, who had married his sister Encarnacion, Rancho El Molino (about ). The grant was confirmed by Governor Nicolás Gutiérrez in 1836.

Upon his arrival in Alta California in 1839, John Sutter was attracted to the land near the Sacramento River. To obtain the land and permission to settle in the territory, he went to the capital at Monterey and requested a grant from Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. Alvarado saw Sutter&#x27;s plan of establishing a colony in the Central Valley as useful in &quot;buttressing the frontier which he was trying to maintain against Indians, Russians, Americans and British.&quot; Sutter persuaded Governor Alvarado to grant him of land for the sake of curtailing American encroachment on the Mexican territory of California. Sutter was given the right to &quot;represent in the Establishment of New Helvetia all the laws of the country, to function as political authority and dispenser of justice, in order to prevent the robberies committed by adventurers from the United States, to stop the invasion of savage Indians, and the hunting and trading by companies from the Columbia (river).&quot; He named the settlement New Helvetia. In an 1841 inventory for John Sutter describes the settlement surrounding the fort: &quot;twenty-four planked dwellings with glazed windows, a floor and a ceiling; each had a garden. There were eight sheds, eight bathhouses and ten kitchens.&quot;

=== Decline of Fort Ross ===

By 1839, the settlement&#x27;s agricultural importance had decreased considerably, the local population of fur-bearing marine mammals had been long depleted by international over-hunting, and the recently secularized California missions no longer supplemented the agricultural needs of the Alaskan colonies. Following the formal trade agreement in 1838 between the Russian-American Company in New Archangel and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver and Fort Langley for their agricultural needs, the settlement at Fort Ross was no longer needed to supply the Alaskan colonies with food. The Russian-American Company consequently offered the settlement to various potential purchasers, and in 1841 it was sold to John Sutter, a Mexican citizen of Swiss origin, soon to be renowned for the discovery of gold at his lumber mill in the Sacramento valley. Although the settlement was sold for $30,000 to Sutter, some Russian historians assert the sum was never paid; therefore legal title of the settlement was never transferred to Sutter and the area still belongs to the Russian people. A recent Sutter biography however, asserts that Sutter&#x27;s agent, Peter Burnett, paid the Russian-American Company agent William M. Steuart $19,788 in &quot;notes and gold&quot; on April 13, 1849, thereby settling the outstanding debt for Fort Ross and Bodega.

===20th century===
Possession of Fort Ross passed from Sutter through successive private hands and finally to George W. Call. In 1903, the stockade and about of land were purchased from the Call family by the California Historical Landmarks Commission. Three years later it was turned over to the State of California for preservation and restoration as a state historic monument. Since then, the state has acquired more of the surrounding land for preservation purposes. California Department of Parks and Recreation as well as many volunteers put extensive efforts into restoration and reconstruction work in the Fort.

CA 1 once bisected Fort Ross. It entered from the northeast where the Kuskov House once stood, and exited through the main gate to the southwest. The road was eventually diverted, and the parts of the fort that had been demolished for the road were rebuilt. The old roadway can still be seen going from the main gate to the northwest; the rest (within the fort and extending northeast) has been removed. CA 1 moved to its current alignment sometime in the mid–late 1970s.

Most of the existing buildings on the site are reconstructions. Cooperative research efforts with Russian archives will help to correct interpretive errors present in structures that date from the Cold-War period. The only original structure remaining is the Rotchev House. Known as the &quot;Commandant&#x27;s House&quot; from the 1940s through the 1970s, it was the residence of the last manager, Aleksandr Rotchev. Renovated in 1836 from an existing structure, it was titled the &quot;new commandant&#x27;s house&quot; in the 1841 inventory to differentiate it from the &quot;old commandant&#x27;s house&quot; (Kuskov House). The Rotchev House, or in original documents, &quot;Administrator&#x27;s House&quot;, is at the center of efforts to &quot;re-interpret&quot; Russia&#x27;s part in California&#x27;s colonial history. The Fort Ross Interpretive Association has received several federally funded grants to restore both exterior and interior elements. While its exterior has been partially restored, its interior is currently undergoing restoration to reflect the recent research that shows a more cosmopolitan and refined aspect of colonial life at the Fort.

The Fort Ross Chapel collapsed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake but much of the original structural woodwork remained and it was re-erected in 1916, but retained the appearance of the American ranch-period modifications when it was used as a stable. Several other restorations ensued, but none incorporated the information in Voznesensky&#x27;s 1841 water-colour which portray the chapel with copper-clad cupola and tower, and red-metal roof. &quot;The Fort Ross Chapel was found eligible for designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1969, architecturally significant as a rare U.S. example of a log church constructed on a Russian quadrilateral plan. An accidental fire destroyed the chapel on October 5, 1970. This loss of the original workmanship and materials of the chapel led to withdrawal of the Chapel&#x27;s Landmark designation in 1971. A complete reconstruction of the chapel was undertaken in 1973 and the Fort Ross settlement, as a whole, retains its National Historic Landmark designation.&quot; The current chapel was built during the intensive restoration activity that followed, but retains the American ranch period appearance.

A large orchard, including several original trees planted by the Russians, is located inland on Fort Ross Road in Sonoma County.

Fort Ross is now a part of Fort Ross State Historic Park, open to the public. In addition to fishing, hiking, surfing, exploring tide pools, picnicking, whale watching, and bird watching, the Park has become a popular destination for scuba divers, some of whom visit Fort Ross Reef. The wreckage of the SS Pomona lies just offshore Fort Ross State Park.

==Fort Ross Cemetery==
In 1990–1992 the Fort Ross Cemetery, located on a ridge adjacent to the settlement, was cleared and 135 gravesites were identified by archaeological excavations. The project was undertaken in collaboration with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), the Kodiak Area Native Association, the Kashaya Pomo, the Bodega Miwok, and the California Native American Heritage Commission. The graves were mostly contained in the main cemetery, across the fort and in view of the chapel, but two grave sites were found outside this area. Russian Orthodox tradition states that the dead must be buried in view of a chapel, so it was unexpected to find people buried out of view of it. It is not known why these people were buried outside the main cemetery, but it is possibly because they were buried before the arrival of the Russian Orthodox community and their religious beliefs.

The cemetery served as a burial ground for both Russians and native people, showing no differentiation of rank or status. Out of the 135 graves excavated, 131 had human remains, and four were empty. The empty graves may have been due to poor preservation of human remains or the earlier removal of the human remains to a different grave site. Based on the grave dimensions, it is estimated that half of the burials were children, who represented 47% of the population of Fort Ross by 1838. Studies show that disease was a common reason for death, as well as various accidents and drownings.

Bodies were generally buried in redwood coffins, or at the very least, a cloth shroud. In 56% of graves, crosses or religious medallions were found. Other items that have been found in the graves have included buttons, glass beads, earrings, dishes, and cloth. The bones were not well preserved due to the soil having a high level of acidity. Redwood tends to be acidic, so this contributed to the lower levels of bone preservation.

In consultation with Reverend Vladimir Derugin of the ROC, researchers were able to confirm that the burial practices followed traditional Russian Orthodox canon and norms, despite having been conducted in a remote frontier outpost. At the conclusion of the project, all unearthed remains were returned to their grave sites, and a religious reburial ceremony was conducted.

=== Conflicting views on the excavation ===
When archaeologists began excavating the cemetery, there were many stakeholders they had to consider. Fort Ross is owned by the state of California and is operated by the department of parks and recreation, so they had to give permission in order for the excavation to occur. Also, the Fort Ross Interpretive Association (FRIA), who work with the park to communicate the history to the public were a part of it. Since Native American remains were involved, archaeologists had to get permissions from the nearest descendants they could find; in this case, it was the Kashaya Pomo. Another group that had a part in the excavation was the Kodiak Area Native Association (KANA), because remains of Alaskan natives were buried in the cemetery. The Russian Orthodox Church was also involved because the fort was a Russian outpost; however, there were two separate groups within the church that both laid claim to the cemetery, so archaeologists consulted with them both as to avoid friction.

With all of these different groups involved, there were a few conflicting views on what to do with the remains and how to treat them. For instance, the Russians thought that everyone buried in the cemetery, including the Kashaya and Alaskan natives, were a part of the Orthodox religion, meaning they had converted. However, many of the Kashaya did not agree with this; they had oral accounts saying that the Kashaya had moved bodies from the Russian cemetery to be buried in a more traditional manner. (Kashaya traditional burial requires that the bodies be cremated.) While some elders were curious about the excavation, to see if the archaeological evidence supported their accounts of Kashaya being removed, the majority did not want their burials excavated. Archaeologists agreed, and said they would do their best to not excavate any Kashaya graves—and if they did, they would rebury them. Later analysis would show that none of the exhumed graves were Kashaya. In contrast, the Russians supported the excavations, but wanted all of the remains reburied in the graves from which they came.

==Windmills at Fort Ross==
Much archaeological research has been done at Fort Ross, more recently in search of the windmills. The historical record states there were at least three windmills, possibly four, although the fourth may have been a watermill or a man- or animal-powered mill. The windmills have gained much attention because various accounts of their exact locations are sometimes inconsistent and vague. There was, in fact, one windmill located not far from the northern end of the blockade, which was most likely used to grind wheat and barley flour. Based on the descriptions given by people who visited Fort Ross, it has been concluded that the main windmill, located outside the blockade, was the traditional style Russian . The root word &quot;stolb&quot; means thick vertical pole.

At the time, the only mills in California, which was under Spanish/Mexican rule, were either water or animal powered. What made the Russian mills significant is that they were the first windmills in California. The Russian needed a very large center post which was sunk into the ground and supported the transverse pole. The transverse pole was rotated by the wings of the mill that faced the wind current. Archaeologists are searching for the remains of this center post, which would have left a significant indentation in the ground.

In October 2012 a modern interpretation of one of Fort Ross&#x27; windmills was erected and placed near the parking lot and visitors center of the State Historic Park. The windmill was built completely by hand, using the same methods that were presumed to have been used in the days of the Russian American settlement. Its pieces were constructed in Russia and shipped to California, where it was fully assembled and now stands as the only working Russian windmill of this style. It has been pointed out, however, that this is a replica of a 19th or early 20th century Vologda Province windmill, and only bears a slight resemblance to the windmill recorded at Fort Ross in 1841 by Ilya Voznesensky. In Voznesensky&#x27;s painting the roof is hipped rather than peaked, and there is no roofed exterior porch on the upper left-hand side. The supporting cribbing is covered in the 1841 rendition, and the proportions are noticeably different. The placement near the parking lot at Fort Ross also conflicts with archeologists&#x27; views of the actual site of the windmill as portrayed by Voznesensky.

== The Fort Ross Archaeological Project ==
The Fort Ross Archeological Project began in the summer of 1988, directed by Professor Kent Lightfoot of the University of California, Berkeley. The purpose was to &quot;examine the nature, extent, and direction of cultural change among native workers in a pluralistic, hierarchically structured, mercantile colony.&quot; In addition to the Archaeological Research Facility and Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, the project saw collaboration with the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Sonoma State University, Santa Rosa Junior College, the Sakhalin Regional Museum, and the Kodiak Area Native Association.

In 1988 and 1989, an encompassing survey of the original 2.8 square kilometer property of Fort Ross Historic State Park was done to determine the size, layout, and archaeological components of native settlements, before and after the establishment of Fort Ross. After dividing the park into a dozen survey blocks in the area of the reconstructed stockade complex, a pedestrian survey of each respective block was undertaken to detect any archaeological remnants. Thirty sites were recorded, mapped, and underwent surface collection. Including the use of historical maps and any presence of temporally-sensitive project point and historical artifact types, several methods were used in determining the chronology of sites; however, this was done primarily by the hydration band measurements of obsidian artifacts. The Obsidian Hydration Laboratory of Sonoma State University completed research of the hydration rates of several local sources of obsidian. 329 obsidian artifacts were collected from Fort Ross sites and analyzed by the laboratory. Sites were dated from the range of 6000–3000 B.C. to A.D. 1812 and onward.

Further lithic materials were analyzed, employing the use of artifact classes as published by the California Office of Historic Preservation. Faunal remains were identified to the most viable discrete taxon and element, with counts made of the minimum number of individuals.

Of the 30 sites cataloged, 27 were used primarily by native Alaskans in addition to, or alternatively, native Californians. Of these 27, eight were determined to have belonged to the historical period including the Russian occupation of Fort Ross.

=== Native Alaskan Village Site and Fort Ross Beach Site ===
Designated CA-SON-1897/H and CA-SON-1898/H respectively, the Native Alaskan Village site and the Fort Ross Beach Site are two sites of particular interest. The former is situated on top of a raised marine terrace and located 30 meters south of the Russian stockade, and the latter resides below the former, traversing a cliff face 30 meters long.

The Native Alaskan Village site was the subject of an investigation into its spatial organization, seeing &quot;topographic mapping of surface features, systematic surface collection and generation of artifact distribution maps, and geophysical investigations involving both magnetometer and soil resistance survey.&quot; The aforementioned surface collection resulted in the discovery of &quot;glass beads, ceramics, projectile points, flakes, and worked bone artifacts over a 200 x 40 m area.&quot;

In addition, 13 surface features were identified and mapped in the Native Alaskan Village site. Two of these were excavated, leading to the unearthing of portions of a set of pit houses. These were referred to as the East Central and South Pit features. A redwood fence line outside the South Pit feature was also discovered, as well as several contextually rich deposits which contained dense concentrations of faunal elements and artifacts, with two in particular being found in the field seasons of 1992 and 1993. Referred to as the East Central, South, and Abalone Dump &quot;Bone Beds,&quot; after extensive 3D mapping of these deposits, crews cataloged thousands of shells, bones, fire-cracked rocks, chipped-stone, ground-stone, glass, metal, and ceramic. These deposits led to the detection of several houses that had been abandoned, and thus were interpreted as being household dumps.

The Fort Ross Beach site saw subsurface testing which led to the discovery of a wide range of faunal remains from domesticated, terrestrial, and sea mammals to fish, birds, and shells of several organisms. Among other finds, a multitude of historical ceramics, lithics, glass beads, glass beverage container fragments, bone artifacts were discovered, as well as debitage from bone tool production. Investigation led to the belief that the site was formed for the most part by activities which had occurred at the base of the cliff and from refuse being discarded over the cliff from the Native Alaskan Village.

==Colonial administrators==
Fort Ross colony had five administrators:
* Ivan A. Kuskov, 1812–1821

==California State Landmark==
 On June 1, 1932, Fort Ross was designated &quot;California Historical Landmark #5&quot;.

=== Fort Ross State Historic Park ===
The 3,000 acre site was purchased in 1906 by the State of California, to preserve the archaeological remains of the area. Later, more land was purchased and the park now includes some of the surrounding lands which although not originally part of the compound, still hold valuable archaeological evidence.

Fort Ross is located on the coast, meaning it is vulnerable to erosion and other natural processes, such as acidic soil, wildfires, and even the destruction of animals like gophers. The other possible disturbance comes from cultural processes; that is, humans and their actions. Harmful activities include illegal collecting and, more generally, the wear and tear that occurs simply from people visiting the site.

<text>Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth, (8 July 1849 – 15 September 1909), was a moderate British Liberal Party statesman who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 until 1894 when he inherited his peerage and then sat in the House of Lords. He served in various capacities in the Liberal governments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Biography==
Tweedmouth was the son of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and Isabella, daughter of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet. Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, was his sister. He was descended from Joseph Marjoribanks, a wine and fish merchant in Edinburgh who died in 1635 and is thought to have been the grandson of Thomas Marjoribanks of Ratho, head of the lowland Clan Marjoribanks. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, but expelled in 1870 following a prank that led to the damage of college sculptures. 

===Political career===

Tweedmouth was returned to Parliament for Berwickshire in 1880, a seat he held until 1894. The seat had been held earlier in the century by his great-uncle, Sir John Marjoribanks, 1st Baronet, and cousin, Charles Albany Marjoribanks.

He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Comptroller of the Household in between February and July 1886 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. When the Liberals returned to power under Gladstone in 1892, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (chief whip). He succeeded his father in the barony in March 1894, only a few days before Gladstone resigned and Lord Rosebery became prime minister. Rosebery appointed Tweedmouth Lord Privy Seal, with a seat in the cabinet, and in May 1894 he also became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He retained these posts until the government fell in 1895.

Amongst other property he inherited the Guisachan estate in Glen Affric from his father but he sold the estate in 1908 to the Earl of Portsmouth.

After ten years in opposition, the Liberals again came to power in December 1905 under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who appointed Tweedmouth First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet. In early 1908 he was criticised for corresponding with German emperor William II on the British naval programme. The matter was referred to the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith eventually stated that the correspondence was &quot;a purely personal and private communication, conceived in an entirely friendly spirit&quot; and no action was taken. However, when Asquith succeeded Campbell-Bannerman as prime minister in April 1908 Tweedmouth was removed as head of the Admiralty and became Lord President of the Council. He suffered a nervous breakdown in June 1908, a condition which was said to partly explain his indiscretion in communicating with the German Emperor on naval matters. Although his health later recovered, he resigned in October 1908. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1908.

An advocate of workers&#x27; rights and social legislation, Tweedmouth was supportive of the Liberal Party&#x27;s alliance with the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 1906 general election, believing that the Liberals could not win without it, and regarded as &quot;humbug&quot; the view that such an alliance meant class legislation.

He died on 15 September 1909.

==Family==
Lord Tweedmouth married Lady Fanny Octavia Louise (1853–1904), daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and aunt of Sir Winston Churchill, in 1873. She reportedly died from cancer in August 1904, aged 51 &quot;at Lord Tweedmouth&#x27;s Glen Affric shooting lodge&quot;. They had a son and heir; Dudley, 3rd Baron Tweedmouth (1874–1935).

Lord Tweedmouth&#x27;s parliamentary career saw him reported as being the Laird of Guisachan and Glenaffric who was, on occasions, &quot;in a fighting mood&quot;. Following Lady Tweedmouth&#x27;s death, Lord Tweedmouth sold the Lairdship of Glen Affric, the property including the Guisachan Estate and deer park that his family had owned since the 1850s. He was reported as being a &quot;generous laird&quot;, who, like his father, &quot;did much for the people&quot; of his estate; the &quot;ties which united the people of Glen Affric with the Laird and his lady were close&quot;.

Lord Tweedmouth survived his wife by five years and died in September 1909, aged 60. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Dudley.

==The Rocking Chair Ranche==
From 1883 until 1896, he was an owner of and investor in Rocking Chair Ranche located in Collingsworth County, Texas, along with his father, The 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and his brother-in-law, The 7th Earl of Aberdeen.

<doc id="603430" wikidata="Q3239281" url="?curid=603430" title="Edersee Dam">
<text>The Edersee Dam is a hydroelectric dam spanning the Eder river in northern Hesse, Germany. Constructed between 1908 and 1914, it lies near the small town of Waldeck at the northern edge of the Kellerwald. Breached by Allied bombs during World War II, it was rebuilt during the war, and today generates hydroelectric power and regulates water levels for shipping on the Weser river.

At low water in late summers of dry years the remnants of three villages (Asel, Bringhausen, and Berich) and a bridge across the original river bed submerged when the lake was filled in 1914 can be seen. Descendants of those buried there go to visit the graves of their ancestors.

==World War II==

The dam was breached in World War II by bouncing bombs dropped by British Lancaster bombers of No. 617 Squadron RAF as part of Operation Chastise. The early morning raid of 17 May 1943 created a massive wide and deep breach in the structure. Water emptied at the rate of into the narrow valley below, producing a flood wave which roared as far as downstream. By the time it diminished in the widening floodplains of the lower Eder, into the Fulda and into the Weser, a total of about 160 cubic meters per hectare had flowed, wreaking widespread destruction and claiming the lives of some 70 people.

(Some non-German sources erroneously cite an early total of 749 for all foreigners killed in all POW and labour camps downriver of the Möhne dam as casualties at a supposed POW or labour camp just below the Eder Dam.)

The dam was rebuilt within months by forced labour drawn from construction of the Atlantic Wall under command of Organisation Todt. The lake today is the third largest reservoir in Germany. Its capacity of makes it a major summertime recreational facility.

The 1955 film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; chronicled the British attack on the dam.

The 2003 video game &quot;Call of Duty&quot; has a playable level of the dam.

<doc id="603432" wikidata="Q6888881" url="?curid=603432" title="Modern Tales">
<text>Modern Tales was a webcomics publisher active from 2002 to 2012, best known for being one of the first profitable subscription models for digital content. Joey Manley was the website&#x27;s publisher and original editor. The site featured a roster of approximately 30 professional webcomic artists. Shaenon Garrity, one of the site&#x27;s original artists, took over as the publication&#x27;s editor in 2006. Other Modern Tales artists included Gene Luen Yang, James Kochalka, Dorothy Gambrell, Harvey Pekar and Will Eisner.

In the first four years of Modern Tales&#x27; run, its most recent webcomic pages and strips were free, and the site&#x27;s archives were available by subscription. The website&#x27;s archives eventually became free to read as well, as online advertisement rates improved. Modern Tales did solid business and Manley spun off a number of similar subscription services, including Serializer.net, Girlamatic, and Kochalka&#x27;s &quot;American Elf&quot;, which together became known as the &quot;Modern Tales family&quot;.

==Concept==
Working in San Francisco for Streaming Media in the early 2000s, Joey Manley became interested in the possibilities for artists on the web. To introduce himself to the webcomic community, he started a podcast called &quot;Digital Comics Talk&quot; and a review website &quot;Talk About Comics&quot;. In 2001, Manley conceptualized a for-profit subscription-based webcomic collective where readers can pay a monthly or annual fee to get access to a library of webcomic archives. He hoped the subscription model would allow artists to work together to increase each other&#x27;s visibility and profits. Manley began to recruit artists, many of whom he had met through his podcast. Shaenon Garrity described the webcomics showcased on Modern Tales as &quot;ambitious, offbeat, and often visually experimental.&quot; The publication was named in the spirit of old pulp magazines, such as &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

The most recent update of each webcomic on Modern Tales was freely available, and readers could pay US$2.95 per month or $29.95 per year to get access to the website&#x27;s archive.

==History==

Modern Tales launched on March 2, 2002, with a roster of major emerging artists and cartoonists. Its launch line-up included Lark Pien, Jason Shiga, Jesse Hamm, Gene Luen Yang, James Kochalka, and Dorothy Gambrell. Established heavy hitters like Harvey Pekar and Will Eisner contributed later, but Modern Tales was generally a showcase for new artists. The website grew rapidly in its first week: while Manley predicted his website would accrue around 150 subscribers in its first year, Modern Tales actually earned over 700 subscribers in its first week. Manley attributed this to high cost of bandwidth and the relatively low number of high-quality webcomics available at the time. As time went on and the number of high-quality free webcomics increased, the subscriber count of Modern Tales went stagnant.

By August 2003, Modern Tales&#x27; back catalogue featured over 4,000 webcomic pages. The website ran a section, curated by Gary Chaloner, featuring 20 Australian cartoonists to aid them in connecting with a global audience. In 2004, Manley published the Modern Tales&#x27; &quot;2003 Yearbook&quot;, titled &quot;Tallscreen Edition&quot;, through BookSurge. This is a 130-page full-color printed book featuring works from all of Joey Manley&#x27;s webcomic subscription services.

In January 2006, Manley launched a secondary, advertisement-driven version of Modern Tales, edited by blogger and critic Eric Burns. Manley decided to establish this free version of Modern Tales in response to changes in economic circumstances that drive website models. In an interview with &quot;The Comics Reporter&quot;, Manley stated that &quot;the Modern Tales brand isn&#x27;t really sustainable in the current environment,&quot; and that he saw a need to append free webcomics to his subscription services. &quot;Narbonic&quot;-creator Shaenon Garrity took over as editor of Modern Tales in August 2006, and worked on reviving its long-form webcomic section and implementing the Project Wonderful advertisement system. As the subscription model became less and less popular, Manley eventually made the website entirely free.

===Spin-off sites===
Manley spun off several other websites based on Modern Tales&#x27; subscription model, including Serializer.net, Girlamatic, AdventureStrips.com and Graphic Smash. Each of these sites had a different editorial focus from that of Modern Tales, such as alternative comics and action comics. Manley also published two single-webcomic subscription sites under the Modern Tales umbrella: Kochalka&#x27;s &quot;American Elf&quot; and Lea Hernandez&#x27; &quot;Rumble Girls&quot;. The entire group of subscription sites Manley published were known as the &quot;Modern Tales family.&quot; Manley launched the free hosting provider Webcomics Nation in 2005 as he took note of the changing Web economy. Whereas Modern Tales and its family was constructed in the style of traditional editorial magazines, Webcomics Nation was set up more as a service-bureau business.

===Closure===
As Modern Tales declined in readership, it was shut down in 2012. The remaining family of subscription services closed down in April 2013, and Manley died in November 2013 of pneumonia.

==Success and impact==

Manley&#x27;s stated goal when he launched Modern Tales was for subscription revenue alone to provide a living wage for artists within five years, and the services did do solid business. Due to Modern Tales&#x27; revenue-sharing model, the most viewed webcomics like Garrity&#x27;s &quot;Narbonic&quot; generated the most income and, in the best years, Garrity could have lived solely off her Modern Tales earnings had she lived somewhere less expensive than the San Francisco Bay Area. Six months after the site&#x27;s launch, Donna Barr was &quot;impressed&quot; that she was regularly making US$100 per month from Modern Tales. Other Modern Tales artists made comparatively little; in 2005, Hernandez described her income from Modern Tales as &quot;gas money&quot;, and Dave Roman said he typically made less than US$100 per year on the website. Before his comic was canceled, cartoonist Jason Shiga was able to make US$70 per strip when he was published in a weekly Bay Area newspaper, but he only made US$4 per strip on Modern Tales in 2003. Some artists on Manley&#x27;s other sites, such as Kochalka with his &quot;American Elf&quot;, were able to make more money than the most profitable artists on the original Modern Tales site.

Manley said in July 2003 that Modern Tales was attracting between 10,000 and 15,000 individual visitors daily, and that 3,500 people had signed up for a subscription. In an interview with &quot;Alameda Times-Star&quot;, Manley said &quot;We&#x27;re not Disney, obviously, but we have proven that people will pay for Web comics.&quot; Throughout 2005 and 2006, Modern Tales had around 2,100 subscribers, which was the most of Manley&#x27;s four subscription services. The entire Modern Tales family grossed around US$100,000 per year, though this had to be split among nearly 100 cartoonists as well as the Web hosting company. Modern Tales was cited by &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; as one of the first workable and profitable subscription models for webcomics. The viability of Modern Tales inspired Marvel Comics and DC Comics to develop their own digital comic websites.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of Britain criticized the website in 2006 for its unintuitive homepage and slow page loading.

<text>Blizzard Brothers (also known as Blizzard Brothers Inc.) were a hardhouse music duo, consisting of DJs, Daniel Allan and Rob Brizzi. They covered and remixed AC/DC&#x27;s song, &quot;Thunderstuck&quot; and released it in Australia on 11 February 2002 as a single, which peaked at No. 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also appeared on the German Singles Chart Top 100. For the track they used Peter Millwood as guest lead vocalist.

In December 2002 they issued their second single, which is a cover of &quot;I Was Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, originally by Kiss. Another track on this single, &quot;Look at Me&quot;, was co-written by Allan and Brizzi with Carlotta Chadwick. Chadwick provided lead vocals and Allan was on backing vocals. Blizzard Brothers Inc. remixed &quot;Alone&quot; by Belgian dance group, Lasgo, which was released with that group&#x27;s single.

Allan later went on to produce for European dance acts: Ian Van Dahl, Paps &#x27;n&#x27; Scar and Lasgo. In Australia, he worked with Human Nature and Sophie Monk (producing a remix of &quot;Inside Outside&quot;). Allan also produced music for the travel and lifestyle television program, &quot;Getaway&quot;, and Channel 9&#x27;s children&#x27;s TV show, &quot;New MacDonalds Farm&quot;. Allan&#x27;s music is featured in the 2003 Australian film, &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;.

<doc id="603440" wikidata="Q3269382" url="?curid=603440" title="Pat McCarran">
<text>Patrick Anthony McCarran (August 8, 1876 – September 28, 1954) was an American farmer, attorney, judge, and Democratic politician who represented Nevada in the United States Senate from 1933 until 1954.

McCarran was born in Reno, Nevada, attended Nevada State University (now the University of Nevada, Reno), and was a farmer and rancher. In 1902, he won election to the Nevada Assembly but left office in 1905 after an unsuccessful campaign for the Nevada State Senate. He studied law privately and was admitted to the bar in 1905, then won election as Nye County District Attorney. He served a two-year term, after which he returned to Reno. From 1913 to 1919, McCarran was a justice of the Supreme Court of Nevada, serving as chief justice from 1917 to 1919. His support for the aviation industry was well known and resulted in Las Vegas&#x27;s McCarran Field (now Harry Reid International Airport) being named in his honor.

In 1932, McCarran unseated incumbent Republican Tasker Oddie and in doing so became the state&#x27;s first U.S. senator born in Nevada; he was reelected three times and served from 1933 until his death. In his Senate career, McCarran served as chairman of the committees on the District of Columbia, Judiciary, and Joint Foreign Economic Cooperation. As Senator, McCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to reject the Second New Deal. He sponsored the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and was a proponent of establishing the United States Air Force. McCarran was a staunch anti-communist, to the point of supporting the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. He sponsored the McCarran Internal Security Act, restricting the political activities of those supporting &quot;totalitarian dictatorship&quot; in the United States. Other significant legislation McCarran sponsored includes the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, sometimes referred to as the McCarran-Walter Act, and the McCarran–Ferguson Act, a landmark law exempting the insurance industry from federal regulation, and the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, which McCarran described as &quot;a Bill of Rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated&quot; by federal agencies.

McCarran&#x27;s career in the Senate was negatively marked by his antisemitism. He was in conflict with the Franklin Roosevelt administration over the New Deal and cooperation with the Soviet Union in World War II.

==Early life and education==
McCarran was born in Reno, Nevada to Irish immigrants Margaret Shay and Patrick McCarran. He was educated in Reno and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1897 at Reno High School. McCarran&#x27;s mother was a devout Catholic, and he inherited his mother&#x27;s faith.

He attended Nevada State University (now the University of Nevada, Reno) but withdrew to work on the family sheep ranch after his father suffered an injury. Instead of returning to college, McCarran studied law with attorney William Woodburn.

Some sources incorrectly state that McCarran received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1901 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1915. In fact, he never received a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts from Nevada State University in 1915. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Georgetown University in 1943 and an honorary LL.D. from the University of Nevada in 1945.

==Nevada Assembly==
McCarran ran for the Nevada Assembly in 1902 as a free silver Democrat with encouragement from his political science professor Anne Henrietta Martin. He was elected and served one term from 1903 to 1905. In 1904, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Nevada State Senate.

He was admitted to the bar in 1905. In 1906, he was elected district attorney of Nye County. He served one term, 1907 to 1909, after which he moved to Reno to continue practicing law.

==Nevada Supreme Court==
In 1912, McCarran was elected to the Supreme Court of Nevada, succeeding John G. Sweeney. He served as a justice from January 1913 to January 1917.

In January 1917, he succeeded Frank Herbert Norcross as chief justice. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1918 and left office in January 1919.

==State government==
Both during his time on the court and afterwards, McCarran continued to play a central role in Nevada&#x27;s state government, as well as its legal and criminal justice systems. From 1913 to 1918, he served on the state Board of Library Commissioners. In addition, he served as chairman of the Nevada State University Board of Visitors.

During his time on the Court from 1913 to 1919, McCarran served on the state Board of Pardons. He was a member of the Board of Parole Commissioners from 1913 to 1918, and he served on the Board of Bar Examiners from 1919 until 1932.

McCarran was president of the Nevada Bar Association from 1920 to 1921 and was a vice president of the American Bar Association from 1922 to 1923.

==United States Senate==
===Electoral history===
McCarran&#x27;s ambition to serve as a U.S. Senator was well known in Nevada, and often the subject of commentary and jokes in the press. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1916, and lost to incumbent Key Pittman. McCarran endorsed Pittman in the general election, and Pittman was reelected.

In 1926, McCarran was again a candidate for the U.S. Senate. He lost the Democratic nomination to Raymond T. Baker, who was defeated by Republican incumbent Tasker Oddie in the general election.

In 1932, McCarran won the Democratic nomination and defeated Oddie in the general election. He was reelected in 1938, 1944, and 1950. He served from March 4, 1933, until his death in 1954.

In 1944, McCarran was challenged by Vail M. Pittman in the Democratic primary, leading to an especially hard-fought campaign that was finally won by McCarran. Pittman ascribed the result to McCarran&#x27;s ability to bring federal money to fund infrastructure projects in Nevada: McCarran&#x27;s biographer Jerome Edwards endorsed this theory, arguing that the narrow margin suggests that a substantial number of registered Democrats in Nevada were dissatisfied with McCarran, but his ability to have the federal government built infrastructure projects that Nevada could not afford on its own explains his enduring appeal in his state.

===Leadership positions===
During his career as a Senator, McCarran served as chairman of the Senate Committees on the District of Columbia (77th and 78th Congresses) and Judiciary (78th, 79th, 81st, and 82nd Congresses). He also served as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation (81st United States Congress).

===Opposition to Roosevelt administration===

Although both were Democrats, McCarran came into increasing opposition with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over patronage decisions, the Second New Deal, and foreign policy.

During his first term, McCarran engaged in a major struggle for the control of patronage appointments relating to federal projects in Nevada with his Democratic colleague Key Pittman. As Nevada was a poor state and badly hit by the Great Depression, there was considerable competition for patronage appointments, and control of patronage was a major political tool. President Roosevelt tended to side with Pittman, the senior senator, in the struggle, thereby earning McCarran&#x27;s enmity. Pittman&#x27;s serious alcoholism rendered him less effective in his last years, and McCarran was able to become the dominant force within the Nevada Democratic Party by 1938.

In the late 1930s, McCarran criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Second New Deal&quot; programs as too liberal. Much of McCarran&#x27;s opposition to the New Deal stemmed from his anger that New Deal programs increased Pittman&#x27;s capacity for patronage appointments.

McCarran was also critical of Roosevelt&#x27;s willingness to intervene in Europe, particularly in alliance with the Soviet Union. From 1939 to 1941, McCarran opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s plans for aid to Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, accusing the president of trying to involve America in a war that was not its business. In particular, McCarran was outraged by the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s offer of military and economic aid to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, arguing that it was immoral to assist &quot;godless communists.&quot; In a speech on the Senate floor, McCarran declared that he despised both Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin but regarded the Third Reich as the lesser evil and felt it was therefore profoundly wrong for the United States to aid the Soviet Union. McCarran was greatly influenced by Pope Pius XI&#x27;s anti-communist &quot;Divini Redemptoris&quot; encyclical in spring 1937, declaring that &quot;Communism is intrinsically wrong, and no one who would save Christian civilization may collaborate with it in any undertaking.&quot;

McCarran supported the war effort after the United States entered the conflict following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

McCarran&#x27;s positions on several key committees, most notably Appropriations and Judiciary, gave him significant influence that he used to obtain federal funding for Nevada. Outside of Nevada, McCarran had the reputation of a narrow-minded and parochial senator; the same reasons that made him unpopular outside of Nevada made him popular to Nevadans as he developed the reputation of a dogged fighter for Nevada&#x27;s interests. McCarran repeatedly attempted via filibusters to force the federal government to stockpile silver, a measure that would have benefited Nevada where silver mining was a major industry, but was widely denounced outside of Nevada as a plan for wasteful spending designed only to benefit his state. After Pearl Harbor, McCarran made much in his Senate speeches to the Senate of the fact that most of American industry was concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, and argued that the federal government had a duty to ensure that war production was shifted to less industrialized states like Nevada.

When Felix Frankfurter became the second Supreme Court nominee to testify in person before the Judiciary Committee, and the first Jewish one, McCarran &quot;used the occasion to launch a nasty, sneering attack on the nominee, filled with innuendo about Frankfurter&#x27;s foreign origins and alleged radical associations.&quot;

McCarran was well known for his efforts at constituent services, often going to extraordinary lengths on behalf of Nevada residents who requested his aid. For instance, McCarran intervened to shield a teenager from Nevada who stole 150 volumes from the Library of Congress and mutilated hundreds of books. In 1942, McCarran pressured the State Department to engage in a prisoner exchange to return the son of a Reno couple who had been captured by the Japanese at Wake Island. McCarran&#x27;s reputation as a man who could &quot;get things done&quot; translated into substantial support at the polls.

In the 1940s and 1950s, 40 percent of Senate bills had to first be approved by the Senate Judiciary committee, giving McCarran immense power as he could easily kill these bills in his committee. Other committee chairmen had the same powers over bills related to their fields, but the number of bills that had to passed by the Judiciary Committee made McCarran far more influential than the other senate committee chairmen. Over time, McCarran used his position as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to engage in much deal-making that allowed him to collect a significant number of political &quot;debts&quot;, making him one of the most powerful Senators. McCarran&#x27;s conservative politics, which pitted him against first Roosevelt and then Harry S. Truman, frequently led to him being asked why he continued as a Democrat instead of defecting to the Republicans. In 1950, when McCarran was asked that question by a reporter, he responded: &quot;I can do more good by staying in the Democratic Party and watching the lunatic fringe--the Roosevelt crowd&quot;. McCarran was against the plans of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations for federal health insurance and increased education spending; favored restricting the power of unions; was opposed to increased immigration, saying he did not want &quot;undesirables from abroad&quot; coming to America; and was against the United Nations, which he called &quot;a haven for spies and Communists&quot;. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he appointed his friend, Senator James Eastland, a well known white supremacist and segregationist, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Civil Rights. Such was McCarran&#x27;s power that in July 1952, the liberal &quot;Washington Post&quot; newspaper (which was not friendly to the conservative McCarran) declared in an article: &quot;It sums the character of this congress to state an unquestionable fact: that its most important member was Patrick A. McCarran&quot;.

===Aviation advocate===

McCarran sponsored numerous laws concerning the early commercial aviation industry, including the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and the Federal Airport Act of 1945. He was an early advocate of separating the United States Army Air Forces from the Army as the Air Force and began sponsoring the necessary legislation in 1933.
===Other initiatives===
In 1945, McCarran co-sponsored the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulations, including antitrust rules. Instead, this act required states to regulate insurance, including mandatory licensing requirements.

McCarran also co-sponsored the 1946 Administrative Procedures Act, which required federal agencies to keep the public informed of their organizational structure, procedures and rules, allowed for public participation in the rule making process, and established uniform standards for the conduct of formal rule making.

===Anti-communism===

McCarran established himself as one of the Senate&#x27;s most ardent anti-Communists. An admirer of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, he was nicknamed the &quot;Senator from Madrid&quot; by columnist Drew Pearson over his efforts to increase foreign aid to Spain. McCarran voted for President Truman&#x27;s 1947 plan to provide aid to Greece and Turkey as part of an effort to prevent them from becoming communist, but in 1949 McCarran broke with Truman after he rejected McCarran&#x27;s request for increased economic aid to Spain and military aid to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s nationalist Chinese government. In 1949, McCarran visited Spain, where he was welcomed as if he were a visiting head of state, and made clear his admiration for Franco. McCarran&#x27;s praise for Franco greatly annoyed Truman. During his visit to Spain, McCarran discussed potential U.S. aid for Franco, infuriating Truman, who angrily declared that McCarran did not have the right to conduct his own foreign policy.

After World War II, McCarran continued his anti-Communist efforts. He was a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek and attributed the &quot;loss of China&quot; to communists to Soviet influence in the U.S. State Department. In 1952, McCarran and Republican Senators Joseph McCarthy and William Knowland attended a dinner hosted by the Kuomintang Ambassador to Washington, toasting &quot;Back to the mainland!&quot; McCarthy sought McCarran&#x27;s favor after he started his &quot;crusade against Communism.&quot; McCarran privately told friends that &quot;Joe is a bit irresponsible&quot; and a &quot;publicity hound,&quot; but praised him for his attacks on the Truman administration. In 1951, in an interview with the &quot;U.S. News&quot;, McCarran expressed his belief that the American Communist Party had engaged in &quot;infiltration&quot; of the media, churches, university faculties, unions and &quot;nationality groups.&quot;

In 1950, McCarran was the chief sponsor of the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required the Communist Party and affiliated organizations to register with the Attorney General and established the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate possible communist subversion and communist front organizations. The act also gave the government power to imprison people &quot;likely&quot; to be spies, saboteurs, and &quot;subversives&quot; without trial (though those imprisoned could appeal to a review board) if the president declared a national emergency. President Truman vetoed the act, charging that it violated civil liberties and put the government in &quot;the business of thought control,&quot; but Congress overrode Truman&#x27;s veto. No such emergency was ever declared and the six camps built for this purpose by the Federal Bureau of Prisons were never used before being shut down in 1957. The act was never enforced due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals before its major provisions were held unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1965 and 1967.

As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, McCarran created and chaired the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to investigate supposed communist spies and sympathizers within the Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman administrations. In acrimonious hearings in February 1951, McCarran questioned Institute of Pacific Relations researcher Owen Lattimore, whom Senator McCarthy accused of being the &quot;top Russian agent&quot; responsible for the &quot;loss of China.&quot; During the hearings, McCarran and Lattimore frequently engaged in shouting matches and interrupted one another. At the end of the hearings, McCarran stated Lattimore was &quot;so flagrantly defiant&quot; and &quot;so persistent in his efforts to confuse and obscure the facts that the committee feels constrained to take due notice of his conduct ... That he has uttered untruths stands clear in the record.&quot; The subcommittee report written by McCarran concluded that China was indeed &quot;lost&quot; because of the policy followed by the State Department, declaring, &quot;Owen Lattimore and John Carter Vincent were influential in bringing about a change in United States policy... favorable to the Chinese Communists&quot;. McCarran was careful not to accuse Lattimore of espionage, which would have allowed him to sue for libel, but came very close with the statement: &quot;Owen Lattimore was, from some time beginning in the 1930s, a conscious, articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy&quot;. McCarran subsequently pushed successfully for Lattimore to be indicted for perjury.
Biographer Michael Ybarra asserted in his book &quot;Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt&quot; that &quot;arguably no American wrecked as many lives as did the great Red hunter from Nevada.&quot;

As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he held up the nomination of Truman&#x27;s nominee for Attorney General, James McGranery, until McGanery promised to indict Lattimore. Lattimore&#x27;s lawyer Abe Fortas defended him by claiming McCarran had deliberately asked questions about arcane and obscure matters that took place in the 1930s in the hope that Lattimore would not be able to recall them properly, thereby giving grounds for perjury indictments. Federal Judge Luther Youngdahl later dismissed all seven charges against Lattimore on the grounds that the matters in question were insubstantial, of little concern to McCarran&#x27;s inquiry, or the result of questions phrased in such a way that they could not be fairly answered.

On July 27, 1953, the armistice of Panmunjom was signed ending the Korean War. McCarran attracted national attention when he criticized President Dwight Eisenhower on the Senate floor for signing the armistice, which he called &quot;a perpetuation of a fraud on this country and the United Nations&quot;. McCarran believed that the United States and the rest of its allies fighting under the United Nations banner in Korea should have fought on until all of Korea was unified under the leadership of President Syngman Rhee, which led him to see the armistice as a sort of American defeat.

===Immigration===
In June 1952, McCarran joined Francis Walter in sponsorship of the McCarran–Walter Act, a law that abolished racial restrictions found in United States immigration and naturalization statutes going back to the Naturalization Act of 1790 and also imposed more rigid restrictions on quotas for immigrants entering the United States. McCarran&#x27;s antisemitism was also reflected in his view on immigration; he actively opposed efforts to permit survivors of the Holocaust to come to the United States. The Act also stiffened the existing law relating to the admission, exclusion and deportation of dangerous aliens under the McCarran Internal Security Act. Of the Act, McCarran said:

Some of the immigration provisions of the act were later superseded by the 1965 Immigration Act, but the power of the government to deny visas for ideological reasons remained on the books another 25 years after that.

==Personal life==
In 1903, McCarran married Harriet Martha &quot;Birdie&quot; Weeks (1882–1963). They were the parents of four daughters and one son. Samuel McCarran became a doctor and worked in Reno. Margaret and Mary became members of the Order of Dominican Sisters. Norine was a longtime employee of the Library of Congress. Patricia became the wife of Edwin Parry Hay of Maryland. Mary left the order in 1957 and became an investment broker, art studio owner, and author.

==Death and burial==
McCarran died in Hawthorne, Nevada, on September 28, 1954, collapsing of a heart attack following a speech he gave at a political rally. McCarran was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno.

==Legacy==
McCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to oppose President Franklin D. Roosevelt and reject the New Deal. In addition, he was a proponent of the aviation industry; he was a sponsor of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and the Federal Airport Act of 1945, and was a proponent of establishing the United States Air Force separate from the Army. In recent years he has been accused of racism, antisemitism, and xenophobia. His strident anti-communism matched that of Joseph McCarthy.

Harold L. Ickes described McCarran as &quot;easy-going, old-shoe &#x27;Pat&#x27;&quot; in a column criticizing McCarran as a tool of the oil companies. American journalist John Gunther was also critical of McCarran&#x27;s alleged corporate ties, writing that he resembled gold &quot;in that he is soft, heavy, and not a good conductor.&quot;
McCarran Boulevard in Reno is named for Pat McCarran, as is McCarran Street in North Las Vegas.

Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas was named after Senator McCarran prior to December 14, 2021. For some time, many Nevada politicians had supported removing his name from the airport due to his antisemitic and racist beliefs. U.S. Senator Harry Reid said McCarran was &quot;one of the most prejudiced people who has ever served in the Senate.&quot; On February 16, 2021, the Clark County Commissioners voted unanimously to officially change the name of McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. The name change took place after federal approval and just before Reid&#x27;s death.

===National Statuary Hall and controversy===

A statue of McCarran is included in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. Each state is allowed to display likenesses of two individuals; Nevada&#x27;s are those of McCarran and Sarah Winnemucca.

In 2017, Nevada&#x27;s three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote to Governor Brian Sandoval and state legislative leaders and stated their view that review of McCarran&#x27;s career might warrant removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall Collection.

In January 2017, a poll of Nevada legislators indicated support for removing McCarran&#x27;s statue from the collection. A bill introduced in the Nevada State Senate, SB 174, which called for the removal of the statue and renaming of McCarran International Airport for former U.S. Senator Harry Reid, failed to be passed before the end of the 2017 legislative session on June 1, 2017.

===Popular culture===
*Cartoonist Walt Kelly introduced a character into his &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strip called Mole MacCaroney. Mole&#x27;s near-blindness and concerns about &quot;germs&quot; were seen as a hostile reference to McCarran and his immigration restriction policies.
*McCarran was in part the inspiration for the fictional character of the corrupt United States Senator Pat Geary in the film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.
*McCarran&#x27;s chair from his tenure in the U.S. Senate was featured in a 2011 episode of the History Channel reality television series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;.

<text>Konstantynów Łódzki is a town in Pabianice County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland, with 18,335 inhabitants (2020). It borders Łódź to the east, Lutomiersk to the west, Aleksandrów Łódzki to the north, and Porszewice to the south.

==History==

It was founded in the 1820s by a landowner who had planned to build a textile industry there. In 1821 Konstantynów Łódzki, at that time still a village, became a part of the textile industry of the Łódź region. Shortly thereafter, in 1824 the town was given its current name and was established as a town in 1830. Town rights were revoked in 1870 and restored in 1924.

Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was occupied by Germany until 1945.

<doc id="603447" wikidata="Q1753204" url="?curid=603447" title="Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland">
<text>Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, (15 December 1792 – 12 February 1865), styled Lord Algernon Percy from birth until 1816 and known as Lord Prudhoe between 1816 and 1847, was a British naval commander, explorer and Conservative politician.

==Early life==
Northumberland was the second son of General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland, and his second wife Frances Julia, daughter of Peter Burrell. He was educated at Eton and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Naval career==
Northumberland entered the Royal Navy in March 1805, aged 12, on board HMS &quot;Tribune&quot; and served in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1815, when only 22, he was promoted to captain, taking command of HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; in August, and commanding her until she was broken up some 10 months later. The following year, aged 23, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Prudhoe, of Prudhoe Castle in the County of Northumberland (Prudhoe being a town in Northumberland). Between 1826 and 1829 he was part of an expedition to Egypt, Nubia and The Levant. During that expedition, Prudhoe obtaining the Prudhoe Lions, a pair of Ancient Egyptian monumental sculptures which he subsequently donated to the British Museum. In 1834, he travelled to the Cape of Good Hope with John Herschel to study the southern constellations.

Northumberland was president of the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck from 1851 to 1865 (partly due to encouragement by George Palmer) during which time he undertook a reorganisation, changing its name to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in October 1854. In 1851 he offered a prize of £200 for a new design of self-righting lifeboat, won by James Beeching, which became the standard model for the new Royal National Lifeboat Institution fleet.

In 1862 he became a full admiral in the Royal Navy on the Reserved List.

==Political career==
Northumberland succeeded his childless elder brother in the dukedom in 1847. In 1852 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet, by the Earl of Derby, a post he held until the fall of the government in December 1852. In 1853 he was made a Knight of the Garter.

==Personal life==
Northumberland married, aged 49, Lady Eleanor Grosvenor, daughter of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, on 25 August 1842 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. They had no children. As a result of gout in his right hand, he died in February 1865, aged 72 at Alnwick Castle and was buried in the Northumberland Vault, within Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded in his titles by his twice first cousin, George Percy, 2nd Earl of Beverley, except for the barony of Percy, which passed through the female line to his great-nephew, John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl. The Duchess of Northumberland died on 4 May 1911.

He was a fellow of the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, president of the Royal United Services Institute and the Royal Institution, a director of the British Institution and a trustee of the British Museum.

Northumberland was a good friend of Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, and Prudhoe Bay, on the north coast of Alaska, was named after him.

<doc id="603453" wikidata="Q1291067" url="?curid=603453" title="Imogene Coca">
<text>Imogene Coca (born Emogeane Coca; November 18, 1908 – June 2, 2001) was an American comic actress best known for her role opposite Sid Caesar on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. Starting out in vaudeville as a child acrobat, she studied ballet and pursued a serious career in music and dance, graduating to decades of stage musical revues, cabaret, and summer stock. In her 40s, she began a celebrated career as a comedian on television, starring in six series and guest-starring on successful television programs from the 1940s to the 1990s.

She was nominated for five Emmy Awards for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, winning Best Actress in 1951 and singled out for a Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting in 1953. Coca was also nominated for a Tony Award in 1978 for &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; and received a sixth Emmy nomination at the age of 80 for an episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;.

She possessed a &quot;rubbery&quot; face capable of the broadest expressions — &quot;Life&quot; magazine compared her to Beatrice Lillie and Charlie Chaplin and described her characterizations as taking &quot;people or situations suspended in their own precarious balance between dignity and absurdity, and push(ing) them over the cliff with one single, pointed gesture&quot;. The magazine noted a &quot;particularly high-brow critic&quot; as observing &quot;The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash, noisy, and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly. Miss Coca, on the other hand, is the timid woman who, when aroused, can beat a tiger to death with a feather.&quot; Aside from vaudeville, cabaret, film, theater, and television, she voiced children&#x27;s cartoons and was even featured in the 1984 MTV music video &quot;Bag Lady&quot; by the band EBN-OZN, ultimately working well into her 80s. In a 1999 interview, Robert Ozn said that during the shoot, she was required to sit on the sidewalk in snow for hours during a blizzard with 15-degree (F) temperatures. &quot;While the rest of us 20-somethings were moaning about the weather, warming ourselves by a heater, this little 75-year-old lady never once complained — put us all to shame. She was the most professional artist I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&quot;

==Early life==
Born Emogeane Coca in Philadelphia in 1908 of Spanish and Irish descent, the only child of Joseph F. Coca, Jr. (the family surname was originally Fernández y Coca), a violinist and vaudeville orchestra conductor, and Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; Brady, a dancer and magician&#x27;s assistant, she took lessons in piano, dance, and voice as a child and while still a teenager moved from Philadelphia to New York City to become a dancer. In 1925, still aged 16, she landed her first job in the chorus of the Broadway musical &quot;When You Smile&quot;. She became a headliner in Manhattan nightclubs with music arranged by her first husband, Bob Burton.

She gained prominence when she combined music with comedy; her first critical success was in &quot;New Faces of 1934&quot;. A well-received part of her act was a comic striptease, during which Coca made sultry faces and gestures but would manage to remove only one glove. She committed this routine to film in the Educational Pictures comedy short &quot;The Bashful Ballerina&quot; (1937). She received excellent notices for her Educational short &quot;Dime a Dance.&quot; In a review headlined &quot;Swell Comic Scores,&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;A real comedienne who will wow the cash customers with her zany antics, Imogene Coca is in a class all by herself, and her style of comedy does not suggest that of any other funster on the screen.&quot; Three other newcomers to films — Danny Kaye, June Allyson, and Barry Sullivan — were featured in the short, filmed at Educational&#x27;s New York studio.

==Television==
Imogene Coca was one of network television&#x27;s first comics. She starred in an early ABC series, &quot;Buzzy Wuzzy&quot;, which lasted four episodes in 1948. She played opposite Sid Caesar on &quot;The Admiral Broadway Revue&quot; (January to June 1949), and then in the sketch comedy program &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950 to 1954), which was immensely popular, winning the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Series in 1952 and 1953. The 90-minute show was aired live on NBC every Saturday night in prime time. In addition to performing with Caesar on this program, she frequently starred in parodies of classic ballets opposite dancer and choreographer James Starbuck. She won the second-ever Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1951 and was nominated for four other Emmys for her work in the show. She won a 1953 Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. The Caesar-Coca partnership might have continued, but the network tried to generate more revenue by spinning off Coca into her own series. &quot;The Imogene Coca Show&quot; ran for one year (1954 to 1955).

In the 1963–64 TV season, Coca portrayed a comic temporary helper in the NBC sitcom &quot;Grindl&quot;. It competed with the second half of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and lasted only one season. Coca later starred as a cavewoman with Joe E. Ross in the 1966–67 time-travel satire sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;.

She continued to appear on comedy and variety series from the 1950s through the 1980s, including several appearances each on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, and Bob Hope specials. She appeared on other shows and specials by Dean Martin, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Lewis, Dick Clark, Danny Kaye, and Andy Williams. &quot;The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris Special&quot; won a 1967 Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special. She made memorable guest appearances on sitcoms, including appearances on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;. She appeared with Milton Berle and &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; co-star Howard Morris in &quot;Curtain Call&quot;, a 1983 episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

Coca appeared in a number of literary adaptations for children. In 1960, she was Miss Clavel in Sol Saks&#x27; adaptation of Ludwig Bemelmans&#x27; &quot;Madeline&quot; for &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;. In 1972, she voiced the character of Princess Jane Klockenlocher in &quot;The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye&quot;, a Rankin/Bass version of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;. In 1978, she appeared in &quot;A Special Sesame Street Christmas&quot;. In 1985, she played The Cook in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, an all-star TV miniseries adaptation of the book by Lewis Carroll. Among her final roles was voicing characters in &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;.

In 1988, Coca appeared as the mother of Allyce Beasley&#x27;s Agnes in the &quot;Moonlighting&quot; episode &quot;Los Dos Dipestos&quot;, written by David Steinberg. She received her sixth Emmy nomination, as Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series, for the role. The same year she was the female recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in Comedy at the second annual American Comedy Awards, alongside male recipient George Burns.

Coca appeared only sporadically in films such as &quot;The Incredible Incident at Independence Square&quot;, filmed in her hometown of Philadelphia, as well as &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot; (1963), &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, &quot;Papa Was a Preacher&quot;, &quot;Buy &amp; Cell&quot;, and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), as &quot;Aunt Edna&quot;.

After having appeared in several Broadway musical comedy revues and plays between the 1930s and the 1950s, Coca returned to Broadway at the age of 70 with a Tony Award-nominated performance as religious zealot Letitia Primrose in &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, a 1978 stage musical adapted from the film &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1934). Her role, that of a religious fanatic who plasters decals onto every available surface, had been a male in both the film and the original stage production, and was rewritten specifically as a vehicle for Coca. She appeared in the Broadway run with Kevin Kline and Madeline Kahn, continued with the national tour starring Rock Hudson and Judy Kaye, and returned for a later tour revival in the mid-1980s with Kaye and Frank Gorshin. She also co-starred with singer Maxine Sullivan in &quot;My Old Friends&quot; and touring productions, including musicals such as &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; and plays such as &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; and &quot;Luv&quot;. She rejoined Sid Caesar in 1961–62, 1977, and 1990–91 for a traveling stage revue and made an appearance with Caesar and Howard Morris at &quot;Comic Relief VI&quot; in 1994. 

One of Coca&#x27;s early stock characters on the Caesar series blended comedy with socially conscious pathos as a bag lady and she was frequently asked to reprise the role, including by Carol Burnett for her &#x27;60s series and by Red Skelton as love interest to one of his own familiar characters in the 1981 TV special &quot;Freddie the Freeloader&#x27;s Christmas Dinner&quot;. New wave group Ēbn-Ōzn featured Coca as the title character in the music video to their song &quot;Bag Lady (I Wonder)&quot;, which was a top-40 dance hit in 1984.

==Personal life and legacy==

Coca had no children, but was married twice: for 20 years to Bob Burton, from 1935 until his death in 1955, and later for 27 years to King Donovan, from 1960 until his death in 1987. Burton&#x27;s death came only one month after her mother had died. Coca was a practicing Roman Catholic.

Coca was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.

Hours after Coca and Donovan completed their New Year&#x27;s Eve 1972 performance of &quot;Fourposter&quot; at the Showboat Dinner Theater in St. Petersburg, Florida, they were involved in a serious auto accident. They had been driving in foggy weather to their home in Clearwater, Florida, when Donovan collided with another car driven by 19-year-old Cheryl Lynn Rice. Rice was unharmed, but Donovan sustained a slight leg injury, and the rear-view mirror entered Coca&#x27;s right eye, smashing her cheekbone. Transported to the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Coca underwent plastic surgery and a cosmetic lens covered her now-blind eye for the rest of her career, which resumed with her long stint in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; beginning in 1978.

Performers citing Coca as an influence include Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Tracey Ullman. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; is considered a television classic and was the basis for a well-received 1982 film, &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;. A 1992 musical version of the film made its way to Broadway, in which comedic actress Andrea Martin won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Alice Miller.

In 1995, Coca was honored with the second annual Women in Film Lucy Award, honoring women&#x27;s achievements in television and named after Lucille Ball.

==Death==
On June 2, 2001, Coca died at her home in Westport, Connecticut, aged 92, from natural causes incidental to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She was cremated and her ashes scattered.

<text>Thomas Hamilton, 9th Earl of Haddington, KT, PC, FRS, FRSE (21 June 1780 – 1 December 1858), known as Lord Binning from 1794 to 1828, was a Scottish Conservative statesman.

==Background and education==
Lord Haddington was the only son of Lady Sophia, daughter of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, and Charles Hamilton, 8th Earl of Haddington. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and Christ Church, Oxford. 

==Political career==
At the beginning of the 19th century, Lord Haddington was a supporter of George Canning. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for St Germans in 1802, but did not stand for re-election in 1806. In August 1814, he was appointed one of His Majesty&#x27;s Commissioners for the management of the affairs in India. He served sporadically in the House of Commons until 1827 when he was elevated to the House of Lords by the new prime minister, George Canning, who had him created Baron Melrose, of Tynninghame in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He had previously been created a privy counsellor in 1814, and, in 1828, he succeeded to his family&#x27;s Scottish earldom.

Lord Haddington went on to vote against the Reform Bill in 1831, but later changed his mind and voted for it in 1832, possibly due to the political crises surrounding its passage. Upon the rise of Sir Robert Peel to the premiership in 1834, Lord Haddington was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, however the government collapsed within six months, and the Whigs were once again in power. Lord Haddington was able to return to government in 1841 with the return of Sir Robert Peel to the premiership - he declined the post of Governor General of India, instead opting to become First Lord of the Admiralty and a member of the Cabinet. He held that post until January 1846, when he was shuffled to become Lord Privy Seal, a post he held until the death of the government in July.

Lord Binning&#x27;s family were related to the Stanhopes and staunch supporters of Pitt&#x27;s administration. Being, as the eldest son of a Scots peer, ineligible for a seat in Scotland, he was provided with an English seat in 1802 &#x27;under the peculiar protection of Mr Pitt&#x27;, by Pitt&#x27;s sister&#x27;s father-in-law, Lord Eliot.

As might have been expected, Binning followed Pitt&#x27;s line in his first Parliament, voting with him for the orders of the day, 3 June 1803, against Addington, 7 Mar., 13 and 16 Apr. (though on 15 Mar. he did not divide on Pitt&#x27;s motion on the navy) and also for Fox&#x27;s and Pitt&#x27;s defence motions which brought down Addington, 23 and 25 April 1804. He went on to support Pitt&#x27;s second administration and voted against the censure of Melville, 8 Apr. 1805. He was on the committee which investigated the 11th naval report. After Pitt&#x27;s death he was one of the Pittite group led by Canning, Sturges Bourne and George Rose which held fortnightly dinners at White&#x27;s, and became a steward of the Pitt Club. He voted against the Grenville ministry on Ellenborough&#x27;s seat in the cabinet, 3 March 1806, and against the repeal of Pitt&#x27;s Additional Force Act, 30 April. On 26 June, he asked why Scotland was excluded from the training bill; on 3 July, when he was teller against the bill, he was put down by the lord advocate who asked him why he wished to extend to Scotland a bill that his fellow oppositionists had been abusing for weeks; but promised to bring in a separate bill for Scotland.

Binning found no seat in 1806, though his friend Huskisson reported that he wished Binning&#x27;s father had allowed him to contest Dover, where he might have got in at modest expense. Melville secured an opening for him from Viscount Lowther on a vacancy at Cockermouth in January 1807: Melville had suggested that Binning might come in for Haslemere on the same interest instead of Viscount Garlies, when the latter succeeded to the title in November 1806, but Binning had to wait for the next vacancy. Cockermouth was only available to him for another year, so at the general election of 1807, he found another seat on Lord Clinton&#x27;s interest at Callington, through their mutual uncle Francis Drake.

In 1831 he was stripped of his hereditary title of Keeper of the Royal Park (Holyrood Park) due to the outrageous behaviour of his father in quarrying in the park. However, Thomas received £40,000 in compensation (the equivalent of £4.5 million in 2022).

==Family==
Lord Haddington married Lady Maria Parker, heir of George Parker, 4th Earl of Macclesfield, in 1802. They had no surviving children and the Earl died in December 1858, aged 78. On his death the barony of Melrose became extinct while he was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin, George Baillie-Hamilton. Lady Haddington died in 1861.

In 1828 he commissioned William Burn to remodel the family seat of Tyninghame House, which passed with the earldom to Baillie-Hamilton.

<text>Coniine is a poisonous chemical compound, an alkaloid present in and isolable from poison hemlock (&quot;Conium maculatum&quot;), where its presence has been a source of significant economic, medical, and historico-cultural interest; coniine is also produced by the yellow pitcher plant (&quot;Sarracenia flava&quot;), and fool&#x27;s parsley (&quot;Aethusa cynapium&quot;). Its ingestion and extended exposure are toxic to humans and all classes of livestock; its mechanism of poisoning involves disruption of the central nervous system, with death caused by respiratory paralysis. The biosynthesis of coniine contains as its penultimate step the non-enzymatic cyclisation of 5-oxooctylamine to γ-coniceine, a Schiff base differing from coniine only by its carbon-nitrogen double bond in the ring. This pathway results in natural coniine that is a mixture—a racemate—composed of two enantiomers, the stereoisomers (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-coniine and (&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-coniine, depending on the direction taken by the chain that branches from the ring. Both enantiomers are toxic, with the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer being the more biologically active and toxic of the two in general. Coniine holds a place in organic chemistry history as being the first of the important class of alkaloids to be synthesized, by Albert Ladenburg in 1886, and it has been synthesized in the laboratory in a number of unique ways through to modern times.

Hemlock poisoning has been a periodic human concern, a regular veterinary concern, and has had significant occurrences in human and cultural history. Notably, in 399 BC, Socrates was sentenced to death by drinking a coniine-containing mixture of poison hemlock.

==Natural origins==

Poison hemlock (&quot;Conium maculatum&quot;) contains highly toxic amounts of coniine. Its presence on farmland is an issue for livestock farmers because animals will eat it if they are not well fed or the hemlock is mixed in with pasture grass. The coniine is present in &quot;Conium maculatum&quot; as a mixture of the R-(−)- and S-(+)-enantiomers. 


Coniine is also found in &quot;Sarracenia flava&quot;, the yellow pitcher plant. The yellow pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant endemic to the southeastern United States. The plant uses a mixture of sugar and coniine to simultaneously attract and poison insects, which then fall into a digestive tube. Coniine is also found in &quot;Aethusa cynapium&quot;, commonly known as fool&#x27;s parsley.

==History of natural isolates==
The history of coniine is understandably tied to the poison hemlock plant, since the natural product was not synthesizable until the 1880s. Jews in the Middle East were poisoned by coniine after consuming quail in the area that usually ate hemlock seeds, and Greeks on the island of Lesbos who also consumed quail suffered from the same poisoning, causing myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury. The most famous hemlock poisoning occurred in 399 BCE, when the philosopher Socrates is believed to have consumed a liquid infused with hemlock to carry out his death sentence, having been convicted of impiety toward the gods, and the corruption of youth. Hemlock juice was often used to execute criminals in ancient Greece.

Hemlock has had a limited medical use throughout history. The Greeks used it not just as capital punishment, but also as an antispasmodic and treatment for arthritis. Books from the 10th century attest to medical use by the Anglo-Saxons. In the Middle Ages it was believed that hemlock could be used to cure rabies; in later European times it came to be associated with flying ointments in witchcraft. Native Americans used hemlock extract as arrow poison.

Yellow pitcher plant, or &quot;Sarracenia flava&quot;, contains coniine. &quot;Aethusa cynapium&quot; contains cynopine, which is similar to coniine.

==Pharmacology and toxicology==
The (&quot;R&quot;)-(−) enantiomer of coniine is the more biologically active, at least in one system (TE-671 cells expressing human fetal nicotinic neuromuscular receptors), and in mouse bioassay, the same enantiomer and the racemic mixture are about two-fold more toxic than the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer (see below).

Coniine, as racemate or as pure enantiomer, begins by binding and stimulating the nicotinic receptor on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. The subsequent depolarization results in nicotinic toxicity; as coniine stays bound to the receptor, the nerve stays depolarized, inactivating it. This results, systemically, in a flaccid paralysis, an action similar to that of succinylcholine since they are both depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Symptoms of paralysis generally occur within a half-hour, although death may take several hours. The central nervous system is not affected: the person remains conscious and aware until respiratory paralysis results in cessation of breathing. The flaccid, muscular paralysis is an ascending paralysis, lower limbs being first affected. The person may have a hypoxic convulsion just prior to death, disguised by the muscular paralysis such that the person may just weakly shudder. Cause of death is lack of oxygen to the brain and heart as a consequence of respiratory paralysis, so that a poisoned person may recover if artificial ventilation can be maintained until the toxin is removed from the victim&#x27;s system.

The values (in mouse, i.v. administered) for the &quot;R&quot;-(−) and &quot;S&quot;-(+) enantiomers, and the racemate, are approximately 7 and 12, and 8 milligrams per kilogram, respectively.

==Chemical properties==
(+/–)-Coniine was first isolated by Giesecke, but the formula was suggested by Blyth and definitely established by Hofmann.

-(&quot;S&quot;)-Coniine has since been determined to be a colorless alkaline liquid, with a penetrating odour and a burning taste; has 0° 0.8626 and 19° 0.8438, refractive index &quot;n&quot;23°D 1.4505, and is dextrorotatory, [α]19°D +15.7° (see related comments under Specific rotation section below). -(&quot;R&quot;)-Coniine has [α]21°D 15° and in other respects resembles its -isomer, but the salts have slightly different melting points; the platinichloride has mp. 160 °C (Löffler and Friedrich report 175 °C), the aurichloride mp. 59 °C.

===Solubility===
Coniine is slightly soluble (1 in 90) in cold water, less so in hot water, so that a clear cold solution becomes turbid when warmed. On the other hand, the base dissolves about 25% of water at room temperature. It mixes with alcohol in all proportions, is readily soluble in ether and most organic solvents. Coniine dissolves in carbon disulfide, forming a complex thiocarbamate.

===Crystallization===
Coniine solidifies into a soft crystalline mass at −2 °C. It slowly oxidizes in the air. The salts crystallize well and are soluble in water or alcohol. The hydrochloride, B•HCl, crystallizes from water in rhombs, mp. 220 °C, [α]20°D +10.1°; the hydrobromide, in needles, mp. 211 °C, and the -acid tartrate, B•C4H6O6•2 H2O, in rhombic crystals, mp. 54 °C. The platinichloride, (B•HCl)2•PtCl4•H2O, separates from concentrated solution as an oil, which solidifies to a mass of orange-yellow crystals, mp. 175 °C (dry). The aurichloride, B•HAuCl4, crystallizes on standing, mp. 77 °C. The picrate forms small yellow needles, mp. 75 °C, from hot water. The 2,4-dinitrobenzoyl- and 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-derivates have mps. 139.0–139.5 °C and 108–9 °C respectively. The precipitate afforded by potassium cadmium iodide solution is crystalline, mp. 118 °C, while that given by nicotine with this reagent is amorphous.

===Color changes===
Coniine gives no coloration with sulfuric or nitric acid. Sodium nitroprusside gives a deep red color, which disappears on warming, but reappears on cooling, and is changed to blue or violet by aldehydes.

===Specific rotation===
The stereochemical composition of &quot;coniine&quot; is a matter of some importance, since its two enantiomers do not have identical biological properties, and many of the older pharmacological studies on this compound were carried out using the naturally-occurring isomeric mixture. &quot;S&quot;-(+)-Coniine has a specific rotation, [α]D, of +8.4° (c = 4.0, in CHCl3). These authors note that Ladenburg&#x27;s value, +15°, is for a &quot;neat&quot;, i.e. undiluted, sample. A similarly high value of +16° for the [α]D of &quot;coniine&quot; is given, without explicit citation of the source, in The Merck Index. The value of +7.7° (c = 4.0, CHCl3) for synthetic S-(+)-coniine and -7.9° (c = 0.5, CHCl3) for synthetic R-(−)-coniine is given by other chemists. The hydrochloride salts of the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) and (&quot;R&quot;)-(−) enantiomers of coniine have values of [α]D of +4.6° and -5.2°, respectively (c = 0.5, in methanol).

==Synthesis==

The original synthesis (shown below) of Coniine was performed by Ladenburg in 1886. Ladenburg heated N-methylpyridine iodide to 250 °C, to obtain 2-methylpyridine. He then performed a Knoevenagel condensation with acetaldehyde in anhydrous zinc chloride to yield 2-propenylpyridine. In fact, Ladenburg used paraldehyde, a cyclic trimer of acetaldehyde that readily forms acetaldehyde upon heating. Finally, 2-propenylpyridine was reduced with metallic sodium in ethanol to provide racemic (±) coniine. Fractional crystallisation of racemic coniine with (+)-tartaric acid yielded enantiopure coniine.

The scheme proposed by Ladenburg gave poor yields, so the quest for alternative routes was open. A slightly better yield is observed if 2-methylpyridine and acetaldehyde are heated in a sealed tube with hydrochloric acid for 10 hours. A mixture of 2-propenylpyridine and 2-chloropropylpyridine is formed and is subsequently reduced by sodium in ethanol to give &quot;rac&quot;-coniine. Note: although the scheme below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, the final reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then separated

In 1907, another route with better yield was proposed. First, 2-(2&#x27;-hydroxypropyl)pyridine is reduced with phosphorus and fuming hydroiodic acid at 125 °C. Second, the product is treated with zinc dust and water. Finally, the product of the second step is treated with sodium in ethanol. Note: although the graphic below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, this reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then purified and separated. 

A number of other syntheses of coniine have been effected, of which that of Diels and Alder is of special interest. The initial adduct of pyridine and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate is tetramethylquinolizine-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate, which on oxidation with dilute nitric acid is converted into trimethyl indolizine-tricarboxylate. This, on hydrolysis and decarboxylation, furnishes indolizine, the octahydro-derivate of which, also known as octahydropyrrocoline is converted by the cyanogen bromide method successively into the bromocyanamide, cyanamide and &quot;rac.&quot;-coniine. A synthesis of the alkaloid, starting from indolizine (pyrrocoline) is described by Ochiai and Tsuda.

The preparation of -(&quot;R&quot;)-coniine by the reduction of β-coniceine (-propenylpiperidine) by Löffler and Friedrich provides means for converting conhydrine to -(&quot;R&quot;)-coniine. Hess and Eichel reported, incorrectly, that pelletierine was the aldehyde (β-2-piperidyl-propaldehyde) corresponding to coniine, and yielded &quot;rac-&quot;coniine when its hydrazone was heated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 156–170 °C. According to these authors, -(&quot;S&quot;)-coniine is rendered almost optically inactive when heated with barium hydroxide and alcohol at 180–230 °C. Leithe has shown by observation of the optical rotation of (+)-pipecolic acid (piperidine-2-carboxylic acid) and some of its derivatives under varying conditions, that it must belong to the -series of amino acids.

Currently, Coniine, and many other alkaloids, can be synthesized stereoselectively. For example, Pd-catalyzed 1,3-chirality transfer reaction can stereospecifically transform a single enantiomer of an allyl alcohol into a cyclic structure (in this case a piperidine). In this way, starting from (S)-alcohol an (S)-enantiomer of Coniine is obtained and vice versa. Remarkably, the separation of racemic alcohol into different enantiomers is done with the help of &quot;Candida antarctica&quot; lipase.

==Biosynthesis ==
The biosynthesis of coniine is still being investigated, but much of the pathway has been elucidated. Originally thought to use 4 acetyl groups as feed compounds for the polyketide synthase that forms coniine, it is in fact derived from two malonyl and a butyryl CoA, which are derived in the usual way from acetyl-CoA.

Further elongation of butyryl-CoA using 2 malonyl-CoA forms 5-ketooctanal. Ketooctanal then undergoes transamination using alanine:5-keto-octanal aminotransferase. The amine then spontaneously cyclizes and is dehydrated to form the coniine precursor γ–coniceine. This is then reduced using NADPH dependent y-coniceine reductase to form coniine.

==In popular culture==
Coniine is the murder weapon in Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot;.

The R and S 2-Propylpiperidine stereoisomers are a neurotoxin present in a slug-like lifeform in &quot;The Expanse&quot;. The toxin is shown as causing almost instant death upon skin contact in the show.
