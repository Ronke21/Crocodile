<doc id="600299" wikidata="Q6487668" url="?curid=600299" title="List of places named after Josip Broz Tito">
<text>During Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s presidency and in the years following his death in 1980, several places in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and across the world were named or renamed in honor of him as part of his cult of personality. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, several towns and squares in the former nation have reverted their names. Numerous streets were also named after Tito, both in former Yugoslavia as well as elsewhere as an honour to a foreign dignitary.

==Cities formerly named after Tito==
A total of eight towns and cities were named after Tito. Right after World War II, four municipalities whose role in the partisan resistance movement was perceived as significant gained the adjective &quot;Tito&#x27;s&quot; (locally &quot;Titov/Titova/Titovo&quot;), while the capital of the smallest federal republic of Montenegro was renamed &quot;Titograd&quot; (&quot;Tito-city&quot;). After Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, four more cities were added, for a total of one in each of the Yugoslav six federal republics and two autonomous provinces. These were as follows:

===Montenegro===
* Titograd, July 13, 1946 – April 2, 1992 – Podgorica
===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* Titov Drvar, 1981–1991 – Drvar, Canton 10, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
===Croatia===
* Titova Korenica, December 5, 1945 – February 7, 1997 – Korenica
===Serbia===
* Titovo Užice, 1946–1992 – Užice
* Titov Vrbas, 1983–1992 – Vrbas, Vojvodina
* Titova Mitrovica, 1981–1992 – Kosovska Mitrovica

===Slovenia===
* Titovo Velenje, October 10, 1981 – July 17, 1990 – Velenje
===North Macedonia===
* Titov Veles, 1946–1996 – Veles
With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, each city was renamed.

==Streets and squares==

Many towns in the countries of former Yugoslavia and in other countries have streets and squares named after him.

===Slovenia===
* Ilirska Bistrica: Trg Maršala Tita (main square)
* Jesenice: Cesta Maršala Tita
* Koper: Titov trg (main square)
* Logatec: Titova ulica
* Ljubljana: Titova cesta (renamed to Slovenska cesta (Slovenian Avenue) in 1991); Titova cesta, a section of Štajerska cesta named after Tito in 2009. After Tito street decision in Slovenia renamed to Štajerska cesta.
* Maribor: Titova cesta (main street), Titov most (Tito&#x27;s Bridge)
* Postojna: Titov trg (main square), Titova cesta
* Radeče: Titova ulica
* Radenci: Titova cesta
* Senovo: Titova cesta
* Slovenska Bistrica: Titova cesta
* Tolmin: Trg Maršala Tita (main square)
* Velenje: Titov trg (main square with highest Tito&#x27;s statue in the world)

In 2011, 2 years after a street in Ljubljana was named after Tito, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia ruled that naming of a new street after Josip Broz Tito was unconstitutional. The court unanimously ruled that Tito symbolizes severe human rights violations, and that naming the street after him glorifies totalitarian regime and violates human dignity. In 2020, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia allowed a referendum against the renaming of Tito&#x27;s street in Radenci. In contrast to the decision about the street in Ljubljana, the street in Radenci had been named after Tito more than 40 years ago; the court rejected the mayor&#x27;s claim that a referendum to keep the name would violate the constitution.

<doc id="600302" wikidata="Q7314243" url="?curid=600302" title="Representative Party of Alberta">
<text>The Representative Party of Alberta (first registered as the Political Alternative Association, and known as the Alternative Government Movement prior to registration in 1984) was a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, formed by former Alberta Social Credit Party parliamentary leader Raymond Speaker in 1984. The party was populist and conservative in ideology, and was considered a modern version of the Canadian social credit movement without the social credit monetary reform policy.

==History==
===Foundation===
Prior to the 1982 Alberta provincial election, Speaker and another longtime Alberta Social Credit Party Socred MLA, Walt Buck, left the party and ran as Independents due to a collapse of their party and problems with organisation and leadership. The two MLAs were successfully returned as Independents to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. After election they tried to form the official opposition over but were denied by the Speaker of the Assembly who gave the two-member Alberta New Democratic Party the official opposition status.

After being denied party funding, Speaker and Buck floated the idea for a new political party in 1982.

The two MLAs set about trying to create a new party which began taking root in the spring of 1984. They began holding meetings across the province which they promoted under the name Alternate Government Movement. The party also hired Preston Manning as a political consultant to present draft policies at its founding meetings.

The founding convention for the party was held on 23 and 24 November in Red Deer. The party selected a board of directors and elected Ray Speaker as leader by acclamation. It also selected the name Representative Party of Alberta from four options. The other three options were United Party, Free Democratic Party and the Free Citizens Alliance Party. The paperwork submitted to Elections Alberta and petitions of registration that had started before the convention were under the Political Alternative Association name. The party planned to submit a request to change the name as soon as registration was accepted by Elections Alberta. On 7 January 1985 Elections Alberta accepted the petition after it collected the signatures of over 4500 Alberta electors.

===Collapse of the Alberta Political Alliance===
In 1985, the Social Credit Party, the Western Canada Concept and the Heritage Party of Alberta began a merger movement that resulted in the Alberta Alliance Political Association.

The merger was short-lived and broke apart, collapsing the parties involved. Many candidates and supporters moved to support the Representative Party which became the primary right-wing alternative party for that election.

===1986 provincial election===
In the 1986 provincial election, the Representative Party ran 46 candidates in Alberta’s 83 ridings, but only its two founding MLAs were elected. The party received 36,656 votes, or 5.1% of the popular vote.

===The final years of the party===
After marginal success of the party in the 1986 election, Walt Buck retired and Raymond Speaker ended up crossing the floor to the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party. The Representative Party remained registered but did not run candidates in the 1989 election.
It was disbanded a short time later

<doc id="600309" wikidata="Q103850" url="?curid=600309" title="Arsenyev">
<text>Arsenyev () is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located about northeast of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 56,750. It was known as &quot;Semyonovka&quot; until 1952.

==History==
The history of Arsenyev begins in 1895, when the settlement of Semyonovka () was founded. The first settlement dwellers were the Old Believers. In 1901, migrant peasants from what is now Poltava Oblast, Ukraine settled here. In 1937, the settlement was connected to the Trans-Siberian Railway by a branch-line. In 1940, the first aviation plant in the Russian Far East, which is now called &quot;Progress Arsenyev Aircraft Works&quot;, was built in Semyonovka. In 1952, Semyonovka was granted town status and renamed Arsenyev, after Vladimir Arsenyev, an explorer of the Far East, a scientist, a traveler, and a writer, who visited Semyonovka in 1912.

During the Cold War, an air base existed northeast of Arsenyev at Varfolomeyevka.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Arsenyev Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Arsenyev Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Arsenyevsky Urban Okrug.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Arsenyev has a dry-winter warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dwb), bordering on a dry-winter hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dwa).

The climate of the town is characterized by a great contrast between summer and winter temperatures in comparison with the coastal Primorye. The average temperature in January is . The average temperature in July is . The absolute low recorded was , record high was . Spring is characterized by an increase of in the average daily temperature from March through April. The annual precipitation is ; the annual humidity is 71%. The soil freezes as deep as 

===Nature===
Large clay deposits that are used by the local plant of construction materials are found in the town&#x27;s vicinity. There are granite and basalt beds within distance from the town. The suburban flora includes Japanese Yew (&quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot;), Amur Velvet, Manchurian Walnut (&quot;Juglans mandschurica&quot;), Ermann&#x27;s Birch (&quot;Betula ermannii&quot;), &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot;, Lotus (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, a rare and very beautiful water-plant that can be found in several small lakes twelve kilometers from Arsenyev). There is a variety of fauna species in the area, including mammals, birds, and insects characteristic of Primorye. The tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;), wildcat (&quot;Felis&quot; spp.), mandarin duck (&quot;Aix galericulata&quot;), several species of unique butterflies including &quot;Catocala&quot; and species of Noctuid moth can be found.

There is much snow during winter in Arsenyev, and this creates perfect conditions for skiing around the town. Arsenyev is surrounded by an almost untouched Ussuri taiga. The ecological situation in Arsenyev is more favorable in comparison with other cities and towns of the krai, due to the absence of polluting enterprises in the town and its suburbs.

==Economy==
As of 1999, the economy of the town is dominated by state enterprises. The proportion of their employees comprises two-thirds of able-bodied population. Other industries employ an additional 12,000 people. There are about 4,000 unemployed in Arsenyev. The largest enterprise of the town are &quot;Askold Shipbuilding Plant&quot; and &quot;Progress&quot;, producing generally products for defense. At present the volume of the output has been lowered due to the reduction of demand for military products. The high prices of raw materials have led to a halt in the production of umbrellas, furniture, and baby prams, that were by-products of &quot;Askold&quot; and &quot;Progress&quot;. All of this constitutes a threat to unemployment to most of the town population, which has been employed by these two plants. One possible solution to the problem is exporting military helicopters of &quot;Progress Stock Company&quot;, which have received worldwide approval. Due to the highly technical industries located there, Arsenyev is characterized by a larger proportion of specialists with higher education compared with other cities of the Krai.

==Tourism==
Arsenyev is situated between the Blue and Eastern-Blue Ranges of the Sikhote-Alin, on the right bank of the Arsenyevka river (the Ussuri&#x27;s tributary). The river is 294 km (200 mi) long. The valley of the Arsenyevka river is wide. The river is the source of water for the town and for the rice plantations of the adjacent Anuchinsky District. In 1954, a dam was constructed on the Dachnaya River (the Arsenyevka&#x27;s tributary). It is located in the center of Arsenyev, forming a pool with fountains. The town park is adjacent to it. This is the favorite recreation place of the town&#x27;s residents. The water reservoir for the town is located on the upper reaches of the Dachnaya river. The town of Arsenyev is built on flat land.

Arsenyev is an attraction primarily for lovers of mountain-skiing. There is a mountain-skiing base in Arsenyev. There is much snow in the Arsenyev area in winter. The mountain normally used for mountain skiers is from the town and rises as high as above sea level. Training for mountain-skiing beginners is available. Tourists are welcome on week-ends. You can stop at the &quot;Salyut&quot; recreation center at the foot of the mountain.

===Sightseeing===
There is a monument to Maxim Gorky, founded in 1958 in the public garden on Gorky Avenue.

The Uvalnaya Hill displays the monument to Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev and his guide gol&#x27;d Dersu Uzala, built in 1972 by donations from Arsenyev&#x27;s residents.

In the area surrounding Arsenyev there are also many archaeological and natural monuments, acquainting visitors with the culture of the ancient tribes inhabiting these lands, with relics and endemic plants and animals.

Arsenyev&#x27;s History Museum was opened in 1969. Over 40,000 exhibits are displayed, including the personal belongings of the first dwellers of Semyonovka, a collection of butterflies found in Central Primorye, ethnographic and archaeological collections. The museum attracts about 35,000 people a year.

<text>Tiveden is a long and wide densely forested rocky ridge in Sweden, throughout history notorious for its wilderness and dangers; historically a hiding place for outlaws. In historic times it, along with Tylöskog and Kolmården, formed the border between the land of the Swedes and the land of the Geats.

Within it, the Tiveden National Park has a designated area of , a comparatively small and arguably the most inaccessible part of the forest. It was established in 1983, and administratively belongs to the municipalities of Karlsborg and Laxå.

== History ==

The name is very old and disputed. -&quot;Ved&quot; is cognate to English &quot;Wood&quot; and the first part of its name, &quot;Ti&quot;-, either means &quot;god&quot; or refers to the god Týr, both descendants of the word meaning “god”. Tiveden separates Närke from Västergötland, and was formerly a frontier between the Geats and the Swedes.

The national park area has never been inhabited, but there are several ancient remains of human activities such as worshipping grounds and sacrificial sites.

== Geography ==

The forest has small lakes with red waterlilies. When they were discovered they provided the European varieties of red waterlilies that are in cultivation. The folklore tale of how this became goes as follows:

The animal life is scarce, but the forest houses a substantial population of western capercaillie. Nowadays there are small populations of wolves, lynxes and wolverines in Tiveden. Bears have also been sighted.

<doc id="600320" wikidata="Q270599" url="?curid=600320" title="Scream 2">
<text>Scream 2 is a 1997 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Jada Pinkett and Liev Schreiber. A sequel to &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), the film was released on December 12, 1997, by Dimension Films as the second installment in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series. &quot;Scream 2&quot; follows the character of Sidney Prescott (Campbell), and the other survivors of the Woodsboro massacre, at the fictional Windsor College in Ohio where they are targeted by a copycat killer using the identity of Ghostface. Like its predecessor, &quot;Scream 2&quot; combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of comedy, satire and &quot;whodunit&quot; mystery while satirizing the cliché of film sequels.

Williamson provided a five-page outline for a sequel to &quot;Scream&quot; when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise. Following a successful test screening of &quot;Scream&quot; and the film&#x27;s financial and critical success, Dimension moved forward with the sequel while &quot;Scream&quot; was still in theaters, with the principal cast all returning to star, Craven to direct and Beltrami to provide music. The film faced controversy following its significant issues with plot information leaking onto the Internet, revealing the identity of the killers. Combined with the film&#x27;s rushed schedule, the script was rewritten often; pages were sometimes completed on the day of filming.

Despite these issues, &quot;Scream 2&quot; earned $172million at the box office, only $683,362 less than &quot;Scream&quot;, and received positive reviews from critics. Beltrami received positive critical reception for his score for evolving the musical themes of the characters created in &quot;Scream&quot;, although some critics claimed that the most memorable pieces from the film were created by composers Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. Elfman&#x27;s contribution had been specially written for the film, but Zimmer&#x27;s score for &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996) was controversially used in the film, replacing Beltrami&#x27;s own work. The film&#x27;s soundtrack achieved moderate sales success, reaching number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A sequel, &quot;Scream 3&quot;, was released on February 3, 2000.

== Plot ==
Two Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens, attend a sneak preview of &quot;Stab&quot;, a film based on the events of the Woodsboro massacre. Briefly exiting the theater to use the restroom, Phil is killed by an individual donning a Ghostface costume, who proceeds to sit beside Maureen in Phil&#x27;s place. The killer then stabs her repeatedly, unnoticed by the raucous crowd, leading her to climb up on stage in a cry for help, which the audience mistakes for a publicity stunt until she falls dead.

The news media, including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott is a student alongside her roommate Hallie McDaniel, her new boyfriend Derek Feldman, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy Meeks and Derek&#x27;s best friend Mickey Altieri. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive: police deputy Dewey Riley to offer Sidney protection, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the incident. Gale and her new cameraman, Joel Jones, unsuccessfully try to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the rape and murder of Sidney&#x27;s mother, Maureen Prescott.

That evening, Sidney and Hallie attend a party at the sorority house Delta Lambda Zeta. At Omega Beta Zeta, another nearby sorority house, Ghostface murders student Cici Cooper. After the partygoers leave to observe Cici&#x27;s crime scene, Ghostface enters Delta Lambda Zeta and attacks Sidney. Ghostface injures Derek but flees when the police arrive. Later, after realizing that Cici is a diminutive for Casey Becker, Gale theorizes that the new Ghostface is targeting students with the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims. Randy theorizes that the killer is likely someone Sidney knows and is patterning the homicides after a movie sequel. Soon after, Ghostface calls Gale, Dewey, and Randy while they are together in daylight on the college campus. Despite their attempts to find him, Ghostface ultimately ambushes Randy, pulling him into Joel&#x27;s media van, where he is murdered. Shortly after, Joel, fearing he will be targeted next, skips town.

As night falls over the campus, Dewey and Gale go to a building to review tapes of footage shot by Joel, hoping to spot the killer in the vicinity of the previous crime scenes, but Ghostface attacks them, stabbing Dewey. Two officers driving Sidney and Hallie to a safe house are murdered when Ghostface intercepts the vehicle. In the ensuing struggle, Ghostface is knocked unconscious, but recovers and kills Hallie. Drawn to music playing in the campus theatre while seeking safety, Sidney finds Derek in the auditorium tied to a cross from an earlier fraternity hazing ritual. Ghostface arrives, revealing himself as Mickey, and shoots Derek, killing him.

Mickey divulges his intent to kill Sidney and allow his arrest, in an effort to blame movie violence for the murders. Debbie arrives, holding Gale at gunpoint, and is revealed to be Mickey&#x27;s accomplice, whom Sidney recognizes as Nancy Loomis, the mother of Woodsboro killer Billy. Nancy betrays Mickey and shoots him, affirming that she only used Mickey to frame him for their killing spree. Mickey fires his gun before collapsing, wounding Gale, who falls offstage. Nancy discloses she is seeking revenge against Sidney for killing Billy and that she murdered Randy in Joel&#x27;s news van for slandering her son&#x27;s name. However, Sidney points out the hypocrisy of Nancy&#x27;s motives, considering that her abandonment fueled Billy&#x27;s psychotic tendencies. The pair fight until Cotton appears and holds them at gunpoint. Nancy attempts to manipulate Cotton into murdering Sidney, reminding him that her testimony got him arrested. Much to Nancy&#x27;s shock, he instead chooses to shoot her in exchange for an interview with Sidney and Diane Sawyer. As Sidney, Cotton, and a recovered Gale glance over Nancy&#x27;s body, Mickey suddenly resurfaces but is shot to death by Gale and Sidney. Sidney then shoots Nancy in the head to ensure her death.

When the police arrive, Dewey is revealed to be alive and Gale climbs into the ambulance with him rather than taking the opportunity to report to the returning Joel. Sidney then instructs the press to direct questions to Cotton to remove attention from herself and reward Cotton for helping her.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
While writing the script for &quot;Scream&quot;, Williamson also developed two five-page treatments for potential sequels. Following the release of &quot;Scream&quot;, Williamson would confirm that he had considered a sequel concept where the character of Sidney Prescott would now be attending college and a copycat Ghostface killer would start a new series of murders. Dimension Films agreed to pursue the sequel in March 1997, by which point Williamson already had forty-two pages of the plot developed which involved four different killers, Derek, Hallie, Cotton Weary, and Nancy Loomis, who is the mother of one of the previous film&#x27;s killers. By July 1997, filming began on &quot;Scream 2&quot; but after Williamson transferred his script to the production it was leaked onto the Internet in full, revealing the identity of the killers and a large amount of the involved plot. This resulted in the production continuing to film with only a partial script while Williamson conducted extensive rewrites, changing much of the film&#x27;s finale, the identities of the film&#x27;s killers and drastically altering the roles of other characters such as Randy Meeks and Joel.

To avoid another such incident and prevent sensitive plot details being revealed through other means, the actors were not given the last pages of the script until weeks before shooting and the pages that revealed the killer&#x27;s identity were only provided on the day the scene was shot to the actors involved. The short production schedule on &quot;Scream 2&quot; and his work on other projects meant that Williamson&#x27;s final script used for the film was detailed in some areas but lacking in others, with Wes Craven forced to write and develop certain scenes as they were being filmed.

The incident was the first in which a film was significantly affected by an Internet leak. In 2017, Williamson claimed the leaked script was a &quot;dummy draft&quot; that was crafted specifically to avoid leaked details. Williamson claimed there were three dummy endings written.

=== Development ===
Williamson had been contracted for two potential sequels to &quot;Scream&quot; when selling the script for the original, based on five-page proposals he attached to the script, hoping to entice prospective buyers with the fact that they were not just buying a film but a franchise, and after a successful test screening for the original, at which Miramax executives were present, Craven was also given a contract to direct the two future films. Dimension Films considered pursuing development of a sequel in January 1997 after &quot;Scream&quot; proceeded to gross more than $50million in the first month of its release, with production being greenlit in March 1997 and an increased budget of $24million over &quot;Scream&quot;″s $15million.

The production of the film suffered a significant setback when the script was leaked, revealing plot details including the identity of the killers, resulting in the script being modified to change many details. In an interview, Craven commented on the rushed six-month production schedule, with the film being expected ready for release on December 12, less than a year after the release of &quot;Scream&quot;, and Williamson forced to rewrite his script, pages for scenes would often only be ready on the day of filming and others lacked significant detail that forced Craven to develop them as the scenes took place. Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the film&#x27;s production, including &quot;Scream Again&quot;, &quot;Scream Louder&quot; and &quot;Scream: The Sequel&quot; before the studio decided to simply use &quot;Scream 2&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Neve Campbell had been contracted to reprise her role as heroine Sidney Prescott in a potential sequel before filming had even begun on &quot;Scream&quot;, her character being the only one from the original film guaranteed to survive and lead a new film. Once production of a sequel was seen as inevitable, following the success of &quot;Scream&quot;, Dimension Films added sequel options for the actors whose characters had survived the previous film: Courteney Cox as ambitious news reporter Gale Weathers, David Arquette as retired deputy sheriff Dewey Riley, Jamie Kennedy as film-geek Randy Meeks and Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man exonerated for the murder of Sidney&#x27;s mother. Roger L. Jackson also returned to voice the character of Ghostface.

Having finalized the returning principal cast from &quot;Scream&quot;, the production approached their casting for &quot;Scream 2&quot; in a similar manner, seeking established and popular actors, largely sourcing from TV shows of the time. In interviews, the production staff of the film remarked that they found approaching and securing the talent they wanted significantly easier than it had been for &quot;Scream&quot;, considering the financial and critical success of the film but also believing the prior involvement of Drew Barrymore had lent the horror genre an element of credibility which made serious actors eager to become involved.

New cast included Sarah Michelle Gellar as sorority sister and film fan Cici Cooper, Elise Neal as Sidney&#x27;s friend and roommate Hallie, Jerry O&#x27;Connell as Sidney&#x27;s boyfriend Derek, Timothy Olyphant as Mickey and Laurie Metcalf as local reporter Debbie Salt, later revealed as Nancy Loomis, mother of Billy Loomis from &quot;Scream&quot;. Early in development, Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler were approached to appear in the film&#x27;s opening sequence, while Eric Mabius, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Paula Marshall all auditioned for unspecified roles. According to Jamie Kennedy, Tobey Maguire was offered the role of Mickey, but he turned it down. Many of the actors involved in the production, including Campbell, Cox, Gellar, and O&#x27;Connell were starring in their own television series at the time, allowing the production limited availability to schedule their involvement. Gellar in particular was in-between filming of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and had only recently finished work on another Williamson-penned film, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997). Despite the hectic scheduling, Gellar admitted in an interview that she agreed to perform in &quot;Scream 2&quot; without having read the script because of the success of &quot;Scream&quot;. Metcalf had only just finished her nine-year run on the popular sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; when she began work on &quot;Scream 2&quot; and Craven was praising of her ability to portray the deranged Nancy Loomis. To obtain the role of Derek, O&#x27;Connell and other candidates had to audition by performing a scene from the film where the character sings &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;. Olyphant&#x27;s involvement as Mickey was his first leading role in a feature film. Despite scheduling difficulties, Craven took their desire to participate in the film despite their workload as a compliment to the film&#x27;s quality.

The cast was rounded out by Lewis Arquette, father of David Arquette, as a local Sheriff in charge of investigating the new murders, Duane Martin as Gale&#x27;s cameraman Joel, Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps as Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens, patrons of the fictional &quot;Stab&quot; film who become the film&#x27;s opening victims, and Portia de Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart as sorority sisters Murphy and Lois. Gayheart had auditioned for the role of Tatum Riley in &quot;Scream&quot; and auditioned multiple times for &quot;Scream 2&quot; for the roles of Cici Cooper, Hallie and Maureen Evans before obtaining her eventual role. Minor roles were filled by Chris Doyle and Philip Pavel as Officer Richards and Officer Andrews, assigned to protect Sidney, veteran actor David Warner as Sidney&#x27;s drama teacher, Joshua Jackson as an unnamed film student, and Nancy O&#x27;Dell as an unnamed reporter who would reprise the role in future installments of the series. Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson and Heather Graham played themselves as characters in the &quot;Stab&quot; films; credited as Stab Sidney, Stab Billy and Stab Casey respectively. Spelling was cast based on a sarcastic remark by Campbell&#x27;s character in &quot;Scream&quot; that she would be played by Spelling in a movie based on her life. Craven remarked that she was a &quot;good sport&quot; about the joke and happy to take part.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Scream 2&quot; took place over a nine-week period beginning in mid-June 1997 and on a budget of $24million. Atlanta, Georgia and Los Angeles were used to represent the state of Ohio, where the fictional Windsor College is situated in &quot;Scream 2&quot;, with filming taking place largely in Los Angeles and over four weeks in Atlanta. The opening scene featuring the premiere of the fictional &quot;Stab&quot; film was filmed over three days in the Vista theater on Sunset Drive, Hollywood, the exterior represented by the Rialto theater in South Pasadena, California. Due to the large number of extras present in the scene, full details of what occurred were leaked onto the Internet shortly after filming completed which Craven cited as the production&#x27;s first experience of a major plot leak. The sorority homes used by the character Cici Cooper and a nearby party were also filmed in Pasadena, east of Los Angeles. The fictional &quot;Stab&quot; film was filmed in Malibu, California. Agnes Scott College, just outside Atlanta, and UCLA in Los Angeles were used to represent the fictional Windsor College which appears in the film.

Following a script leak early into filming, security around the production was significantly increased, with a focus on closed film sets and strict restrictions on what personnel could be present during filming and have access to the script, with all present required to sign non-disclosure agreements. The script itself was reprinted on specialty paper to prevent photocopying and was often destroyed after use.

=== Post-production ===
Craven had difficulties passing &quot;Scream&quot; through the film-rating body MPAA to receive an R-rating to help the film remain commercially viable, sending eight different cuts and requiring the direct intervention of Dimension Films founder Bob Weinstein to eventually obtain the necessary rating to release the film without significant cuts.

Eager to avoid the same experience on &quot;Scream 2&quot;, Craven attempted to manipulate the MPAA by sending them a version of the film that had been edited to focus on and enhance the gore and violence present beyond what they actually wanted in the film, including reusing a clip of Omar Epps&#x27; character Phil Stevens being stabbed in the ear three times, instead of only once as seen in the final film, and an extended scene of Randy Meeks&#x27; death that showed his throat being slashed. Craven&#x27;s reasoning was that the parts of the film they wished to keep would be more acceptable when viewed with the enhanced violence and so the MPAA would force them to remove the footage they already did not want to keep while passing the content they did want. However, the MPAA granted &quot;Scream 2&quot; an R-rating for the more violent cut, as they believed the underlying message of the film was significant enough to warrant the violence.

=== Music ===

Marco Beltrami returned to helm the score for &quot;Scream 2&quot;, though there would be a late inclusion by Danny Elfman in the form of the choral track &quot;Cassandra Aria&quot; which plays during a scene where Campbell&#x27;s character performs in a play and again in the film&#x27;s finale as &quot;Cassandra Aria Reprise&quot;. Excerpts from the score of the 1996 film &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; by Hans Zimmer appeared in the film, in particular guitar work by Duane Eddy, for the character Dewey, replacing the tracks that had been developed for the character from the original &quot;Scream&quot; score. Beltrami would explain in an interview that the Zimmer piece was used as a placeholder for Beltrami&#x27;s incomplete score during a test screening. The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio to keep the Zimmer piece, reducing &quot;Dewey&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which Beltrami had composed to fill its place, to minor use during more serious scenes involving the character. In 1998, Varèse Sarabande released a 30-minute album with music from &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot;, and in 2016 &quot;Scream 2: The Deluxe Edition&quot; was released including the Elfman material and the complete Beltrami score.

== Release ==
&quot;Scream 2&quot; held its premiere on December 10, 1997, at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Hollywood, followed by a general release on December 12, 1997, less than a year after the release of &quot;Scream&quot;. After the unexpected success of &quot;Scream&quot;, by late 1997, &quot;Scream 2&quot; was considered such a potential box office success that the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and James Cameron&#x27;s future hit &quot;Titanic&quot; were moved from their release date of December 12 to 19, so as to not face the film as competition.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Scream 2&quot; opened in 2,663 theaters and took $32.9million on its opening weekend in box-office receipts, a $27million increase over &quot;Scream&quot;. It went on to gross $101.4million in the United States and $71million in other territories with a worldwide lifetime gross of $172.4million. Its debut set the December opening weekend record until December 2000, being replaced by &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000). It also achieved the highest December weekend gross for two weeks until it was overtaken by &quot;Titanic&quot;. &quot;Scream 2&quot; enjoyed financial success on par with &quot;Scream&quot; despite its rapid production time and issues with script rewrites, nearly matching the first film&#x27;s total gross of $173million. &quot;Scream 2&quot; is currently the third highest-grossing film in the slasher genre, again behind &quot;Scream&quot;. &quot;Scream 2&quot; was the 21st highest-grossing film of 1997 despite competition from blockbuster films such as &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Men in Black&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;As with the first film, &quot;Scream 2&quot; is a gleeful takedown of scary movie conventions that manages to poke fun at terrible horror sequels without falling victim to the same fate.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Both Gene Siskel and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to &quot;Scream&quot;; Maslin remarked: &quot;&quot;Scream 2&quot; almost works as straight satire. It&#x27;s so sharp—pardon the expression—that no pretty young things absolutely had to die.&quot; Roger Ebert stated the film was &quot;about as good as the original&quot; but lamented that &quot;[&quot;Scream 2&quot;] is gorier than the original, and that distracts from the witty screenplay.&quot; &quot;Time Out London&quot; was mixed in its response, calling the film superior to most other horror films, but poor in comparison to &quot;Scream&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot;, scathing of &quot;Scream&quot; before its release, positively received the sequel, saying &quot;[characters] ponder whether any sequel ever topped the original. &quot;Scream 2&quot; is certainly worthy of being part of that debate.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s Kim Newman echoed this sentiment saying &quot;Some great comic—and terrifying—moments, but suffers for not being as original as the original&quot; remarking that though the film had the same elements that made &quot;Scream&quot; a success, they were no longer surprising for having been in &quot;Scream&quot;.

There was, however, criticism over the death of the character Randy Meeks played by Kennedy. John Muir, author of &quot;Wes Craven: The Art of Horror&quot; called the character&#x27;s death the &quot;most devastating moment of the sequel&quot; and a &quot;bad call&quot;, but praised the development of the other surviving characters from &quot;Scream&quot;, calling Cox, Arquette and Campbell&#x27;s characters &quot;beloved&quot;. In contrast, Muir criticized all of the new characters in &quot;Scream 2&quot;, believing they never attained the same depth of the &quot;Scream&quot; cast because of &quot;Scream 2&quot;″s focus on increasing the body count and violence over the original, saying that the film&#x27;s killer could literally be anyone, as the audience is never provided with enough information about the new characters to form an opinion about them. Ebert also commented upon this, saying &quot;there is no way to guess who&#x27;s doing the killing, and everyone who seems suspicious is (almost) sure to be innocent&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Scream 2&quot; won few awards compared to its predecessor, with Campbell again receiving the most nominations and wins, having won two awards for &quot;Scream&quot;. She received a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination and went on to win a Best Female Performance. Despite having only a brief cameo appearance as &quot;Sidney Prescott&quot; in the film within a film &quot;Stab&quot; shown in &quot;Scream 2&quot;, Tori Spelling became one of the nominees for a 1997 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star, which was tied with her role in &quot;The House of Yes&quot;. The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress for Courteney Cox and Best Horror Film for &quot;Scream 2&quot; itself.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Scream 2&quot; was released in US territories on VHS on December 1, 1998, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (distributed in Canada by Alliance Atlantis). &quot;Scream 2&quot; was released on DVD for the first time in the US on July 22, 1998 with a Collector&#x27;s Edition following on September 26, 2000, in &quot;The Ultimate Scream Collection&quot; and a separate release on August 7, 2001. The Collector&#x27;s Edition featured additional material including outtakes, deleted scenes, the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer, music videos of songs featured in the film and director&#x27;s commentary. Both releases were undertaken by Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Following the release of then series finale &quot;Scream 3&quot;, the three films were collected in &quot;The Ultimate Scream Collection&quot; by Dimension Films on September 26, 2000, in a box set containing &quot;Behind the Scream&quot;, a short documentary about the production of the three films and additional material including screen tests of actors involved in the films, outtakes and deleted scenes.

&quot;Scream 2&quot; remained unreleased in foreign territories including Europe and Japan until February 26, 2001, when it was released simultaneously with &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 3&quot; by Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Each film contained the additional content found in the Collector&#x27;s Edition version of the US release, including deleted scenes, outtakes, theatrical trailers, music videos and commentary from each respective film&#x27;s crew. Additionally, the three films were collected together in a single pack as the &quot;&quot;Scream&quot; Trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Scream 2&quot; was released individually and in a collection with &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 3&quot; on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, two weeks prior to the theatrical release of &quot;Scream 4&quot;, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. In addition to the films, each release contained audio commentary, theatrical trailers and behind-the-scenes footage. The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 4, 2022, by Paramount Home Entertainment.

<text>George Stanley Faber (often written G. S. Faber; 25 October 1773 – 27 January 1854) was an Anglican theologian and prolific author.

He was a typologist, who believed that all the world&#x27;s myths were corrupted versions of the original stories in the Bible, and an advocate of Day-Age Theory. He was a contemporary of John Nelson Darby. Faber&#x27;s writings had an influence on Historicism and Dispensationalism.

==Life==

Faber, eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Faber, vicar of Calverley, Yorkshire, by Anne, daughter of the Rev. David Traviss, was born at Calverley parsonage on 25 October 1773, and educated at Hipperholme Grammar School, near Halifax, where he remained until he went to Oxford. On 10 June 1789 he matriculated from University College, being then only in his sixteenth year; he was elected a scholar on 25 March following, and took his B.A. degree when in his twentieth year. On 3 July 1793 he was elected a fellow and tutor of Lincoln College. He proceeded M.A. 1796 and B.D. 1803, served the office of proctor in 1801, and in the same year as Bampton lecturer preached a discourse, which he published under the title of &quot;Horæ Mosaicæ&quot;.

By his marriage, 31 May 1803, with Eliza Sophia, younger daughter of Major John Scott-Waring of Ince, Cheshire, he vacated his fellowship, and for the next two years acted as his father&#x27;s curate at Calverley. In 1805 he was collated by Bishop Barrington to the vicarage of Stockton-on-Tees, which he resigned three years afterwards for the rectory of Redmarshall, also in Durham, and in 1811 he was presented by the same prelate to the rectory of Longnewton, in the same county, where he remained twenty-one years. Bishop Burgess collated him to a prebendal stall in Salisbury Cathedral in 1830, and Bishop van Mildert gave him the mastership of Sherburn Hospital in 1832, when he resigned the rectory of Longnewton. At Sherburn he devoted a very considerable part of his income to the permanent improvement of the hospital estates, and at his death left the buildings and the farms in perfect condition.

His nephew Frederick William Faber converted to Catholicism and also became a well known theologian and author.

==Views and work==

Throughout his career he strenuously advocated the evangelical doctrines of the necessity of conversion, justification by faith, and the sole authority of scripture as the rule of faith. By this conduct, as well as by his able writings, he obtained the friendship of Bishop Burgess, Bishop van Mildert, Bishop Barrington, the Marquis of Bath, Lord Bexley, and Dr. Routh.

His work on &quot;The Origin of Pagan Idolatry&quot;, 1816, considers that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were only deified men. This began at the Tower of Babel, and the triads of supreme gods among the heathens represent the three sons of Noah. He also wrote on the &quot;Arkite Egg&quot;’ and some of his views on this subject may likewise be found in his &quot;Bampton Lectures&quot;. His treatises on the Revelation and on the Seven Vials belong to the older school of prophetic interpretation, and the restoration of the French empire under Napoleon III was brought into his scheme.

His books on the primitive doctrines of election and justification retain some importance. He laid stress on the evangelical view of these doctrines in opposition to the opinion of contemporary writers of very different schools, such as Vicesimus Knox and Joseph Milner. His works show some research and careful writing. He died at Sherburn Hospital, near Durham, 27 January 1854, and was buried in the chapel of the hospital on 1 February. His wife died at Sherburn House 28 November 1851, aged 75.

<text>The Naqshbandi order () is a Sufi order of Sunni Islam named after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband. Naqshbandis trace their (chain of succession) to Muhammad through the first caliph Abu Bakr () by way of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. The Naqshbandi Sufi order is most distinguished from other Sunni Sufi orders by the high level of importance they assign to the Sharia, highlighted by major Naqshbandi scholars such as Ahmad Sirhindi and Shah Waliullah Dehlawi.

== History ==
The order is also known as the &quot;convergence of the two oceans&quot; due to the presence of Abu Bakr and Jafar al-Sadiq in the &quot;silsila&quot; and the &quot;Sufi Order of Jafar al-Sadiq&quot;. The Naqshbandi order owes many insights to Yusuf Hamadani and Abdul Khaliq Ghijduwani in the 12th century, the latter of whom is regarded as the organizer of the practices and is responsible for placing stress upon the purely silent remembrance of Allah. It was later associated with Baha al-Din Shah Naqshband in the 14th century, hence the name of the order.

Since it was founded the Naqshbandi order has split into multiple sub-orders founded by several prominent figures within the chain of succession. &#x27;Ubeydullah Ahrar founded the Naqshbandiyya Ahrariyya; Ahmad Sirhindi founded the Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya; Shamsuddin Mirza Mazhar founded the Naqshbandiyya Mazhariyya; and Mawlana Khalid founded the Naqshbandiyya Khalidiyya.

=== South Asia ===

The Naqshbandiyya order became an influential factor in Indian Muslim life, and for two centuries it was the most common Sufi order in the Indian subcontinent. Khwaja Baqi Billah, who was born in Kabul and brought up and educated in Kabul and Samarkand, is credited for bringing the order to India during the end of the 16th century. He tried to spread his knowledge about the order but died three years later. His disciple Ahmad Sirhindi took over after his death, and it was through him that the order gained popularity within a short period of time. Shah Waliullah Dehlawi was an 18th-century member of the order.

===Syria===
The Naqshbandiyya order was introduced into Syria at the end of the 17th century by Murad Ali al-Bukhari, who established himself in Damascus and traveled throughout Arabia. His branch became known as the Muradiyya and was led by his descendants. In 1820, Khalid Shahrazuri rose as a prominent Naqshbandi leader in the Ottoman world and his order became known as the Khalidiyya which spread for at least two decades. In Syria and Lebanon, the leaders of every active Naqshbandiyya group acknowledged its spiritual lineage. Later, a strife between Khalid&#x27;s khalifas led to disruption of the order and it divide. The Farmadiyya branch, which practices silent and vocal invocation, is still present in Lebanon and is named after Ali-Farmadi. The pre-Mujaddidi line of the Naqshbandiyya in Greater Syria came to an end when political leader Musa Bukhar died in 1973. The only branch to have survived till recently is the one based in the Khanqah al-Uzbakiyya in Jerusalem.

===Egypt===
The Naqshbandi order rose to prominence in Egypt during the 19th century. A major khanqah was constructed in 1851 by Abbas I as a favor to the Naqshbandi sheikh Ahmad Ashiq, who led the order until his death in 1883. Ahmad Ashiq practiced the Diya&#x27;iyya branch of the Khalidiyya. Two other versions of Naqshbandiyya spread in Egypt in the last decades of the 19th century: the Judiyya, led by sheikh Juda Ibrahim, and the Khalidiyya, led by Sudanese al-Sharif Isma&#x27;il al-Sinnari and his successors. These branches continued to grow and are still active today. None of the early orders survived far into the 20th century however, and all khanqahs in Egypt were closed in 1954 when the buildings were either assigned a different function or demolished.

===Southeast Asia===
The first known Naqshbandi murshid in Malay Archipelago was Yusuf al-Makassari, a 17th century Islamic scholar who also introduced Khalwatiyya to the region. However, the order quickly disappeared before being introduced again in the 19th century. There are two well known branches of Naqshbandiyya in Southeast Asia. The first one is Khalidiyya, introduced by Ismail al-Minankabawi, a disciple of Abdullah al-Arzinjani in Mecca, and spread across Sumatra, Java, and Malay Peninsula. PERTI, an Indonesian Islamic organization from Minangkabau Highlands, was founded by Sulaiman ar-Rasuli and other Khalidi clerics. The other branch is Mazhariyya, named after Shamsuddin Mazhar, a Naqshbandi branch through Abu Said al-Ahmadi, one of Abdullah Dehlawi&#x27;s khalifas. Mazhariyya is the main Naqshbandi branch in Madura, brought by Abdul Azim al-Maduri after studying in Mecca. Another related order is Qadiriyya wa Naqshbandiyya, a fusion of Qadiriyya and Naqshbandiyya, whose sheikhs in Banten and Lombok led rebellions against the Dutch East Indies at the end of the 19th century.

===China===

Ma Laichi brought the Naqshbandi () order to China, creating the Khufiyya () Hua Si Sufi ; (&quot;Multicolored Mosque&quot;) menhuan. Ma Mingxin, also brought the Naqshbandi order, creating the Jahriyya () menhuan. These two menhuan were rivals, and fought against each other which led to the Jahriyya Rebellion, Dungan revolt, and Dungan Revolt (1895).

# Remembrance ( – ): Always orally and mentally repeating the dhikr.
# Restraint ( – ): Focus on Tawhid, and engaging in the dhikr of the shahada phrase – &quot;La-ilaha il-allah&quot;.
# Watchfulness ( – ): Being conscientious over wandering thoughts.
# Recollection ( – ): Concentration upon the Divine presence in a condition of dhawq, foretaste, intuitive anticipation or perceptiveness, not using external aids.
# Awareness while breathing ( – ): Controlling one&#x27;s breathing by not exhaling or inhaling in the forgetfulness of the Divine.
# Journeying in one&#x27;s homeland ( - ): An internal journey that moves the person from having blameworthy to praiseworthy properties. This is also referred to as the vision or revelation of the hidden side of the shahada.
# Watching one&#x27;s step ( - ): Do not be distracted from purpose of the ultimate journey.
# Solitude in a crowd ( - ): Although journey is outwardly in this world, it is inwardly with God.
# Temporal pause ( - ): Keeping account of how one spends his or her time. If time is spent rightfully give thanks and time is spent incorrectly ask for forgiveness.

<text>David Arquette (born September 8, 1971) is an American actor, producer, and retired professional wrestler. As an actor, he is known for playing Dewey Riley in the slasher franchise &quot;Scream&quot; (1996–2022), which won him a Teen Choice Award and two Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. As a professional wrestler, he is best known for his panned 2000 stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where he won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, headlining the Slamboree pay-per-view event, and appearing in WWE and on the independent wrestling circuit. 

Arquette rose to recognition with roles in films such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992), &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (1995), &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; (1999), &quot;See Spot Run&quot; (2001), and &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; (2002). He directed, wrote, and produced the film &quot;The Tripper&quot; (2006), and has additionally produced the films &quot;Just Before I Go&quot; (2014) and &quot;12 Hour Shift&quot; (2020). His television credits include CBS&#x27; &quot;Double Rush&quot; (1995), ABC&#x27;s &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot; (2007), and Disney Channel&#x27;s animated series &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot; (2011–2016). He executive produced the game show &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot; (2014–2017), for which he received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination.

==Early life==
Arquette was born in a Subud commune in Bentonville, Virginia. He is the youngest child of Brenda &quot;Mardi&quot; Olivia (née Nowak), an actress, burlesque dancer, poet, theater operator, activist, acting-teacher, and therapist, and Lewis Arquette, a puppeteer and actor. Arquette&#x27;s paternal grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. Arquette&#x27;s mother was Jewish (from a family that emigrated from Poland) while his father was a convert from Roman Catholicism to Islam; through him, David is distantly related to explorer Meriwether Lewis. His father, whose family&#x27;s surname was originally Arcouet, was partly of French-Canadian descent. Arquette&#x27;s four siblings, Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and Alexis, all became actors as well. The Arquettes had an unusual upbringing, with a father who occasionally had issues with substance abuse. Their mother died of breast cancer.

==Career==

=== Acting ===
Arquette appeared in a number of films in the 1990s, including &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992), &quot;Airheads&quot; (1994) and &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; (1999). He had guest spots on television shows like &quot;Blossom&quot; (1992), &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1992) and &quot;Friends&quot; (1996). Arquette achieved his biggest success in the horror/slasher film franchise &quot;Scream&quot;. It was during the filming of the first film in 1996 that he first met his future wife, Courteney Cox. The couple married in 1999; together, they appeared in a 2003 advertisement for Coke and formed the production company Coquette (both a portmanteau of their last names and a word meaning ), which has produced a number of films and television series, including &quot;Daisy Does America&quot;, &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;Cougar Town&quot;. Arquette guest starred alongside Cox on &quot;Cougar Town&quot; in 2012.

Arquette appeared in the Sega video game &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot;, voicing himself as a &quot;celebrity adversary&quot; and manager of his own team, the Los Angeles Locos, as well as appearing as an unlockable character in Season Mode. He also appeared in the 2001 EA video game &quot;SSX Tricky&quot;, as the voice of lead character Eddie. He also starred in &quot;See Spot Run&quot; in 2001. Arquette starred in the 2007 ABC comedy series &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot;, which was canceled after one season. Since then, he has appeared in the 2008 film &quot;Hamlet 2&quot; and reprised his role in &quot;Scream 4&quot;, again acting alongside Cox. He appeared alongside his sister in the TV show &quot;Medium&quot; in January 2011.

He appeared in Rascal Flatts&#x27; music video for their song &quot;Why Wait&quot; in 2010. Arquette, a well known horror fan, made his directorial debut with 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Tripper&quot; and has signed on to direct &quot;Glutton&quot;, a 3D psychological thriller. The film began shooting in July 2011 in Canada. Arquette appeared on the 13th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with two-time champion Kym Johnson. He was eliminated on November 1, 2011. On October 7, 2013, Arquette&#x27;s new show &quot;Dream School&quot;, in which he plays a mentor to high risk kids in L.A., premiered on the Sundance Channel. In 2017, he starred in the reboot of &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot; as Captain Barnabus. In May 2020, it was confirmed that Arquette would be reprising his role as Dewey Riley for the fifth &quot;Scream&quot; film, which was directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. The film was released on January 14, 2022.

Arquette has appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; many times, including multiple times as the show&#x27;s celebrity intern. Arquette purchased the rights to Bozo the Clown in 2021 and has plans to revive the character.

=== Professional wrestling ===
In 2000, after filming the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) film &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;, Arquette was brought into WCW storylines. He made his first appearance on the April 12, 2000, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, sitting in the crowd before leaping into the ring to take part in a worked confrontation with Eric Bischoff and his New Blood stable. Afterwards, he formed an alliance with Chris Kanyon and then reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion Diamond Dallas Page, and with their help, he defeated Bischoff in a singles match on the April 24 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. On the following episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Arquette teamed with Page in a match against Bischoff and Jeff Jarrett, with the stipulation that whichever man got the pin would take the championship. Arquette pinned Bischoff again in the match&#x27;s finish, winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in the process.
During his time as champion, Arquette was mostly used as comic relief. He only appeared on two shows as champion, the May 1 &quot;Nitro&quot; and May 7 Slamboree pay-per-view. During the former, a vignette was shown, filmed on the set of Arquette&#x27;s film &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot;, which also featured his wife Courteney Cox and their co-star Kurt Russell. In the vignette, Cox informs Russell that Arquette is the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, causing Russell to laugh and walk off and Arquette to chase after him with a steel chair. In another portion of the show, Arquette was seen backstage trembling in fear and attempting to &quot;give back&quot; the championship belt. However, he did successfully defend the title against Tank Abbott with help from Page.

Arquette held the title for 12 days until the Slamboree pay-per-view on May 7, 2000, when he was booked to defend the championship against Jarrett and Page in a Triple Cage match, the same match featured in the climax of &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;. In the end, he turned on Page and gave the victory to Jarrett. After Slamboree, Arquette cut a promo on the May 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, explaining that his entire friendship with Page and title run was a &quot;swerve&quot;. Page subsequently ran down to the ring and hit him with a &quot;Diamond Cutter&quot;. Arquette made one final appearance with WCW at the New Blood Rising pay-per-view on August 13, when he interfered in a match between Buff Bagwell and Kanyon.

Arquette was against the idea of becoming the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, believing that fans like himself would detest a non-wrestler winning the title. Vince Russo, who was the head booker for WCW at the time, insisted that Arquette becoming the champion would be good for the company and for publicity, and Arquette reluctantly agreed to the angle. All the money he made during his WCW tenure was donated to the families of Owen Hart (who died in a freak accident), Brian Pillman (who died from an undiagnosed heart condition), and Darren Drozdov (who became a quadriplegic after an in-ring accident). After the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE) purchased WCW, Arquette&#x27;s championship run was listed as the top reason for the &quot;failure&quot; of &quot;Nitro&quot; in a list published by &quot;WWE Magazine&quot;. Gene Okerlund stated in a 2009 interview on WCW&#x27;s history that &quot;once Arquette won the title, it might as well been thrown in the trash&quot; due to losing what little credibility it had left at that point, and Arquette&#x27;s reign as champion has been criticized in other WWE media in the years since, despite the fact that the then-WWF itself briefly booked Vince McMahon as WWF Champion months before Arquette&#x27;s title win.

On the December 13, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Arquette made his WWE debut by teaming with Alex Riley in a handicap match against Randy Orton, which they lost. 
In 2018, during an interview on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, Arquette said that, in the years following his controversial WCW title win, he had been trolled on the Internet and that he wanted people to have respect for his name in professional wrestling. He began training with professional wrestler Peter Avalon for his return. On July 15, 2018, Arquette made his return to professional wrestling making his debut for Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) in a losing effort against RJ City.

On October 6, 2018, Arquette teamed with RJ City to defeat the team of Halal Beefcake (Idris Abraham and Joe Coleman) in a tag team match at Border City Wrestling&#x27;s 25th Anniversary show in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The event was filmed by Impact Wrestling to air as a One Night Only pay-per-view in November 2018. On November 16, 2018, Arquette wrestled Nick Gage in a deathmatch at Joey Janela&#x27;s LA Confidential event. During the match, he suffered a severe cut in the neck, causing him to bleed profusely. After the match, he went to a hospital and was operated on. Arquette later stated that he was done with deathmatches.

On May 23, 2019, Arquette made his debut on &quot;Being the Elite&quot;, where he attempted to convince Nick and Matt Jackson to allow him to enter the Over the Budget Battle Royal at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s (AEW) Double or Nothing event. Neither of them recognized him at first, however they eventually recalled his WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign but still refused to let him compete, instead, giving him a double Superkick.

In June 2021, Arquette announced he was retiring as a wrestler. His last match was on 31 July 2021 as Rob Boss, teaming with A Little Angry Tree and defeating Whopper Texas Ranger for Wrestling Pro Wrestling in Burbank, California. 

On April 23, 2023, Arquette appeared on AEW&#x27;s internet television show &quot;Hey! (EW)&quot;.

== Other activities ==
In May 2007, Image Comics (in conjunction with Raw Studios) published &quot;David Arquette&#x27;s the Tripper&quot;, which was adapted for the comic book medium by artist Nat Jones and writer Joe Harris, with whom Arquette shared writing duties. Propr Collection is a clothing line run by Arquette and Ben Harper. Arquette was briefly in a band by the name of Ear2000, who contributed a song to the &quot;Scream 2&quot; soundtrack and &quot;Scream 3&quot; soundtrack. The group, whose style blended hip hop and rock, has since broken up. Arquette has also been a part of Washington&#x27;s Red Museum and recorded &quot;Post Empire&quot; with the band, which was released in 2011.

Arquette is part owner of Bootsy Bellows, an exclusive nightclub in Los Angeles. The club is named for Arquette&#x27;s mother, a burlesque dancer who performed by that name.

==Personal life==
Arquette married his &quot;Scream&quot; co-star Courteney Cox on June 12, 1999. They have a daughter, Coco Arquette, born in June 2004. Jennifer Aniston is her godmother. On October 11, 2010, the media announced that Arquette and Cox were having a trial separation, but &quot;still love each other deeply.&quot; In June 2012, Arquette filed for divorce after nearly two years of separation from Cox. The divorce became final in May 2013. He started dating &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; correspondent Christina McLarty in 2011. They announced they were expecting their first child together in November 2013. McLarty gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son in 2014. The couple announced their engagement in July 2014. They were married on April 12, 2015. McLarty gave birth to their second son in 2017.

Arquette checked into a rehabilitation center for treatment of &quot;alcohol and other issues&quot; on January 1, 2011. On April 8, 2011, Arquette announced on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that he had reached the 100-day sober milestone. Later that year, Arquette said he has been sober for over nine months. In June 2012, while in Israel to film an episode of the travel show &quot;Trippin&quot;, Arquette belatedly celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at the Western Wall. The presiding rabbi was Shmuel Rabinovitch.

==Legacy==
The band the Black Math Experiment released &quot;You Cannot Kill David Arquette&quot;, a tongue in cheek song about Arquette&#x27;s acting and wrestling career. Arquette himself helped promote the band on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and during his promotional tour for &quot;The Tripper&quot;.

<text>Gerald Gordon Keddy (born February 15, 1953) is a Canadian politician. Keddy is a former Christmas tree grower, and offshore drill operator and was a Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2015, first sitting with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and latterly with its successor the Conservative Party of Canada. Keddy was chair of The Standing Committee on Fisheries, and later long time Parliamentary Secretary for International Trade, Atlantic Canada Opportunities, and then National Revenue and Agriculture. His wife, Judy Streatch, is a former Nova Scotia MLA and cabinet minister.

==Early life and education==
Keddy was born in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. He graduated from Acadia University in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts in History.

==Political career==
He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of South Shore from 1997 to 2004, and South Shore—St. Margaret&#x27;s from 2004 to 2015. He was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party before 2004, and then joined the Conservative Party of Canada. He served as the Whip and the Deputy Whip of the Progressive Conservative Party, and as critic of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Natural Resources, Fisheries and Oceans, Public Accounts, Parliamentary Affairs, and Library of Parliament.

As a member of Stephen Harper&#x27;s caucus, he served as the Chairman of the Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. On October 10, 2007, Keddy was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and has subsequently also served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and to the Minister of National Revenue. He also served as a school board trustee in New Ross, Nova Scotia.

Keddy did not stand for re-election in 2015 and retired from parliament.

==Same sex marriage==
He was one of only a handful of Conservative MPs to support same-sex marriage. His stance on this issue cost him votes in the western portion of his riding in the 2006 Canadian federal election, including some to Christian Heritage Party candidate Jim Hnatiuk who ran specifically to protest Keddy&#x27;s stance on this issue. However, an evenly split opposition (Liberal and New Democrat rivals came within 60 votes of each other) and rising Green Party also split his opposition&#x27;s vote.

==Lighthouses==
Keddy&#x27;s riding included many historic lighthouses and is in fact known as the &quot;Lighthouse Route&quot;. In 2006, he sponsored in the House of Commons a bill which had emerged from the Senate, the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, until Parliament was prorogued in 2007. Keddy supported the Act when it was re-introduced by MP Larry Miller in 2008, which led to Royal Assent on May 29, 2008.

==Government Cheques with Conservative Party ethics probe==

In 2009, Keddy used a ceremonial cheque at a funding announcement which contained a large Conservative party logo and was in the blue colour scheme associated with the party. Usually such cheques carry the Government of Canada logo. The use of the partisan cheque was found to be &quot;inappropriate&quot; but not &quot;illegal&quot; by the Ethics Commissioner 

==November 2009 &quot;no-good bastards&quot; comment==
On November 23, 2009, Keddy sparked a controversy when he was discussing the use of immigrant labour in the industry when he remarked that &quot;Nova Scotians won’t do it — all those no-good bastards sitting on the sidewalk in Halifax that can’t get work.&quot; Keddy apologized for the remark the following day, saying, &quot;In no way did I mean to offend those who have lost their job due to the global recession, nor did I mean to suggest that anyone who is unemployed is not actively looking for employment.&quot;

<text>Chancellorsville is a historic site and unincorporated community in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, United States, about ten miles west of Fredericksburg. The name of the locale derives from the mid-19th century inn operated by the family of George Chancellor at the intersection of the Orange Turnpike and Orange Plank Road. The Battle of Chancellorsville occurred there during the American Civil War in May 1863, and the Battle of the Wilderness was fought nearby in May 1864. During the 1863 battle, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson was wounded by friendly fire, dying eight days later on May 10, 1863, from pneumonia.

Portions of both the Chancellorsville and Wilderness battlefields are protected within Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, although both battlefields have come under threat from development in recent years. The site of the Chancellorsville Inn, where Union Gen. Joseph Hooker had his headquarters during the 1863 battle, is preserved in the national military park, as is the site of Jackson&#x27;s wounding. The site of Jackson&#x27;s death is located at Guinea Station in Caroline County, south of Fredericksburg, and is also preserved as part of the park.

<text>Hiwi (), the German abbreviation of the word Hilfswilliger or, in English, auxiliary volunteer, designated, during World War II, a member of different kinds of voluntary auxiliary forces made up of recruits indigenous to the territories of Eastern Europe occupied by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/46/1/147/102854/Leaning-on-Legionnaires-Why-Modern-States-Recruit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Hitler reluctantly agreed to allow recruitment of Soviet citizens in the Rear Areas during Operation Barbarossa. In a short period of time, many of them were moved to combat units.

==Overview==
Hiwis comprised 50% of the 2nd Panzer Army&#x27;s 134th Infantry Division in late 1942, while the 6th Army at the Battle of Stalingrad was composed of 25% Hiwis. By 1944, their numbers had grown to 600,000. Both men and women were recruited. Veteran Hiwis were practically indistinguishable from regular German troops, and often served in entire company strengths.

Between September 1941 and July 1944 the &quot;SS&quot; employed thousands of collaborationist auxiliary police recruited as Hiwis directly from the Soviet POW camps. After training, they were deployed for service with Nazi Germany, in the General Government, and the occupied East.

In one instance, the German &quot;SS&quot; and police inducted, processed, and trained 5,082 Hiwi guards before the end of 1944 at the &quot;SS&quot; training camp division of the Trawniki concentration camp set up in the village of Trawniki southeast of Lublin. They were known as the &quot;Trawniki men&quot; () and were former Soviet citizens, mostly Ukrainians. Trawnikis were sent to all major killing sites of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;, which was their training&#x27;s primary purpose. They took an active role in the executions of Jews at Bełżec, Sobibor, Treblinka II, Warsaw (three times), Częstochowa, Lublin, Lvov, Radom, Kraków, Białystok (twice), Majdanek as well as Auschwitz, and Trawniki itself.

==Use of term==
The term &#x27;Hiwis&#x27; acquired a thoroughly negative meaning during World War II when it entered into several other languages in reference to &quot;Ostlegionen&quot; as well as volunteers enlisted from occupied territories for service in a number of roles including hands-on shooting actions and guard duties at extermination camps on top of regular military service, drivers, cooks, hospital attendants, ammunition carriers, messengers, sappers, etc.

In the context of World War II the term has clear connotations of collaborationism, and in the case of the occupied Soviet territories also of anti-Bolshevism (widely presented as such by the Germans). 

German historian wrote that there were many different reasons why Soviet citizens volunteered. He argues that the issue has to be seen first and foremost with the German &quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot; (war of annihilation) policy in mind. For example, volunteering allowed Soviet POWs to get out of the barbaric German POW camp system, giving them a much higher chance of survival. During World War II, Nazi Germany engaged in a policy of deliberate maltreatment of Soviet POWs, in contrast to their treatment of British and American POWs. This resulted in some 3.3 to 3.5 million deaths, or 57% of all Soviet POWs. Therefore it becomes very difficult to differentiate between a genuine desire to volunteer, and seeming to volunteer in the hope of a better chance of surviving the war.

A captured Hiwi told his NKVD interrogators:

Soviet authorities referred to the Hiwis as &quot;former Russians&quot; regardless of the circumstances of their joining or their fate at the hands of the NKVD secret police. After the war, thousands attempted to return to their homes in the USSR. Hundreds were captured and prosecuted, charged with treason and therefore guilty of enlistment from the start of judicial proceedings. Most were sentenced to the Gulag labor camps, and released under the Khrushchev amnesty of 1955.

The reliance upon Hiwis exposed a gap between Nazi ideologues and pragmatic German Army commanders. Nazi leaders including Adolf Hitler regarded all Slavs as &quot;Untermenschen&quot; and therefore of limited value as volunteers also. On the other hand, the manpower was needed, and German Intelligence had recognised the need to divide the Soviet nationals. The contradiction was sometimes disguised by reclassification of Slavs as Cossacks. Colonel Helmuth Groscurth (XI Corps&#x27; Chief of Staff) wrote to General Beck: &quot;It is disturbing that we are forced to strengthen our fighting troops with Russian prisoners of war, who are already being turned into gunners. It&#x27;s an odd state of affairs that the &quot;Beasts&quot; we have been fighting against are now living with us in closest harmony.&quot; The Hiwis may have constituted one quarter of 6th Army&#x27;s front-line strength, amounting to over 50,000 Slavic auxiliaries serving with the German troops.

<text>Scream 3 is a 2000 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Ehren Kruger. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Lance Henriksen, Matt Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Deon Richmond, and Patrick Warburton. It is a sequel to &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) and the third installment in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series. The film&#x27;s story follows Sidney Prescott (Campbell), who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films but is drawn to Hollywood after a new Ghostface begins killing the cast of the film within a film &quot;Stab 3&quot;. &quot;Scream 3&quot; combines the violence of the slasher genre with comedy and &quot;whodunit&quot; mystery, while satirizing the cliché of film trilogies. Unlike the previous &quot;Scream&quot; films, there was an increased emphasis on comedic elements in this installment; the violence and horror were reduced in response to increased public scrutiny about violence in media, following the Columbine High School massacre.

&quot;Scream&quot; (1996) screenwriter Kevin Williamson provided a five-page outline for two sequels to &quot;Scream&quot; when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise. Williamson&#x27;s commitments to other projects meant he was unable to develop a complete script for &quot;Scream 3&quot;, so writing duties were undertaken by Kruger, who discarded many of Williamson&#x27;s notes. Craven and Marco Beltrami returned to direct and score the film, respectively. Production was troubled, including script rewrites, occasions when pages were only ready on the day of filming, and scheduling difficulties with the main cast. Principal photography took place from July to September 1999, and the ending was re-filmed in January 2000.

&quot;Scream 3&quot; premiered on February 3, 2000, in Westwood, Los Angeles, and was theatrically released the following day, grossing $162million worldwide on a budget of $40million. The film received mixed reviews but has been reappraised in recent years in the wake of the MeToo movement. &quot;Scream 3&quot; was originally intended to be the final installment of the series until the franchise was revived with a sequel, &quot;Scream 4&quot;, released on April 15, 2011.

== Plot ==

Cotton Weary, now a successful talk show host, is contacted by Ghostface, who demands to know the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott. When Cotton refuses to cooperate, Ghostface murders him and his girlfriend Christine. Detective Mark Kincaid contacts Gale Weathers to discuss Cotton&#x27;s murder, prompting her to travel to Hollywood. She finds Dewey Riley working as an adviser on the set of &quot;Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro&quot;, the third film in the series based on the Ghostface murders.

Ghostface kills &quot;Stab 3&quot; actress Sarah Darling, halting the film&#x27;s production to the frustration of director Roman Bridger. The remaining cast, along with Dewey and Gale, gather at the home of Jennifer Jolie, the actress playing Gale in &quot;Stab 3.&quot; Ghostface stabs Jennifer&#x27;s bodyguard to death and causes a gas explosion, killing co-star Tom Prinze.

Elsewhere, Sidney is living in seclusion under an alias, fearing another killer may strike, and works as a crisis counselor for an abused women&#x27;s hotline. Having uncovered her location, the killer begins taunting Sidney using a voice changer to sound like her deceased mother Maureen Prescott. Sidney travels to Hollywood, realizing she is no longer safe. Gale and Jennifer learn that Maureen briefly worked as an actress in the 1960s under the stage name &quot;Rina Reynolds&quot; and had been raped at a party held by &quot;Stab 3&quot; producer John Milton.

Martha Meeks, the sister of Sidney&#x27;s murdered friend Randy, visits Sidney and the others to deliver a videotape that Randy made before his death. Randy posthumously warns them the rules of a horror film do not apply in the third film of a trilogy and that any of them could die. Sidney is later attacked by Ghostface on the &quot;Stab 3&quot; set, forcing the police to hold her for protection.

Dewey, Gale, Jennifer, and the remaining cast, Angelina Tyler and Tyson Fox, attend a birthday party for Roman at Milton&#x27;s mansion. Ghostface attacks the group, killing Angelina, Tyson, and Jennifer while taking Gale and Dewey hostage. Ghostface contacts Sidney, and she travels to the mansion. Kincaid follows but is knocked unconscious by Ghostface. Sidney is lured to a secret screening room where Ghostface appears and reveals himself to be Roman.

Roman explains that he is Sidney&#x27;s half-brother and the product of Maureen&#x27;s sexual assault. Four years prior, he tracked Maureen down, only for her to reject him. Roman began stalking her and filming the men she philandered with. He showed Billy Loomis footage of his father with Maureen, setting off the string of murders in Woodsboro. When he discovered the fame Sidney attracted due to those events, Roman snapped and lured her out of hiding, planning to kill her and frame her for his murders. After Roman reveals a bound Milton and slits his throat, Sidney furiously denounces his explanation as nothing more than deflection to hide his selfish motivations. Roman suffers a mental breakdown and attacks, and after a ferocious fight, Sidney ultimately outsmarts Roman and repeatedly stabs him. As Dewey and Gale arrive, Roman rises and tries to attack once more but is finally killed when Dewey shoots him in the head.

Later at Sidney&#x27;s house, Dewey proposes to Gale, who accepts. Sidney returns from a walk and leaves her previously alarmed front gates open. As she joins Gale, Dewey and Kincaid to watch a movie, a wind blows her front door open, but she ignores it.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Scream 3&quot; was released just over two years after &quot;Scream 2&quot;, greenlit with a budget of $40million, a significant increase over the budgets of &quot;Scream&quot; at $15million and &quot;Scream 2&quot; at $24million. Williamson&#x27;s involvement had been contracted while selling his &quot;Scream&quot; script, to which he had attached two five-page outlines for potential sequels, which would become &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;Scream 3&quot;, hoping to entice buyers with the prospect of purchasing a franchise rather than a single script. Craven too had been contracted for two potential sequels following a successful test screening of &quot;Scream&quot; and he returned to direct the third installment. Shortly before production began on the film, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students, a teacher, and themselves at their school, in what became known as the Columbine High School massacre. In the aftermath of the incident, many parties began looking for rationales for their actions and this led to an increased scrutiny on the role of the media in society, including video games and film, and the influence it could have on an audience. With the production of &quot;Scream 3&quot; not yet underway, there were considerations about whether the film should be made at that time, aware of the potential for negative attention but the studio decided to press forward, albeit with changes. The studio remained however much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in &quot;Scream 3&quot; than with previous installments, pressing for a greater emphasis on the series&#x27; satiric humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio went as far as demanding that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence at all, a drastic departure for the series, but Craven directly intervened. According to Kruger, &quot;[Craven ...] said &#x27;Be serious, guys. Either we make a &quot;Scream&quot; movie or we make a movie and call it something else. But if it&#x27;s a &quot;Scream&quot; movie, it&#x27;s going to have certain standards.&#x27;&quot;

=== Writing ===
Bob and Harvey Weinstein approached Williamson in early 1999 to pursue a full script for a third installment to the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise, &quot;Scream 3&quot;. However, following his successes with the &quot;Scream&quot; series and other projects such as &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, Williamson had become involved in multiple projects including the development of the short-lived TV series &quot;Wasteland&quot; and directing his self-penned film &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; (1999) which Williamson had written prior to &quot;Scream&quot; and which had languished in development hell since. Unable to develop a full script for the production, Williamson instead wrote a 20–30 page draft outline for the film that involved the return of Ghostface to the fictional town of Woodsboro where the &quot;Stab&quot; series, a fictional series of films within a film that exist within the &quot;Scream&quot; universe and are based on the events of &quot;Scream&quot;, would be filmed. The Weinsteins hired &quot;Arlington Road&quot; scribe Ehren Kruger to replace Williamson and helm writing duties, developing a script based on Williamson&#x27;s notes.

The environment for &quot;Scream 3&quot;″s development had become more complicated than with previous films. There was increased scrutiny on the effects of violence in media and the effect it could have on the public in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre which occurred shortly before production would begin on the film. In addition, since the release of the original &quot;Scream&quot; films, various acts of violence had taken place which had gained notoriety and media attention when they were linked to, or blamed on, the films. Eager to avoid further criticism or connection to such incidents, Williamson&#x27;s notes were largely discarded as the studio insisted that the script should focus on the comedic elements of the series while significantly reducing the violence. The setting of the film was changed from Woodsboro to Hollywood upon which Kruger commented that he believed the characters should be moving to &quot;bigger&quot; places from high school, to college, to the city of Hollywood. Behind the scenes however, the move away from Woodsboro was mandated as it was considered that a film containing violent acts of murder in and around the small town of Woodsboro and the associated school would attract significant negative criticism and attention that could be detrimental to the production and studio, with the film set for release less than a year following the Columbine incident.

Kruger agreed to develop the script for &quot;Scream 3&quot; primarily to work with Craven and the executives under Miramax; he said of his decision to take on writing duties on the film:

To help in developing the script, Kruger read copies of Williamson&#x27;s scripts for &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot;, as well as watched the earlier films to better understand the characters and tone. In an interview, Kruger admitted that his lack of involvement with the development of the principal cast of &quot;Scream&quot; hampered his ability to portray them true to their previous characterization. Early scripts for &quot;Scream 3&quot; had the character of Sidney Prescott much like &quot;Linda Hamilton in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;&quot; – a more action-orientated heroine – at which point Craven would intervene and correct the script to bring the characters closer to their previous appearances. Kruger admitted that despite not receiving any writing credit, Craven had a significant hand in developing the script for &quot;Scream 3&quot;. Like &quot;Scream 2&quot;, the script for &quot;Scream 3&quot; was subject to repeated alterations with pages sometimes completed only on the day on which they were to be filmed. Multiple scenes were rewritten to include previously absent characters or change elements of the plot when it was decided that they were not connecting with other scenes. In a 2013 interview, Williamson further detailed his original script, which would have seen the killers be a &quot;Stab&quot; fan club of Woodsboro kids. All the members of the club would have been involved in the killings and the final twist &quot;of the movie was when Sidney walked into the house after Ghostface had killed everyone ... and they all rose up. None of them were actually dead and they&#x27;d planned the whole thing.&quot; Williamson later adapted this story for his 2013 TV series &quot;The Following&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Liev Schreiber all returned to their roles as Sidney Prescott and news reporter Gale Weathers, Dewey Riley, and Cotton Weary, now host of a TV show, respectively for &quot;Scream 3&quot;, their characters being the only central roles to survive the events of the previous two films. In an interview, Craven stated that convincing the central cast to return to film a new &quot;Scream&quot; film was not difficult but as with &quot;Scream 2&quot;, their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film&#x27;s production period difficult. The consequence of Campbell&#x27;s commitments in particular meant she was only available to film her role for 20 days, forcing the script to reduce the series&#x27; main character to a smaller role while focusing on the other characters played by Cox and Arquette. Lynn McRee finally makes a physical appearance in the series as Maureen Prescott (though only through a hallucination of Sidney), and Sidney now is a crisis counselor. Roger L. Jackson again returned to voice the antagonist Ghostface and Jamie Kennedy reprised his role as Randy Meeks in spite of the character&#x27;s death in &quot;Scream 2&quot;. Negative feedback following the death of Randy had the production consider methods to have had his character survive to appear in &quot;Scream 3&quot; including having the character&#x27;s family hide him away for safety while recuperating from his injuries, but it was deemed too unbelievable and the idea was replaced with the character appearing in a minor role via a pre-recorded video message.

Many of the supporting cast played fictitious actors taking part in the film within a film &quot;Stab 3&quot; including Emily Mortimer as Angelina Tyler, Parker Posey as Jennifer Jolie, Matt Keeslar as Tom Prinze, Jenny McCarthy as Sarah Darling, and Deon Richmond as Tyson Fox with Scott Foley as the film&#x27;s director, Roman Bridger. Additional cast included Lance Henriksen as film producer John Milton, Patrick Dempsey as detective Mark Kincaid, Patrick Warburton as bodyguard Steven Stone, and Kelly Rutherford as Christine Hamilton, girlfriend to Cotton Weary. Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact. Shortly after being cast, Mortimer was found to lack the necessary work permit to allow her involvement in the film, requiring her to be flown to Vancouver to obtain one. &quot;Scream 3&quot; also featured the first live on-screen appearance of Sidney Prescott&#x27;s mother Maureen Prescott, played by Lynn McRee, the actress previously having represented the character in photographs during the previous films.

Lawrence Hecht and C.W. Morgan appeared in minor roles reprising their characters of Sidney&#x27;s father Neil Prescott and Hank Loomis respectively. Nancy O&#x27;Dell appeared as an unnamed reporter, having previously appeared in &quot;Scream 2&quot; and would go on to appear in &quot;Scream 4&quot; in the same role. &quot;Scream 3&quot; featured several cameo appearances including the fictional characters of Jay and Silent Bob from the 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot; and sequels played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, and director Roger Corman as an on-set studio executive. Carrie Fisher made a cameo in the film as former actress Bianca Burnette at the suggestion of Bob Weinstein; Fisher helped to write her character, who makes reference to having almost been cast as Princess Leia.

In a 2009 interview, Matthew Lillard, who played Stu Macher in &quot;Scream&quot;, said that he had been contracted to reprise his role in &quot;Scream 3&quot; as the primary antagonist, having survived his apparent death, orchestrating new Ghostface attacks from prison on high school students and ultimately targeting Sidney. Following the Columbine High School massacre shortly before production began, the script was scrapped and re-written without his character and this plot to avoid development of a film which associated violence and murder with a high school setting.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Scream 3&quot; began on July 6, 1999, in and around Hollywood, Los Angeles on a budget of $40million and finished on September 29, 1999, after twelve weeks. Filming took place largely in the areas of San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silver Lake with the isolated home of Campbell&#x27;s character situated in Topanga Canyon. The opening scene involves Cotton Weary (Schreiber) driving before arriving home where he is murdered by the Ghostface character. For the driving scene, the production filmed on Hollywood Boulevard but the following scene in Cotton&#x27;s apartment was changed frequently, requiring alterations to the driving scene to maintain continuity, modifying who speaks to Cotton by phone and what the conversation entailed. Unable to return to Hollywood Boulevard, the scene was reshot on a street outside of the production studio in San Fernando Valley and intermixed with footage taken on the Boulevard. The opening attack scene was filmed partially at the exterior and interior of Harper House in West Hollywood but changes were made to the scene including introducing a live girlfriend for Cotton instead of her being dead when Cotton arrives. It was later decided that the confrontation between Cotton and Ghostface, featuring Cotton physically dominating the character and attempting to escape by skylight, was unrealistic and made Ghostface appear weak and this scene was reshot. Again however, they were unable to return to Harper House to conduct filming and resorted to constructing a replica of the apartment interior to produce the necessary footage which had the Ghostface character appear more dominant and completely excised the attempted skylight escape. Cox&#x27;s character is introduced during a seminar which takes place within a classroom at UCLA, a location previously used in &quot;Scream 2&quot; to represent the fictional Windsor College. The film studio where the fictional &quot;Stab 3&quot; is filmed is represented by the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, San Fernando Valley while scenes at the home of Posey&#x27;s character were filmed in the Hollywood Hills at Runyon Ranch in Runyon Canyon Park. The finale, featuring the final attacks of the film and confrontation between the antagonist and Sidney, was filmed at the Canfield-Moreno Estate, a mansion in Silverlake.

A scene in the film involved Campbell being pursued by Ghostface through filmset replicas of locations from the original &quot;Scream&quot; including her character&#x27;s home. The scene was not present in the script itself, but Craven paid to have the sets constructed, knowing he wanted to revisit the original film in some manner. After the construction of the sets, the scene was then written around the resulting areas producing the scene in the final film. The script underwent changes repeatedly as filming was conducted with pages regularly only available on the day of filming. Additionally, if the production decided to change a scene this sometimes meant refilming other scenes to maintain continuity requiring further rewrites. The production team purposely filmed large amounts of footage containing different variations of each scene based on the different script developments in order that, should the script further change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date, requiring them to obtain access to locations or build sets. Additionally, a three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had over two hours of footage filmed. The script for the film was so in flux that the epilogue scene was filmed with three variants of Patrick Dempsey&#x27;s character – one with him absent, one where his arm is bandaged and one with him in a normal condition – as the production were not certain what his ultimate fate would be following the finalization of the film.

=== Post-production ===
In January 2000, three months after completing principal photography for &quot;Scream 3&quot;, the ending was refilmed when it was decided to be an inadequate conclusion. Originally the ending consisted of Sidney (Campbell) easily defeating Roman (Scott Foley) which led into an early morning scene of police arriving and then into the final scene of Sidney in her home. The production considered that this amounted to essentially three endings, damaging the pacing of the film and there was also consideration that, being the concluding chapter of the trilogy, the audience needed to believe that Sidney could lose and die, something her easy victory did not achieve. To create the alternate ending, the fight scene between Sidney and Roman was extended and an addition involved Roman shooting Sidney, seemingly to death where previously she had simply hidden from the character. A major addition was the presence of the character Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), who had previously been completely absent from the finale after the production realized that his character simply disappeared from the plot and his story arc went nowhere.

As with the production of &quot;Scream&quot;, Craven encountered repeated conflicts over censorship with the MPAA regarding violence, and the director stated in an interview that the issues made him consider leaving the horror genre.

=== Music ===

Marco Beltrami returned to score &quot;Scream 3&quot;, having scored the previous two films in the series. For the film, Beltrami employed seven orchestrators to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film&#x27;s score. He experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted, unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically. Beltrami continued to incorporate a heavy vocal orchestra throughout the score as he had with the previous films. There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the film&#x27;s deadline. Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score, again incorporating excerpts of the score to &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; by Hans Zimmer in the track &quot;Sid Wears a Dress&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Scream 3&quot; held its premiere on February 3, 2000, at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, Los Angeles, California and was theatrically released the following day on February 4.

=== Box office ===
The film set a record for the widest opening ever in the United States and Canada, being released on 3,467 screens.

The film grossed $34.7million during its opening weekend, ranking number one at the US box office. It broke &quot;The Empire Strikes Back: Special Edition&quot; record for the highest weekend debut in February. It also beat &quot;Scream 2&quot; record for the highest weekend debut for a horror film and also for a Miramax film. It went on to gross $89.1million in the United States and Canada, and $72.7million in other territories, for a world lifetime gross of $161.8million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 43% based on 164 reviews and an average rating of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Despite some surprising twists, &quot;Scream 3&quot; sees the franchise falling back on the same old horror formulas and cliches it once hacked and slashed with postmodern abandon.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Time Out London&quot; was particularly critical of the film, calling the film&#x27;s metafiction commentary a poor imitation of Craven&#x27;s own horror film &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994). Of the characters, Roger Ebert said &quot;[the characters] are so thin, they&#x27;re transparent&quot; but praised Campbell&#x27;s appearance saying, &quot;The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute.&quot;

In a positive review, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film, &quot;Genuinely scary and also highly amusing&quot;, and the BBC stated that &quot;as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the film as the end of the &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy, saying &quot;Aficionados will be the best able to appreciate how wittily Craven has brought down the curtain on his much-imitated, genre-reviving series&quot; while &quot;Empire&quot; called it &quot;satisfying&quot; though believed the premise of the series had worn thin.

==== Post-2017 re-evaluation ====
In the wake of the scandal involving the &quot;Scream&quot; films&#x27; executive producer Harvey Weinstein, several publications noted the parallels between Weinstein&#x27;s behavior and the themes of abuse featured in the film, particularly those involving Maureen Prescott, the late mother of the film series&#x27; protagonist, Sidney. In 2017, Kristen Yoonsoo Kim noted the scene in which John Milton, portrayed by Lance Henriksen, discusses taking advantage of aspiring actresses. In 2019, the film&#x27;s editor, Patrick Lussier, discussed those particular themes and Wes Craven&#x27;s approach to them, saying of Henriksen&#x27;s character: &quot;Wes, I think, was very interested in that character as not necessarily the villain—he certainly is a villain—but as a catalyst for the villain&#x27;s motivation. He&#x27;s really the spark for the events, or retconned that he is the spark for the events, in the entire series.&quot;

In 2020, Adam White wrote that the film was &quot;an angry indictment of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, predatory men and the casting couch&quot;. He noted several instances of &quot;transactional sex&quot; within the film, including the characters Jennifer and Angelina both making references to having sex with filmmakers in order to secure roles in the fictional &quot;Stab&quot; film, and Carrie Fisher in a cameo role (as a lookalike of Fisher herself) who claims that the role of Princess Leia in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise was won by &quot;the one who [slept] with George Lucas&quot;. White also noted that Rose McGowan, who appeared in the first &quot;Scream&quot; film, later accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room a year after the film was released. McGowan revealed in 2017 that she received a $100,000 settlement as a result of this attack.

Writing for SyFy Wire, Emma Fraser commented that throughout the series, the late Maureen is &quot;slut-shamed&quot; and &quot;victim-blamed&quot;. Fraser also lamented the film&#x27;s lack of exploration of these themes, stating that the film &quot;could have been a fascinating look at the crimes of this industry and the relationship horror has with sex&quot;.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Scream 3&quot; was released in US territories on VHS and on DVD on July 4, 2000, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Dimension Home Video label). The video was later released as a bonus edition on October 24, 2000. The DVD version was only released as a Collector&#x27;s Edition featuring deleted scenes, outtakes, audio commentary, music videos of songs featured in the film, trailers for the film, and biographies of the cast and crew involved in the film&#x27;s production. Following the release of &quot;Scream 3&quot; as what was then the concluding chapter of the series, Collector&#x27;s Editions of &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Scream 2&quot;, and &quot;Scream 3&quot; were packaged in &quot;The Ultimate Scream Collection&quot; DVD boxset by Dimension Films on September 26, 2000, which included &quot;Behind the Scream&quot;, a short documentary about the production of the films, outtakes, deleted scenes, screentests of actors involved in the films and other miscellaneous materials related to the series. In 2001, the DVD release of &quot;Scream 3&quot; was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Home Video Release, but lost to &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (1997).

&quot;Scream 3&quot; remained unreleased in foreign territories including Europe and Japan until 2001 where it was simultaneously released with &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot; on February 26 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Each film contained the additional content found in the Collector&#x27;s Edition version of their US release including deleted scenes, outtakes, theatrical trailers, music videos, and commentary from each respective film&#x27;s crew. Additionally, the three films were collected together in a single pack, again released on February 26 and released as &quot;Scream Trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Scream 3&quot; was released on the Blu-ray Disc format on March 29, 2011, alongside &quot;Scream&quot;, and &quot;Scream 2&quot;, two weeks prior to the release of &quot;Scream 4&quot;, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, hosting the films in 1080p high definition and included audio commentary, theatrical trailers and behind-the-scenes footage for each respective film. The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 3, 2023, by Paramount Pictures.

<text>Quarry Bank Mill (also known as Styal Mill) in Styal, Cheshire, England, is one of the best preserved textile factories of the Industrial Revolution. Built in 1784, the cotton mill is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Quarry Bank Mill was established by Samuel Greg, and was notable for innovations both in machinery and also in its approach to labour relations, the latter largely as a result of the work of Greg&#x27;s wife, Hannah Lightbody. The family took a somewhat paternalistic attitude toward the workers, providing medical care for all and limited education to the children, but all laboured roughly 72 hours per week until 1847 when a new law shortened the hours.

Greg also built housing for his all of his workers, in a large community now known as Styal Estate. Some were conversions of farm houses, or older residences but 42 new cottages, including the Oak Cottages (now Grade II Listed), were built in the 1820s when the mill was being expanded.

The National Trust, which runs the mill and Styal Estate as a museum that is open to the public, calls the site &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s greatest industrial heritage sites, home to a complete industrial community&quot;. According to the Council of Europe, the mill with Styal village make up &quot;the most complete and least altered factory colony of the Industrial Revolution. It is of outstanding national and international importance&quot;.

==Location==
Quarry Bank Mill is on the outskirts of Styal in Cheshire, abutting and to the south of Manchester Airport.
The mill is on the bank of the River Bollin which provided water to power the waterwheels. It was connected by road to the Bridgewater Canal for transporting raw cotton from the port of Liverpool. The site consisted of three farms or folds. Styal railway station opened in 1909, about a kilometre away.

==History==

Samuel Greg leased land at Quarrell Hole on Pownall Fee from Lord Stamford, who imposed a condition that &quot;none of the surrounding trees should be pruned, felled or lopped&quot;; maintaining the woodland character of the area. One reason for selecting this location was the &quot;suitable head of water provided by the River Bollin and its proximity to the Bridgewater Canal and thus Liverpool&quot;. The factory was built in 1784 by Greg to spin cotton. When Greg retired in 1832 it was the largest such business in the United Kingdom. The water-powered Georgian mill still produces cotton calico. The Gregs were careful and pragmatic, paternalistic millowners, and the mill was expanded and changed throughout its history. When Greg&#x27;s son, Robert Hyde Greg, took over the business, he introduced weaving. Samuel Greg died in 1834.

An 1835 report provided these specifics about the mill: &quot;It is driven by an elegant water-wheel, thirty-two feet in diameter, and twenty-four feet broad, equivalent in power to one
hundred and twenty horses&quot;

The Mill was attacked during the Plug Plot riots on 10 August 1842.

The mill&#x27;s iron water wheel, the fourth to be installed, was designed by Thomas Hewes and built between 1816 and 1820. Overhead shafts above the machines were attached to the water wheel by a belt. When the wheel turned, the motion moved the belt and powered the machinery. A beam engine and a horizontal steam engine were subsequently installed to supplement the power. The Hewes wheel broke in 1904 but the River Bollin continued to power the mill through two water turbines. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river&#x27;s water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years. Steam engines could produce power all year round. Today the mill houses the most powerful working waterwheel in Europe, an iron wheel moved from Glasshouses Mill at Pateley Bridge designed by Sir William Fairbairn who had been Hewes&#x27; apprentice.

===Mill community===
The sparse accommodation that existed when the Gregs built the mill was soon exhausted and Greg built plain cottages, including the Oak Cottages which are now Grade II listed; these were rented to his workers. Each house had a parlour, kitchen and two bedrooms (a two-up two-down), an outside privy and a small garden. Rent was deducted from the workers&#x27; wages. The area of worker housing became known as Styal Estate.

The Gregs owned a home in Manchester but also built a home near the mill in 1797, called &quot;Quarry Bank House&quot;. The building has been Grade II listed since 1975. It was restored in 2017 in a manner that ensured that &quot;all primary features dating from the Greg family’s occupation have been retained&quot;, and was opened to visits by the public by the National Trust.

Samuel Greg, like Robert Owen, who built New Lanark, attempted to bring the structured order of a country village to his new industrial centres. He built Oak School to educate the children and the Norcliffe Chapel where the villagers worshipped and held a Sunday school.

At first, Greg converted farm buildings in Styal to house workers. As the mill increased in size, new housing was constructed for the workers. According to the National Trust, in the 1820s, &quot;... new terraced cottages brought a brand new style of architecture and an expanding population ... In the tiny two-up-two-down cottages workers lived in cramped conditions, with as many as 14 people living in one house and tenants sub-letting rooms to other mill workers&quot;.

The Gregs also built the village shop and, for roughly five decades, remained the owners.

Medical care for mill workers was provided by staff physicians and surgeons. The mill provided the &quot;earliest recorded occupational health service in this country&quot;, according to an article in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine.

===Apprentice system===

Quarry Bank Mill employed child apprentices, a system that continued only until 1847. Most were children of families in poverty, living in workhouses, which sent them to the mill which was &quot;clamouring for cheap labour&quot;. At the time, the consensus was that the children were better off in labour than they would have been under &#x27;the step-motherly care of the Poor Law&#x27;&quot;, according to a reliable source. Initially, the children were brought from Hackney and Chelsea but by 1834 they came mostly from neighbouring parishes or Liverpool poorhouses.

The last child to be indentured started work in 1841. Child labour, constituted over half of the labour force in the early decades of the mill&#x27;s operation, according to Prof Hannah Barker, chair of Manchester Histories at the University of Manchester. &quot;By 1833 apprentices made up only 20% of workforce at Styal, and in 1847 the apprentice system was completely abandoned&quot;.

The first children apprentices lived in lodgings in the neighbourhood then in 1790 Greg built the Apprentice House near the factory. Greg believed he could get the best out of his workers by treating them fairly. He hired a superintendent to attend to their care and morals and members of the Greg family and external tutors gave them lessons.

Some of the work was dangerous, with fingers sometimes being severed by the machines. Samuel Greg employed Peter Holland, father of the Royal Physician Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet and uncle of Elizabeth Gaskell, as mill doctor. Holland was responsible for the health of the children and other workers, and was the first doctor to be employed in such a capacity.

Life for the children was not ideal of course. Hours were long: 12 hours per day, six days a week, according to documents from 1794. Time for play was allowed only on Sunday afternoons. Still, their &quot;diet appears to have been a relatively good one&quot;, according to Professor Barker&#x27;s research, and some education was provided. (The Gregs were Unitarians who believed in educating their workers, including Sunday School for both sexes.) Initially, schooling was provided only for boys, for an hour on three evenings of the week, at most; by 1833 the mill claimed that girls were also getting some education on Sunday afternoons. A comparative study of child mill workers of the era by Katrina Honeyman indicated that &quot;those at Quarry Bank were treated &#x27;better than average&#x27;, but that the Gregs were not amongst the best employers in the country&quot;.

A former director of the Quarry Bank Mill, and author of a book about Hannah Greg, provided this summary of child labour, based on extensive research.Over half of Samuel Greg’s workforce were poor and orphaned children ... the children were given good medical care by the Greg family doctor, and education in writing and maths three nights a week ... although the child workers were not subjected to corporal punishment, bad behaviour brought overtime, threats that girls would have their heads shaved or young workers being locked in a room for days on a porridge-only diet&quot;.

===20th and 21st century===

The estate and mill were eventually inherited by Robert Hyde Greg and then by Alexander Carlton Greg, who donated the site in 1939 to the National Trust. The mill continued in production until 1959. According to the historic listing, the 32 ft. diameter waterwheel was replaced by two turbines in 1904. Some restoration was completed in 1969.

In 2006 the National Trust acquired Quarry Bank House and its gardens and, in 2010, the gardener&#x27;s house and the upper gardens. In 2013 the mill received 130,000 visitors. In 2013, the trust launched an appeal to raise £1.4 million to restore a worker&#x27;s cottage, a shop and the Greg&#x27;s glasshouses and digitise records relating to Gregs and the mill workers.

During 2015–2020, the Quarry Bank Project improved the site for visitors with a £9.4 million restoration. &quot;New areas have been restored and for the first time ever visitors can now explore the complete industrial heritage site at Quarry Bank&quot;. A promotional video published by the Trust depicts scenes and activities that visitors can experience.

==Architecture==

Quarry Bank is an example of an early, rural, cotton-spinning mill that was initially dependent on water power. The first mill was built by Samuel Greg and John Massey in 1784. Its design was functional and unadorned, growing out of the pragmatism of the men who felt no need to make a bold architectural statement. It was a four-storey mill measuring by , with an attached staircase, counting house and warehouse. It was designed to use water frames which had just come out of patent, and the increased supply of cotton caused by the cessation of the American War of Independence. The water wheel was at the north end of the mill.

The mill was extended in 1796 when it was doubled in length and a fifth floor added. A second wheel was built at the southern end. The mill was extended between 1817 and 1820 and a mansard-roofed wing extended part of the 1796 building forward beneath which the wheel was installed. The new building kept the 1784 detailing with respect to line and windows. The 1784 mill ran 2425 spindles, after 1805 with the new wheel it ran 3452 spindles.

Weaving sheds were added in 1836 and 1838 and they were of two storeys and housed 305 looms. Before the 1830s, spinning mills produced cotton, that was put-out to hand-loom weavers who worked in their own homes or small loom shops, like the one Greg owned at Eyam. Hand-loom weaving continued in parallel to power loom weaving throughout the 19th century. Around 1830 the power loom became sufficiently viable for independent weaving sheds to be set up, and for larger owners to add weaving sheds to their spinning mills. A weaving shed needed the correct light and humidity and a floor that was stable enough to withstand the vibration caused by the picking of many looms. Quarry Bank Mill is of national significance in that it used two-storey side-lit buildings rather the a single storey sheds with a saw-tooth roof. The first two-storey shed at Quarry Bank was by . The 1838 building was by to which a storey was added in 1842 for warping and beaming. In the Gregs pragmatic way, looms were purchased gradually.

===Water power===

The first wheel was a wooden overshot wheel taking water by means of a long leat from upstream on the River Bollin. The second wheel built by Peter Ewart in 1801 was wooden. To increase power he dammed the Bollin and took water into the mill directly, the tailrace leaving the river below the dam. The third wheel of 1807 was a replacement for one of the wooden wheels. It is believed it was a suspension wheel, in diameter made from iron to the design of Thomas Hewes.

The fourth wheel, the &quot;Great Wheel&quot; was also designed by Hewes. The challenge was to increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to below the level of the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant&#x27;s Castle. This gave a head of acting on the diameter suspension wheel- which is wide. The &quot;Great Wheel&quot; operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904.

In 1905 two water turbines built by Gilbert Gilkes and Company were installed to replace the &quot;Great Wheel&quot;. They used the same head and tail race and operated until 1959. When the mill was restored in 1983, a diameter waterwheel of similar design to that of Hewes by his pupil Sir William Fairbairn, was moved from Glasshouses Mill near Pateley Bridge and installed to provide power to work the machinery.

===Steam power===
Water flow from the Bollin was unreliable so an auxiliary steam engine was procured in 1810. It was a 10 hp beam engine from Boulton and Watt. In 1836 with the arrival of power looms a second 20 hp Boulton and Watt beam engine was acquired. The first horizontal condensing engine was acquired in 1871. A new engine house was built. In 1906 the 1871 engine was replaced by a second-hand 60 hp engine. The engines no longer exist and the museum has purchased a similar steam engine to display.

==Profiting from the slave trade==
The Gregs were involved in the triangular trade. Samuel Greg&#x27;s brother-in-law, Thomas Hodgson, owned a slave ship, his father Thomas Greg and his brother John Greg part owned sugar plantations on the Caribbean island of Dominica. The best documented is Hillsborough Estate, Dominica which Samuel Greg and his brother Thomas inherited in 1795. In 1818 it had 71 male and 68 female slaves.

A research document states that &quot;although [Samuel] Greg did not rely on Caribbean estate earnings to finance entry into cotton spinning, his interest in plantations formed part of a wider family engagement in commerce that included significant slave-related business&quot;. &quot;Samuel Greg ... his father Thomas and uncle John had interests in four estates in Dominica and St Vincent, ... while Samuel and his brother Thomas inherited the Hillsborough plantation in Dominica and other estates&quot;, according to a news item. The research document also confirms that Samuel Greg&#x27;s brothers were owners of estates, in the West Indies, where labour was provided by slaves.

In 2020, the National Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the owners of its properties, including the Quarry Bank Mill, who had links to colonialism and slavery. Visitors will find information about the &quot;histories of slavery and colonialism&quot; at the site.

==In popular culture==
The relationship between mill owners and employees at Quarry Bank, starting in 1833, was explored in the 2013–2014 television series &quot;The Mill&quot;. The producers used stories from the archives of the mill; the ten episodes were based on the stories but included some fictional characters.

Some of the exteriors were filmed at the Quarry Bank Mill while others in the city centre of Chester and at Chester Crown Court. 
Interiors of the work in the mill were filmed in Manchester because &quot;the real factory floor couldn’t be easily converted from its contemporary function as a museum&quot;.

In 2020, some scenes for the ITV series &quot;Belgravia&quot; were filmed at the mill.

==Early life and education==
Eyking was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia. His parents, born in Beverwijk (father) and Moergestel (mother), emigrated from the Netherlands to Canada in 1952. Not being able to travel to their city of preference Vancouver due to a lack of funds, they chose to start a business in olericulture in Sydney, where Eyking was born eight years later.

<doc id="600364" wikidata="Q1478144" url="?curid=600364" title="Football in England">
<text>Football is the most popular sport in England. England is home to the world&#x27;s first football league, the oldest national governing body, and the oldest national knockout competition. The first modern rules for the game were established in England in 1863.
England is one of the oldest national football teams, having played in the first international match in 1872. England won the FIFA World Cup in 1966, and has qualified for the World Cup 16 times. England has more football clubs than any other country, including the world&#x27;s first club, Sheffield F.C., and the world&#x27;s oldest professional club, Notts County. England&#x27;s top domestic league, the Premier League, is one of the most popular and richest leagues in the world. 
The British Empire&#x27;s cultural power spread the rules of football to areas of British influence. 
England the home of football, where the first modern set of rules for the code were established in 1863, which were a major influence on the development of the modern Laws of the Game. With over 40,000 association football clubs, England has more clubs involved in the code than any other country. England hosts the world&#x27;s first club, Sheffield F.C.; the world&#x27;s oldest professional association football club, Notts County; the oldest national governing body, the Football Association; the joint-oldest national team; the oldest national knockout competition, the FA Cup; and the oldest national league, the English Football League. It also has 31% of the population interested in Football. Today England&#x27;s top domestic league, the Premier League, is one of the most popular and richest sports leagues in the world, with five of the ten richest football clubs in the world as of 2022.

The England national football team is one of only eight teams to win the FIFA World Cup, having done so once, in 1966. A total of six English club teams have won the UEFA Champions League, formerly known as the European Cup.

==History of the men&#x27;s game==
===Middle Ages===
Football was played in England as far back as medieval times. The first written evidence of a football match came in about 1170, when William Fitzstephen wrote of his visit to London, &quot;After dinner all the youths of the city goes out into the fields for the very popular game of ball.&quot; He also went on to mention that each trade had their own team, &quot;The elders, the fathers, and the men of wealth come on horseback to view the contests of their juniors, and in their fashion sport with the young men; and there seems to be aroused in these elders a stirring of natural heat by viewing so much activity and by participation in the joys of unrestrained youth.&quot; Kicking ball games are described in England from 1280.

In 1314, Edward II, then the King of England, said about a sport of football and the use of footballs, &quot;certain tumults arising from great footballs in the fields of the public, from which many evils may arise.&quot; An account of an exclusively kicking &quot;football&quot; game from Nottinghamshire in the fifteenth century bears similarity to association football. By the 16th centuries references to organised teams and goals had appeared. There is evidence for refereed, team football games being played in English schools since at least 1581. The eighteenth-century Gymnastic Society of London is, arguably, the world&#x27;s first football club.

===19th century developments===

The 19th century saw the codification of the rules of football at several public schools, with those of Rugby School (first published 1845) and Eton College (first published 1847) being particularly influential, in addition to those of Harrow, Winchester and Shrewsbury. The need for alumni of different public schools to be able to play against each other resulted in several sets of &quot;compromise laws&quot;, often known as Cambridge rules, being drawn up at the University of Cambridge between the 1830s and the 1860s.

In the second half of the century, a culture of independent &quot;football clubs&quot; began to thrive. It was through the spread of football in elite social groups that allowed the growth of such clubs. It was common for sons descendant of elite locals to return to their home from school and form their own clubs. In 1894, Charles Miller, a young elite son of a Scottish father and Brazilian mother, returned home after his studies in Southampton with a new profound passion for football. Miller spread this passion of football to his fellow peers in a local athletic club and began to organise local football matches. More importantly, colleges that trained teachers encouraged educators to spread the passion of football and even set up their own football clubs. This encouragement of educators to spread the enthusiasm for football aided in the global diffusion of football. For example, William Leslie Poole, a teacher at the English High School in Montevideo, is acknowledged as the founder of the first football club and league in Uruguay.

Particularly in London and Sheffield, with Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857, is recognised today as the world&#x27;s oldest surviving independent football club. The example of Sheffield F.C., which published its first set of laws in 1859, soon led to a proliferation of clubs in and around the city playing &quot;Sheffield rules&quot;. Sheffield hosted the world&#x27;s first multi-team football tournament, the Youdan Cup, in 1867. In general, each football club, school or university tended to have its own rules, which might differ on such fundamental questions as whether to follow the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried, with players carrying the ball being allowed to be &quot;hacked&quot; (kicked in the shins) by their opponents. The desire of football clubs for a common code was the impetus behind the foundation of the Football Association (FA) in 1863. Within the FA, there was an acrimonious debate between the &quot;hacking&quot; and &quot;non-hacking&quot; clubs. When the first meetings were held to discuss the FA&#x27;s laws of football, the &quot;hackers&quot; were in the ascendancy, but the publication of the 1863 set of Cambridge rules (which forbade hacking) enabled the &quot;non-hackers&quot; to prevail and the FA&#x27;s first Laws of the Game, published in December 1863, banned hacking and carrying the ball. The FA, initially dominated by London-based clubs, saw its influence gradually spread over the country by the success of FA Cup, first contested in the 1871–72 season.
Between 1863 and 2021, the FA and Sheffield rules co-existed, with each code at times influencing the other. Several games were played between Sheffield and London teams, using both sets of rules. After several disputes, the two codes were unified in 1877 when the Sheffield Football Association voted to adopt the FA laws, following the adoption of a compromise throw-in law by the FA. The Sheffield rules had a major influence on how the modern game of football developed. Among other things they introduced into the laws of the game are the concepts of corners, and free kicks for fouls.

International football began when teams representing England and Scotland met in a match at Kennington Oval in south London on 5 March 1870. A total of five games were played between the two teams to 21 February 1872 but they are not recognised as official internationals by FIFA because the Scottish players were all London-based and so not fully representative of Scotland as a nation.

The first official international, Scotland v England, was played on 30 November 1872 at Hamilton Crescent, the West of Scotland Cricket Club&#x27;s ground in Partick, Glasgow. It was a 0–0 draw watched by 4,000 spectators. On 8 March 1873, England&#x27;s 4–2 win over Scotland at Kennington Oval was the first-ever victory in international football.

The late nineteenth century was dominated by the growing split between the amateur and professional teams, which was roughly aligned along a North-South divide. Northern clubs were keen to adopt professionalism as workers could not afford to play on an amateur basis, while Southern clubs by the large part stuck by traditional &quot;Corinthian&quot; values of amateurism. Eventually, in 1885 the FA legalised professionalism, and when Aston Villa director William McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England&#x27;s leading clubs, this led to the formation of the Football League in 1888. Preston North End were inaugural winners in 1888–89 and were also the first club to complete the double of both winning the league and the FA Cup. Aston Villa repeated the feat in 1896–97.

===Early 20th century: Expanding the league===
The League expanded over the next 25 years as football boomed in England, from one division of twelve clubs in 1888, to two divisions by the 1892–93 season, with a total of 28 clubs and with the gradual addition of more clubs, a total of 40 by 1905–06. It remained at 40 until the league was suspended after the 1914–15 season with the outbreak of World War I. During this time clubs from the North and Midlands dominated, with Aston Villa, Sunderland, The Wednesday (later renamed Sheffield Wednesday) and Newcastle United all winning three or more league titles in the period leading up to World War I. Other clubs to win league titles in this period include Sheffield United, Manchester United and Everton. London-based clubs enjoyed little success during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the first major trophy being won by a London-based club being Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s FA Cup triumph in 1901, when they were still a Southern Football League club, although they were elected to the Football League soon after.

During the war, competitive football was suspended. However, an unofficial &quot;Wartime Football league&quot; was played from 1915–16 to 1918–19, although the FA Cup was suspended until after the war.

In the 1920–21 season the Football League was expanded, with the new Third Division, which expanded the league south of Birmingham, which until then had been sparsely represented in the Football League. Each division had 22 clubs. The next season the league was again expanded with the Third Division divided into North (with 20 clubs) and South (with 22 clubs) sections, making a total of 86 clubs in the Football League. In the 1923–24 season the Third Division North was expanded to 22 clubs, making a total of 88 league clubs.

After half a century of cup finals and internationals being hosted at various venues across England, the national stadium at Wembley was opened in 1923, with the &quot;White Horse Final&quot; being the first FA Cup final to be played there. Bolton Wanderers defeated West Ham United to win this landmark game. Bolton Wanderers would win the FA Cup on three occasions during the 1920s.

The inter-war years were dominated by Huddersfield Town, Everton and Arsenal, who won eleven of the eighteen league titles contested between them, with Huddersfield and Arsenal each grabbing a three consecutive titles, and Arsenal taking five in total, as well as two FA Cups. Huddersfield, and then Arsenal, were managed by Herbert Chapman, who moved from Huddersfield to Arsenal after the Yorkshire club&#x27;s second successive title, and died just before Arsenal won their third successive title.

By the turn of the 1930s, the national side regularly played against other national teams from outside the British Isles. However, the FA&#x27;s resignation from FIFA in 1928 meant that England did not contest any of the first three World Cups. The 1939–40 season was abandoned in September 1939 following the outbreak of World War II. However, as with World War I, a special wartime league was played throughout the war years, with the FA Cup again suspended. Ten regional &quot;mini-leagues&quot; were initially established in 1939 as well as the Football League War Cup which ran six seasons from 1939 to 1945 with West Ham United, Preston North End, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackpool, and Bolton Wanderers winning the trophy while in 1943–44 Aston Villa and Charlton Athletic shared the trophy after drawing 1–1. Various leagues and cups, mostly on a regional basis, were organised throughout the war years for five seasons until the FA Cup resumed in 1945–46. The Football League returned the following season.

===Late 20th century: World War II aftermath===

The English national team suffered two shock defeats in the early 1950s: a 1–0 loss to the United States at the 1950 World Cup and a 6–3 defeat to Hungary at Wembley in 1953. However, Wolverhampton Wanderers defeated the Hungarian club Budapest Honvéd, a match which inspired the creation of the European Cup. Chelsea were dissuaded from participating in the first season of the European Cup in 1955–56, but Manchester United ignored such advice and went on to reach the semi-final of the 1956–57 edition, losing to the eventual winners Real Madrid. In the following season&#x27;s European Cup, Manchester United were involved in the Munich air disaster: this also affected the national team as three of the players who died – Roger Byrne, Tommy Taylor and Duncan Edwards – were established England internationals. Their manager Matt Busby was seriously injured but survived; he had already taken United to FA Cup glory in 1948 and another league title triumph in 1952 with an earlier side which featured the likes of Johnny Carey, Jack Rowley and Stan Pearson.

Two English teams, a London XI and Birmingham City, both lost to Barcelona in the first two finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1958 and 1960.

Wolverhampton Wanderers were another highly successful English club side during the postwar years. Under the management of Stan Cullis, they were league champions three times and FA Cup winners twice between 1949 and 1960. Although they failed to make a major impact in either of their European Cup campaigns, they did beat some of European football&#x27;s most respected club sides in a series of friendlies at Molineux Stadium during the 1950s. Arsenal continued their run of success for several years after the resumption of league football, winning two league titles and an FA Cup between 1948 and 1953. Their North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur won the league title for the first time in 1951, and by the end of the decade were challenging for honors once again under new manager Bill Nicholson and captain Danny Blanchflower. Another London club, Chelsea, won the league title in 1955. Newcastle United were FA Cup winners three times in the 1950s, while Portsmouth won back-to-back league titles in the early postwar years.

The Football League was reorganised for the 1958–59 season with Third Divisions North and South discontinued. The top half of each regional Third Division from the previous season formed a new Third Division, while the lower halves formed the new Fourth Division. Modernisation followed in the 1960s, with revolutions in the game such as the George Eastham case allowing players greater freedom of movement, and the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961.

Tottenham Hotspur became the first club to win the Double in the 20th century in 1960–61, retained the FA Cup the following season, and then became the first English club to win a European trophy, the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1962–63 when they beat Atlético Madrid 5–1 in the final. Manager Bill Nicholson then built another successful Tottenham side which lifted a further FA Cup in 1967.

The most marked success of the era, however, was Alf Ramsey&#x27;s England team, which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup on home soil after controversially beating West Germany 4–2 after extra time, the only time the national team has won the trophy.

In the late 1960s English clubs dominated the last years of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, with wins for Leeds United, Newcastle United and Arsenal. Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup in 1967–68 when they beat Benfica 4–1 at Wembley in the final. Liverpool (four), Nottingham Forest (two), and Aston Villa (one) won the European Cup in a successful period between 1977 and 1984.

The first half of the 1960s saw the promotion of two sides to the First Division who would achieve great success as this level for many years afterwards: Liverpool (in 1962) and Leeds United (in 1964). Liverpool, managed by Bill Shankly, won the league title in 1964, two seasons after promotion, and followed this up with their first-ever FA Cup triumph a year later and a further league title in 1966. Among their players was Roger Hunt, who played in attack for England&#x27;s World Cup winning side of 1966. Leeds United had appointed Don Revie, an FA Cup winner for Manchester City as a player in 1956, as their new manager in 1961, and he guided them to promotion in 1964. A year after promotion, they only missed out on the league title on goal average, finally winning it in 1969, by which time they had already won the Football League Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

Manchester United also faced competition from their local rivals Manchester City, who overcame a dismal first half of the decade (which included three seasons in the Second Division) to pip United to the league title in 1968, win the FA Cup in 1969 and claim their first piece of European silverware in 1970 when they lifted the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

West Ham United also played a major role in English football in the 1960s. They won their first silverware in 1964 when they won the FA Cup, and went on to win the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup a year later. In 1966, they provided three key players in England&#x27;s World Cup winning side – goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters as well as captain Bobby Moore.

Liverpool enjoyed even more success during the 1970s. They won a further league title, FA Cup and the UEFA Cup before the retirement of Bill Shankly as manager in 1974. His successor Bob Paisley took Liverpool to even greater heights; by the end of the decade, he had guided them to three league titles, another UEFA Cup triumph, and the club&#x27;s first two European Cups. Liverpool&#x27;s local rivals Everton, who had been league champions in 1963 and FA Cup winners in 1966, began the 1970s by winning another league titles, but failed to add any silverware to their list of honors for the rest of the decade, although they did hold onto their place in the First Division. Arsenal started the 1970s on a winning note by lifting the penultimate Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and then became the second team of the 20th century to win the double when they clinched the league title and FA Cup in 1971. Their next major trophy came in 1979, when they fought off a late revival from Manchester United at Wembley to win the FA Cup final 3–2.

Leeds United added a further league title and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as well as their first FA Cup, before Don Revie departed to take over as manager of the England national football team in the summer of 1974, after the Football Association terminated Sir Alf Ramsey&#x27;s contract after 11 years, following England&#x27;s failure to qualify for the World Cup.

Although Leeds United were still in the First Division at the decade&#x27;s end, they failed to win any trophies after Revie left the club. The England team, meanwhile, continued to struggle, failing to qualify for the 1978 World Cup, with Revie defecting to coach the United Arab Emirates side just before this latest disappointment. Things began turn around under his successor Ron Greenwood, who ended the decade by securing England&#x27;s qualification for the 1980 European Championships, the first major tournament England had qualified for in 10 years.

Derby County, promoted to the First Division in 1969 after a lengthy absence, emerged as a force during the 1970s, winning the league title in 1972 under the controversial but effective management of Brian Clough, and again in 1975 under Clough&#x27;s successor Dave Mackay. Clough, after a disastrous 44-day spell as Don Revie&#x27;s successor at Leeds United, enjoyed even greater success at Nottingham Forest, taking the East Midlands club to promotion in 1977, the league title and League Cup in 1978 and to a further League Cup and the European Cup in 1979, before retaining their European crown in 1980. During this run of outstanding success, Clough also shelled out British football&#x27;s first £1million transfer fee for the Birmingham City forward Trevor Francis, who signed for Forest in February 1979. Also among his acquisitions was the goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who went on to win a record of 125 full caps for England.
The rise of football hooliganism marred the game throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which contributed to a decline in match attendance. Other factors in falling attendances were the dismal economic conditions and rising unemployment which plagued the British economy for most of the 1970s and into the 1980s, with many clubs in the north of England being hit particularly hard.

Many of English football&#x27;s most famous and successful clubs reached low ebbs during the 1970s and 1980s, in many cases at least partly due to financial problems. Preston North End and Blackpool both fell into the Fourth Division and had to apply for re-election to the Football League between 1982 and 1986. Wolverhampton Wanderers found themselves on the verge of closure twice during the 1980s and suffered three successive relegation which pushed them into the Fourth Division in 1986. Their local rivals Birmingham City dropped into the Third Division for the first time in 1989. Sunderland suffered the same fate as Birmingham two years previously, but achieved promotion at the first attempt and were soon challenging for a return to the First Division, while Wolves ended the decade back in the Second Division after two successive promotions. Bolton Wanderers, four times FA Cup winners, were relegated to the Fourth Division in 1987, but were promoted at the first time of asking.

In August 1974, a Blackpool fan was stabbed to death at the back of the Spion Kop, Bloomfield Road at Blackpool&#x27;s home match with Bolton Wanderers. It was widely reported as being the first hooligan death at an English football match, and other clubs who gained notorious reputations for hooliganism during the 1970s and 1980s included Chelsea, Millwall, West Ham United, and Leeds United. The nadir came in May 1985, when Liverpool fans hooliganism, combined with poor policing and infrastructure, led to the deaths of 39 Juventus fans before the European Cup final, in the Heysel Stadium disaster. The sequel to the tragedy was a ban on English clubs in European competitions, which was not lifted for five years. Due to the ban, many English star players transferred to continental clubs. England&#x27;s ageing and poorly built stadiums were responsible for two disasters, at Bradford in May 1985 (just before the Heysel tragedy) and Hillsborough in April 1989, resulting in the deaths of 56 and 97 people respectively.

In 1986–87 automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and non-league was introduced, with the bottom club in the league being relegated to the Conference. The first club to suffer automatic relegation from the Football League was Lincoln City, who were replaced by the GM Vauxhall Conference champions Scarborough, only to regain their league status a year later. That first relegation place in 1987 had very nearly been occupied by Burnley, league champions 27 years earlier and First Division members until just over a decade earlier, but victory in their final league game of the season secured their league survival.

Another major change which took place in English football during the second half of the 1980s was a restructuring of the divisions. During the 1986 close season, the Football League decided to reduce the First Division to 21 clubs for the 1987–88 season and finally to 20 clubs for the 1988–89 season, while the Second Division would be increased to 23 and finally to 24 clubs in the process. End-of-season promotion/relegation playoffs were introduced for these two transitional seasons, before the playoffs were established as promotion-only deciders from the end of the 1988–89 season onward, with the previously two-legged final being altered to a single match at Wembley from 1990 onward.

The 1970s saw the FA Cup won twice by Second Division clubs, the first time in the postwar era that the trophy had been won by a club outside the First Division. First, Sunderland lifted the trophy in 1973 at the expense of Leeds United. Three years later, Southampton defeated Manchester United to claim the first silverware of their history. In 1980, the trophy was won by a Second Division club for the third time in eight seasons when West Ham United triumphed over holders Arsenal.

The 1980s saw five different clubs reach the First Division for the first time. In 1981, Swansea City reached the First Division after climbing from the Fourth Division in just four seasons – the fastest rise of any club throughout the league at the time. They topped the First Division more than once during the 1981–82 season before finishing sixth. However, Swansea&#x27;s successive story was short-lived, and their second season among the elite ended in relegation, and by 1986 they were back in the Fourth Division, having narrowly avoided going out of business. In 1982, Watford reached the First Division under the chairmanship of Elton John, management of Graham Taylor, and with the scoring prowess of Luther Blissett and John Barnes in attack. They finished runners-up in the league in their first top division season and were FA Cup runners-up in their second, and survived in the First Division until 1988. Taylor later managed the England team, while Barnes went on to help Liverpool win five major trophies and was a regular member of the England side for the second half of the 1980s and into the 1990s. 1985 saw the promotion of Oxford United to the First Division, 23 years after being elected to the Football League. They survived for three seasons in the First Division and won the League Cup in their first season among the elite. An even bigger success story emerged soon after Oxford&#x27;s First Division arrival, when Wimbledon won promotion to the First Division in 1986, a mere nine years after being elected to the Football League. They quickly established themselves in the First Division, finishing sixth in their first season at this level, and even more impressively won the FA Cup a year later, beating league champions Liverpool 1–0 in the Wembley final. Wimbledon would enjoy the longest stay in the top flight of any of the First Division&#x27;s new arrivals of the 1980s, retaining their tenancy at this level for 14 years. 1988 saw Millwall reach the First Division for the first time. Tipped by many to go straight back down, they actually topped the First Division briefly in its early stages before finishing 10th – the lowest position they occupied all season. They briefly went top of the league again during the second month of the following season, but finished the season relegated after just two seasons in the First Division.

Eventually, promotion and relegation between the Conference and the Football League was increased to two clubs in 2002–03. In the 1980s, play-offs were introduced throughout the Football League for promotion each season, with one club each season being promoted via the end of season play-offs in addition to those clubs promoted automatically.

Liverpool remained the most successful club side in England during the 1980s, winning the league title six times and the FA Cup twice (including the double in 1986). They also won four successive League Cups, and before the Heysel disaster they won the European Cup in 1981 and again in 1984, bringing their total number of victories in European football&#x27;s biggest competition to four.

Everton also enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s. Following the appointment of Howard Kendall as manager in 1981 and the signing of inspirational striker Andy Gray in November 1983, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and enjoyed even more success a year later, when they lifted the league title and their first European trophy – the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Although they failed to win any trophies in 1986, they did finish runners-up to Liverpool in the league and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 3–1 to their close neighbours, in a season where Gray&#x27;s successor in attack, Gary Lineker, found the net more than 40 times in all competitions. Despite the sale of Lineker to Barcelona in the summer of 1986, Everton retained their league title the following season.

Manchester United endured a difficult time in the 1970s following the retirement of Matt Busby as manager. They suffered relegation to the Second Division in 1974, but achieved instant promotion and went on to win the FA Cup in 1977. The 1980s brought more success for the club, who won the FA Cup in 1983 and again in 1985 under the management of Ron Atkinson. They were captained by Bryan Robson, who also captained the England team for much of the decade, and had been Britain&#x27;s most expensive footballer on his £1.5million arrival at the club in October 1981. Atkinson was succeeded by Alex Ferguson as manager in November 1986, but by the end of the decade United had gone more than 20 years without winning the league title, although they had finished in the top four on no less than seven times during the decade.

Tottenham Hotspur also enjoyed success during the 1970s and 1980s. They won the League Cup twice during the early 1970s as well as the inaugural UEFA Cup in 1972, but suffered relegation to the Second Division in 1977. They achieved instant promotion under recently appointed manager Keith Burkinshaw, who then guided Spurs to back-to-back FA Cups and then another UEFA Cup triumph before stepping down as manager in 1984. Their North London rivals Arsenal won the League Cup in 1987 and ended their 18-year wait for the league title in 1989, when they beat Liverpool at Anfield in the final minute of the last game of the season to clinch the championship trophy on goals scored.

The summer of 1988 saw the first £2million+ transfer fees paid by British clubs. Tottenham Hotspur signed 21-year-old PFA Young Player of the Year Paul Gascoigne from Newcastle United, before Everton swooped for high-scoring forward Tony Cottee from West Ham United. After spending an unsuccessful season in Italy with Juventus, Ian Rush headed back to Liverpool for a second spell with the club he had scored more than 200 goals from during his first spell there.

The England team made considerable progress during the 1980s after the barren performances of the previous decade, qualifying for every major tournament between 1980 and 1990, with the exception of the 1984 European Championships, although their best run in any of these competitions was a quarter-final appearance at the 1986 World Cup.

The post-Hillsborough Taylor Report forced the conversion of major to all-seater, which was a requirement at all clubs in the top divisions by the 1994–95 season. At the same time, the money from television coverage was increasing rapidly, due to England reaching the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup and a concerted effort to drive out hooliganism reinvigorated the national game. The ban on English clubs in European competitions was lifted in July 1990, although Liverpool still had to serve an additional year and it would be a further five years before all of the English places in European competitions were restored.

Manchester United marked a winning return for English clubs in European competitions by winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1991, having lifted the FA Cup a year earlier. Enjoying a run of success under Alex Ferguson, they clinched the League Cup in the 1991–92 season, although a shortage of goals in the second half of that season did cost them the league title, which was instead won by a resurgent Leeds United. Liverpool also enjoyed a good start to the 1990s, winning their 18th league title in 1990, but were then stunned by the resignation of Kenny Dalglish as manager in February 1991. His successor Graeme Souness, who had enjoyed great success with the club as a player a decade earlier, guided the Reds to FA Cup glory in 1992.

Arsenal, the 1989 champions of the English First Division, won another league title in 1991, losing just once all season. The FA Cup also headed to North London that year, although it was won by Tottenham Hotspur, who lifted the trophy for a record eighth time.

In the last season of the English Football League being the highest division, Leeds United won their first league title ever since 1974.

=== 1992–present: Premier League era===
In the 1991–92 season, following two years of widespread speculation about the leading clubs of English football forming a breakaway league from the Football League, the 22 clubs competing in the First Division resigned &quot;en masse&quot; from the Football League, forming a new top-level competition, The FA Premier League, overseen by the FA, largely to capitalise upon their status as the biggest and most wealthy clubs in the country, and negotiate more profitable television rights. The new league came into force for the 1992–93 season. The Football League was consequently reorganised, with the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions renamed as the First, Second and Third Divisions respectively. Thus, the First Division, while still the top level of the Football League, became the second level of the entire English football league system with the top clubs inheriting the promotion play-off system from the old Second Division. The Premier League was reduced to 20 teams after the 1994–95 season.

The Premier League has been won by seven clubs in its 30 seasons, with Manchester United winning on 13 occasions. They have set many precedents in the process, becoming the first team to win a second double of the league title and FA Cup in 1996 (their first double being won in 1994), and in 1999 they won a unique treble of the league title, FA Cup and European Cup. English clubs have also won European tournaments since being permitted to compete after the Heysel disaster, the first English team to win the UEFA Champions League being Manchester United in 1999. The 2008 final, for the first time, was played between two English teams, Manchester United and Chelsea. Manchester United won the final in Moscow on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

The early Premier League years saw the transfer record fee in English football broken many times in a relatively short period of time, and rise at a rate barely comparable with even that of the late 1970s. The biggest fee paid by an English club during the Football League era was the £2.9million paid by Liverpool for Dean Saunders in July 1991. The national record was broken the following summer when Blackburn Rovers paid £3.3million for Alan Shearer. The national record was broken again in June 1993 when Manchester United signed Roy Keane for £3.75million. Blackburn then broke the national record in the 1994 close season by signing 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton for £5million. In 1995, the record fee was broken three times in the space of six months. At the turn of the year, Andy Cole arrived at Manchester United in a deal worth £7million. After the season&#x27;s end, Arsenal paid £7.5million to Inter Milan for Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp, but Bergkamp had just spent days with his new club when Liverpool paid £8.5million for Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore. A year later, Alan Shearer became the most expensive player not only in England but in the world when he left Blackburn Rovers to sign for Newcastle United in a £15million deal. This fee, however, remained unsurpassed for more than four years. Premier League clubs have been increasingly successful at attracting foreign players, particularly since the removal of the limit on fielding players from common market countries in the mid-1990s.

The first decade of the premier league was dominated by Manchester United who won the championship in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and then won again in 2003 and in 1999 completed a continental treble. After a hiatus during which United manager Alex Ferguson rebuilt his squad United went on to win further titles in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013. The first team to interrupt Manchester United&#x27;s early dominance were Blackburn Rovers, who won the title by a single point in 1995. They had only returned to the top flight of English football in 1992, in time for the new league&#x27;s formation, after a 26-year exile, bankrolled by the wealth of steel baron owner Jack Walker, who had enabled Blackburn to compete for some of the best players in English football however following their title success their performances declined. Under Arsène Wenger, Arsenal have so far been Premier League champions three times; in 1998, 2002 and 2004. On the first two occasions, they completed the double of the league title and FA Cup, while on the third occasion they won the title without losing a single league game all season. Chelsea made history in 1997 when they won the FA Cup under Dutch manager Ruud Gullit, the first foreign manager to win a major trophy in English football. They won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and League Cup a year later under Gullit&#x27;s successor Gianluca Vialli, who added a further FA Cup in 2000. Chelsea&#x27;s biggest successes however, have come since the arrival of new Russian owner Roman Abramovich in June 2003 and the appointment of Portuguese coach José Mourinho as manager 12 months later. Mourinho was in charge for more than three years until his sudden departure from the club in September 2007, before returning for a second spell as manager six years later (which lasted two years before getting sacked in December 2015). In the interim, Chelsea were managed by seven different managers over the course of six seasons, but continued to win trophies on a regular basis. Since Abramovich&#x27;s takeover of Chelsea, the West London club have been Premier League champions five times, FA Cup winners four times and League Cup winners three times, and have also won the European Cup and the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup). Manchester City, bankrolled since August 2008 by wealthy Arab owners, ended their 35-year wait for a major trophy by winning the FA Cup in 2011, and then won their first league title in 44 years the following season, both under the management of Italian coach Roberto Mancini. His Chilean successor Manuel Pellegrini became the first non-European manager to win a major trophy in English football when he guided City to the Premier League title and the League Cup in 2014. Further titles followed under Spanish coach Pep Guardiola along with further domestic trophies including a domestic treble and in 2023 the European Cup. After narrowly avoiding relegation the previous season, outsiders Leicester City won an unprecedented league title in 2016, having never previously won the top flight title. The winning squad was worth just one-tenth of that of Manchester City&#x27;s. For much of the premier league era Liverpool struggled to recapture their form of the previous decades and did not win a league championship until 2020 though in the meantime they won other domestic trophies, the UEFA Cup and two further European Cups. Leeds United, the last champions of English football before the creation of the Premier League, played in the first 12 seasons of the Premier League, peaking at third place in 2000, before being relegated in 2004 in the midst of a serious financial crisis which was the direct result of heavy spending on players in the previous few seasons and a failure to net the extra revenue that successful challenges for domestic and European silverware would have brought them. They would not return to the Premier League until more than a decade later, guided by Marcelo Bielsa to champions of the 2020/2021 EFL championship season.

Since the creation of the Premier League, a number of England&#x27;s leading clubs have relocated to new stadiums. After several smaller clubs adopted this approach rather than update their ageing homes in the late 1980s and early 1990s, newly promoted Middlesbrough became the first top flight club to relocate to a new stadium when they moved into the Riverside Stadium for the 1995–96 season, ending a 92-year residence of Ayresome Park. Two years later, Middlesbrough&#x27;s north-east rivals Sunderland left their historic Roker Park home for the new 42,000-seat Stadium of Light (which has since been expanded to hold nearly 50,000 seated fans) on the banks of the River Wear. Also in 1997, Derby County, Stoke City and Bolton Wanderers all moved into new all-seater stadiums.

A number of clubs who initially chose to convert their existing homes into all-seater stadiums went on to relocate to new stadiums to gain a larger capacity from the turn of the 21st century, particularly those who had progressed throughout the league and attracted a higher demand for tickets since the early 1990s. Southampton relocated to St Mary&#x27;s Stadium in 2001 after more than 100 years at The Dell, with their new 32,000-seat stadium holding more than twice as many fans as their previous home had during its final years, as an all-seater stadium. Leicester City relocated to the Walkers Stadium (now known as the King Power Stadium) in 2002 after 111 years at Filbert Street. Having originally decided to stay at Maine Road, which was redeveloped to hold 35,000 seated fans by 1995, Manchester City moved into the City of Manchester Stadium (built for the previous year&#x27;s Commonwealth games) at the start of the 2003–04 season. Arsenal had converted Highbury into an all-seater stadium capable of holding just under 39,000 fans by 1993, but within five years the club&#x27;s owners had decided that such a capacity was inadequate and, after local residents objected to any expansion of Highbury (parts of which were listed structures) and a bid to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association was rejected, decided to build a new stadium at nearby Ashburton Grove. Their new stadium, the Emirates Stadium, was completed in time for the 2006–07 season, holding more than 60,000 spectators. West Ham United moved from the Boleyn Ground into the ~60,000 capacity Olympic Stadium at the end of the 2015–16 season.

The beginning of the new century also saw the construction of a new national stadium at Wembley. The old Wembley Stadium had been converted to an all-seater format by 1989, but its capacity was reduced to 78,000 from its previous capacity of 100,000. By the mid-1990s, plans were afoot for refurbishment or complete reconstruction of the stadium. The eventual plan was for the old stadium to be demolished and a completely new 90,000-seat stadium to be built in its place. The old stadium finally closed in October 2000 and it was anticipated that the new stadium would be completed in 2003, but a series of delays meant that demolition of the old stadium did not take place for two years after the last game was played, and the new Wembley was not opened until March 2007.

==Men&#x27;s League system==
The English Football League, established in 1888 as The Football League by Aston Villa director William McGregor and renamed &quot;English Football League&quot; in 2016, was the first professional football league in the world. Since its founding, however, many other leagues have been founded in England. Sunday leagues are played each weekend by clubs, the study made by the FA sees to this. Over the years there has been an increasing effort to link all these leagues together in a pyramidal structure allowing promotion and relegation between different levels. The primary motivation for this drive is to maintain the possibility that any club in England may dream of one day rising to the very top, no matter what status they currently hold. In a study made by FIFA in 2006 there are around 40,000 clubs registered with the FA, which is 11,000 more than any other country, the closest being the Brazilian Football Confederation who have 29,000 registered clubs. Even without taking relative population into account, England has more football clubs than any other country in the world.

Traditionally men&#x27;s league fixtures are played on Saturdays at 3pm, although more recently high-profile matches are played across weekend afternoons and evenings to allow television broadcasts. European fixtures are typically played on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings.

===Premier League===
The Premier League was founded in 1992 after England&#x27;s top clubs broke away from the Football League in a successful effort aimed at increasing their income at the expense of clubs in the lower divisions. Links with The Football League were maintained, and each season the bottom three clubs are relegated from the Premier League and replaced by the top three from the Championship. The Premier League is contested between 20 clubs each season. Each club in the Premier League in any given season owns one twentieth of a share in the league itself, meaning that they are all supposedly equal owners with equal rights and responsibilities. Some of the famous clubs in the premier league include Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, with an estimated global audience of over 4.7 billion people. It is also the richest football league in the world, with clubs spending billions of dollars each year on players, wages, and transfer fees.

===English Football League===
Although the oldest league in the world, the English Football League (EFL) now ranks second in the hierarchy of English football since the split of England&#x27;s top clubs in 1992 to form the FA Premier League. The EFL has 72 member clubs evenly divided among three divisions, currently named the Championship, League One and League Two. Despite the organizational split, promotion and relegation of clubs still takes place between the Premier League and the EFL.

===National League===
Clubs not playing within either the Premier League or the three levels of the English Football League are commonly stated to be playing &quot;non-League football&quot;. This use of the term non-league can be confusing, as these lower-level clubs do indeed play with in organized league structures, but these lower-level leagues are outside of the Premier and English Football Leagues; hence the term &quot;non-league&quot; football.

In recent years, the top few levels have been consolidated into the National League System, operated by the FA. Most clubs in the National League division are fully professional.

There is promotion and relegation between League Two and the National League, and for several levels below that, although this becomes more irregular further down the league system. The non-League system is often known as the &quot;pyramid&quot;, because the number of leagues at each level begins to increase the further down through the levels, with each league covering a smaller geographic area.

===Amateur===

Although the FA abandoned a formal definition of &quot;amateur&quot; in the early 1970s, the vast majority of clubs still effectively play as amateurs, with no financial reward.

Regional

They are three leagues at a regional level; Northern Premier League, Isthmian League and Southern League. Each have a top and multiple, single level, lower divisions.

County

The various County Football Associations, which are based roughly on the historic county boundaries, are the local governing bodies of football in England. They govern all aspects of Sunday league football. Not all County Football Associations are run on county basis. Each armed service has one, for instance such as the Army Football Association which administers football within the British Army.

The Amateur Football Alliance (AFA) is the largest organized amateur competition, being particularly strong in the London area. The AFA is also a County Football Association and as such governs leagues such as the Arthurian League which contains two former FA Cup winners, Old Etonians who won the FA Cup twice, in 1879 and 1882 as well as Old Carthusians who were FA Cup winners in 1881.

===Sunday League===

Sunday league football in England tends to be lower level amateur football, which is also sometimes referred to as Pub League due to the number of public houses who field teams in Sunday leagues. Each local County Football Association governs all aspects of Sunday league football.

===Scaled-down teams===
Smaller-sided versions of the game such as Five-a-side football are popular. Futsal is also a growing sport in England. These are often played informally, but there are many competitive small-sided leagues running across the country.

===Reserve leagues===
The top division for reserve teams of professional clubs is the Premier Reserve League, which was founded in 1999 and is split into Premier Reserve League North and Premier Reserve League South, both with ten participating teams.

Beneath that operate the Central League for Football League clubs reserve teams in the Midlands and North of England, and the Football Combination for clubs from the South of England and Wales.

The Central League was formed in 1911 and currently has 28 teams, split into three divisions – Central, North and South. The winners of each division and the best runner-up compete in the end-of-season play-offs to decide the league champions. Whilst the Central League is for Football League reserve teams, The West Division contains a Manchester City side which uses a mix of reserve team and youth team squad players and in 2007–08 they were Central League champions. The Central League also organises the Central League Cup, although not all clubs enter the cup.

The Football Combination was formed in 1915 and currently has 30 teams. The Combination is also split into three divisions – East, Central and Wales &amp; East. Whilst the majority of teams are Football League reserve teams, the Combination also currently has the reserve teams of two National League sides, Lewes, and Salisbury City. The Football Combination also organises the Combination Challenge Cup, although not all clubs enter the cup.

There is no promotion and relegation between the reserve team leagues. When a first team is relegated from the Premier League, their reserve team withdraws from the Premier Reserve League to either of the other two leagues and is replaced by the reserve team of the club promoted from the Championship.

Below the professional club reserve leagues, many clubs also operate reserve teams, which play in separate Reserve leagues, such as the Lancashire League. Some lower leagues, such as the North West Counties Football League organised their own reserve leagues. And, at some lower levels of the pyramid, reserve teams play against first teams.

===Youth leagues===
Many club sides have youth teams. The top level of youth football is the Premier Academy League, founded in 1997, which is for all Premier League and Football League clubs that have Academy sides. The league, which currently has 40 clubs, is divided into four groups each with ten teams. The winners of each group contest the end-of-season play-offs to decide the league champions.

The second tier youth league is the Football League Youth Alliance, also founded in 1997, in which those Football League clubs that have Centres of Excellence status field their youth teams. The league, which currently has 58 clubs, is divided into four regional conference leagues. The Youth Alliance also operate the annual Youth Alliance Cup.

The FA Youth Cup is a nationwide cup competition for Under-18 teams organised by the FA. Over 400 clubs enter the FA Youth Cup each season.

==Men&#x27;s Cup competitions==
There are several cup competitions for clubs at different levels of the football pyramid. The two major cup competitions are the FA Cup and the EFL Cup, with the winners of the FA Cup qualifying for the UEFA Europa League and winners of the EFL Cup qualifying for the UEFA Conference League.
*The FA Cup, first held in 1871, is the oldest national cup competition in the world. It is open to around 600 clubs in levels 1–10 of the football pyramid.
*The FA Community Shield (formerly Charity Shield), first held in 1908, is a single match played each August between the FA Cup winners and the Premier League champions.
*The EFL Cup (currently known as the Carabao Cup), first held in 1960, is England&#x27;s second major cup competition, and is contested by the 92 Premier League and EFL clubs.
*The EFL Trophy (currently known as the Bristol Street Motors Trophy), first held in 1983, is a competition for the 48 clubs in Football League One and Football League Two, and 16 Premier League and Championship under-23 sides.
*The FA Trophy, first held in 1969, is for clubs playing in levels 5–8 of the football pyramid (steps 1–4 of the National League System), i.e. the twelve divisions of the National League, the Southern Football League, the Isthmian League and the Northern Premier League.
*The FA Vase, first held in 1974, is for clubs in levels 9–10 of the football pyramid (steps 5–6 of the National League System)
*The FA Inter-League Cup (NLS Cup) was formed in the 2003–04 to provide an English representative in the UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup. It is contested by representative sides from leagues at level 11 of the English football pyramid (level 7 of the National League System), which is roughly the county level, together with a few other leagues permitted by the FA. The first winner of the NLS Cup was the Mid Cheshire League, who beat the Cambridgeshire County League 2–0 in May 2004.
*A number of lower leagues organise their own cup competitions, such as the North West Counties Football League who run a League Cup and a Division One Trophy.
*Many County Football Associations organise their own cup competitions involving Premier League and Football League clubs as well as non-league clubs in some counties. Most league clubs tend to use reserve or youth teams whereas non-league clubs will use their first team. County cups include the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup, which is one of the oldest surviving cup competitions in the world, the Birmingham Senior Cup which began in 1875 with its first final in 1876 making it the oldest known surviving regional football cup competition in the world and which has featured all of the major West Midlands clubs over the years with Aston Villa winning a record number of times, the Lancashire Senior Cup which is competed for by Premier League and Football League clubs from the historic county of Lancashire, including Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Everton and Burnley, along with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Bolton Wanderers, Blackpool, Preston North End, Oldham Athletic, Rochdale, Bury and Morecambe. The Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy is for senior non-league clubs in the same county. Everton, Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers enter the Liverpool Senior Cup using their reserve or youth teams, along with local Merseyside non-league clubs, such as Burscough and Marine. Other competitions include the London Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Cup.
*The FA Sunday Cup began in 1964 and is a national knockout competition for all Sunday league teams. The 2008 final was played at Anfield.
*The AFA Senior Cup is an amateur football competition organised by the Amateur Football Alliance and contested by the first teams of clubs affiliated to the Alliance.
* Although not an FA-affiliated contest, the Masters Football contest is a contest between former players and is refereed by former Premier League Referees

There have also been a number of other cup competitions which are no longer run:
*FA Amateur Cup (1893–1974) was for all teams outside the Football League, which in theory were amateur
*Sheriff of London Charity Shield (1898–1907, 1931–1934 and 1965–66) was an early predecessor to the Community Shield
*Anglo-Italian Cup (1970–1973, 1976–1986 and 1992–1996) also involved Italian clubs
*Anglo-Italian League Cup (1969–1971, 1975–1976) involving FA Cup or League Cup winners and the Coppa Italia winners
*Watney Cup (1970–1973) was an invitational tournament for select clubs across Football League divisions
*Texaco Cup (1971–1975) was an invitational tournament also involving teams from Scotland and all Ireland
*Anglo-Scottish Cup (1975–1981)
*Super Cup (1985) 
*Full Members Cup (1985–1992) was for clubs in levels 1–2 and ended with the Premier League separation.
*The Conference League Cup (1979–2009) was for clubs in level 5–6 i.e. the three divisions of the Football Conference.

===Current national cup eligibility===
== Most successful men&#x27;s clubs ==

The most successful men&#x27;s football club of all time are Liverpool with a total of 69 competitive honours, closely followed by Manchester United with 68 honours. The next two most successful are Arsenal and Manchester City.

In the all-time league table since 1888–89, Liverpool are once again the most successful club in terms of points achieved. This is followed by Arsenal, Everton, Manchester United, and Aston Villa.

==The popularity of Premier League clubs==

Many successful Premier League clubs are also successful on social media with a large international fanbase. Six of the top 20 most popular football clubs on social media in the world, as of 28 September 2023, are from England:
==UEFA qualification==
From the 2015–16 season, the various permutations allow for a maximum of five English clubs to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and five for the UEFA Europa League. From the 2018–19 season, the top four clubs in Europe&#x27;s four highest ranked leagues qualify directly to the group stages. These leagues are currently England, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. The minimum quota is for four English clubs to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and three for the UEFA Europa League.

==National teams==

The England national football team represents England in international football. It is one of the two oldest national football teams in the world, the other one being Scotland. England is one of only eight national teams to have won the World Cup and did this in 1966. They are one of the more prominent teams on the global stage, rarely dropping outside of the top ten rankings of both FIFA and Elo. They were the most successful of the Home Nations in the British Home Championship with 54 wins (including 20 shared wins) before the competition was suspended in 1984.

There are also a number of other national teams from the Under-16 team to the Under-21 team, the latter of which is considered to be a feeder team for the national team. In addition there is an England B team which occasionally plays games as support for the national team. The England C team (formerly the England National Game XI and the England Semi-Professional team) represents England at non-league level. They compete annually in the Four Nations Tournament as well as in friendly matches throughout the year.

==Women&#x27;s football==
The first recorded women&#x27;s football match in England was more than 100 years ago. Women&#x27;s football was very popular for many years, but it was stopped by a ban made by the Football Association from 1921 to 1962.

Women&#x27;s football in England is organised into a pyramid system similar to the men&#x27;s game. It has seven tiers, with the FA Women&#x27;s Super League (FA WSL), launched in 2011, at the top.

==Stadiums==

===Capacity===
Wembley Stadium is the national stadium in England. It is also the largest stadium in the country with a capacity of 90,000. It is owned by the FA and stages England home matches, the FA Cup final and semi-finals, English Football League Cup final, English Football League Trophy, FA Trophy, FA Vase as well as the Promotion play-off finals of the English Football League and the Conference National. Old Trafford with a capacity of 76,212 is the largest club stadium, with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium holding 62,850 and Emirates Stadium holding 60,355. All Premier League clubs play in all-seater stadiums. Most professional clubs have either moved to new purpose-built stadiums or redeveloped their stadium. Even at non-league level there have been big improvements with the likes of New Bucks Head the home of Telford United with a capacity of 6,300, being one of the best in non-league and Princes Park with a capacity of 4,100, the home of Dartford, one of the most ecologically sound ever built.

===Ownership===
Some clubs moved out of their old stadiums into newly developed council built and owned stadiums, where they are tenants. Clubs include Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium, which is owned by Doncaster Council, and Hull City at the KC Stadium, which is owned by Hull City Council. Coventry City&#x27;s home ground of the Ricoh Arena was a council-built stadium originally owned jointly by City Council and the Alan Edward Higgs Charity, but it has since been purchased by the rugby union club Wasps.

===Visiting all league club stadiums===
The 92 Club is a society, to be a member of which, a person must attend a football match at the stadium of every current Premier League and Football League club in England and Wales.

<doc id="600366" wikidata="Q744443" url="?curid=600366" title="Libertine">
<text>A libertine is a person questioning and challenging most moral principles, such as responsibility or sexual restraints, and will often declare these traits as unnecessary, undesirable or evil. A libertine is especially someone who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour observed by the larger society. The values and practices of libertines are known collectively as libertinism or libertinage and are described as an extreme form of hedonism or liberalism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade.

== History of the term ==

The word &quot;libertine&quot; was originally coined by John Calvin to negatively describe opponents of his policies in Geneva, Switzerland. The group, led by Ami Perrin, argued against Calvin&#x27;s &quot;insistence that church discipline should be enforced uniformly against all members of Genevan society&quot;. Perrin and his allies were elected to the town council in 1548, and &quot;broadened their support base in Geneva by stirring up resentment among the older inhabitants against the increasing number of religious refugees who were fleeing France in even greater numbers&quot;. By 1555, Calvinists were firmly in place on the Genevan town council, so the Libertines, led by Perrin, responded with an &quot;attempted coup against the government and called for the massacre of the French. This was the last great political challenge Calvin had to face in Geneva&quot;. In England, a few Lollards held libertine views such as that adultery and fornication were not sin, or that &quot;whoever died in faith would be saved irrespective of his way of life&quot;.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the term became more associated with debauchery. Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand wrote that Joseph Bonaparte &quot;sought only life&#x27;s pleasures and easy access to libertinism&quot; while on the throne of Naples.

== Literature ==

&quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, 1782), an epistolary novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, is a trenchant description of sexual libertinism. Wayland Young argues: &quot;... the mere analysis of libertinism ... carried out by a novelist with such a prodigious command of his medium ... was enough to condemn it and play a large part in its destruction.&quot;

Agreeable to Calvin&#x27;s emphasis on the need for uniformity of discipline in Geneva, Samuel Rutherford (Professor of Divinity in the University of St. Andrews, and Christian minister in 17th-century Scotland) offered a rigorous treatment of &quot;Libertinism&quot; in his polemical work &quot;A Free Disputation Against Pretended Liberty of Conscience&quot; (1649).

&quot;A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind&quot; is a poem by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester which addresses the question of the proper use of reason, and is generally assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism. The narrator subordinates reason to sense. It is based to some extent on Boileau&#x27;s version of Juvenal&#x27;s eighth or fifteenth satire, and is also indebted to Hobbes, Montaigne, Lucretius, and Epicurus, as well as the general libertine tradition. Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself, or a satirised persona. It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II.

The libertine novel was a primarily 18th-century literary genre of which the roots lay in the European but mainly French libertine tradition. The genre effectively ended with the French Revolution. Themes of libertine novels were anti-clericalism, anti-establishment and eroticism.
Authors include Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (&quot;Les Égarements du cœur et de l&#x27;esprit&quot;, 1736; &quot;Le Sopha, conte moral&quot;, 1742), Denis Diderot (&quot;Les bijoux indiscrets&quot;, 1748), Marquis de Sade (&quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Juliette&quot;, 1797–1801), Choderlos de Laclos (&quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, 1782), and John Wilmot (&quot;Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery&quot;, 1684).

Other famous titles are &quot;Histoire de Dom Bougre, Portier des Chartreux&quot; (1741) and &quot;Thérèse Philosophe&quot; (1748).

Precursors to the libertine writers were Théophile de Viau (1590–1626) and Charles de Saint-Evremond (1610–1703), who were inspired by Epicurus and the publication of Petronius.

Robert Darnton is a cultural historian who has covered this genre extensively. A three-part essay in &quot;The Book Collector&quot; by David Foxen explores libertine literature in England, 1660-1745.

Critics have been divided as to the literary merits of William Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;Liber Amoris&quot;, a deeply personal account of frustrated love that is quite unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.

One or two positive reviews appeared, such as the one in the &quot;Globe&quot;, 7 June 1823: &quot;The &quot;Liber Amoris&quot; is unique in the English language; and as, possibly, the first book in its fervour, its vehemency, and its careless exposure of passion and weakness—of sentiments and sensations which the common race of mankind seek most studiously to mystify or conceal—that exhibits a portion of the most distinguishing characteristics of Rousseau, it ought to be generally praised&quot;. Dan Cruickshank in his book &quot;London&#x27;s Sinful Secret&quot; summarized Hazlitt&#x27;s infatuation stating: &quot;Decades after her death Batsy (Careless) still haunted the imagination of the essayist William Hazlitt, a man who lodged near Covent Garden during the 1820s, where he became unpleasantly intimate with the social consequences of unconventional sexual obsession that he revealed in his &quot;Liber Amoris&quot; of 1823, in which he candidly confessed to his infatuation with his landlord&#x27;s young daughter.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
During the Baroque era in France, there existed a freethinking circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as &quot;libertinage érudit&quot; and which included Gabriel Naudé, Élie Diodati and François de La Mothe Le Vayer. The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester&#x27;s libertinism to Hobbesian materialism.

<doc id="600368" wikidata="Q1689021" url="?curid=600368" title="Shelf life">
<text>Shelf life is the length of time that a commodity may be stored without becoming unfit for use, consumption, or sale. In other words, it might refer to whether a commodity should no longer be on a pantry shelf (unfit for use), or no longer on a supermarket shelf (unfit for sale, but not yet unfit for use). It applies to cosmetics, foods and beverages, medical devices, medicines, explosives, pharmaceutical drugs, chemicals, tyres, batteries, and many other perishable items. In some regions, an advisory &quot;best before&quot;, mandatory &quot;use by&quot; or &quot;freshness date&quot; is required on packaged perishable foods. The concept of expiration date is related but legally distinct in some jurisdictions.

==Background==

Shelf life is the recommended maximum time for which products or fresh (harvested) produce can be stored, during which the defined quality of a specified proportion of the goods remains acceptable under expected (or specified) conditions of distribution, storage and display.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), &quot;canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 °F (32.2 °C)&quot;. If the cans look okay, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-acid canned foods (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned foods (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years.

&quot;Sell by date&quot; is a less ambiguous term for what is often referred to as an &quot;expiration date&quot;. Most food is still edible after the expiration date. A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. Some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.

Shelf life depends on the degradation mechanism of the specific product. Most can be influenced by several factors: exposure to light, heat, moisture, transmission of gases, mechanical stresses, and contamination by things such as micro-organisms. Product quality is often mathematically modelled around a parameter (concentration of a chemical compound, a microbiological index, or moisture content).

For some foods, health issues are important in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized milk can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
The expiration date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is a case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired tetracycline. A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.

Shelf life is not significantly studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local programs are not permitted to participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as Cipro remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.

Preservatives and antioxidants may be incorporated into some food and drug products to extend their shelf life. Some companies use induction sealing and vacuum/oxygen-barrier pouches to assist in the extension of the shelf life of their products where oxygen causes the loss.

The DoD Shelf-Life Program defines shelf-life as

The total period of time beginning with the date of manufacture, date of cure (for elastomeric and rubber products only), date of assembly, or date of pack (subsistence only), and terminated by the date by which an item must be used (expiration date) or subjected to inspection, test, restoration, or disposal action; or after inspection/laboratory test/restorative action that an item may remain in the combined wholesale (including manufacture&#x27;s) and retail storage systems and still be suitable for issue or use by the end user. Shelf-life is not to be confused with service-life (defined as, A general term used to quantify the average or standard life expectancy of an item or equipment while in use. When a shelf-life item is unpacked and introduced to mission requirements, installed into intended application, or merely left in storage, placed in pre-expended bins, or held as bench stock, shelf-life management stops and service life begins.)
Shelf life is often specified in conjunction with a specific product, package, and distribution system. For example, an MRE field ration is designed to have a shelf life of three years at and six months at .

==Temperature control==

Nearly all chemical reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and the degradation of foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. Nitroglycerine is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert; this is why old rubber bands and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.

The often quoted rule of thumb is that chemical reactions double their rate for each temperature increase of because activation energy barriers are more easily surmounted at higher temperatures. However, as with many rules of thumb, there are many s and exceptions. The rule works best for reactions with activation energy values around 50 kJ/mole; many of these are important at the usual temperatures we encounter. It is often applied in shelf life estimation, sometimes wrongly. There is a widespread impression, for instance in industry, that &quot;triple time&quot; can be simulated in practice by increasing the temperature by , e.g., storing a product for one month at simulates three months at . This is mathematically incorrect (if the rule was precisely accurate the required temperature increase would be about ), and in any case the rule is only a rough approximation and cannot always be relied on. Chemists often use the more comprehensive Arrhenius equation for better estimations.

The same is true, up to a point, of the chemical reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by enzymes which change reaction rates, but with no variation in catalytic action, the rule of thumb is still mostly applicable. In the case of bacteria and fungi, the reactions needed to feed and reproduce speed up at higher temperatures, up to the point that the proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to break down, or denature, so quickly that they cannot be replaced. This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: &#x27;tissue&#x27; breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, &#x27;elevated&#x27; temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels.

Just as temperature increases speed up reactions, temperature decreases reduce them. Therefore, to make explosives stable for longer periods, or to keep rubber bands springy, or to force bacteria to slow down their growth, they can be cooled. That is why shelf life is generally extended by temperature control: (refrigeration, insulated shipping containers, controlled cold chain, etc.) and why some medicines and foods &quot;must&quot; be refrigerated. Since such storing of such goods is temporal in nature and shelf life is dependent on the temperature controlled environment, they are also referred to as cargo even when in special storage to emphasize the inherent time-temperature sensitivity matrix.

Temperature data loggers and time temperature indicators can record the temperature history of a shipment to help estimate their remaining shelf life.

According to the USDA, &quot;foods kept frozen continuously are safe indefinitely&quot;.

==Packaging==
Passive barrier packaging can often help control or extend shelf life by blocking the transmission of deleterious substances, like moisture or oxygen, across the barrier. Active packaging, on the other hand, employs the use of substances that scavenge, capture, or otherwise render harmless deleterious substances. When moisture content is a mechanism for product degradation, packaging with a low moisture vapor transmission rate and the use of desiccants help keep the moisture in the package within acceptable limits. When oxidation is the primary concern, packaging with a low oxygen transmission rate and the use of oxygen absorbers can help extend the shelf life. Produce and other products with respiration often require packaging with controlled barrier properties. The use of a modified atmosphere in the package can extend the shelf life for some products.

==Related concepts==
The concept of shelf life applies to other products besides food and drugs. Gasoline has a shelf life, although it is not normally necessary to display a sell-by date. Exceeding this time-frame will introduce harmful varnishes, etc. into equipment designed to operate with these products, i.e. a gasoline lawn mower that has not been properly winterized could incur damage that will prevent use in the spring, and require expensive servicing to the carburetor.

Some glues and adhesives also have a limited storage life, and will stop working in a reliable and usable manner if their safe shelf life is exceeded.

Rather different is the use of a time limit for the use of items like vouchers, gift certificates and pre-paid phone cards, so that after the displayed date the voucher etc. will no longer be valid. Bell Mobility and its parent company, BCE Inc. have been served with notice of a $100-million class-action lawsuit alleging that expiry dates on its pre-paid wireless services are illegal.

<text>In mathematics, the gradient conjecture, due to René Thom (1989), was proved in 2000 by three Polish mathematicians, Krzysztof Kurdyka (University of Savoie, France), Tadeusz Mostowski (Warsaw University, Poland) and Adam Parusiński (University of Angers, France).

The conjecture states that given a real-valued analytic function &quot;f&quot; defined on R&quot;n&quot; and a trajectory &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) of the gradient vector field of &quot;f&quot; having a limit point &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ R&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; has an isolated critical point at &quot;x&quot;0, there exists a limit (in the projective space PR&quot;n-1&quot;) for the secant lines from &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) to &quot;x&quot;0, as &quot;t&quot; tends to zero.

The proof depends on a theorem due to Stanis%C5%82aw %C5%81ojasiewicz.

<text>Morges (; , plural, probably ablative, else dative; ) is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud and the seat of the district of Morges. It is located on Lake Geneva, west of Lausanne.

==History==
Morges is first mentioned in 1288 as &quot;Morgia&quot;. It was known by its German name &quot;Morsee&quot; though that name is no longer used.

===Prehistory===
There were several prehistoric settlements along what is now the Morges lakefront. The largest and best known, &quot;Grande-Cité&quot;, was occupied in the late Bronze Age. One of the wooden objects at Grande-Cité has been dendrochronologically dated to 1031 BC. Many of the stilts and building structures have been preserved in situ. A dugout of oak was discovered near the settlement and in 1877 half of it was recovered and placed in the Musée d&#x27;histoire et d&#x27;art in Geneva.

About a hundred meters (yards) further north is the village of Vers-l&#x27;Église. The first settlement here dates back to the Neolithic, based on a layer of ceramic objects that date from between 2900 BC and 2700 BC. It remained occupied through the Late Bronze Age.

North-east of Grande-Cité is the third lake settlement, Les Roseaux, which comes from the Early Bronze Age. It is a rich site for artifacts including numerous edge strips for bronze axes and cups made of fine ceramics (of the Roseaux type). The arrangement of the stilts show the organization of the huts, which were oriented at right angles to the modern shore. Dendrochronological investigations of the stilts have determined that many of the houses were built between 1776 and 1600 BC. On top of the older settlement, a smaller Late Bronze Age settlement, dendrochronologically dated to 1055 BC, has been discovered.

The Bronze Age settlements were abandoned and the region was sparsely inhabited until the Gallo-Roman era when a villa and farms were built.

===Medieval Morges===

In 1286, Louis of Savoy, founded a city in a pasture where a gallows has previously stood. A castle was built to protect the city. A town charter was granted in 1293. The new city grew at the expense of the county of Vufflens, the diocese of Lausanne and Romainmôtier Abbey, all of which lost property and rights to the new city. It quickly developed into an administrative and market center as well as a hub for transporting goods by land and sea.

During the Middle Ages, Morges was a seasonal residence of the court of Savoy and the seat of a bailiff. The city was ruled as a single fief, and the residents were taxed according to their frontage or the width of their property along the street. The city was laid out like many neighboring Zähringer towns. There were two wide longitudinal streets that could be used for markets and fairs. A third, parallel road was added due to the rapid expansion of Morges. A rectangular plaza was created for the weekly market. Due to the shape of the streets and the frontage tax, most of the plots are long and narrow. Most of the houses have courtyards for light and ventilation and some are also equipped with spiral staircases and arbors. The religious institutions and their related educational institutions and parish houses as well as a hospital and the college were in the northern half of the town near the church. Workshops developed in the southern half of the city, around the harbor and the marketplace. There were also the covered markets, the granary, the slaughterhouse and important inns in the southern half. The most significant of the inns was the Auberge de la Croix Blanche at Grande-Rue 70-72 which was given a late Gothic facade around 1550.

The castle in the south of the town square was built with a square floor plan and four round corner towers. It resembles the castle of Yverdon, which may have served as a model for Morges Castle. One of the round towers, larger than the others, served as the main tower. The raised courtyard was covered, during the Middle Ages, by casemates, which were first mentioned in 1340. On the lake side, outside the castle walls, there was a fortified kitchen. This kitchen, which was unique in Switzerland, was attached to the exterior of the castle walls. In 1363 the kitchen was rebuilt. Following the conquest of Vaud by Bern, the roof the kitchen became a platform for shooters. It was later converted into an observation deck.

The Syndics are first mentioned in Morges in 1375. The Town Hall was built around 1515-20 and is the oldest public building of its type in Vaud. The stair tower and monumental portal were built in 1682, while the facade was done in a late Gothic style. Prior to its construction, public meetings were held in the church, the hospital or in a hostel. Until the 16th century the town council consisted of two groups, the small Council with six or seven members, and a General Council (Conseil général). In 1514 the old councils were replaced with a twelve-member council and a twenty-four-member council. Both of these councils remained until the end of the Ancien Régime.

The municipality owned their own weights and measures, two community ovens, an infirmary (1340–1564) and a Hospital which was consecrated to St. Rochus (1518). The pillory was on the market place, the prison at the castle and the gallows were at Tolochenaz.

During the Middle Ages, the church belonged to the former parish church of Notre-Dame in Joules (now part of Echichens). The town chapel was first mentioned in 1306 without a patron saint and by 1490 it was consecrated to Notre-Dame. The chapel was on the Lausanne side of the ramparts and the unattached bell tower adjoined the city gate and served as part of the city defenses. In 1537 Tolochenaz and Morges formed a Reformed parish and the chapel was converted into a Reformed church. It was razed in 1769.

Outside the city walls, but near Morges, was the monastery of Colettaner, which was also known as the Franciscan abbey. It was founded in 1497-1500 and despite being close to Morges, was associated with Geneva. Swiss Confederation troops devastated it in 1530 and again in 1536. The ruins of the monastery were replaced with a cemetery.

===Early Modern Morges===

The city and castle were plundered in 1475 and again in 1530. After the conquest of Vaud in 1536 by Bern, Morges became the center of a bailiwick in 1539. The castle was in deplorable condition. The new owners had the upper half of the fortifications rebuilt in the 1540s to suit the needs of artillery. Since Morges had not surrendered quickly enough to Bern, the city gates were demolished. The gate houses remained until 1769 and 1803, when they were finally destroyed.

During the early modern era, Morges was very prosperous. A number of large civic and private buildings were built during this time. They include Bern&#x27;s granary (1690–92) at the site of a formerly fortified private residence, the house at Grande-Rue 56 (which was built in 1560 and the arcaded courtyard was added in 1670) and the building at Grande-Rue 94 with its remarkable facade from 1682. A latin school (scola grammatical calis) was operating by the second half of the 15th century. In 1574 the Collège de Couvaloup, which was inspired by the academies of Geneva, Lausanne and Bern, opened in Morges. The new church was built in a French classicism style between 1769–76 and is one of the masterpieces of Reformed architecture in Switzerland. German language church services began in town starting in 1710.

Beginning in the late 18th century the areas outside the city walls were built up. A number of country estates (La Gottaz, La Prairie, La Gracieuse) and new suburbs developed along the arterial roads to Lausanne and Geneva. A small harbor is first mentioned in 1536 and shortly thereafter, regular boat service to Geneva began. In 1664 a simple pier was built out of poles, but it was too small to provide protection for the galleys that were on the lake. The Bernese government therefore decided to build a commercial and military port in Morges and not in Lausanne-Ouchy. The current port was built with two curved breakwaters between 1691–96 and in 1702 the customs house was finished. With the port, Morges became the starting point for several trade routes and became the site of a major transshipment point for goods such as salt, wine and grain.

During the early modern era, the local economy began to rely more on transportation and trade than on the production of goods. The shoemakers guild was very influential in the 16th and 17th centuries. They were replaced by tanners in the 18th and 19th centuries when they grew to be more important in the local economy. The largest socio-professional groups at the end of the Ancien Régime in 1798 were; (in order of importance) the rentiers or landlords, merchants, winemakers, farmers, shoemakers, tailors, carpenters and joiners.

===Morges in the modern era===
The first railway line of the Canton connected Yverdon to Morges in 1855. The new station for this line, on the western outskirts of the city, caused a surge of development outside the city walls. The first line was followed in 1856 by the Morges-Lausanne route and in 1858, the Morges-Geneva line. In 1895, the Morges-Bière-Apples line was finished, which opened up the hinterland.

Morges grew into a regional economic, political and cultural center during the ancien régime. With the cultural development, it became a center for patriots (including Jean-Jacques Cart, Henri Monod and Jules Nicholas Muret) and the Vaudois revolution. After the 1798 French invasion Morges was a district capital.

During the second half of the 19th century, the city enjoyed an upturn in business thanks to the steamship port and the temporary connection from port to the railway (1855–62). In the port, the shipyard was located near the shipping company Compagnie générale de navigation sur le lac Léman (1858–89). The castle, which became the cantonal armory in 1803, was expanded in 1836–39 with some utility buildings and damaged in an explosion in 1871. Starting in 1925, it housed the Vaud Military Museum.

A Catholic church was built in 1844 and a chapel for German language services opened in 1891. In 1922 the cantonal Farming and Wine Production school was founded in Marcelin, the building is now the &quot;Agrilogie Marcelin&quot;.

A number of companies dominated the economic life of the municipality in the 19th and 20th centuries: a gas factory (1867–1932), the transport company Friderici AG (1890), the biscuit factory Oulevay AG (1899–1992), the metal construction workshop Société industrielle de Lausanne (1907–79), the foundry Neeser AG (1947) and the pasta factory Gala (1988–2005). Between 1900 and 1940, the city extended further, with new villas and suburbs springing up. The first zoning plan of 1934 was followed by further plans in 1957 and 1970. Between 1961 and 1964 the highway was built, that divides the municipality into two parts. Since 2007, the municipality has been part of the agglomeration of Lausanne-Morges project. This project aims to create 30,000 jobs by 2020.

In September 2020, a man released from prison July and who had been under investigation for &quot;previous jihadist activity,&quot; chose a victim at random in Morges and killed him &quot;to avenge the prophet.&quot;

<text>Ner Israel Rabbinical College (ישיבת נר ישראל), also known as NIRC and Ner Yisroel, is a Haredi yeshiva (Jewish educational institution) in Pikesville, Maryland. It was founded in 1933 by Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman, a disciple of Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (the Alter of Slabodka), dean of the Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania. Rabbi Aharon Feldman, a disciple of Rabbi Ruderman and a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of America, became its head in 2001.

The yeshiva is an all-male Lithuanian (Litvish)-style Talmudic academy and is politically affiliated with Agudath Israel of America. The yeshiva is composed of three departments: The Mechina for high school students (Mesivta Bochurim), the yeshiva for post high school students (Beis Medrash Bochurim), and the Kollel for married students (literally translated as &quot;young men&quot;). The graduates of Ner Yisroel are known for their dedication to Torah study and communal leadership.

In 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Ner Yisroel as being &quot;unusual in that it has always allowed students access to secular, professional education.&quot; This takes place off-premises, as university-accredited night-courses, with the participation of some students.

Although &quot;Ner Israel&#x27;s mission statement makes clear its priority is religious studies,&quot; the yeshiva&#x27;s alumni have been estimated as 50% rabbis and religious-school teachers, and 50% as professionals: bankers, accountants, physicians, attorneys, psychologists, etc.

==History and past leadership==
Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Ruderman, the son-in-law of Rabbi Sheftel Kramer, founded the yeshiva in 1933 with six students. It was based in a local shul. The yeshiva was named after Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter, the founder of the mussar movement followed by Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (known as the Alter of Slabodka), Ruderman&#x27;s mentor. He modeled Ner Yisroel after Finkel&#x27;s yeshiva, the Slabodka Yeshiva.

Rabbi Dovid Kronglass, of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Europe (and during World War II in Shanghai) was the yeshiva&#x27;s first mashgiach ruchani until his death on December 16, 1972. Besides his role as Mashgiach, he also served as a Maggid Shiur and was the Posek of the Yeshiva.

Rabbi Herman Naftali Neuberger, a son-in-law of Rabbi Sheftel Kramer, brother-in-law of Ruderman, and an alumnus of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Europe, and of Ner Israel itself, was president of Ner Israel from 1940 until his death in 2005. Rabbi Neuberger joined the Yeshiva as a student when he arrived from his native Bavaria in 1938.

His son Rabbi Sheftel Neuberger was full-time assistant &#x27;menahel&#x27; from May 1987, the &quot;menahel&quot; (president) of the yeshiva from 2005, when he succeeded his father, until his death on February 10, 2021. Prior to 2005, Sheftel Neuberger was a Maggid Shiur in the yeshiva for many years, ending that position before Passover 1987 to become full-time assistant &#x27;menahel&#x27;.

Rabbi Shmuel Yaakov Weinberg, a disciple of Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner, served on the &quot;Ner Yisroel&quot; faculty for nearly 50 years. He served as a Maggid Shiur from 1945 to 1965, as well as dean of the Kollel from 1953 to 1965. From 1971 until 1987, he served as an assistant to the Rosh Yeshiva and head of the Kollel. From Ruderman&#x27;s death in 1987 until his own death on July 1, 1999, Weinberg served as Rosh Yeshiva. Weinberg was married to Chana Ruderman, the only child of Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman. She died on January 23, 2012.

Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Kulefsky, a disciple of Rabbi Shlomo Heiman and senior lecturer in the Yeshiva, served as the Rosh Yeshiva from Weinberg&#x27;s death in 1999 until his death on November 30, 2000. Other rabbis who served on the faculty include the late: Rabbi Shimon Schwab, later rabbi of the German-Jewish Frankfurt &quot;Kehillah&quot; / community in Washington Heights N.Y.; Rabbi Simcha Zissel Broide of the Chevron Yeshiva in Jerusalem; Rabbi Ephraim Eisenberg, the son-in-law of Rabbi Mordechai Gifter, and Rabbi Zvi Dov Slanger, a disciple of Rav Shach, who was a Maggid Shiur in the high school for many years until 1996 when he founded and became Rosh Yeshiva of the Bais Medrash &amp; Mesivta Of Baltimore.

The Mechina was founded in 1957 and went through seven principals until Rabbi Yosef Tendler became the principal of the Mechina in 1964, and remained in that position until his death on February 8, 2012.

==Leadership==
Rabbi Aharon Feldman is as the rosh yeshiva (dean) and is also a council member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Feldman studied in the yeshiva in the 1950s, but had been living in Israel from 1961 until his appointment as rosh yeshiva in 2001.

Rabbi Boruch Neuberger is the &quot;menahel&quot; (president) of the yeshiva, succeeding his father, Rabbi Sheftel Neuberger. Jerome Kadden is the yeshiva&#x27;s executive director.

Rabbi Beryl Weisbord, a son-in-law of Weinberg, is the yeshiva&#x27;s mashgiach ruchani.

Rabbi Simcha Cook is the &quot;menahel&quot; of the high school. Rabbi Yosef Neuberger is the Mashgiach. Rabbi Azriel Hauptman is the General Studies principal.

==Campus==
The campus (known as &quot;The Beren Campus&quot;) is nearly 100 acres at Mt. Wilson Lane, just northwest of the Baltimore City limits, where the yeshiva moved in 1968 from 4411 Garrison Boulevard in Baltimore.

Ner Israel has two central study halls, one for the high school (known as the Mechina) and one much larger for the beis medrash and the kollel (also doubling as the main prayer sanctuaries). There is an additional study hall/multi-purpose room of a smaller size that is called the &quot;Friedman Beis Medrash&quot;. Enrollment is approximately 250 students in its high school division, 300 students in its beis medrash/undergraduate division, and about 200 members in its kollel/postgraduate division.

There is a dining hall, the Sindler/Wolf Dining Hall, and three dormitories on campus.

There is housing on campus for members of the faculty and some members of the kollel. This section of the campus is known as &quot;Yeshiva Lane&quot;.

==Activity outside of Baltimore==
In 1959, Rabbi Sholom Gold established a branch of Ner Yisroel in Toronto. In 1964, Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg became the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel of Toronto until 1971. This yeshiva still functions but is no longer affiliated with Ner Yisroel in Baltimore.

In recent years, Ner Israel has sent alumni to kollelim across the United States and several have founded their own institutions.

Major student projects include &quot;PROJECT YAHUD&quot;, a spring break fund-raising effort for the religious school in Yahud, Israel, and &quot;PROJECT SEED&quot;, a summertime outreach effort in smaller communities across America and the world.

==Accreditation==
Ner Israel is a Maryland state-accredited college through the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools – Accreditation Commission (AARTS), and has agreements with Johns Hopkins University, Towson University, Loyola College in Maryland, University of Baltimore, and University of Maryland, Baltimore County allowing undergraduate students to take night courses at these colleges and universities in a variety of academic fields. The agreement also allows the students to receive academic credits for their religious studies. Ner Yisrael also has a pre-med program in association with Stevenson University of Owings Mills.

The Mechina high school is an accredited high school in the state of Maryland under the name &quot;Israel Henry Beren High School&quot;. The high school was dedicated by the philanthropic Beren family in memory of Israel Henry Beren who died in 1994.

==Curriculum==
===Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates of the Talmud)===
The yeshiva&#x27;s studies are primarily Talmud texts and relevant rabbinic literature. The yeshiva has a rotating cycle of nine different Talmudic tractates it covers in the course of nine years: Bava Kamma 1, Yevamos, Bava Basra, Gittin, Bava Kamma 2, Nedarim, Bava Metzia, Kiddushin, and Kesubos. There are additional tractates that are sometimes studied in the spring semester. These include Succah, Pesachim, and Makkos.

As is true in many Lithuanian-style Yeshivas, the methodology of the study of the Talmud is based on the Brisker method. Other Lithuanian-style Yeshivos follow almost exclusively the Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz style of the Brisker method. Although Rabbi Lebowitz&#x27;s works are studied in Ner Yisrael, his specific style of study is not the only approach in Ner Yisroel as Ner Yisroel subscribes to a more eclectic approach of the Brisker method. Hour-long Shiurim (lessons) on Talmud are given daily. The highest level shiur is taught by Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz.

Additionally, half an hour per day is dedicated to the study of Musar literature.

===Kollel Avodas Levi===
Kollel Avodas Levi is a department of the Yeshiva that is composed of older students, mostly married, who are engaged in advanced studies. Established in 1959, the Kollel was later named &quot;Avodas Levi&quot; in memory of Rabbi Ruderman who authored a sefer of the same name. Most of the 250+ members, known as yungerleit, learn within the framework of a study group, called a &quot;chabura&quot;, that is focused on a specific topic and led by a senior member of the Kollel. Ner Yisroel confers Semicha (Rabbinic Ordination) upon qualified members.

Rabbi Ezra Neuberger, son of Rabbi Herman became Rosh Kollel/Dean of the Kollel/Graduate school in his father&#x27;s lifetime.

===The Mechina&#x27;s Masechta Bechina===
The Mechina High School studies two tractates every year. One is studied in depth (Iyyun), and the other one is studied in its entirety at a faster pace which is known as the study of Bekius. At the end of the school year, the students take an exam on the entire tractate that was studied in the Bekius program. This exam is called the &quot;Masechta Bechina&quot;. An exam on an entire tractate is considered a major accomplishment due to the amount and complexity of the information contained in each tractate. Former students recount how decades later they still have an incredible recall of the tractates that they studied in the Mechina&#x27;s Bekius program.

Advanced students complete the Iyyun tractate on their own as an extracurricular project. Those that complete the Iyyun tractate are honored at the end of the school year at a special dinner.

===STAR-K program===
Students of Ner Yisroel&#x27;s Kollel Avodas Levi have the option to participate in the Star-K Rabbinical Training Program, which prepares them for Kashrus supervision.

==Degrees and certificates==
Degrees granted by Ner Israel are a Bachelor of Talmudic Law (four years), Master of Talmudic Law (six years), Doctorate in Talmudic Law (ten years and authoring a commentary on Talmudic or Rabbinic texts).

Rabbinic ordination (Semichah) can also be conferred in Ner Yisroel.

Ner Yisroel&#x27;s &quot;Machon&quot; program, which began in 1962, trains religious educators for Jewish communities and schools and students earn a Torah Umesorah recognized certification.

==Student body==
===Persian Students===
In the 1970s due to the political turmoil following the Iranian Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, which saw many young Iranian men being sent to the front-lines with little military training, life became difficult for Iran&#x27;s Jews. Rabbi Herman Neuberger was very instrumental in bringing to the United States over 1,000 young Persian men, most of whom studied in Ner Yisroel. Ner Yisroel still maintains a special minyan on Shabbos for Persian students. There are large communities of Orthodox Persian Jews in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and New York that are a direct result of Rabbi Neuberger&#x27;s efforts.

===South American Students===
There are many South American students in the Yeshiva. This is primarily due to Camp Or Haner, which is a camp for South Americans that is located in Ner Yisroel. Many of the campers are inspired to remain as students in the Yeshiva. Many of these students return to their communities of origin, which has made a significant impact on the religious observance of members of those communities. The camp was founded by Rabbi Moshe Fuller, who began himself as a South American student of the Yeshiva. Rabbi Fuller died in 2008.

===Community service===
Students periodically engage in community service such as leading the prayers in the nearby North Oaks retirement community. Additionally, the Yeshiva sends several Rebbeim once a year to spend a Shabbos in the community. This is known as &quot;The Baltimore Shabbos of Chizuk&quot;. Additionally, many students visit older members in the community in the nearby Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital on Fridays.

<text>CKVU-DT (channel 10) is a television station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving as the West Coast flagship of the Citytv network. It is owned and operated by network parent Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside Omni Television station CHNM-DT (channel 42). The two stations share studios at the corner of West 2nd Avenue and Columbia Street (near False Creek) in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood of Vancouver; CKVU-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver, with additional transmitter link facilities on the roof of the Century Plaza Hotel in Downtown Vancouver.

==History==
CKVU&#x27;s history dates back to 1975 when Western Approaches Ltd. was awarded the third television station licence in the Vancouver market by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Western Approaches—which had, unlike the other applicants, filed for both channel 10 and 26—had emerged from a chaotic proceeding in which the CRTC did not award the main channel 10 allocation in deference to the CBC&#x27;s plan to use it for a television station in Victoria; that station would never launch because of budget cuts in 1978. The station was originally assigned to broadcast on UHF channel 26, but it was instead given channel 21 prior to its launch. (The CBC was already planning on using channel 26 to launch Radio-Canada station CBUFT.) The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1976; it was the first station in Vancouver to transmit on the UHF band. In addition, CKVU was carried on cable channel 13, an assignment it retains to this day. In its first year of operation, CKVU lost more than $3 million.

In 1979, the station was approaching the break-even point. It was also under the scrutiny of the CRTC at that time due to its lack of local programming. According to the CRTC, CKVU did not produce its own newscasts but instead relayed the Ontario-focused newscasts from the Global Television Network. That same year, Charles Allard, owner of CITV in Edmonton, purchased a 5% common stock and 7% preferred stock interest in CKVU through his company, Allarcom. Canwest Pacific, a subsidiary of CanWest Broadcasting, loaned $4 million to Western Approaches so it could thwart a takeover attempt from Allarcom. Three years later, CanWest loaned another $8 million to Western Approaches to reduce the station&#x27;s debt with the condition that CanWest would have the option to purchase Western Approaches&#x27; shares in CKVU.

In 1984, Western Approaches applied to move CKVU-TV from channel 21 to channel 10, which remained vacant after the CBC Victoria plans fell through. Concerns arose over the potential of a stronger channel 10 signal—which would extend service to 183,000 additional people—to overwhelm cable and antenna receiving equipment aimed at Seattle and KCTS-TV on channel 9, particularly because the cable receiving site was colocated with the CKVU transmitter on Salt Spring Island. The CRTC approved the channel change in February 1985 on the condition that CKVU give cable systems time to modify their receiving setups; CKVU moved to channel 10 on September 6, 1986, bringing the channel to use in southwestern British Columbia more than a decade after the original applications for it were made. Until it was shut down on August 31, 2011, as part of Canada&#x27;s digital television transition, CKVU&#x27;s analogue signal, which transmitted from a very high location on Salt Spring Island, could be received throughout much of southwest British Columbia and northwest Washington, as well as in some areas of northern Seattle. This analogue transmitter was replaced with two UHF transmitters serving Vancouver and Victoria, both with reduced coverage areas overall, but with improved coverage to those particular metropolitan areas. CKVU also maintained a rebroadcast transmitter located west of Courtenay, CKVU-TV-1, which is received over-the-air on North Vancouver Island.
On December 6, 1985, CanWest announced that it had purchased controlling interest in CKVU, subject to CRTC approval. Western Approaches went to court in an attempt to block the sale, which resulted in a dispute between Western Approaches, Allarcom, and Canwest that lasted several years. On June 19, 1987, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ordered Western Approaches to sell its interest in CKVU to Canwest, subject to CRTC approval. Once the sale was approved and all other legal issues were settled, CanWest gained 100% ownership and control of CKVU. It then began sharing programs with CanWest&#x27;s other independent stations, as well as the Global network in Ontario. In 1990, CKVU and Canwest&#x27;s other independent stations became known as the &quot;Canwest Global System.&quot;

Under CanWest&#x27;s ownership, the station was rebranded as &quot;U.TV&quot;, and its audience and profits increased. The station had previously been branded as both &quot;CKVU-13&quot; and &quot;VU13&quot; (both referring to the station&#x27;s cable channel) and more simply, the &quot;CKVU&quot; call letters. On Monday August 18, 1997, Canwest dropped the more localized brandings from all of its stations and rebranded them as the Global Television Network, as part of a full expansion of the network outside of Ontario to the Canwest Global System stations. Accordingly, after seven years under the &quot;U.TV&quot; brand, CKVU rebranded as &quot;Global Vancouver&quot;.

===Transition to Citytv===
In 2000, Canwest acquired the television interests of Western International Communications, including CHAN-TV (channel 8) in Vancouver and CHEK-TV (channel 6) in Victoria. The CRTC approved the purchase on July 6, 2000, on the condition that Canwest divest CKVU. The CRTC further approved the transfer of CKVU to a Canwest subsidiary, CKVU Sub Inc., on December 21, placing the station in a blind trust while the company looked for a buyer. Indeed, Canwest had bought WIC&#x27;s television interests specifically to increase its reach in British Columbia. CHAN (long known in the province under its &quot;BCTV&quot; brand) had been the dominant station in British Columbia for the better part of the last 30 years and boasted over 100 transmitters across the province. In contrast, CKVU operated only three transmitters covering only the southwest quadrant of British Columbia.

CHUM Limited applied to the CRTC to acquire CKVU Sub Inc. on July 26, 2001 for $175 million, with the intention of making it a Citytv station, using a similar format as the company&#x27;s flagship station, CITY-TV in Toronto. CHUM planned on spending $8.03 million on British Columbia-based independent productions, $5.95 million on local news and information programming, and $1.37 million on local culture, social policy, and talent development over a period of seven years.
A large network shuffle occurred on September 1, when CHAN&#x27;s contract with CTV expired. CHAN, now under Canwest ownership, switched affiliations from CTV to Global. As a result, CIVT (channel 32), an independent station owned by Baton Broadcasting, became a CTV owned-and-operated station, while CKVU was rebranded as &quot;ckvu13&quot;. While CKVU began airing CHUM-supplied programming immediately following the switch, the station remained in trust pending regulatory approval of the sale. CHUM gained CRTC approval for its acquisition of CKVU Sub Inc. on October 15, 2001. Because CHUM owned CIVI (channel 53) in Victoria, which was part of the &quot;NewNet&quot; system, the CRTC imposed its usual licence conditions for large-market twinsticks: CKVU was prohibited from airing more than 10% of the programming aired on CIVI, and newscasts were required to be separately managed.

===As Citytv Vancouver===
At 6 a.m. Pacific Time on July 22, 2002, CKVU dropped the &quot;ckvu13&quot; branding and became the second television station in Canada to use the Citytv brand (as &quot;Citytv Vancouver&quot;), effectively turning Citytv into a television system. A new morning program (&quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, based on the format originated on CITY-TV) was launched immediately after the rebrand, and the station&#x27;s 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts were rebranded as &quot;CityPulse&quot; on the same day (later to be renamed &quot;CityNews&quot; in 2005).
In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later known as CTVglobemedia and now Bell Media) acquired CHUM Limited and its assets, including CKVU and the four other Citytv stations. The acquisition was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007, on the condition that CTVglobemedia sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations (including CKVU) to another buyer due to the fact the company had CIVT in the same base as the station; Rogers Communications announced its intention to purchase the five Citytv stations three days later. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on September 28, and the acquisition by Rogers was finalized on October 31, 2007.

On October 25, 2008, a fire occurred at CKVU&#x27;s rebroadcast transmitter site southwest of Courtenay, knocking the analogue station&#x27;s channel 5 over-the-air signal off the air; it has not broadcast since then and it is currently unknown if the station will replace the transmitter or simply delete it from its licence altogether. CBC Television O&amp;O CBUT (channel 2) also operated a transmitter at the same site; it later filed an application to revoke the license for the transmitter at the Courtenay site, which the CRTC approved on October 12, 2011. This application noted that the decision had been made not to rebuild the transmission site, which was destroyed in the fire.

In December 2012, the Citytv system started to begin being referred to as &quot;City Television&quot; in on-air promotions, although the Citytv branding was still heavily used in promos and on on-screen logo bugs. At the same time, CKVU&#x27;s (and the entire system&#x27;s) website and on-air graphics phased in the &quot;City&quot; name, effectively rebranding the station as &quot;City Vancouver&quot;. The new City branding was launched on Monday, December 31, 2012, coinciding with the &quot;City New Year&#x27;s Bash&quot; broadcast. The &quot;Citytv&quot; name was reinstated in 2018.

==News operation==
CKVU presently broadcasts 14 hours of locally produced newscasts each week, consisting of two hour-long nightly newscasts under the &quot;CityNews&quot; brand.

The station&#x27;s news operation used a variety of branding over the years; it was known as &quot;First News&quot; (or &quot;1st News&quot;) in the 1980s, and as &quot;U News&quot; for most of the 1990s (during this period, CKVU ran hourly news updates, using the &quot;24-Hour News Source&quot; format then-popular in the United States). With the 1997 rebrand to Global, this meant &quot;U News&quot; became &quot;Global News&quot;. After the sale of the station and conversion to independent status, the temporary &quot;CKVU News&quot; name was adopted; this gave way to &quot;CityPulse&quot; with the station&#x27;s relaunch as Citytv in July 2002. &quot;CityPulse&quot; became known as &quot;CityNews&quot; by 2005.

The station&#x27;s news operations underwent significant changes in July 2006 following the announcement of Bell Globemedia&#x27;s acquisition of CHUM Limited; CKVU&#x27;s 6 and 11 p.m. evening newscasts were cancelled outright, while the station&#x27;s morning show &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; was expanded from three hours to four.

On January 19, 2010, Rogers Communications announced that it was laying off six employees at CKVU. The layoffs also resulted in the cancellation of the locally produced programs &quot;Lunch Television&quot; and &quot;The CityNews List&quot;, while &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; was reduced from four hours back to three; the latter was eventually expanded to hours in September 2011.

On June 5, 2017, Rogers announced that it would re-launch local 6 and 11 p.m. &quot;CityNews&quot; newscasts in Vancouver in early 2018, as part of a nationwide restoration of news programming to Citytv&#x27;s owned-and-operated broadcast stations. The new programs launched on September 3, 2018.

On September 5, 2019, Rogers laid off four employees from CKVU and placed &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on hiatus until September 23. At this time the program was relaunched with a new hybrid format, consisting of a mixture of local content with national entertainment and lifestyle segments produced from Toronto.

On November 17, 2020, Rogers Sports &amp; Media imposed staff cuts across the country, including cancelling &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in Vancouver.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On February 23, 2010, the station received approval from the CRTC to broadcast its digital transmitter from Mount Seymour, rather than from its existing analogue transmitter site on Saltspring Island. This transmitter improved signal coverage for the Vancouver and Fraser Valley areas, but reduced reception in Victoria. CKVU&#x27;s digital signal first signed on the air on March 2, 2010.

CKVU shut down its analogue signal, over VHF channel 10, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal was relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 47 to post-transition channel 33 (which previously served as the pre-transition digital channel for Vancouver-based CTV O&amp;O CIVT-DT). Digital television receivers display CKVU-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as its analogue-era VHF channel 10.

CKVU improved its digital signal coverage on August 31, 2011, by broadcasting from a new transmitter in Victoria, which had been approved by the CRTC. The Victoria and Mount Seymour digital transmitters replaced the majority of the coverage area previously covered by its channel 10 analog transmitter and improved coverage within the Vancouver and Victoria metropolitan areas.

<text>Nell Marie McKay (born April 13, 1982) is an English–American singer and songwriter. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (2006).

==Early life and education==

McKay was born in London to an English father, writer-director Malcolm McKay, and an American mother, actress Robin Pappas. She also has a half sister, author Alice Clark Platts. She holds dual citizenship. While growing up, she lived with her mother in Harlem, New York, in Olympia, Washington and in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. She studied jazz voice at the Manhattan School of Music, but did not graduate. Her performances at various New York City music venues, including the Sidewalk Cafe and Joe&#x27;s Pub, drew attention from record labels.

==Career==
===2004–2006===

The recording sessions for McKay&#x27;s debut album &quot;Get Away from Me&quot; took place in August 2003 with Geoff Emerick as producer. Emerick was known for working as the Beatles&#x27; engineer on such albums as &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The title is a play on Norah Jones&#x27; &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.

&quot;Get Away from Me&quot; was released in February 2004. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the album &quot;a tour de force from a sly, articulate musician who sounds comfortable in any era&quot;. The album was included on several &quot;Best of 2004&quot; lists.

McKay was one of the major breakout artists from the 2004 SXSW Festival and was a finalist in the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize. She toured the northern United States in July 2004 as an opening act on the first half of the Au Naturale tour co-headlined by Alanis Morissette and Barenaked Ladies.

&quot;Pretty Little Head&quot; was released in the United States on 31 October 2006 on McKay&#x27;s own label, Hungry Mouse, and was marketed by SpinART Records.

McKay made her Broadway debut as Polly Peachum in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s limited-run production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, co-starring with Alan Cumming, Jim Dale, Cyndi Lauper, and Brian Charles Rooney. The role earned her a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Debut Performance.

===2007–present===

McKay&#x27;s third full-length studio release debuted on 25 September 2007. With both her previous albums lasting over 60 minutes and spanning two discs each, &quot;Obligatory Villagers&quot;, with only nine tracks (ten if purchased from iTunes), totaling 30 minutes was her shortest release to date.

On October 13, 2009 she released her fourth studio album, &quot;Normal as Blueberry Pie – A Tribute to Doris Day&quot; on Verve Records. The album contains twelve covers of songs made famous by Day, as well as one original tune. Barnes &amp; Noble featured an exclusive edition, packaged with the bonus track &quot;I Want To Be Happy&quot;. iTunes also featured an exclusive edition with a different bonus track, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;.

On September 28, 2010 McKay and Verve Records released her fifth album, &quot;Home Sweet Mobile Home,&quot; with original tracks. It was produced by McKay and her mother, Robin Pappas, with artistic input from David Byrne.

In 2013, McKay appeared in the Off-Broadway revue show &quot;Old Hats&quot;.

On March 24, 2015 McKay released her sixth album, &quot;My Weekly Reader&quot;, a covers album of songs from the 1960s. Songs include Moby Grape&#x27;s &quot;Murder in My Heart for the Judge&quot;, The Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, the Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;Quicksilver Girl&quot;, Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Hungry Freaks, Daddy&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;If I Fell&quot;, The Cyrkle&#x27;s &quot;Red Rubber Ball&quot;, and Herman&#x27;s Hermits&#x27; &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;.

On February 1, 2017, McKay joined Laurie Anderson, Joan Osborne, Suzanne Vega and the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra for &quot;Four Scored&quot;, a single performance of reworked songs at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

McKay, along with violinist Philippe Quint, starred in and contributed music to the independent film &quot;Downtown Express&quot;, directed by David Grubin.

Her musical show &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; is based on the life of murderer Barbara Graham, who also inspired a 1958 film with the same title.

==Personal life==
McKay is a vocal feminist, and wrote a satirical song relating to feminist issues called &quot;Mother of Pearl&quot;. She is a vegan.

McKay &quot;is a proud member of PETA&quot; (album notes); her song &quot;Columbia Is Bleeding&quot; dealt with the issue of Columbia University&#x27;s cruelty to animals. She wrote a 2004 song (&quot;John John&quot;) about her feelings in favor of political candidate Ralph Nader over Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.

She has performed at events for the progressive radio station WBAI, Planned Parenthood, Farm Sanctuary, and the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages, among many groups. McKay was one of several musicians to write a song in support of Georgia death row inmate Troy Davis.

In 2018, she appeared on &quot;The Jimmy Dore Show&quot;, a progressive political commentary show on YouTube, where she performed several of her songs and discussed her political views with Dore. She has also appeared as a guest on Dore&#x27;s live show.

<doc id="600391" wikidata="Q2143253" url="?curid=600391" title="Urabi revolt">
<text>The ʻUrabi revolt, also known as the ʻUrabi Revolution (), was a nationalist uprising in the Khedivate of Egypt from 1879 to 1882. It was led by and named for Colonel Ahmed Urabi and sought to depose the khedive, Tewfik Pasha, and end Imperial British and French influence over the country.

The uprising was ended by the Anglo-Egyptian War and the British takeover of the country, beginning the history of Egypt under the British.

==Prologue==
Egypt in the 1870s was under foreign influence, corruption, misgovernment, and in a state of financial ruin. Huge debts rung up by its ruler Ismaʻil Pasha could no longer be repaid, and under pressure from the European banks that held the debt, the country&#x27;s finances were being controlled by representatives of France and Britain via the Caisse de la Dette Publique. When Ismaʻil tried to rouse the Egyptian people against this foreign intervention, he was deposed by the British and replaced by his more pliable son Tewfik Pasha.

The upper ranks of the civil service, the army, and the business world had become dominated by Europeans, who were paid more than native Egyptians. Within Egypt, a parallel legal system for suing Europeans separately from the natives was set up. This angered educated and ambitious Egyptians in the military and civil service who felt that the European domination of top positions was preventing their own advancement. The heavily taxed Egyptian peasants were also annoyed by their taxes going to Europeans who lived in relative wealth.

Egyptians resented not only Western European domination but also the Turks, Circassians and Albanians, who controlled most other elite positions in the government and military. Albanian troops had come to Egypt along with Muhammad Ali and helped him to take control of the country and were highly favoured by the Khedive. Ottoman Turkish was still the official language of the army and Turks were more likely to be promoted. In the ruling cabinet under Khedive Tewfiq, every member was a Turco-Circassians. The growing fiscal crisis in the country forced the Khedive to drastically cut the army. From a height of 94,000 troops in 1874, its strength was cut to 36,000 in 1879, with plans to shrink it even more. This created a large class of unemployed and disaffected army officers within the country. The disastrous war with the Ethiopian Empire of 1875–1876 also angered the officers, who felt that the government had sent them unwisely into the conflict.

A public consciousness was developing in Egypt during this period, literacy was spreading, and more newspapers were being published in the 1870s and 1880s, such as the influential &quot;Abu Naddara&quot;. Published by Yaʻqūb Ṣanūʻ, a Jew of Italian and Egyptian origins also known as &quot;James Sanua&quot;, this Paris-based publication was a political satire magazine that often mocked the establishment under European control, and it increasingly irritated the ruling powers as well as the Europeans as it favoured reform and revolutionary movements. It had a wide reach since, unlike many other publications, &quot;Abu Naddara&quot; was written in Egyptian Arabic rather than Modern Standard Arabic, making its satire and political pieces understandable to the masses, not just the educated elite. Yaʻqūb Ṣanūʻ claimed that his magazine reached a circulation of 10,000, which was a huge number in those days.

During this time, Ahmed ʻUrabi, a native non-European army officer, had risen to the rank of colonel. Because of his peasant upbringing and traditional training, he came to be viewed by many as the authentic voice of the people of Egypt. To them, he represented a peasant population frustrated with tax-exempt foreigners and wealthy local landlords. ʻUrabi commanded the respect and support of not only the peasantry but also a large portion of the Egyptian army.

==ʻUrabi&#x27;s seizure of power==
Tension built over the summer of 1881 as both the Khedive and the Egyptian officers, now led by ʻUrabi, searched for supporters and gathered allies. In September the Khedive ordered ʻUrabi&#x27;s regiment to leave Cairo. He refused and ordered the dismissal of the Turco-Circassian generals and the creation of an elected government. Unable to oppose the revolt, Tewfiq agreed and a new chamber of deputies and government were established containing a number of ʻUrabi&#x27;s allies.

==Foreign intervention==
On January 8, 1882, the French and British sent a joint note that asserted the primacy of the Khedive&#x27;s authority. The note infuriated the parliamentarians and ʻUrabi. The government collapsed; a new one with ʻUrabi as Minister of War was created. This new government threatened the positions of Europeans in the government and also began laying off large numbers of Turco-Circassian officers.

This broad effort at reform was opposed by European interests, many of the large landowners, the Turkish and Circassian elite, the high-ranking ulama (Muslim clergy), Syrian Christians, and most of the wealthiest members of society. In contrast, it had the support of most of the population, including lower-level ulama, the officer corps, and local leaders.

Copts were divided: their close affiliation with Europeans angered many and sometimes made them a target, but the deep rivalry between Coptic and Syrian Christians led many to align with rebels. The Coptic Patriarch lent his support to the revolt when it was at its peak, but later claimed that he was pressured into doing so. ʻUrabi and other leaders of the revolt acknowledged the Copts as potential allies and worked to prevent any targeting of the minority by nationalist Muslims, but were not always successful.

An effort to court the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II began. Tewfik Pasha called on the sultan to quell the revolt, but the Sublime Porte hesitated to employ troops against Muslims who opposed foreign colonial rule. ʻUrabi asked the Sultan to depose Tewfiq, but again the Sultan hesitated.

==British invasion==

On the afternoon of June 11, 1882 the political turmoil exploded into violence on the streets of Alexandria. Rioters attacked Greek, Maltese and Italian businesses and battles broke out in the streets. About fifty Europeans and 250 Egyptians were killed. The exact cause of the revolt is uncertain; both the Khedive and ʻUrabi have been blamed for starting it, but there is no proof of either allegation.

As the city&#x27;s garrison was maintaining the coastal defence batteries, an ultimatum was sent demanding the batteries be dismantled under threat of bombardment. The ultimatum was ignored, and the British fleet off Alexandria under Admiral Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester bombarded the city. The coastal batteries returned fire. The French fleet, also at Alexandria, refused to participate. A large British naval force then tried to capture the city. Despite encountering heavy resistance, the British forces succeeded, forcing the Egyptians to withdraw.

As revolts spread across Egypt, the British House of Commons voted in favour of a larger intervention. The British army launched a probing/scouting attack at the Battle of Kafr El Dawwar to determine whether or not Cairo could be advanced on from Alexandria, However the British concluded that the Egyptian defences were too strong, so in September of that year a British army was landed in the Canal Zone. The motivation for the British intervention is still disputed. The British were especially concerned that ʻUrabi would default on Egypt&#x27;s massive debt and that he might try to gain control of the Suez Canal. On September 13, 1882, the British forces defeated ʻUrabi&#x27;s army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. ʻUrabi was captured and eventually exiled to the British colony of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

==Aftermath==
While the British intervention was meant to be short-term, it persisted until 1956. Egypt was effectively made a colony until 1952. Both the British and the Khedival government did their best to discredit ʻUrabi&#x27;s name and the revolution, although among the common people ʻUrabi remained a popular figure. The government used the state media and educational system to denounce him as a traitor, and the revolution as merely a military mutiny. Egyptian historian Mohammed Rif&#x27;at was one of the first to call the events a &quot;thawrah&quot;, or &quot;revolution,&quot; but he claimed that it lacked popular support. Other historians in Egypt supported this thesis, and even expanded on it, sometimes suffering government censure. During the last years of the monarchy, authors became more critical of the old establishment and especially of the British, and ʻUrabi is sometimes portrayed as a hero of freedom and constitutionalism

ʻUrabi&#x27;s Revolt had a long-lasting significance as the first instance of Egyptian anti-colonial nationalism, which would later play a major role in Egyptian history. Especially under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the revolt would be regarded as a &quot;glorious struggle&quot; against foreign occupation. The ʻUrabi Revolution was seen by the Free Officers movement as a precursor to the 1952 revolution, and both Nasser and Muhammad Neguib were likened to ʻUrabi. Nasserist textbooks called the ʻUrabi Revolt a &quot;national revolution,&quot; but ʻUrabi was seen as making great strategic mistakes and not being as much of a man of the people as Nasser. During Nasser&#x27;s experiment with Arab socialism, the ʻUrabi revolt was also sometimes put in a Marxist context. Also during President Anwar Sadat&#x27;s &quot;infitah&quot; (economic liberalisation) period, in which there was growing, controlled, economic liberalization and growing ties with the Western European bloc, the government played up the desire of the ʻUrabists to draft a constitution and have democratic elections. After the 1952 revolution, the image of ʻUrabi, at least officially, has generally improved, with a number of streets and a square in Cairo bearing his name, indicating the honored position he has in the official history.

==Views of historians==
Historians have in general been divided, with one group seeing the revolt as a push for liberalism and freedom on the model of the French Revolution and others arguing that it was little more than a military coup, similar to those made about the 1952 movement. Among Western European historians, especially British, there was a traditional view that the ʻUrabi revolution was nothing more than a &quot;revolt&quot; or &quot;insurrection&quot; and not a real social revolution. By far the most influential Englishman in Egypt, Lord Cromer, wrote a scathing assessment of the ʻUrabists in his &quot;Modern Egypt&quot;. While this view is still held by many, there has been a growing trend to call the ʻUrabi uprising a real revolution, especially amongst newer historians who tend to emphasize social and economic history and to examine native, rather than European, sources.

The earliest published work of Augusta, Lady Gregory—later to embrace Irish nationalism and have an important role in the cultural life of Ireland—was &quot;Arabi and His Household&quot; (1882), a pamphlet (originally a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper) in support of Ahmed ʻUrabi and his revolt.

Historians have also been divided over the reasons for the British invasion, with some arguing that it was to protect the Suez Canal and prevent &quot;anarchy&quot;, while others argue that it was to protect the interests of British investors with assets in Egypt (see Anglo-Egyptian War).

<text>Johan Classon Risingh (1617 in Risinge – 1672) was the last governor of the Swedish colony of New Sweden.

==Biography==
Risingh was born in 1617 in Risinge, Östergötland, Sweden. His father was a pastor named Reverend Clas Botvidi. After gymnasium at Linköping, he attended the University of Uppsala and University of Leyden. From 1651 to 1653, he held the office of secretary of the Commercial College of Sweden under Erik Alexsson Oxenstierna. He wrote the first treatise on trade and economics ever compiled in Sweden in the autumn of 1653. Receiving knighthood, he set out from Sweden early in 1654, to take up his duties in New Sweden. Risingh was appointed assistant councilor of New Sweden under Governor Johan Printz.

Upon arrival in 1654, Risingh expressed concerns about the loss of Native alliances due to declining trade. This relationship was in decline due to rising hostilities over trade competition in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Risingh wrote that the loss of Native alliances could severely impact the territorial integrity of New Sweden against the English colony of Maryland and Dutch colony of New Netherland.

His first act was to cause the seizure of the Dutch Fort Casimir, which the Director-General of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant, had erected just below Fort Christina (near New Castle, Delaware) in 1651. Risingh claimed that Fort Casimir had been built on land that New Sweden had purchased from the local Native Americans.

Stuyvesant subsequently responded by leading an expedition to New Sweden and brought the colony under control of his government. In 1655, Risingh wrote to the Swedish government asking for financial support, but none was given. Swedish-allied Lenape launched raids on underdefended villages in New Netherland in response to the Dutch attack on New Sweden. Despite this, New Sweden prompted to surrender following the fall of Fort Christina to the Dutch on August 15, 1655. After the surrender, Risingh and the other officials, soldiers, and such colonists as were unwilling to become Dutch subjects, were taken back to Europe. Risingh died in poverty at Stockholm in April 1672.

Risingh&#x27;s reports for the period 1654 to 1655, constituting a valuable history of New Sweden under his administration. A contemporary manuscript copy of this report in Swedish is in the National Library of Sweden. This report was printed in 1878, in the appendix of Carl K. S. Sprinchorn&#x27;s &quot;Kolonien Nya Sveriges Historia&quot; (in English: History of the Colony of New Sweden). A translation of Sprinchorn&#x27;s text was made by Amandus Johnson.

Risingh is an amusing character in Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Knickerbocker&#x27;s History of New York.&quot; Irving gives a tongue-in-cheek report of the battle for Fort Casimir.

<text>The Second Battle of Ushant was a naval battle fought between French and British squadrons near Ushant, an island off the coast of Brittany, on 12 December 1781, as part of the American Revolutionary War.

==Background==
On 10 December 1781, a French convoy sailed from Brest with reinforcements and stores for the East and West Indies, protected by a fleet of 19 ships of the line commanded by Comte de Guichen.

On 11 December 1781, Bussy-Castelnau departed Cadiz, Spain, with a squadron comprising the 64-gun &quot;Saint-Michel&quot; and the 74-gun &quot;Illustre&quot;, escorting three transports, to make his junction at Tenerife in the Canary Islands with the squadron under Guichen.

The next day, they encountered a British squadron of ships of the line, commanded by Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt in HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, that had been ordered to sea to intercept the expected convoy.

==Action==
On 12 December, Kempenfelt&#x27;s squadron sighted the French convoy, discovering that its protective escort had been strengthened.

Initially, Guichen&#x27;s fleet was situated downwind of the convoy, allowing the British ships to sweep down and capture 15 ships carrying troops and supplies before the French ships could intervene.

Kempenfelt&#x27;s force was not strong enough to attack the 19 French escorts, but the French convoy, having deliberately risked setting sail in the North Atlantic storm season in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid British forces, was dispersed in a gale shortly afterwards, and most of the ships were forced to return to port.

==Aftermath==
Only two of the ships of the line intended for the West Indies arrived with a few transport vessels in time for the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782.

When news of the battle at Ushant reached Britain, the Opposition in Parliament questioned the decision to send such a small force against the convoy and forced an official inquiry into the administration of the Royal Navy. This was the first of a succession of Opposition challenges that would ultimately bring about the fall of the government of Lord North on 20 March 1782 and pave the way for the Peace of Paris the following year, which ended the American Revolutionary War.

The French transports &quot;Marquis de Castries&quot; and &quot;Neptune-Royal&quot;, lone survivors of the convoy, reached Saint Croix carrying siege artillery and an artillery company.

<text>Robert G. Thibault, (born September 29, 1959) is a Canadian politician.

==Early life==
Thibault was born in Digby, Nova Scotia in 1959. He is the grandson of former provincial politician, Joseph William Comeau.

==Political career==
Thibault served as a municipal councillor in Clare, Nova Scotia from 1988 to 2001 and was reelected in 2012. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and a former member in the House of Commons of Canada, serving three terms as the representative of West Nova from 2000 to 2008. He won his first federal election in 2000. He was named Minister of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency) in 2001. He was Minister of Fisheries and Oceans from 2002 to 2003. He won re-election in 2004. Thibault was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health from 2004 to 2006 under Paul Martin. In the 2006 election, he defeated Conservative opponent and former Nova Scotia cabinet minister Greg Kerr by 511 votes. On April 27, 2007, Thibault was named Liberal Critic for Competitiveness and the New Economy by Liberal leader Stéphane Dion. He was subsequently appointed Liberal critic for Health. Thibault was defeated in Canada&#x27;s 40th general election on October 14, 2008, by Conservative opponent Greg Kerr.

On October 3, 2009, Thibault was once again nominated to contest the West Nova seat for the Liberals in the 2011 federal election. On May 2, 2011, Thibault was defeated in his comeback attempt, losing to Kerr by more than 4,000 votes.

===Controversy===
In August 2008, Thibault caused controversy with some accusing him of ageism when he suggested that his Conservative opponent Greg Kerr was too old for the job. Only five days later, Thibault was accused of sexism when he called Marjory LeBreton, then government leader in the Senate, an &quot;idiot&quot; and suggested she should &quot;go back to making tea&quot; for former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Three months later, Thibault lost his seat in the 2008 election.

<doc id="600416" wikidata="Q392849" url="?curid=600416" title="A Perfect Day for Bananafish">
<text>&quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; is a short story by J. D. Salinger, originally published in the January 31, 1948, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It was anthologized in 1949&#x27;s &quot;55 Short Stories from The New Yorker&quot;, as well as in Salinger&#x27;s 1953 collection &quot;Nine Stories&quot;. The story is an enigmatic examination of a young married couple, Muriel and Seymour Glass, on vacation in Florida. It is the first of his stories to feature a member of the fictional Glass family.

When the 28-year-old Salinger submitted the manuscript to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in January 1947, titled &quot;The Bananafish&quot;, its arresting dialogue and precise style were read with interest by fiction editor William Maxwell and his staff, though the point of the story, in this original version, was considered incomprehensible.

At Maxwell&#x27;s urging, Salinger embarked upon a major reworking of the piece, adding the opening section with Muriel&#x27;s character, and crafting the material to provide insights into Seymour&#x27;s tragic demise. In frequent consultation with editor Gus Lobrano, Salinger revised the story numerous times throughout 1947, renaming it &quot;A Fine Day for Bananafish&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published the final version as &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; one year after Salinger first submitted the manuscript.

The story met with immediate acclaim, and according to Salinger biographer Paul Alexander, was &quot;the story that would permanently change his standing in the literary community.&quot; Salinger&#x27;s decision to collaborate with Maxwell and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; staff in developing the story marked a major advance in his career and led to his entry into the echelon of elite writers at the journal. The story has been compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;May Day.&quot;

==Plot summary==
The story is set at a large seaside resort in Florida. Muriel Glass, a wealthy and self-absorbed woman, phones her mother from her suite to discuss her husband Seymour, a World War II combat veteran recently discharged from an army hospital; it is implied that he was being evaluated for a psychiatric disorder. Muriel&#x27;s mother is concerned by reports of her son-in-law&#x27;s increasingly bizarre and anti-social actions, and warns her daughter that the doctor said he may &quot;lose control of himself&quot;. Muriel dismisses her remarks as hyperbole, regarding her husband&#x27;s idiosyncrasies as benign and manageable. 

Meanwhile, at the resort&#x27;s adjoining beach, a child named Sybil Carpenter has been left unsupervised by her mother so that she may drink at the hotel bar. Sybil wanders on the beach and finds Seymour, lying in solitude a quarter-mile from the hotel. Sybil reproaches Seymour for allowing another little girl, Sharon Lipschutz, to sit with him the previous night as he played the lounge piano for the hotel&#x27;s guests. Seymour attempts to placate Sybil by suggesting they &quot;catch a Bananafish&quot;, but Sybil insists that Seymour choose between her and Sharon Lipschutz. Seymour responds that he observed Sybil abusing a hotel patron&#x27;s dog, and the girl falls silent.

Seymour places Sybil on a rubber raft and wades into the water, where he tells her the story of &quot;the very tragic life&quot; of the bananafish: they gorge themselves on bananas, become too large to escape their feeding holes, and die. Sybil is unfazed by the story, and claims that she sees a bananafish with six bananas in its mouth. Seymour affectionately kisses the arch of one of her feet, and returns her to shore, where she departs.

Once alone, and returning to the hotel, Seymour becomes less affable. He starts a baseless argument with a woman in an elevator, accusing her of staring at his feet and calling her a &quot;god-damned sneak&quot;. He returns to his hotel room, where his wife is taking a nap. He retrieves a pistol from his luggage and shoots himself.

== Background on publication and style ==
Before publication of the story, Salinger had reworked the details in a meeting with Maxwell. Originally, the story consisted merely of Seymour&#x27;s incident on the beach with Sybil Carpenter and the subsequent suicide. Maxwell argued that there was no clear explanation for Seymour&#x27;s killing himself. After meeting with Maxwell, Salinger incorporated the portion of the story with Muriel talking to her mother on the phone. After the triumph of &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot;, Salinger allowed the &quot;New Yorker&quot; to have the first chance at printing all his subsequent writing by signing a contract with the magazine.

Despite some differing critical opinion, Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Nine Stories,&quot; in which &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; appears, are not separate entities published together. Author Eberhard Alsen, in &quot;A Reader’s Guide to J.D Salinger,&quot; observes that the stories evolve chronologically. They change in a way that mirrors Salinger&#x27;s personal life and his experiences with religion. Many scholars and critics have analyzed and reviewed the character of Seymour Glass in regard to his wartime experiences and suicide. Salinger&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Salinger, recalls her father&#x27;s stories from World War II and makes a connection between Salinger and Seymour. Author Ron Rosenbaum draws from Margaret Salinger&#x27;s memories to elicit a connection between Salinger&#x27;s progression from bleak to optimistic, and the spiritual writing style in &quot;Nine Stories&quot;.

Salinger was also greatly influenced by Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s writing style and narration method. Hemingway writes in such a way that the reader has to interpret and draw his or her own conclusions when characters are speaking. The vague description common to Hemingway&#x27;s narrative dialogue appears in several of Salinger&#x27;s stories and novels.

== Reception and criticism ==
Though &quot;Slight Rebellion off Madison&quot; was published in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; and met with acclaim&quot;,&quot; Salinger continued to face rejection afterward. The &quot;New Yorker&quot; consistently dismissed further stories he submitted. Unfazed, Salinger continued to submit work to the &quot;New Yorker&quot; because he believed the magazine&#x27;s editors would publish more of his stories. After sending the initial draft, &quot;The Bananafish&quot;, to the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Harold Ober, Salinger&#x27;s agent, received a letter from William Maxwell, a fiction editor at the magazine. The letter, from January 22, 1947, stated: &quot;We like parts of &#x27;The Bananafish&#x27; by J.D. Salinger very much, but it seems to us to lack any discernible story or point. If Mr. Salinger is around town, perhaps he&#x27;d like to come in and talk to us about New Yorker stories.&quot;

When &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; was first published, its initial reception was favorable. Readers accepted Salinger&#x27;s novel tone, and &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; popularized Salinger in the literary community.

Much of the criticism of the story involves the character of Seymour Glass, who appears in several other Salinger stories. Critics interpret evidence from the story to determine the cause of Seymour&#x27;s suicide; conflicting reasons appear in other stories about the Glass family. Some believe the entire world drives Seymour to madness; others draw a connection to post-traumatic stress. According to critic Janet Malcolm, the world portrayed in the story is both tangled and simplified by Salinger. This &quot;dualism&quot; can be found in other works of Salinger, as he repeatedly depicts life &quot;as a battleground between the normal and abnormal, the ordinary and the extraordinary, the talentless and the gifted, the well and the sick.&quot;

==Analysis==
Like the eldest son of the Glass family, Salinger was deeply affected by his experiences as a combat soldier in WWII, and these informed his writing. Kenneth Slawenski reports that Salinger, in his &quot;Seymour – An Introduction&quot; (1959), confesses that the young man in &quot;Bananafish&quot; &quot;was not Seymour at all but... myself.&quot; Traumatized by the Battle of the Bulge and the Nazi concentration camps, Salinger &quot;found it impossible to fit into a society that ignored the truth that he now knew.&quot;

Children figure prominently in Salinger&#x27;s works. Seymour&#x27;s sympathetic, affectionate interaction with children is contrasted with the detached and phony behavior of adults. In the aftermath of his interlude with Sybil, Seymour &quot;has drawn his own conclusions regarding the makeup of human beings and the world around him&quot; and commits suicide.

===T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and &quot;Bananafish&quot;===

Salinger quotes a verse from the poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by poet T. S. Eliot in the following exchange between Seymour and Sybil, regarding the little girl&#x27;s young rival, Sharon Lipschutz:

The stanza that contains the verse is from Section I of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; – &quot;The Burial of the Dead&quot;:

&quot;The Burial of the Dead&quot; begins with an excerpt from Petronius Arbiter&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;, which reads: &quot;For once I saw with my own eyes the Cumean Sibyl hanging in a jar, and when the boys asked her, &#x27;Sibyl, what do you want?&#x27; she answered, &#x27;I want to die.

Slawenski argues that Salinger&#x27;s choice of the name Sybil for the little girl establishes an &quot;unmistakable&quot; correlation between Eliot&#x27;s depiction of the Cumaean Sybil of Greek myth and Seymour&#x27;s story of the bananafish. The bananafish are &quot;doomed by greed&quot; and thus share the fate of Eliot&#x27;s Sybil, &quot;cursed by relentless existence.&quot;

<text>This article concerns football records in England. Unless otherwise stated, records are taken from the Football League or Premier League. Where a different record exists for the top flight (Football League First Division 1888–1992, and Premier League 1992–present), this is also given. This article includes clubs based in Wales that compete in English leagues.

==League==
The original league saw twelve teams become the founding members of the Football League in 1888–89: Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Everton, Preston North End, Aston Villa, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Three of the teams (Blackburn Rovers, Everton and Aston Villa) also played in the first Premier League season in 1992–93, but Notts County missed out, finishing in the relegation zone in 1991–92.

A second division was added four years later for the 1892–93 season, resulting in the Football League now becoming the Football League First Division, the top division for the next one hundred years. The Southern League became Division 3 in 1920. A Northern League formed the following year that became Division Three North. In 1958 the regional divisions combined to form the Third Division and a national Fourth Division. The top 12 sides from the Northern and Southern divisions formed the Third Division, whilst the bottom 12 of the respective divisions formed the new fourth tier.

Nine clubs have reached double figures of league titles, with Liverpool and Manchester United leading the chasing pack. Five clubs have managed to win all four divisions, while a further seven clubs need the top title to complete the full set. Luton Town have technically also won four different divisions, albeit one of these was the National League (the first tier of English non-league football) in 2014.



For the 1919–20 season, the first season after the First World War, Arsenal were controversially elected in to the first division, despite finishing fifth in the last season before the outbreak of war in the second division. However, they have remained at this level ever since. Arsenal had once previously won promotion after finishing second behind Preston North End in the 1903–04 season, staying there until finishing bottom in 1912–13. Other clubs won elections to play in the first division. Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United in 1898, Bury and Notts County in 1905 and Chelsea (alongside Arsenal) in 1919 were also elected to the top flight. Blackburn later won division 2 in 1938–39, and Newcastle United finished runners-up in 1947–48. Notts County became second division champions in 1913–14, while Bury would finish runners-up in 1923–24. In the 1929–30 season, Chelsea finished second behind Blackpool. Arsenal, still to this day, have the unenviable record as being the only club who have never earned their place in the top flight, through their league position, after being elected in the 1919–20 season.

Holding the record of continuous seasons, Arsenal are some way ahead of other clubs who have suffered relegation. Everton spent three years in the second division before finishing as runners-up to Leicester City in the 1953–54 season. Neighbours Liverpool, after having spent eight years outside the top division, won the second division title in the 1961–62 season. Manchester United bounced straight back up in 1974–75, after finishing second bottom in 1973–74. This would be Manchester United&#x27;s last football league title before the birth of the Premier League, in their only time outside the top division since the end of the Second World War. Tottenham Hotspur also spent a season in the Second Division; similarly to Manchester United, it is the only time they have been outside the top flight since 1950. In 1976–77, Spurs conceded 72 goals as they finished bottom; the following season, they finished third in the second division to earn promotion back to the top flight. Chelsea have been in the top flight since 1989 after winning the second division, while Manchester City were present there since their 2002 promotion as Division 1 (2nd Tier) Winners. The 1998–99 season saw Manchester City earn promotion from Division 2 (currently known as League One), after winning a penalty shootout against Gillingham in the play-off final. City finished as runners-up to Charlton Athletic in Division 1 (currently known as the Championship) the following season, then made an immediate return after relegation in 2001, before securing their seventh second division title.

Unlike many European clubs that have never played outside their country&#x27;s top division, no English club can claim that achievement. 65 clubs have played at the top level, six clubs have never returned, and the rest, apart from Arsenal, have secured promotion from the second division. Glossop, Leyton Orient, Northampton Town, Carlisle United, Swindon Town, and Barnsley have completed only one season in the top flight. The club that can boast playing the most seasons in the top tier is Everton, who are about to play their 121st season there (out of a possible 125 league seasons). The city of Liverpool has always been represented in footballs top tier. While Everton suffered relegation in 1930, Liverpool remained, though Everton instantly returned to the top flight a year later. After three years in the second division from 1951 to 1954, Everton won promotion to the First Division, swapping places with Liverpool who had been relegated; it would be eight years later that under Bill Shankly, Liverpool were promoted from the second division.

=== Champions of England ===
Twenty four different football clubs have been crowned English champions since the league began in 1888. Some clubs have enjoyed regular success with others not so fortunate. In 2020, Liverpool ended a 30-year wait to become league champions again, however this is nowhere near the longest wait in history to once again be the English champions. Preston North End won the first two league titles but have never won it since 1890. Sheffield United won in 1898 but no second title has yet arrived. Their neighbours, Sheffield Wednesday, have won the league more recently than them, but have not added to their tally of four league titles, with their most recent success coming in 1930. Huddersfield Town won a hat-trick of titles between 1924 and 1926, but nearly a century later no fourth title has been added. 

It is approaching 100 years since Newcastle United were English champions while Tottenham Hotspur have now gone 63 years without any league titles. Chelsea had to wait 50 years before their first Premier League success in 2005, although they did win the second division twice in the 1980s. 

Manchester City endured 44 barren years before winning the league title in 2012. Manchester United went 41 years without the top title, but that time period includes two world wars, with eleven seasons lost. Arsenal, meanwhile, are currently in their longest period without a league title since first becoming English champions in 1931, with their last triumph coming in 2004. Arsenal went 18 years without a title twice, 1953 until 1971, then again until 1989.

In the lower leagues Leicester City hold the record for most second tier titles with eight. Behind are Sunderland, Sheffield Wednesday and Norwich City all with five. The third tier record is held by Plymouth Argyle. Winning League 1 in the 2022-23 season moved them to outright holders, ahead of Portsmouth, Bristol City, Doncaster Rovers, Wigan Athletic and Hull City. Chesterfield still hold the fourth tier record, which they have held since the 2013-14 season. Notts County, Doncaster Rovers, Brentford and Swindon Town all have three titles.

<doc id="600420" wikidata="Q1343040" url="?curid=600420" title="Battle of Ushant (1778)">
<text>The Battle of Ushant (also called the First Battle of Ushant) took place on 27 July 1778, and was fought during the American Revolutionary War between French and British fleets west of Ushant, an island at the mouth of the English Channel off the westernmost point of France. &quot;Ushant&quot; is the anglicised pronunciation of &quot;Ouessant&quot;.

The French commander was under orders to avoid battle if possible, in order to maintain a fleet in being. The commanders of the two squadrons of the British fleet were already personally and politically at odds with each other, and failed to make a concerted attack on the French.

The battle, which was the first major naval engagement in the Anglo-French War of 1778, ended indecisively with no ships lost on either side and led to recriminations and political conflicts in both countries.

==Background==
The British had a fleet of thirty ships-of-the-line, four frigates, and two fire-ships commanded by Admiral Augustus Keppel, in , which sailed from Spithead on 9 July. The French fleet had thirty-two ships-of-the-line, seven frigates, five corvettes and one lugger, commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte d&#x27;Orvilliers, who had sailed from Brest on 8 July. Keppel sighted the French fleet west of Ushant at just after noon on 23 July. Keppel immediately ordered his battleships into line and set off in pursuit. At around 7 o&#x27;clock in the evening, the French fleet went about and began heading towards the British. Keppel, who did not wish to engage at night, had his ships hove to in response. In the morning, d&#x27;Orvilliers found himself to the north-west of the British fleet and cut off from Brest, although he retained the weather gage. Two of his ships, standing to leeward, escaped into port, leaving him with thirty ships-of-the-line. Keppel tried for three days to bring the French to action but d&#x27;Orvilliers declined, maintaining his position upwind and heading into the Atlantic.

==Battle==

At 6a.m. on 27 July, with the British fleet roughly line-abreast, Keppel gave the order for the rear division, several miles away under Sir Hugh Palliser, to chase to windward. At 9a.m., the French, who had hitherto been sailing in the same direction, several miles to windward, went about once more. As the rearmost ships of the French fleet were tacking, however, the wind changed allowing the British to close the gap between them and their quarry. At 10:15 the British were slightly to leeward, line-ahead on the same course as the French. A little later, a change in wind direction brought about a rain squall which cleared at around 11 o&#x27;clock. A further change in wind direction to the south-west gave advantage to the British which d&#x27;Orvilliers sought to negate by ordering his ships about. The French, now heading towards the British in a loose formation, would pass slightly to windward.

The French ships were a few points off the wind and d&#x27;Orvilliers ordered them close hauled which caused the French line to veer slightly away from the British. The battle began at 11:20 when the fourth French ship in the line was able to bring her guns to bear. Keppel, who wished to save his salvo for the enemy flagship, received the broadsides of six French ships without reply. Once he had engaged the 110-gun , he continued to attack the next six ships in the French line.

As the British van under Robert Harland passed the end of the French line, Harland ordered his ships about so as to chase the French rearguard, including the . Palliser&#x27;s ten ships at the rear had not formed line of battle but were instead in a loose irregular formation. This was in part due to Keppel&#x27;s earlier order to break off and chase the French ships to windward. Palliser&#x27;s division therefore was badly mauled, having allowed itself to be attacked piecemeal. At 1p.m. &quot;Victory&quot; passed the last French ship and attempted to follow Harland but was so badly damaged in the masts and rigging that Keppel had to wear round and it was 2p.m. before his ships were on the opposite tack. It was about this time that Palliser in &quot;Formidable&quot; emerged from the battle, downwind of Keppel&#x27;s division.

Meanwhile, the French line had tacked and was now heading south on the starboard tack and threatening to pass the British fleet to leeward. The French practice of firing high into the rigging had left several of the British ships disabled and it was this group that Keppel now stood down towards whilst making the signal, &#x27;form line of battle&#x27;. By 4p.m., Harland&#x27;s division had gone about and joined Keppel&#x27;s ships in line but Palliser would not or could not conform and his ships, misunderstanding Keppel&#x27;s intentions, formed line with their commander, several miles upwind from the rest of the British fleet. D&#x27;Orvilliers did not, however, attack the British fleet while it was divided into three sections but instead continued his course, passing the British fleet to leeward.

At 5p.m., Keppel sent the sixth-rate, , to demand that Palliser join the main body of the fleet and when this failed, at 7, Keppel removed Palliser from the chain of command by individually signalling each ship in Palliser&#x27;s division. By the time those ships had joined Keppel, night had fallen and, under cover of darkness, the French fleet sailed off. By daylight the French were 20 miles away and with no chance of catching them, Keppel decided to return to Plymouth to repair his ships.

==Aftermath==

===France===
The &quot;duc de Chartres&quot;, Louis Philippe II d&#x27;Orléans, a French Prince du sang (Prince of the royal blood), who took part in the battle, requested permission to carry news of its outcome to Paris and Versailles. He arrived there early on the morning of 2 August, had Louis XVI woken and announced a victory. Chartres was widely celebrated and received a twenty-minute standing ovation when he attended the Paris Opera. An effigy of Admiral Keppel was burnt in the gardens of his family residence, the Palais-Royal. Chartres then returned to Brest to rejoin the fleet. Fresh reports of the battle and Chartres&#x27; role then began to arrive in the French capital. Far from a victory, it was now reported as being at best indecisive, and Chartres was accused by d&#x27;Orvilliers of either misunderstanding or deliberately ignoring an order to engage the enemy.

Chartres was soon mocked by street ballads in Paris, and the embarrassment led to his eventual resignation from the Navy. He subsequently tried to gain permission to take part in a planned invasion of Britain the following year, but he was refused by the King.

The captains of and , Trémigon and Rochechouart, were subject of an inquiry for their failure to take part in the battle after they got separated from the fleet in the night of 23 to 24 July. Rochechouart was also the commanding officer of the Second Division of the White-and-Blue squadron. Trémigon was admonished, and Rochechouart was cleared.

===Britain===
A violent quarrel, exacerbated by political differences, broke out between the British commands. This led to two courts-martial, the resignation of Keppel, and great injury to the discipline of the navy. Keppel was court-martialled but cleared of misconduct in action. Much was made of the alteration of log books and missing notes. Palliser was criticised by an inquiry before the affair turned into a squabble of party politics.

== Order of battle ==
=== British fleet ===
=== French fleet ===
The French line of battle was in reversed order (the Régiment du Dauphin provided a detachment of marines during the battle).

<text>Rescue – The British Archaeological Trust is a charitable organisation in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1971 as a pressure group by a team including the archaeologists Margaret Ursula Jones, Phillip A. Barker, and Martin Biddle.

The Trust campaigns for government funds to permit the excavation of archaeological sites in advance of road-building, construction or other development. Specific actions include opposing the planned tunnel near the site of Stonehenge, proposed in 2017, claiming that it could threaten the site&#x27;s UNESCO heritage status, and criticising the use of metal detectors to discover items of cultural significance.

<text>Chavannes-près-Renens is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud, located in the district of Ouest Lausannois.

==History==
The eastern part of Chavannes-près-Renens was already inhabited during the time of the Romans. A bronze figurine, an axe, knives and several iron items have been found from that period. From the middle ages until the 18th century it was a rural town focused on agriculture.

Chavannes-près-Renens is first mentioned in 1224 as &quot;Chavanes&quot;. In another document from October 1272 the former bisschop of Lausanne Jean de Cossonay talks about the territory of Chavannes as well as its mills.

==Geography==

Chavannes-près-Renens has an area, , of . Of this area, or 23.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 9.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 65.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 2.4% is either rivers or lakes.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 4.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 27.9% and transportation infrastructure made up 18.2%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 14.5%. Out of the forested land, 6.1% of the total land area is heavily forested and 3.0% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 10.3% is used for growing crops and 9.1% is pastures, while 4.2% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.

The municipality was part of the Morges District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Chavannes-près-Renens became part of the new district of Ouest Lausannois.

The municipality is located in the industrial region westward of Lausanne.

== Flag and coat of arms ==
The flag and coat of arms of the town consists of an arched bridge and a cherry branch on an argent (silver) and gules (red) background.

The flag and the coat of arms were adopted in 1905 but got their final forms in 1930. The bridge and the background colors represent the bridge in Lausanne under which the inhabitants of Chavannes had to walk in the Middle Ages. The cherries symbolize the importance of orchards for the town at the beginning of the 20th century. A special type of dark cherries, called &quot;Noire de Chavannes&quot; was cultivated during that time. 
The coat of arms shows red cherries instead of dark ones, probably for aesthetic reasons.

<doc id="600439" wikidata="Q3545771" url="?curid=600439" title="Sabrina the Teenage Witch">
<text>Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Madhouse&quot; #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962). Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title &quot;Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch&quot; in almost all of the &quot;Little Archie&quot; comics.

The premise is that Sabrina, a &quot;half-witch&quot; – her mother is an ordinary human, or &quot;mortal&quot; as witches refer to them, while her father is a warlock – lives with her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, both witches themselves, in the fictional town of Greendale, which is located somewhere near Riverdale, the home of Archie Andrews. Also living with the three women as the family pet is Salem Saberhagen, a warlock who has been turned into a cat as punishment for world domination attempts. Sabrina&#x27;s primary romantic interest is her mortal boyfriend Harvey Kinkle who, like nearly all the other mortals in Sabrina&#x27;s world, is unaware she is a witch.

Most of Sabrina&#x27;s adventures consist of Sabrina either trying to use her powers in secret to help others – witches generally are not allowed to tell mortals about their abilities or existence – or dealing with the day-to-day trials of being a teenager. A recurring theme in Sabrina&#x27;s stories is her learning more about the proper use of her powers, either through her aunts or from trips to a magical dimension that is the home of various magical/mythological creatures, including other witches. Various names are given to this dimension; the mid-late 2000s comics refer to it as the &quot;Magic Realm,&quot; while the live-action sitcom referred to it as the &quot;Other Realm&quot;.

The comic&#x27;s characters have also appeared in various other media formats. The live-action sitcom, in which Sabrina discovers her powers at the age of sixteen, aired for a combined seven seasons on ABC and the WB. Earlier, there had been an animated series produced by Filmation Associates. Another format was a series of paperback novels (see list below) written by various authors, including Nancy Holder, Diana G. Gallagher, and Mel Odom, as well as a set in the original Archie Comics continuity, where Sabrina already knows about her powers while in junior high. She is portrayed by Melissa Joan Hart on the live action sitcom and Kiernan Shipka on the Riverdale spin-off, &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;.

==Publication history==
Sabrina the Teenage Witch debuted in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Madhouse&quot; (the logo is sometimes given as &quot;Archie&#x27;s Mad House&quot;) #22 (Oct. 1962). Created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo. She first appeared in that humor anthology&#x27;s lead story (the logo then spelled &quot;Teen-Age&quot;), and eventually became one of Archie Comics&#x27; major characters, appearing in an animated series and a television sitcom. Gladir recalled in 2007,

Sabrina made regular appearances in the comic book &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Laugh-Out&quot;. The title was published from 1969 to 1985, and consisted of 106 issues.

The first volume of &quot;Sabrina The Teenage Witch&quot; was published from 1971 to 1983, and ran for 77 issues. A new &quot;Sabrina&quot; comic series was introduced shortly after the debut of the 1996 live-action sitcom. This series ran for 32 issues, between 1997 and December 1999. The new series incorporated elements from the live-action sitcom, including modernized fashions and appearances for the aunts, Sabrina&#x27;s last name and Salem&#x27;s personality and backstory.

Starting in January 2000, Archie rebooted the series from #1, this time based upon the 2000 animated series (the final issue of the 1997–1999 series had acted as a transition between the two adaptations). This new title was simply titled &quot;Sabrina&quot; and lasted for 37 issues; issue #38, published in late 2002, again acted as a transition issue, as the series was re-titled &quot;Sabrina The Teenage Witch&quot; and resumed the conventional high school setting. However, elements of the live-action sitcom (Salem&#x27;s backstory, the modernized appearances of Hilda and Zelda) were retained, along with the name of Sabrina&#x27;s hometown (Greendale) from &quot;Sabrina the Animated Series&quot; being incorporated into the comics. The conventional setting lasted until issue #57, published in 2004, when the comic underwent a manga makeover (see below). The series ended with issue #104 in September 2009.

Sabrina also occasionally appears in other Archie Comics as a visiting acquaintance of Archie, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, and Jughead Jones. In &quot;Jughead&quot; #200 (May 2010), Sabrina reveals to Jughead that she is a witch, which is made use of in a follow-up story. Sabrina and Salem make a notable appearance in the 2012 &quot;Archie&quot; issue #636, where Salem, as a plot device, performs a spell (against Sabrina&#x27;s desires) that gender-bends the entire town of Riverdale without the characters noticing the change.

===Specials===
Issue #28 of &quot;Sabrina&quot;, as well as the Sonic Super Special &quot;Crossover Chaos&quot;, featured a crossover with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, in which Sonic was brought to Greendale from Mobius by one of Sabrina&#x27;s enemies and subsequently brainwashed into attacking Sabrina herself. In this issue, it is mentioned that Salem is a fan of Sonic and has all of his comics and watches &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

=== Manga-inspired version ===
In 2004, beginning with issue #58 (in the second &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; comic book series), the comics were taken over by Tania del Rio with her manga-inspired art and design style. Concurrent with this, the comic ceased to be connected to either the live-action or animated &quot;Sabrina&quot; series. The comics were then released featuring new characters and a slightly more serious, continuity-heavy plot. The manga Sabrina story wrapped up at issue #100 in 2009, albeit with a few unresolved subplots.

Issues #58-61 of the &#x27;manga makeover&#x27; series were reprinted as &quot;Sabrina- The Magic Revisited&quot;. Then, in 2013, issues #58-67 were reprinted as &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch: The Magic Within Book 1&quot; in grayscale instead of full-color. &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch: The Magic Within Book 2&quot; containing issues #68-78 also was reprinted in grayscale instead of full-color. Book 3 and 4 containing issues #79-89 and #90-100, respectively, were also released and, like the first two, were reprinted in gray-scale instead of full color.

Issues #58-100 of the &#x27;manga makeover&#x27; series were released digitally as Sabrina Manga #1–43.

=== &quot;Stories of Young Salem&quot; ===
A four-issue spin-off miniseries featuring Salem as a young boy (predating his attempts at conquest later in life and his transformation into a cat) was published in 2009. The miniseries was written by Ian Flynn and illustrated by Chad Thomas. The mini-series continued directly on Sabrina&#x27;s regular series beginning with issue #101, albeit with a different title known as &quot;The Magical Tales of Young Salem&quot;. This was done as a method to cut newsstands costs. The new series is partially based on a two-part story which occurred during the manga Sabrina series issues #93 and #94, which was a flashback about Salem&#x27;s near-rise to power. As of issue #104, the first &quot;The Magical Tales of Young Salem&quot; mini-series was concluded, but apparently the comic book series was subsequently suspended for internal reasons with no further Young Salem stories announced.

=== &quot;New Riverdale&quot; ===

In 2015, &quot;New Riverdale&quot; was introduced, rebooting the entire original Archie lineup in favor of a realistic aesthetic aimed at older readers. Sabrina debuted in the &quot;New Riverdale&quot; with &quot;Jughead&quot; #9. She continued to appear for issues #10 and #11. In December 2016, it was announced that a &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; one-shot would debut in March 2017 as part of Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;pilot season&quot;. This one-shot would have been greenlit into a full series if there was enough fan interest. However, in May 2017 it was revealed that the one-shot was cancelled, with no intention of releasing it at a later date.

=== 2019 miniseries ===

In November 2018, Archie Comics announced a five-issue miniseries, written by Kelly Thompson and illustrated by the husband-and-wife team of Veronica Fish and Andy Fish, set to launch in the spring of 2019.

The series was critically acclaimed, with Thrillist calling it &quot;one of the best comics of the year&quot; and commercially successful. Archie Comics announced a second series to debut in the winter of 2020 with the same creative team.

=== 2020 miniseries ===

In Winter 2020, &quot;Sabrina, Something WICKED&quot; would debut with writer Kelly Thompson and husband-wife duo Veronica Fish and Andy Fish all returning for another five issues.

This miniseries would end with the fifth issue, featuring the first comic appearance of Ambrose, from the chilling adventures show, telling Sabrina she had been accepted into a magical academy.

This version of the Sabrina mythos would continue with one last issue, the 2020 Sabrina Winter Special, picking up after the end of &quot;Something WICKED&quot; with writer Kelly Thompson again returning to write with Veronica Fish and Andy Fish once again illustrating.

The Winter Special shows Sabrina attending her new magical school, and helping her classmates rescue a fellow friend from a demon-beast.

As an added bonus, the winter special would also include a bonus comic featuring Sabrina&#x27;s aunts and parents in their teenage years trying to save the &quot;Yuel Festival&quot; from the spirit of one of Sabrina&#x27;s ancestors.

==Characters==
This is a list and description of the characters that appear in the &quot;Sabrina&quot; comic books. For information about the characters from the live-action TV sitcom, see &quot;List of Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series) characters&quot;.

===Main characters===
*Sabrina Spellman: the lead character of the series. In the early comic series, Sabrina is a well-meaning girl, but she struggles with constant pressure to be &quot;bad&quot; from all the other witches around her, especially her aunts, as well as learning to master her powers. Later comics incarnations (and media spinoffs) present other witches, including her aunts, as largely &quot;good,&quot; though Sabrina still struggles to fully master her powers.
*Hilda Spellman: Sabrina&#x27;s aunt. In the earlier comics, Hilda is portrayed dressed as and behaving in a more stereotypical witch manner, including being cranky, disliking mortals (particularly Harvey), and prone to using her powers for revenge or resolving petty disputes. The 1990s comics toned down Hilda&#x27;s cranky behavior and modernized her clothing and physical appearance.
*Zelda Spellman: Sabrina&#x27;s aunt. In the earlier comics, Zelda (like Hilda) also was dressed in stereotypical witch&#x27;s clothes, but unlike Hilda, was the more compassionate and kindly of the two. The 1990s comics modernized Zelda&#x27;s clothing and physical appearance. In the earliest comics, she was supposed to find a husband within a year or else lose her powers.
*Harvey Kinkle: Sabrina&#x27;s boyfriend, a mortal who is unaware of Sabrina&#x27;s being a witch. Harvey is presented as being sweet and loyal, but also accident-prone (similar to Archie).
*Salem Saberhagen: the Spellmans&#x27; American shorthair cat. Salem was formerly a witch, who was turned into a cat as punishment by the Witches&#x27; Council for plotting to take over the world. Salem has the ability to speak and possesses a sarcastic and somewhat self-centered attitude. The name &quot;Salem&quot; refers to the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Comics published before the late 1990s presented Salem as an ordinary orange-colored cat unable to speak. Since the late 1990s, Salem inherited the elements of his live-action sitcom counterpart, including the backstory of formerly being a witch, the ability to speak, and being colored black. Since the late 1990s, reprints of earlier Sabrina stories in Archie digests usually recolor Salem as black.

===Other recurring characters===
*Witches&#x27; Council: A council of powerful witches that oversees the other witches.
*Enchantra: The Queen of Witches, and head of the Witches&#x27; Council. Most of her appearances were in &quot;&quot;.
*Della, the Spellmans&#x27; head witch. A strict, short-tempered authority figure, Della does not approve of Sabrina using magic to help others. Della largely appears in the earlier comics. In the late 1990s comics, she appears as Enchantra&#x27;s secretary.
*Rosalind: Sabrina&#x27;s arch-enemy in the original comic book stories from &quot;Archie&#x27;s Mad House&quot;. She was constantly fighting with Sabrina over the same boys. In later stories, their adversarial relationship is dropped. Instead, Rosalind is depicted as a teenage witch and is much more friendly with Sabrina.

===Sabrina&#x27;s cousins===
*Ambrose: Sabrina&#x27;s cousin, a witch. He had an acute sense of fashion and showmanship and, in the Filmation animated series, an effete voice and mannerisms. Ambrose does not appear in any of the later media spin-offs; his role in the comics since the 1990s has largely been replaced by Salem. He has since returned in &quot;the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;, along with his cobra familiars, Nag and Nagaina.
*Esmeralda: Sabrina&#x27;s younger cousin from the comic book series who is also a witch, but has an obnoxious, bratty attitude. Her character is similar to Sabrina&#x27;s young cousin Amanda from the live-action TV sitcom (who was played by actress Melissa Joan Hart&#x27;s real-life younger sister, Emily Hart).
*Brucie: Sabrina&#x27;s young mystical prankster cousin from &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; #18 (1974) that she has to babysit.
*Al: Sabrina&#x27;s cousin that dresses like a cowboy. He uses magic to help Sabrina&#x27;s boyfriend Harvey play music in &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; #2 (1971)

===Characters from the Gravestone Heights stories===
A 1990s storyline saw Sabrina and her aunts relocate for a time to the town of &quot;Gravestone Heights,&quot; which is populated by various monsters and creatures.

*Eye-da: A student from Riverdale High with a giant eyeball for a head. She appeared at least twice in the late 1950s in &quot;Archie&quot; stories, usually as only an unexpected visual punchline at the end of a typical story featuring Betty and Veronica. However, she became a significant character many years later in one incarnation of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;. When Sabrina and her aunts moved to Gravestone Heights, a city inhabited by witches, ghosts and monsters, Eye-da (who seemed less out of place there) became one of Sabrina&#x27;s best friends.
*Francine: Sabrina&#x27;s ghoulish friend that resembles the Bride of Frankenstein.
*Cleara Glass: One of Sabrina&#x27;s best friends in the Gravestone Heights series. Cleara is an invisible girl, except for her eyes and mouth.
*Milton: Sabrina&#x27;s vampire boyfriend. In the original cast list of Gravestone Heights, Milton is listed as a friend of Sabrina&#x27;s that is a mummy who is &quot;all wrapped up in himself&quot;, while Sabrina&#x27;s &quot;very vein&quot; vampire boyfriend is named Drac. In later comics, it was explained that Milton had to wrap himself up like a mummy to protect himself from the sunlight.
*Ms. Reaper: A teacher at Gravestone Heights &quot;whose tests are deadly&quot;.

===Characters from the manga stories===
*Batty Bartholomew: Called &quot;Batty&quot; as a nickname because, when his memory was originally erased, he went kind of crazy. One of the original Four Blades leaders. Was Sabrina&#x27;s tutor and helped her become good again after using the dark side of her wand. Sabrina restored his memory. The &quot;new Four Blades&quot; have joined forces with the &quot;old Four Blades&quot; once Sabrina and the other &quot;new Four Blades&quot; realized the true intentions of the Four Blades movement.
*Libby Chessler: A cheerleader, Sabrina&#x27;s arch-enemy. Libby always is trying to steal Harvey from Sabrina. Libby was introduced in the live-action TV series and is similar to the original version of Rosalind from the comic book series. She was later integrated into the comic books.
*Galiena: Wizardress, Czarina of Decree (i.e. chief enforcer) of the Magic Council. She was Sabrina&#x27;s &quot;boss&quot; when Sabrina interned there for a summer.
*LLandra da Silva: Another teenage witch and Sabrina&#x27;s best friend. Also lives in the mortal realm, but goes to a different high school. Was, but is no longer, dating Shinji Yamagi.
*Professor Lunata: A female satyr who is one of the teachers at Charm School.
*Narayan: A teenage merman and LLandra&#x27;s current boyfriend. He was given the ability to walk on land by Sabrina. He joined the Four Blades after that to get closer to LLandra and also became friends with Sabrina and Shinji.
*Amy Reinhardt: Amy is a popular girl at Sabrina&#x27;s high school who often competes with Sabrina in various forms, but most notably for Harvey&#x27;s attention. Amy appeared mostly in the comics in the 1990s and 2000s, though her character is similar to Libby from the live action TV series, and Katy from the 1996 TV movie. In , she is considerably nicer, albeit still somewhat arrogant.
*Gwenevive Ricci: A mortal goth and wannabe witch who is a friend of Sabrina&#x27;s.
*Queen Seles: Elven sorceress and Queen of the Magic Council. After Seles was &quot;rescued&quot; by Nocturna and Salem, she went around the magic realm with a &quot;family&quot;, but that never included Salem. Nocturna read his mind, while believing that he loved her. She realized that all of Salem&#x27;s thoughts were of war and destruction. She tells Sabrina what the Four Blades really did, as well as her story of how she lost all her magic, and why the Mana Tree is dying.
*Shinji Yamagi: A teenage witch whom Sabrina met while attending a spellcasting school. He tries to compete with Harvey for Sabrina&#x27;s affections. He appears in Secrets as a bully character who hates Sabrina, and is Enchantra&#x27;s son.

===Animated television series===

====&quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; (1970)====

In 1970, CBS debuted a Filmation boy-oriented animated superhero fantasy sitcom, The Sabrina the Teenage Witch Show, a spin-off from its popular Archie franchise.

In this version, Sabrina lives in Riverdale (fictional hometown of the Archie characters), rather than Greendale, as it was in the comic books. Her last name is Sawyer instead of Spellman, also it is said that both her parents are witches.

====&quot;Sabrina Goes to Rome&quot;====

A film starring Melissa Joan Hart, it follows American teenage witch Sabrina and her food-obsessed magical talking cat and mouse to Rome, the last whereabout of her 16th-century aunt Sophia.

====&quot;Sabrina Down Under&quot;====
The third &quot;Sabrina&quot; film finds the title character trying to save mermaids from environmental pollution and a man trying to alter Australia&#x27;s waterways.

<text>Uncle Remus is the fictional title character and narrator of a collection of African American folktales compiled and adapted by Joel Chandler Harris and published in book form in 1881. Harris was a journalist in post–Reconstruction era Atlanta, and he produced seven Uncle Remus books. He did so by introducing tales that he had heard and framing them in the plantation context. He wrote his stories in a dialect which was his interpretation of the Deep South African-American language of the time. For these framing and stylistic choices, Harris&#x27;s collection has garnered controversy since its publication.

==Structure==
&quot;Uncle Remus&quot; is a collection of animal stories, songs, and oral folklore collected from Southern black Americans. Many of the stories are didactic, much like those of Aesop&#x27;s Fables and Jean de La Fontaine&#x27;s stories. Uncle Remus is a kindly old freedman who serves as a story-telling device, passing on the folktales to children gathered around him, like the traditional African griot.

The stories are written in an eye dialect devised by Harris to represent a Deep South Black dialect. Uncle Remus is a compilation of Br&#x27;er Rabbit storytellers whom Harris had encountered during his time at the Turnwold Plantation. Harris said that the use of the Black dialect was an effort to add to the effect of the stories and to allow the stories to retain their authenticity. The genre of stories is the trickster tale. At the time of Harris&#x27;s publication, his work was praised for its ability to capture plantation Black dialect.

Br&#x27;er Rabbit (&quot;Brother Rabbit&quot;) is the main character of the stories, a character prone to tricks and troublemaking, who is often opposed by Br&#x27;er Fox and Br&#x27;er Bear. In one tale, Br&#x27;er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and puts clothing on it. When Br&#x27;er Rabbit comes along, he addresses the &quot;tar baby&quot; amiably but receives no response. Br&#x27;er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the tar baby&#x27;s lack of manners, punches it and kicks it and becomes stuck.

==Related works==
Harris compiled seven volumes of &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; stories between 1881 and 1907; a further three books were published posthumously, following his death in 1908.

The McClure Newspaper Syndicate released a &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; Sunday strip drawn by J. M. Condé from June 24 to October 7, 1906.

An &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; newspaper Sundays-only strip (King Features Syndicate) ran from October 14, 1945, through December 31, 1972, as an offshoot of the Disney comics strip &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;.

===Films and television===

=== Music ===
&quot;Uncle Remus&quot; is a song by Frank Zappa and George Duke from Zappa&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot;.

Bob Dylan lists several people that are commonly looked to for hope and inspiration in his poem &quot;Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie&quot;, saying &quot;that stuff ain&#x27;t real... And Uncle Remus can&#x27;t tell you and neither can Santa Claus.&quot;

===Influence===
Uncle Remus has been claimed as a major influence on Beatrix Potter.

<doc id="600445" wikidata="Q1914257" url="?curid=600445" title="Maximum segment size">
<text>The maximum segment size (MSS) is a parameter of the &quot;Options&quot; field of the TCP header that specifies the largest amount of data, specified in bytes, that a computer or communications device can receive in a single TCP segment. It does not count the TCP header or the IP header (unlike, for example, the MTU for IP datagrams). The IP datagram containing a TCP segment may be self-contained within a single packet, or it may be reconstructed from several fragmented pieces; either way, the MSS limit applies to the total amount of data contained in the final, reconstructed TCP segment.

To avoid fragmentation in the IP layer, a host must specify the maximum segment size as equal to the largest IP datagram that the host can handle minus the IP and TCP header sizes. Though there is no minimum required MSS defined in IETF RFCs, there is a minimum MTU, and so a default MSS is calculated by subtracting the minimum IP and TCP header sizes from the MTU. For example, IPv4 hosts typically default to an MSS of 536 octets (= 576 − 20 − 20) and IPv6 hosts generally are able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets (= 1280 − 40 − 20).

Small MSS values will reduce or eliminate IP fragmentation but will result in higher overhead.

Each direction of data flow can use a different MSS.

For most computer users, the MSS option is established by the operating system.

TCP options size (Variable 0–320 bits, in units of 32 bits) must be deducted from MSS size if TCP options are enabled. For example, TCP Time Stamps are enabled by default on Linux platforms.

==Default value==
The default TCP Maximum Segment Size is for IPv4 is 536. For IPv6 it is 1220. Where a host wishes to set the maximum segment size to a value other than the default, the maximum segment size is specified as a TCP option, initially in the TCP SYN packet during the TCP handshake. The value cannot be changed after the connection is established.

==Inter-Layer Communication==
In order to notify MSS to the other end, an inter-layer communication is done as follows:
* The Network Driver (ND) or interface should know the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the directly attached network.
* The IP should ask the Network Driver for the Maximum Transmission Unit.
* The TCP should ask the IP for the Maximum Datagram Data Size (MDDS). This is the MTU minus the IP header length (MDDS = MTU − IPHdrLen).
* When opening a connection, TCP can send an MSS option with the value equal to: MDDS − TCPHdrLen. In other words, the MSS value to send is: MSS = MTU − TCPHdrLen − IPHdrLen

While sending TCP segments to the other end, an inter-layer communication is done as follows:
* TCP should determine the Maximum Segment Data Size (MSDS) from either the default or the received value of the MSS option.
* TCP should determine if source fragmentation is possible (by asking the IP) and desirable.
** If so, TCP may hand to IP, segments (including the TCP header) up to MSDS + TCPHdrLen.
** If not, TCP may hand to IP, segments (including the TCP header) up to the lesser of (MSDS + TCPHdrLen) and MDDS.
* IP checks the length of data passed to it by TCP. If the length is less than or equal MDDS, IP attaches the IP header and hands it to the ND. Otherwise, the IP must do source fragmentation.

==MSS and MTU==
MSS is sometimes conflated with MTU/PMTU, which is a characteristic of the underlying link layer, while MSS applies specifically to TCP and hence the transport layer. The two are similar in that they limit the maximum size of the payload carried by their respective protocol data unit (frame for MTU, TCP segment for MSS), and related since MSS cannot exceed the MTU for its underlying link (taking into account the overhead of any headers added by the layers below TCP). However, the difference, in addition to applying to different layers, is that MSS can have a different value in either direction and also that frames exceeding the MTU may cause packets (which encapsulate segments) to be fragmented by the network layer, while segments exceeding the MSS are simply discarded.

<doc id="600451" wikidata="Q635195" url="?curid=600451" title="Polydipsia">
<text>Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives , which is derived . Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds.

==Causes==
===Diabetes===
Polydipsia can be characteristic of diabetes mellitus, often as an initial symptom. It is observed in cases of poorly controlled diabetes, which is sometimes the result of low patient adherence to anti-diabetic medication.

Diabetes insipidus (&quot;tasteless&quot; diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia.

===Other physiological causes===
It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia, decreased blood volume (as occurs during major hemorrhage), and other conditions that create a water deficit. This is usually a result of osmotic diuresis.

Polydipsia is also a symptom of anticholinergic poisoning. Zinc is also known to reduce symptoms of polydipsia by causing the body to absorb fluids more efficiently (reduction of diarrhea, induces constipation) and it causes the body to retain more sodium; thus a zinc deficiency can be a possible cause. The combination of polydipsia and (nocturnal) polyuria is also seen in (primary) hyperaldosteronism (which often goes with hypokalemia).
Antipsychotics can have side effects such as dry mouth that may make the patient feel thirsty.

===Primary polydipsia===
Primary polydipsia describes excessive thirst and water intake caused in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both psychogenic primary polydipsia and non-psychogenic primary polydipsia, such as in patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis with severely elevated globulin levels.

Psychogenic polydipsia is an excessive water intake seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, or with developmental disabilities. It should be taken very seriously, as the amount of water ingested exceeds the amount that can be excreted by the kidneys, and can on rare occasions be life-threatening as the body&#x27;s serum sodium level is diluted to an extent that seizures and cardiac arrest can occur.

While psychogenic polydipsia is generally not found outside the population of serious mental disorders, there is some anecdotal evidence of a milder form (typically called &#x27;habit polydipsia&#x27; or &#x27;habit drinking&#x27;) that can be found in the absence of psychosis or other mental conditions. The excessive levels of fluid intake may result in a false diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, since the chronic ingestion of excessive water can produce diagnostic results that closely mimic those of mild diabetes insipidus. As discussed in the entry on diabetes insipidus, &quot;Habit drinking (in its severest form termed psychogenic polydipsia) is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.&quot; However, prior to a water deprivation test, consideration should be given to a psychiatric consult to see whether it is possible to rule out psychogenic polydipsia or habit polydipsia.

==Diagnosis==
Polydipsia is a symptom (evidence of a disease state), not a disease in itself. It is often accompanied by polyuria (excessive urination) and low sodium levels. Investigations directed at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. Blood serum tests can also provide useful information about the osmolality of the body&#x27;s extracellular fluids. A decrease in osmolality caused by excess water intake will decrease the serum concentration of red blood cells, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and sodium.

<text>Écublens () is a municipality in Switzerland in the canton of Vaud, located in the district of Ouest Lausannois. It is a suburb of Lausanne and is served by the Lausanne metro line 1 and several bus lines. The nearest train station is Renens.

== History ==
A Hallstatt era grave was discovered in Dorigny. Three Bronze Age graves were found in Valeyre and several La Tène culture graves have been found in Bassenges and Valeyre. A motte (a raised earthen, fortified hill) of an unknown age is found at a place in the municipality which is known as &quot;Chateau-de-la-Motte&quot;. A connection between the motte and nearby Roman era artifacts has not been established.

Écublens is first mentioned around 958-59 as &quot;in villa Escublens&quot;. In 964 it was mentioned as &quot;Scubilingis&quot; in a document recording the property of the cathedral of Lausanne. This document mentions that Scubilingis is situated near Renens.

In the 10th century Écublens was part of the territory of Renens. Under Bernese rule it was part of the bailiwick of Lausanne and was administered by that court. In 1156, a chapel was built in Écublens which was under the authority of the Priory of Saint-Sulpice. In 1228 the parish church of St. Peter is first mentioned. By 1453 the parish church was again under the authority of the church of Saint-Sulpice.

On 9 May 1476, Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, gathered his army in Écublens after his defeat at the Battle of Grandson, in preparation for the Battle of Morat. The area was under the Bernese Occupation from 1536 until 1798, when French troops arrived. On 12 May 1800, Napoleon inspected two divisions of his troops in Écublens on his way to the Great St Bernard Pass during his Italian campaign of 1800.

After the Protestant Reformation included the parish of Écublens was created, which included Saint-Sulpice and the village of Chavannes. They remained part of the parish until 1966.

In 1803 it was made the district capital. In 1909 the General Council was replaced by a local council.

During World War II a small aerodrome was operated in Écublens. As part of the nation&#x27;s planning for post-war development of aviation, Lausanne planned to expand this facility into one of five regional airports forming a second-tier of airports in the country. This development would permit the disposal of the nearby Blécherett Aerodrome as that location was deemed to be unfeasible for expansion. This plan was not fulfilled, and the Écublens aerodrome fell into disuse. There was an effort in the 1950s to revive the plan and build an 1100 m runway along with facilities for regional and air taxi operations as the Lausanne-Ecublens Regional Airport (). A two-stage proposal foresaw paving at least one of the smaller grass surface runways as well to support recreational and executive use, but ultimately this plan as well was shelved.

Strong growth in the agricultural industry in the 1960s fueled to a population explosion mostly through immigration. In addition, the municipality grew due to the influx of several large companies: in 1959, Socsil AG, in 1962, Socorex Isba AG, in 1964 Nokia-Maillefer Sapal AG, in 1970, ARL AG (Laboratory), in 1972, Leduc-Thévenaz Sirec AG and in 1979 the administration of Migros Vaud.

<text>Yeni-Kale (; ; ; , also spelled as &quot;Yenikale&quot; and &quot;Eni-Kale&quot; and &quot;Yeni-Kaleh&quot; or &quot;Yéni-Kaleb&quot;) is a fortress on the shore of Kerch Strait in the city of Kerch.

==History==
In the ancient period in this area was the ancient Greek town of Myrmekion and many ancient remains have been found.

Yeni-Kale was built by Ottoman Turks in 1699–1706 on the Kerch peninsula that belonged to the Crimean Khanate. The name &quot;Yenikale&quot; means &quot;New Castle&quot; in Turkish (&quot;yeni&quot; - new, &quot;kale&quot; - castle). The fortress was built under the guidance of Goloppo, who was an Italian convert to Islam. Several French engineers also took part in the construction.

Yeni-Kale was armed with powerful cannons and took an important strategical place on the coast of Kerch Strait. The fortress occupied area of 25,000 m2 and had two powder-magazines, arsenal, water reservoir, living houses, bath-house and mosque. About 800 Turkish and 300 Crimean Tatar soldiers were garrisoned in Yeni-Kale. The weak spot of the fortress was a lack of drinking water in the area, so an underground water-pipe was made to bring water from a source located several kilometres away from the fortress. Yeni-Kale also served as a residence of the pasha.

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 the Russian Army invaded Crimea in the summer of 1771. Though reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire had arrived beforehand, the Turks decided to abandon Yeni-Kale. Russian units under command of general Nikolay Borzov entered the fortress on 21 June 1771. Abaza Muhammad Pasha who was a commandant of Yeni-Kale fled to Sinop and the sultan sentenced him to death for the number of military failures.

After the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, Kerch and the fortress of Yeni-Kale were ceded to Russia. The fortress became a part of the Kerch-Yenikale city municipality of the Taurida Governorate.

In the 19th century the fortress was used by Russians as a military hospital. Since the 1880s Yeni-Kale was completely deserted.

Today ruins of Yeni-Kale are often visited by tourists. The neighboring district of Kerch also is named Yeni-Kale.
