<text>A war cabinet is a committee formed by a government in a time of war to efficiently and effectively conduct that war. It is usually a subset of the full executive cabinet of ministers, although it is quite common for a war cabinet to have senior military officers and opposition politicians as members.

==United Kingdom==
===First World War===

====British war cabinet====
Prior to the First World War, the British had the Committee of Imperial Defence. During World War I, it became a war committee.

During the war, lengthy cabinet discussions came to be seen as a source of vacillation in Britain&#x27;s war effort.

The number of cabinet ministries grew throughout the nineteenth century. Following dissatisfaction at the conduct of the Crimean War, Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli proposed that the number of cabinet members never exceed 10 (he had 12 at the time). However, this didn&#x27;t happen, and the number of ministries continued to grow: 15 in 1859, 21 in 1914, and 23 in 1916. Despite talk of &quot;inner circles&quot; within the Asquith Administration, all committees reported to the 23 cabinet ministers, whose priorities were diverse in nature, and who had final say over war policy formation for the first two years of World War I. This cumbersome arrangement could not stand; a more efficient way of prosecuting the war was needed.

In December 1916 it was proposed that Prime Minister H. H. Asquith should delegate decision-making to a small, three-man committee chaired by the Secretary of State for War, David Lloyd George. Asquith initially agreed (provided the committee reported to him and he retained the right to attend if he chose) before changing his mind after being infuriated by a news story in &quot;The Times&quot; which portrayed the proposed change as a defeat for him. The political crisis grew from this point until Asquith was forced to resign as Prime Minister; he was succeeded by Lloyd George who thereupon formed a small war cabinet. The original members of the war cabinet were:

* David Lloyd George
* George Curzon (Lord President of the Council)
* Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer)
* Arthur Henderson (December 1916 – August 1917)
* Alfred Milner (December 1916 – April 1918)

Lloyd George, Curzon, and Bonar Law served throughout the existence of the war cabinet. Later members included:

* Jan Smuts (June 1917 – January 1919)
* George Barnes (May 1917 – January 1919)
* Edward Carson (July 1917 – January 1918)
* Austen Chamberlain (April 1918 – October 1919)
* Eric Geddes (January – October 1919)

Unlike a normal peacetime cabinet, few of these men had departmental responsibilities – Bonar Law, and then Chamberlain, served as chancellors of the exchequer, but the rest had no specific portfolio. The title of, &quot;minister without portfolio&quot; was important. It allowed total devotion to war duties, without the distraction of civil cabinet responsibilities. Among others, the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, was never a member of the war cabinet, nor were the service ministers Edward Stanley (Army) and Edward Carson (Navy). The latter did join, but only after leaving the Admiralty. Whenever these specialties were needed by the war cabinet, they were summoned. The functioning of the war cabinet is best summed up by Lord Hutchison during a Parliamentary debate held on &quot;14 March 1934&quot;.

Despite its efficiency, on 8 June 1917 at Lord Milner&#x27;s urging, it became necessary to form a War Policy Committee within the war cabinet to coordinate war strategy. Its members included David Lloyd George, Lord Milner, Lord Curzon, Jan Smuts, and Maurice Hankey. Upon his transfer from the war cabinet to the War Office as Secretary of State for War in April 1918, the X Committee was created so Lord Milner could meet with the Prime Minister before war cabinet sessions to continue the talks.

Previously, all cabinet members were paid based upon their cabinet status. With the creation of ministers without portfolio, it was suggested that these positions go unpaid. Indeed, Henry Petty-Lansdowne, a millionaire, while a member without portfolio in Asquith&#x27;s government, received no pay. The debate, which took place in the House of Commons on 13 February 1917, was decided in the new government&#x27;s favour. Appropriations of £5,000 a year (£350,000 in 2020) were made.

The British war cabinet marked the first time minutes were recorded of official meetings. This innovation set the trend for all important corporate and governmental meetings since.

With World War I over, and the two main peace treaties signed with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Lloyd George decided to discontinue the war cabinet. Its last meeting was held on 27 October 1919.

====Imperial War Cabinet====

The origins of an Imperial War Cabinet date back to the beginning of Lloyd George&#x27;s government, and the proper way of responding to peace offerings from Germany. The first mention of a conference in the war cabinet happened on 18 December 1916. In January invitations were sent out, and in the spring of 1917 the Imperial War Cabinet was formed. Goals were also established to strengthen imperial federation by upgrading the status of the Dominions and India to an equal footing with that of Britain when coordinating war strategy. The Imperial War Cabinet met in three sessions: from March to May 1917, from June to August 1918, and from August to December 1918. The last session was improvised. It occurred due to Allied successes on the battlefield and a desire of dominion partners to keep abreast of events. Its original members were:
* Arthur Henderson (British war cabinet)
* Alfred Milner (British war cabinet)
* George Curzon (British war cabinet)
* Bonar Law (British war cabinet and future Prime Minister)
* David Lloyd George (British war cabinet and Prime Minister)
* Robert Borden (Prime Minister of Canada)
* W.F. Massey (Prime Minister of New Zealand)
* Jan Smuts (Minister for Defence, South Africa)
* S.P. Sinha (Representative of Bengal)
* Maharajah of Bikanir (King of (Northern) India)
* James Meston (Assistant to the Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom)
* Austen Chamberlain (Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom)
* Robert Cecil (Minister of Blockade, United Kingdom)
* Walter Long (Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom)
* Joseph Ward (Finance Minister of New Zealand)
* George Perley (Overseas War Minister of Canada)
* Robert Rogers (Minister of Public Works, Canada)
* J.D. Hazen (Minister of the Navy, Canada)
* Leopold Amery (Assistant Secretary from the United Kingdom)
* Admiral John Jellicoe (First Sea Lord, United Kingdom)
* Edward Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty (civilian head of the Royal Navy), United Kingdom)
* Edward Stanley (Secretary of State for War, United Kingdom)
* General Frederick Maurice (Director of Military Operations, United Kingdom)
* Maurice Hankey (Assistant Secretary from the United Kingdom)
* Henry Lambert (Colonial Office, from the United Kingdom)
* Major Lancelot Storr (Assistant Secretary from the United Kingdom)

To strengthen ties between countries, the writing of an imperial constitution was a significant priority in 1917. However, the delegates postponed the matter until after the war, and they failed to take it up.

Minutes to the Imperial War Cabinet meetings are held at the National Archives (Kew).

===Second World War===
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and after to-ing and fro-ing with French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, an ultimatum was presented to the Germans and on its expiry war was declared at 11am on 3 September 1939.

====Chamberlain war ministry====

On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced his war cabinet.

* Prime Minister: Neville Chamberlain (Conservative)
* Lord Privy Seal: Samuel Hoare (Conservative)
* Chancellor of the Exchequer: John Simon (National Liberal)
* Foreign Secretary: Edward Wood (Conservative)
* Secretary of State for War: Leslie Hore-Belisha (National Liberal)
* Secretary of State for Air: Kingsley Wood (Conservative)
* First Lord of the Admiralty: Winston Churchill (Conservative)
* Minister for the Coordination of Defence: Ernle Chatfield (National Government)
* Minister without Portfolio: Maurice Hankey (National Government)

Dominated largely by Conservative ministers who served under Chamberlain&#x27;s National Government between 1937 and 1939, the additions of Lord Hankey (a former Cabinet Secretary from the First World War) and Winston Churchill (strong anti-appeaser) seemed to give the cabinet more balance. Unlike David Lloyd George&#x27;s war cabinet, the members of this one were also heads of government departments.

In January 1940, after disagreements with the Chiefs of Staff, Hore-Belisha resigned from the National Government, refusing a move to the post of President of the Board of Trade. He was succeeded by Oliver Stanley.

It was originally the practice for the Chiefs of Staff to attend all military discussions of the Chamberlain war cabinet. Churchill became uneasy with this, as he felt that when they attended they did not confine their comments to purely military issues. To overcome this, a Military Co-ordination Committee was set up, consisting of the three service ministers normally chaired by Chatfield. This together with the service chiefs would co-ordinate the strategic ideas of &#x27;top hats&#x27; and &#x27;brass&#x27; and agree strategic proposals to put forward to the war cabinet. Unfortunately, except when chaired by the Prime Minister, the Military Co-ordinating Committee lacked sufficient authority to override a Minister &quot;fighting his corner&quot;. When Churchill took over from Chatfield, whilst continuing to represent the Admiralty, this introduced additional problems, and did little to improve the pre-existing ones. Chamberlain announced a further change in arrangements in the Norway Debate, but this (and the Military Co-ordination Committee) was overtaken by events, the Churchill war cabinet being run on rather different principles.

====Churchill war ministry====

When he became Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill formed a war cabinet, initially consisting of the following members:

* Prime Minister &amp; Minister of Defence: Winston Churchill (Conservative)
* Lord President of the Council: Neville Chamberlain (Conservative)
* Lord Privy Seal: Clement Attlee (Labour)
* Foreign Secretary: Edward Wood (Conservative)
* Minister without Portfolio: Arthur Greenwood (Labour)

Churchill strongly believed that the war cabinet should be kept to a relatively small number of individuals to allow efficient execution of the war effort. Even so, there were a number of ministers who, though they were not members of the war cabinet, were &quot;Constant Attenders&quot;. As the war cabinet considered issues that pertained to a given branch of the service or government due input was obtained from the respective body.

The War Cabinet would undergo a number of changes in composition over the next five years. On 19 February 1942 a reconstructed war cabinet was announced by Churchill consisting of the following members:

* Prime Minister and Minister of Defence: Winston Churchill (Conservative)
* Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs: Clement Attlee (Labour)
* Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons: Stafford Cripps (Labour)
* Lord President of the Council: John Anderson (National)
* Foreign Secretary: Anthony Eden (Conservative)
* Minister of Production: Oliver Lyttelton (Conservative)
* Minister of Labour: Ernest Bevin (Labour)

This war cabinet was consistent with Churchill&#x27;s view that members should also hold &quot;responsible offices and not mere advisors at large with nothing to do but think and talk and take decisions by compromise or majority&quot; The war cabinet often met within the Cabinet War Rooms, particularly during The Blitz of London.

===Falklands War===
* Prime Minister – Margaret Thatcher
* Deputy Prime Minister &amp; Home Secretary – Willie Whitelaw
* Secretary of State for Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Affairs – Francis Pym
* Secretary of State for Defence – John Nott
* Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster – Cecil Parkinson
* Chief of the Defence Staff – Admiral Terence Lewin
* Attorney General – Michael Havers

Thatcher chose not to include any representation of Her Majesty&#x27;s Treasury on the advice of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan (who had been British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean theatre for the second half of World War II), that the security and defence of the armed forces and the war effort should not be compromised for financial reasons.

===Persian Gulf War===
* Prime Minister – John Major
* Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs – Douglas Hurd
* Secretary of State for Defence – Tom King
* Chancellor of the Exchequer – Norman Lamont
* Chief of the Defence Staff – Marshal of the RAF David Craig

===Invasion of Afghanistan===
* Prime Minister – Tony Blair
* Deputy Prime Minister – John Prescott
* Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs – Jack Straw
* Secretary of State for Home Affairs – David Blunkett

* Secretary of State for International Development – Clare Short
* Chief of the Defence Staff – Admiral Michael Boyce
* Downing Street Director of Communications – Alastair Campbell
* Leader of the House of Commons – Robin Cook

===Iraq War===

* Leader of the House of Commons – John Reid
* Director of MI5 – Eliza Manningham-Buller
* Director of MI6 – Richard Dearlove

==Australia==

At the Imperial Conference in London in 1937, the Australian government had agreed to form a war cabinet on the outbreak of war. The full cabinet approved the formation of the war cabinet on 26 September 1939. As neither Earle Page&#x27;s Country Party nor John Curtin&#x27;s Australian Labor Party would join in a coalition government with Menzies&#x27; United Australia Party, the war cabinet initially consisted of:
* Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Treasurer)
* Richard Casey (Minister for Supply)
* Geoffrey Street (Minister for Defence)
* George McLeay (Minister for Commerce)
* Henry Gullett (Minister for Information)
* Billy Hughes (Attorney-General)
In November 1939, the Department of Defence was split up. Street became Minister for the Army, Menzies also became Minister for Defence Coordination, and three more ministers joined the war cabinet:
* James Fairbairn (Minister for Air)
* Frederick Stewart (Minister for the Navy)
* Harry Foll (Minister for Interior)

Following the deaths of Fairbairn and Gullett in the Canberra air disaster and the loss of seats in the 1940 Australian federal election the war cabinet of October 1940 consisted of:
* Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination)
* Arthur Fadden (Treasurer)
* John McEwen (Minister for Air)
* Percy Spender (Minister for the Army)
* Billy Hughes (Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy)
* Harry Foll (Minister for Interior)
* Philip McBride (Minister for Munitions) (from 26 June 1941)

The government was replaced by a Labor one on 3 October 1941. A new war cabinet was formed, consisting of:
* John Curtin (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination)
* Frank Forde (Minister for the Army)
* Ben Chifley (Treasurer)
* H. V. Evatt (Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs)
* Jack Beasley (Minister for Supply)
* Norman Makin (Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions)
* Arthur Drakeford (Minister for Air)
* John Dedman (Minister for the Interior) (from 11 December 1941)

Frederick Shedden, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Defence, served as secretary of the war cabinet, which met regularly throughout the war. It held its last meeting in Canberra on 19 January 1946.

While the Australian war cabinets included only members of the governing party, the Advisory War Council which was established in October 1940 included members of the opposition as well. This body did not have executive powers, but from the formation of the Labor Government in October 1941 it was agreed that its decisions would be treated as war cabinet decisions, with only some issues being formally referred to the war cabinet for separate decision. As a result, the Advisory War Council had significant influence on Australia&#x27;s war effort.

==United States==
In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush created a war cabinet. They met at Camp David on the weekend of 15 September to shape what became the War on Terrorism. The membership was mostly, but not entirely, identical to that of the U.S. National Security Council.

The cabinet comprised:
* President – George W. Bush
* Vice President – Dick Cheney
* Defense Secretary – Donald Rumsfeld
* National Security Advisor – Condoleezza Rice
* Secretary of State – Colin Powell
* Director of Central Intelligence – George Tenet
* Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – Hugh Shelton
* Attorney General – John Ashcroft
* Secretary of the Treasury – Paul O&#x27;Neill
* Counselor to the President – Karen Hughes
* White House Press Secretary – Ari Fleischer
* Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation – Robert Mueller
* Deputy Defense Secretary – Paul Wolfowitz
* White House Chief of Staff – Andrew Card

==Israel==
On October 11, 2023, four days after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the formation of a war cabinet with the following composition.

3 full members:
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
* Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant
* Minister without portfolio and former Chief of the General Staff Benny Gantz
and 2 observers:
* Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer
* Minister without portfolio and former Chief of the General Staff Gadi Eisenkot

Netanyahu disbanded the war cabinet on June 17, 2024, eight days after Gantz and Eisenkot resigned from the government and the war cabinet.

<text>Otto Maria Carpeaux (March 9, 1900 – February 3, 1978), born Otto Karpfen, was an Austrian-born Brazilian literary critic and multilingual scholar.

==Career overview==
Carpeaux was born Otto Karpfen in 1900 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a Jewish family, and lived there until 1939. At the age of 20, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study Law. In 1925, he received a PhD in letters and philosophy and began working as a journalist. Later, he also studied exact sciences and mathematics in Leipzig, sociology and philosophy in Paris, comparative literature in Naples, and politics in Berlin. At some point in his life, Karpfen converted to Roman Catholicism, adding &quot;Maria&quot; to his name and using &quot;Fidelis&quot; as his surname for some time. This conversion was evident in his political books (such as &quot;Wege Nach Rom&quot;) and his thinking, and led to his participation in the right-wing government of Engelbert Dollfuss.

When the Anschluss occurred and the Nazis took over Vienna, Carpeaux fled to Belgium. He stayed there for about a year and, at the break of the Second World War, he went to Brazil. Carpeaux did not speak Portuguese at first, and he mastered the language on his own, eventually also frenchifying his lastname to &quot;Carpeaux&quot;, considering that it would seem more prestigious among Brazilian intellectuals. At first, he was given a simple rural job, but he gradually established himself as a literary critic. His first published article was on Franz Kafka, on the newspaper &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;, something he did out of desperation when living under severe conditions. He was to introduce writers such as Robert Musil and Kafka to Brazilian audiences, along with the literary criticism of Wilhelm Dilthey, Benedetto Croce, Walter Benjamin and others.

His first book in Portuguese came in 1942, &quot;A Cinza do Purgatório&quot;. Two years later, he became director of Fundação Getúlio Vargas library. He also published essays on philosophers and sociologists such as Friedrich Engels and Max Weber, as well as on Brazilian writers he came to discover when in the country, writing on Carlos Drummond de Andrade e Graciliano Ramos.

Perhaps the peak of Carpeaux&#x27;s production was his eight-volume &quot;História da Literatura Ocidental&quot; (&quot;History of Western Literature&quot;), available only in Portuguese, in spite of being in public domain. Carpeaux took eight years to write his masterwork, from 1941 to 1947. Late critic José Lino Grünewald labelled it one of the brightest moments of the language in prose, despite the fact that Carpeaux was not a native speaker. It is also unique in that it focuses on creating links between all periods, in order to create an organic vision of the literary history he is telling. The book also include more than 8,000 brief criticisms and expositions of the majority of the figures discussed along the way, minus the ones cited in passing; all are dealt with in their original languages, both in expositions and quotations and in the bibliography offered. The total bibliographical amount of cited works is on the merge of 30,000 books or more.

In this series, Carpeaux begins with an analysis of classical Greek and Latin literatures and proceeds until the twentieth century avant-garde movements such as surrealism and dadaism, encompassing every major literary establishments in between. For this reason, it has been called &quot;definitive, encyclopaedic and multidisciplinary, a fundamental work in Brazilian literary and cultural bibliography&quot;. To Antonio Candido, Carpeaux&#x27;s &quot;universal vision allows him to surmount the eventual limitations of critic nacionalism, whose historic function is important in certain moments, but which must not serve to obliterate the true dimension of the literary phenomena, which, through its own nature, is transcendental as well as national. Carpeaux demonstrates in other moments how Brazilian literature benefits from being seen in a double perspective, such as his, capable of increasing insight and break routine.&quot;
Never abandoning his abomination to militarism and tyranny, Carpeaux opposed to the Brazilian Military Regime and abandoned his literary writings by 1968, in order to participate more actively on political debate. However, he did participate in the composition of an encyclopedia called &quot;Mirador&quot;. He maintained his convictions as a right-wing thinker, and died of a heart attack in 1978.

Recently, his essays have been compiled by Brazilian philosopher and journalist Olavo de Carvalho, with an added introduction. Critic Mauro Souza Ventura released &quot;De Karpfen a Carpeaux&quot;, a study in the life and work of Carpeaux. Carpeaux&#x27;s other works include a dense history of German literature, several books of literary criticism, a popular history of Western music and various political writings.

<text>George Stacey Davis (August 23, 1870 – October 17, 1940) was an American professional baseball shortstop and manager in Major League Baseball at the turn of the 20th century. Davis also spent multiple seasons as a third baseman and center fielder, and lesser amounts of time at other positions. He broke into the major leagues in 1890 and played through 1909. He is ranked among the top 100 players of all time in several statistical categories. Davis was a switch hitter.

After his playing career, Davis managed the Amherst College baseball team for several years. He died in a mental institution, suffering the effects of syphilis. Not much was known about Davis&#x27;s life or career until the 1990s, when he gained some recognition from the city historian of his hometown of Cohoes, New York. He was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1998.

==Early life==
Born on August 23, 1870, in Cohoes, New York, Davis was one of seven children born to Abram and Sarah Davis. His father had immigrated from Wales and his mother came from England. Davis was playing amateur baseball in Albany when he was 16 years old and he could bat from both sides of the plate.

By 1889, Davis was on a team of semiprofessional and amateur players near the Hudson River in Albany. The squad was managed by Tom York, a former major league player. York recommended Davis for major league service with the Cleveland Spiders. The team signed Davis for the 1890 season.

==Early playing career==
Davis patrolled center field for the first two seasons of his career, leading the National League (NL) in outfield assists with 35 in 1890. He made three brief appearances as a pitcher in 1891, giving up seven earned runs in four innings and recording one save. That year he was among the league&#x27;s top ten players in hits, doubles, triples, total bases, runs batted in (RBI), plate appearances and assists as an outfielder.

Davis never appeared as a pitcher again, but his strong arm did lead the team to move him to third base in 1892, a position he played for the next five seasons. His batting average dropped almost 50 points to .241 in 1892, but he recorded 82 RBI and 36 stolen bases.

==New York Giants==
The Spiders traded Davis to the New York Giants for aging star Buck Ewing shortly before the 1893 season, and Davis blossomed in New York City. With league rules moving the pitcher&#x27;s mound back to 60 feet, 6 inches that season, offensive totals jumped across the league, and Davis was at the forefront of the surge. He compiled a .355 batting average and set career highs with 27 triples and 11 home runs. He also collected 22 doubles and 37 stolen bases, while scoring 112 runs and driving in 119. He became the first player to hit a triple and a home run in the same inning.
Davis continued to perform at an elite level throughout the 1890s, regularly ranking among the league leaders in doubles, triples, RBI, and stolen bases. He had a batting average of more than .300 for nine consecutive seasons beginning in 1893. He began playing more shortstop in 1896 and moved to the position full-time the next season. In 1897, Davis hit .353 and registered a league-best 135 RBI. He led the league in double plays and fielding percentage four times each.

During his playing career, Davis enjoyed a reputation as an intelligent and hard-working player who did not participate in dirty play. On their way to practice at the Polo Grounds on April 26, 1900, Davis and teammates Kid Gleason and Mike Grady stumbled upon a raging tenement fire. The players rushed into the building and rescued two women and a three-year-old child. The fire left 45 families homeless. Davis said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do much. I just went up the ladder the same as the rest of the boys and helped to carry down women and children... I didn&#x27;t do half as much as Grady and Gleason.&quot; His face blistered from the heat, Davis helped his team earn a 10–10 tie with the Boston Beaneaters that evening.

==Later career==
The formation of the American League provided new financial opportunities to ballplayers, and induced by a $4,000 salary, Davis jumped to the Chicago White Sox in 1902. He became the first switch hitter to achieve 2,000 hits during the season. He attempted a return to the Giants the following season for a further raise to $6,700 (the second-highest figure in the league, after that of Nap Lajoie), but was prevented by the implementation of a peace agreement between the warring leagues.

Davis sat out the bulk of the season before returning to the White Sox, with whom he spent the remainder of his career. His raw offensive statistics from this time pale before those of his earlier career, but when properly compared to a drastic league-wide decline in offense, they remain impressive. Davis stole home in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series for the champion White Sox. He also had three runs batted in for the Sox in the title-clinching Game 6 against the crosstown Chicago Cubs. His productivity declined in , as he batted .238, his lowest batting average since 1892. He batted worse the following year, batting .217 in 128 games played. In , he played just 28 games while batting .132 before he played his final game on August 15.

His career totals in several statistical categories rank in the top 100 players all-time, including games played, at bats, hits, runs, doubles, triples, RBI and stolen bases.

==Later life==
Davis returned to the minor leagues for one season as player-manager of the 1910 Des Moines Boosters. He managed a bowling alley in the early 1910s. He was the Amherst College baseball coach from 1913 to 1918, then he became a car salesman.

The circumstances of his death remained a mystery until baseball historian Lee Allen discovered its details through a campaign to track down historical baseball players, run in part in &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. Davis was admitted to a Philadelphia mental institution in 1934 suffering from paresis due to tertiary syphilis. He died in the institution in 1940. Davis was survived by his wife Jane, who was said to have been angry at him when he died. His wife spent $41 to have him buried within a day at nearby Fernwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In a 1995 book, baseball author Bill James referred to Davis as baseball&#x27;s best player who had not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Also in 1995, Davis was featured in David Pietrusza&#x27;s television film &quot;Local Heroes&quot; in the segment &quot;Knocking on Cooperstown&#x27;s Door.&quot;

In 1997, baseball researcher Frederick Ivor-Campbell said that Davis was &quot;the most neglected player of the 19th century. He&#x27;s definitely the best eligible player not in the Hall, and he&#x27;s a lot better than a lot of guys already in.&quot; Around the same time, Davis was rated the 21st best baseball player of all time in the official baseball encyclopedia, &quot;Total Baseball&quot;.

Davis was up for a vote before the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee in 1998. Before the committee voted, sportswriter Dave Anderson wrote an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on Davis&#x27;s Hall of Fame candidacy. He pointed out the work of Cohoes city historian Walt Lipka, which favorably compared Davis to almost all of the shortstops in the Hall of Fame. Anderson supported Davis&#x27;s election, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s as if he were discarded nearly a century ago into a time capsule that was forgotten until now... For too long, George Stacey Davis has been his era&#x27;s most forgotten best player.&quot; He was selected for induction that year.

Prior to his Hall of Fame induction, a Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) chapter in New York put out a call to locate a descendant of Davis to be present at the induction ceremony and announced plans for a historical marker in Cohoes. As a great deal of time had passed since his death, no relatives could be located, but a group of about 50 people from Cohoes traveled to the ceremony in support of Davis.

<doc id="594815" wikidata="Q570481" url="?curid=594815" title="What Lies Beneath">
<text>What Lies Beneath is a 2000 American supernatural thriller film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Clark Gregg, who co-wrote the story with Sarah Kernochan. The film stars Harrison Ford as a university professor and Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife, who is unsure if their home is haunted by a ghost or if she is losing her mind. The film also features Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, James Remar and Miranda Otto in supporting roles.

The first film by Zemeckis&#x27; production company ImageMovers, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; was theatrically released in North America by DreamWorks Pictures and internationally by 20th Century Fox on July 21, 2000. While it received mixed reviews from critics who praised Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance and criticized Gregg&#x27;s script, the film was a box office success, grossing US$291 million worldwide and becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of the year.

&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film at the 27th Saturn Awards, in addition to nominations for Best Director (for Zemeckis) and Best Actress (for Pfeiffer). At the 7th Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, Ford and Pfeiffer won Favorite Actor – Suspense and Favorite Actress – Suspense, respectively, and Scarwid was nominated for Favorite Supporting Actress – Suspense.

==Plot==
Claire Spencer and her husband Norman, an accomplished scientist and professor, live a quiet life at their lakeside home in Vermont. The Spencers&#x27; relationship is strained, especially after Caitlin, Claire&#x27;s daughter and Norman&#x27;s stepdaughter, leaves for college. Claire notices that their new neighbors, Mary and Warren Feur, have a volatile relationship. After Mary is unseen for several days, Claire suspects Warren may have killed her. Claire believes she sees a woman&#x27;s body in the lake and senses a presence in the house. A framed article about Norman falls off his desk and shatters, leading Claire to discover an odd key. She finds the bathtub mysteriously filled and sees another woman&#x27;s reflection in the water.

Claire and her friend Jody hold a séance. She finds the bathtub filled again, sees a message stating &quot;you know&quot; on the foggy bathroom mirror, and her computer inexplicably types the initials &quot;MEF&quot;. Convinced Mary&#x27;s ghost is haunting her, Claire publicly confronts Warren, only for Mary to appear next to him. She later learns that Mary went to her mother&#x27;s house after the couple had a fight. On the back of Norman&#x27;s article, Claire finds a story about a missing woman named Madison Elizabeth Frank. She visits Madison&#x27;s mother and steals a lock of Madison&#x27;s hair, as well as noticing a photo of Madison wearing an unusual necklace.

Following a ritual from a book, Claire attempts to conjure Madison. Seemingly possessed by her spirit, Claire aggressively seduces Norman, shocking him by speaking as Madison until she drops the lock of hair, which ends the possession. Claire recalls a repressed memory about Norman&#x27;s affair with a student named Madison, which happened during a rough patch in their marriage. Claire leaves to spend the night with Jody, who reveals that she saw Norman arguing with a woman at a café in the nearby town of Adamant a year earlier. Returning home, Claire finds Norman unconscious in the bathtub, along with a hairdryer, which he assures her was an accident. He says an unstable Madison confronted him at home when he ended their affair, but denies killing her. Standing on the lakeside dock with Madison&#x27;s hair, Claire is pulled into the water by an unseen force; while underwater, she sees a jewelry box matching Madison&#x27;s necklace in the photo. Norman pulls Claire to safety and they burn the lock of hair.

Claire&#x27;s suspicions return when Norman claims not to know the café in Adamant, where she sees the same necklace and jewelry box at a nearby shop. Recovering the box from the lake and unlocking it with the key from Norman&#x27;s office, she finds Madison&#x27;s necklace inside. She confronts Norman, who says that he came home to find Madison had killed herself; in desperation, he pushed her car into the lake with her body inside. Norman agrees to confess and call the police, but instead distracts and paralyzes Claire with halothane.

Norman admits to murdering Madison when she threatened to expose their affair to the dean. He places Claire in the bathtub, filling it with water to stage her suicide. As he removes Madison&#x27;s necklace from Claire, her face contorts into that of Madison&#x27;s corpse. A startled Norman hits his head on the sink and knocks himself out. As the drug wears off, Claire barely escapes drowning. She flees in Norman&#x27;s truck, but he climbs on it and attacks her. The truck crashes into the lake, dislodging Madison&#x27;s body from the sunken car. As Norman tries to drown Claire, Madison grabs him. Claire escapes as Norman drowns and Madison&#x27;s ghost drifts away. Later that winter, Claire places a rose on Madison&#x27;s grave.

==Production==
Documentary filmmaker Sarah Kernochan had adapted a personal experience with the paranormal as a script treatment featuring a retirement aged couple dealing with restless but compassionate spirits. DreamWorks commissioned a rewrite from actor-writer Clark Gregg. This script was delivered in 1998 by Steven Spielberg to his director friend Robert Zemeckis, who had signed a deal for DreamWorks to distribute the films of newly founded production company ImageMovers, and announced interest in doing a thriller film. Harrison Ford then signed on to star in the film, even agreeing to clear room in his schedule for the project. Michelle Pfeiffer then followed as DreamWorks started to negotiate with 20th Century Fox regarding the film&#x27;s distribution. Ford and Pfeiffer were Zemeckis&#x27; first and only choices for the lead roles. Fox agreed to distribute both &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; and Zemeckis&#x27; other project &quot;Cast Away&quot;, with the thriller having DreamWorks doing the domestic distribution and Fox the international one.

&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; was filmed while production of &quot;Cast Away&quot; took a hiatus to allow Tom Hanks to lose weight and grow a beard. As Gregg had to remain with production for rewrites, he had to decline an offer to read for a major role in &quot;Sports Night&quot;; Aaron Sorkin later created a minor role in the final episodes of the series for Gregg.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; opened in 2,813 theaters in North America and grossed $29,702,959 for an average of $10,559 per theater. It reached the number one spot at the box office upon opening, beating &quot;X-Men&quot;. The film ended up earning $155,464,351 domestically and $135,956,000 internationally for a total of $291,420,351 worldwide, close to triple its production budget of $100 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; holds an approval rating of 47% based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Robert Zemeckis is unable to salvage an uncompelling and unoriginal film.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;at the start, [Zemeckis] zaps us with quick, glib scares, just to show he still knows how, but his heart isn&#x27;t in this kind of material anymore. His reflexes are a little slow.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;spooky with a polished kind of creepiness added in... &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; nevertheless feels more planned than passionate, scary at points but unconvincing overall.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; thought that &quot;after a slow build that at times makes every hair stand on endZemeckis rolls out every thriller cliché there is. A pity, because until then it&#x27;s a smart, realistically staged, adult-oriented and extraordinarily effective domestic chiller.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; wrote &quot;The biggest surprise is, perhaps, that what emerges is no masterpiece, but a semi-sophisticated shocker, playfully homaging Hitchcock like a mechanical masterclass in doing &#x27;genre&#x27;. The first hour is great fun... It&#x27;s an enjoyably giddy ride, certainly, but once you&#x27;re back from the edge of your seat, you realise most of the creaks and groans are from the decomposing script.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. He praised Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance, calling her &quot;convincing and sympathetic&quot;, but commented, &quot;Lacking a smarter screenplay, it milks the genuine skills of its actors and director for more than it deserves, and then runs off the rails in an ending more laughable than scary. Along the way, yes, there are some good moments.&quot; He also stated that he felt the problem with Zemeckis&#x27; desire to direct a Hitchcockian film (&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; contains several musical, visual and plot references to &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;, among other Hitchcock films) was Zemeckis&#x27; decision to involve the supernatural, a device Ebert felt Alfred Hitchcock never would have done.

===Accolades===
==Remake==
The film was unofficially remade in India as &quot;Raaz&quot; and released in 2002.

<doc id="594817" wikidata="Q1052634" url="?curid=594817" title="All-American Girls Professional Baseball League">
<text>The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was a professional women&#x27;s baseball league founded by Philip K. Wrigley, which existed from 1943 to 1954. The AAGPBL is the forerunner of women&#x27;s professional league sports in the United States. Over 600 women played in the league, which eventually consisted of 10 teams located in the American Midwest. In 1948, league attendance peaked at over 900,000 spectators. The most successful team, the Rockford Peaches, won a league-best four championships.

The 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and the 2022 show of the same name are mostly fictionalized accounts of the league and its stars. Sixty-five original AAGPBL members appeared in scenes for the movie filmed in October 1991 recreating the induction of the league into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.

==History==
===Founding===

Although the AAGPBL was the first recorded professional women&#x27;s baseball league, women had played baseball since the nineteenth century. The first known women&#x27;s baseball team played at Vassar College in 1866, while there were several barnstorming Bloomer Girls teams (sometimes including men).

With the entry of the United States into World War II, several major league baseball executives started a new professional league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye while the majority of able men were away. The founders included Philip K. Wrigley, Branch Rickey and Paul V. Harper. They feared that Major League Baseball might even temporarily cease due to the war because of the loss of talent, as well as restrictions on team travel due to gasoline rationing.

The women&#x27;s initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Scouted from amateur softball games across the country, over 200 women were invited to try out, and about 60 were selected for the league roster. Like the male major league, the &#x27;girls&#x27; league was also informally segregated; thus, no African Americans were recruited or hired. Women were selected for their skilled play, but the player also needed to fit what was seen by marketers as a wholesome, feminine ideal. The first league game was played on May 30, 1943.

Scouts for the Chicago-based All-American Girls Professional Baseball League initially sought and recruited talent from the Chicago softball Metropolitan League, along with several others. However, after seeing many of their players leave for the AAGPBL, it was decided to then turn the amateur Metropolitan League to a professional league. The result was the creation of the six-team National Girls Baseball League, which began in 1944, composed entirely of Chicago-area teams. The National Girls baseball League was founded by Emery Parichy, Charles Bidwill (owner of the Chicago Cardinals football team) and politician Ed Kolski. Pirachy operated the Metropolitan League. Football star Red Grange was hired to preside over the league. As a local league with a limited geographical reach, the NGBL was much less publicized than the AAGPBL, but it paralleled the AAGPBL, as it also lasted until 1954 and drew up to 500,000 fans per season. For a time, the two leagues were involved in a strong rivalry for players, before meeting and agreeing to a poaching truce in 1946. Many players and several managers appeared in both leagues.

In the winter of 1952–1953, players from both the AAGPBL and National Girls Baseball League played together in the four–team International Girls Baseball League based in Miami, Florida.

===Ownership and management===

The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League went through three periods of ownership. It was owned by chewing gum mogul Wrigley from 1943 to 1945, wealthy publicist Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951, and the teams were individually owned from 1951 to 1954. The teams generally played in Midwestern cities. The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the full period of the AAGPBL&#x27;s existence.

Baseball Hall of Fame members Max Carey and Jimmie Foxx managed teams in the AAGPBL. The character of Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, was loosely based on Foxx&#x27;s tenure in the league. However, several of his former AAGPBL players said that, unlike Hanks&#x27;s character in the movie, Foxx was always gentlemanly around them.
===Play===
In the first season, the league played a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball. The ball was 12 inches in circumference, the size of a regulation softball (regulation baseballs are 9 to 9 inches). The pitcher&#x27;s mound was only forty feet from home plate, closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the baseball distance of 60 feet, 6 inches. Pitchers threw underhand windmill, like in softball, and the distance between bases was 65 feet, five feet longer than in softball, but 25 feet shorter than in baseball. Major similarities between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use of a pitcher&#x27;s mound (softball pitchers throw from flat ground). By 1948, the ball had shrunk to 10 inches, overhand pitching was allowed, and the mound was moved back to 50 feet. Over the history of the league, the rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball. By the final season in 1954, the ball was regulation baseball size, the mound was moved back to 60 feet, and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet (still five feet shorter than in regulation baseball). Teams were generally managed by men who knew competitive athletics and were former major league players, in part to demonstrate to fans that the league was serious.

Salaries were above average for women and ranged from $45–$85 (or $–$ in dollars) a week during the first years of play to about $125 (or $ in dollars) per week in later years. The women&#x27;s league generally went along with the men&#x27;s late spring to early autumn season.
The uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted, short-sleeved tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt. Rules stated that skirts were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee, but the regulation was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding. A circular team logo was sewn on the front of each dress, and baseball caps featured elastic bands in the back so that they were one-size-fits-all.

During spring training, the girls were required to attend evening classes at Helena Rubinstein&#x27;s charm school. The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms and dress code was presented to all of the players. In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible, each received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it. As a part of the league&#x27;s &#x27;Rules of Conduct&#x27;, the &#x27;girls&#x27; were not permitted to have short hair, could not smoke or drink in public places, were not allowed to wear pants, and were required to wear lipstick at all times. Fines for not following the league&#x27;s rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense, ten for the second, and suspension for the third. In 1944, Josephine &quot;JoJo&quot; D&#x27;Angelo was fired for cutting her hair short. The women&#x27;s contracts were much stricter about behavior than in the men&#x27;s league, and each team was also assigned its own chaperone by the league.

===Publicity===
The AAGPBL received extensive publicity from its inception throughout the 1940s. The league was featured in national periodicals such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and American Magazine&quot;,&quot; as well as in local city newspapers. Philip Wrigley, the league&#x27;s founder, believed in the value of advertising, which may have contributed to the league&#x27;s extensive exposure and marketing focus. Wrigley learned to appreciate advertising from his father, William Wrigley, who had success with his chewing-gum company in large part due to marketing methods. The league remained under Wrigley&#x27;s advertising influence until 1951, when individual team directors took over the publicity.

The league&#x27;s principal advertising agent was Arthur E. Meyerhoff, who handled the league&#x27;s publicity from 1943 through 1950. Meyerhoff&#x27;s promotional efforts focused on the value of national exposure in popular periodicals. These magazine articles attracted new fans and new players to the AAGPBL. The major publicity themes that characterized the league were &quot;Recreation for War Workers&quot;, &quot;Femininity&quot;, &quot;Community Welfare&quot;, and &quot;Family Entertainment&quot;.

The league shifted to decentralized league administration from 1951 to 1954. Thus, the responsibility was on individual team management to publicize and promote the teams. However, local managers were not always effective due to their lack of expertise in advertising. In the 1951 season, league president Fred Leo asked all team presidents to provide publicity on games and training events. Only one team complied with Fred Leo&#x27;s request, which led to an early 1952 preseason board meeting to discuss inadequate promotion.

Due to the decentralized league administration, many of the promotion efforts from team management were aimed exclusively at local populaces. There were many promotional events with players, children&#x27;s benefits, civic groups and holiday celebrations. Along with daily newspaper reports, the primary advertising strategy was radio broadcasts.

The AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans. The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four (1945, 1948, 1949 and 1950). The Milwaukee/Grand Rapids Chicks were second with three (1944 in Milwaukee and 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids). The Racine Belles (1943 and 1946) and the South Bend Blue Sox (1951 and 1952) each won two, and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league&#x27;s final season (1954).

=== Closure===
Once WWII ended, men returned to the workforce, which meant men&#x27;s sport became more prioritized rather than women&#x27;s sports. As attendance and revenues began to fall in the early 1950s, the league became less alluring to players, and some even returned to playing softball. Teams rapidly began to close down operations each year until, at the end of the 1954 season, only five teams remained, and the AAGPBL officially shut down and closed in 1954. During the AAGPBL&#x27;s twelve-year operations, over 500 women were able to play baseball in a professional setting.

==Rules of play==
Since the only organized ball for women in the United States was softball, the league officials created a hybrid game which included features of both fast-pitch softball and baseball. Compared to softball, the crucial differences were that nine (not ten) players were used, and runners could lead off, slide and steal bases.

In its twelve years of history the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League evolved through many stages. These differences varied from the beginning of the league, progressively extending the length of the base paths and pitching distance, while decreasing the size of the ball until the final year of play in 1954.

For the first five years the circuit used a fastpitch underhand motion, shifted to sidearm in the 1947 season, and overhand pitching began in 1948.

==Uniforms==
The uniform was a one-piece short-skirted flared tunic with a team patch in the center of the chest. The base uniform was designed by Wrigley Company art director Otis Shepard, assisted by Wrigley&#x27;s wife Helen and Chicago softball player Ann Harnett, the first player signed by the league. Shepard was also the longtime art director for the Chicago Cubs and spearheaded a series of innovative uniforms beginning in 1937. Shepard designed all visual elements of the league, including game scorecards and promotional materials. For his work on the AAGPBL and the Cubs, Shepard was called the &quot;chief visualizer of mid-century baseball&quot;.

Shepard modeled the uniform after the figure skating, field hockey and tennis outfits of the period. The uniforms included satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks and a baseball cap. The team patches were modeled after each respective city&#x27;s seal. The uniform was meant to display the player&#x27;s feminine image; all masculine clothing was not allowed, both on the field and in public.

In the beginning, each team was issued one uniform style, to be worn in all games. Shepard unveiled the inaugural uniforms in a palette of pastel colors: green for Kenosha; yellow for Racine; blue for South Bend; and peach for Rockford. The accessories (cap, belt and stirrups) were bold, darker shades of the team color. As new teams were added, they were given a new distinctive team color (gray for Milwaukee, pink for Minneapolis). Road uniforms were introduced to the league starting with the 1948 season.

==Branding==
The league went through a series of name changes during its history. It was founded as the All-American Girls Softball League, but, midway through its first season of 1943, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). After the 1943 season, the official League name was again changed, to the All-American Girls Professional Ball League (AAGPBL), reflecting that players were paid from the start and further separating it from existing amateur leagues. This name was used until the end of the 1945 season, when the league reverted to All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL), which it would use through 1950. When teams were sold to independent owners at the end of the 1950 season, the official League name was changed to the American Girls Baseball League (AGBL), although it continued to be popularly identified as the All-American League or the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). When the Players&#x27; Association was organized in 1986 and gained recognition from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988, it was again, and finally, named &quot;All-American Girls Professional Baseball League&quot; (AAGPBL).

The theme song made famous in the 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; was the official song of the All-American Girls Baseball League, co-written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird (although in the movie, the word &quot;Irishmen&quot; was changed to &quot;Irish ones&quot;). In their annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing the song.

==League champions==
The League had twelve champions in its time of play. For the 1943 and 1944 seasons, the playoffs were a matchup of the first half champion and the second half champion. The seasons of 1945-1947 matched four teams for its postseason. For 1948 only, four teams each from the Eastern and Western Division made the postseason. The 1949 season utilized a system where six teams reached the postseason, with the 1 and 3 seeds having a first-round bye (the 2 seed played the 1 seed). The 1950 season had four teams reach the postseason. The 1951 season returned to the half system, but with a caveat that the top two teams of the first and second half went to the playoffs. For the final three seasons (1952-1954), they had the top four teams reach the playoffs.
==Legacy==
===Media===
The 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, although fictionalized, covers the founding and play of this league. Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Madonna and Tom Hanks were the stars of the film, which was directed by Penny Marshall. A six-episode television series with the same name aired in 1993. In 2022, a second spin-off television series of the same name was released. The 2022 series shares a number of similarities to the film, but showrunner Abbi Jacobson notes that the series aims to portray a more authentic representation of the league. The television adaptation addresses homosexuality within the league, the reality of which has been discussed by former players. The series also addresses race relations at the time, taking on a split format which follows both the Peaches and Max Chapman—a fictional black pitcher who was barred from trying out for the league.

Lois Siegel documented the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film &quot;Baseball Girls&quot;, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Several histories of the AAGPBL have also been published in book form.

===AAGPBL Players Association===
When the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was unable to continue in 1955, its history and its significance were forgotten by baseball historians. Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates, and opponents that resulted in the league&#x27;s first reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. The Players Association was formed after a 1986 Reunion held in Fort Wayne as part of Run, Jane, Run, a local Women&#x27;s Bureau event. Historian and Baseball card publisher Sharon Roepke (author of &quot;Diamond Gals&quot;) who was circulating a petition to get the Baseball Hall of Fame to recognize the All American Girls Baseball League asked the players at the Reunion to organize to help the effort. A meeting was held at the South Bend home of Fran Janssen, and the Player&#x27;s Association was born. June Peppas was nominated President. Membership is now offered to players, staff members, and descendants, in addition to associate memberships for baseball fans and historians.

Sixty-five original AAGPBL members appeared in the 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; in scenes recreating the induction of the league into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.

As of 2017, the AAGPBL Players Association President was Richard Chapman, son of Dorothy Maguire. In 2017, he told &quot;Baseball America&quot; after his mother&#x27;s death in 1981, he attended the first reunion as her descendant, &quot;When I went to the reunion in 1982 to represent her, I learned more about her playing than she had ever said. There is a lot of history getting lost.&quot;

In 2019, the Players&#x27; Association established &quot;American Girls Baseball,&quot; which promotes women&#x27;s baseball for the World Baseball Softball Confederation Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup. The organization, headed by Sue Parsons (Rockford, 1953–54) with support from Misdee Miller, granddaughter of AAGPBL founder Phillip Wrigley, organizes the All-American Woman’s Baseball Classic at Ed Smith Stadium, the spring training home of the Baltimore Orioles, in Sarasota, Florida during November in a tournament that began in 2022. The AGB tournament features four teams named as tributes for the original AAGPBL teams, with all teams using a progressive fade to white jersey based on the colors of the squad—Rockford (peach with red numerals), South Bend (light blue with dark blue numerals), Racine (gold with brown numerals), and Kenosha (light green with green numerals) and white trousers. Games are played to modern WBSC Women&#x27;s Baseball rules, with all games seven innings long.

<doc id="594821" wikidata="Q1142246" url="?curid=594821" title="Succession to the Danish throne">
<text>The Danish Act of Succession, adopted on 5 June 1953, restricts the throne to those descended from Christian X and his wife, Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, through approved marriages. By a change in the law in 2009, succession is governed by absolute primogeniture.

==Law of succession==
Dynasts lose their right to the throne if they marry without the permission of the monarch, to be given in the Council of State. Individuals born to unmarried dynasts or to former dynasts who married without royal permission, and their descendants, are excluded from the throne. Further, when approving a marriage, the monarch can impose conditions that must be met in order for any resulting offspring to have succession rights. If there is no eligible person(s) to inherit the throne, the Danish Parliament (the Folketing) has the right to elect a new monarch and determine a line of succession.

==Line of succession==
People in the line of succession are listed with a number signifying their place in the line.
* &quot;King Frederik IX (1899–1972)&quot;
** Queen Margrethe II (born 1940)
*** King Frederik X (born 1968)
**** (1) Crown Prince Christian (born 2005)
**** (2) Princess Isabella (born 2007)
**** (3) Prince Vincent (born 2011)
**** (4) Princess Josephine (born 2011)
*** (5) Prince Joachim (born 1969)
**** (6) Count Nikolai of Monpezat (born 1999)
**** (7) Count Felix of Monpezat (born 2002)
**** (8) Count Henrik of Monpezat (born 2009)
**** (9) Countess Athena of Monpezat (born 2012)
** (10) Princess Benedikte, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 1944)
*** Gustav, 7th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 1969)
**** Prince Gustav Albrecht of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 2023)
**** Princess Mafalda of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 2024)
*** Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 1970)
**** Count Richard von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth (born 1999)
**** Countess Ingrid von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth (born 2003)
*** Princess Nathalie of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 1975)
**** Konstantin Johannsmann (born 2010)
**** Louisa Johannsmann (born 2015)
===Note===
The consent to Princess Benedikte&#x27;s marriage to Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1968 was given on the condition that their children (and further descendants) would have to take up permanent residence in Denmark during the age of mandatory education if they were to retain their succession rights. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte&#x27;s children are not deemed to have succession rights and are not included in the official line of succession. It is unclear whether their own descendants will have succession rights if residing in Denmark during the age of mandatory education. One Danish constitutional scholar, the late Professor Henrik Zahle, claimed that the children of Princess Benedikte do have succession rights, but without providing any arguments for the claim.

==History==
From the London Protocol in 1852 till 1953, various male-line descendants of King Christian IX had succession rights in Denmark except King George I of Greece (former Prince William of Denmark) and subsequent Kings of Greece, whose rights to the Danish throne were blocked by Article VI of the 1863 treaty between Denmark, France, the United Kingdom and Russia recognising George I as King of the Hellenes (Article VI stated: In no case shall the Crown of Greece and the Crown of Denmark be united on the same head.), although King George I never renounced his rights to the Danish throne when he assumed the Greek one, though he did defer his succession rights and agreed that his younger brother&#x27;s would supersede his.

King Haakon VII of Norway (former Prince Carl of Denmark) whose rights was blocked by Section XI of the Constitution of Norway which states &quot;The king must not receive any other crown or government without the Storting&#x27;s consent, for which two-thirds of the votes are required&quot;, from 19 August 1908.

The new Act of Succession terminated succession rights but left the excluded individuals in possession of their titles. This created a class of people with royal titles but no rights to the throne. As a distinction, those entitled to inherit the throne are called &quot;Prins til Danmark&quot; (Prince to Denmark, although this distinction is not made in English) while those without succession rights are referred to as &quot;Prins af Danmark&quot; (Prince of Denmark).

From 1853 until 1953, the Crown passed according to agnatic primogeniture. The monarch in 1953, King Frederik IX, had three daughters but no sons. Before the 1953 Act, the heir presumptive to the throne was Hereditary Prince Knud, the King&#x27;s younger brother. The Hereditary Prince was far less popular than the King was. Further, his mother-in-law, Princess Helena, was accused of supporting the Nazi movement during the Second World War. These factors, combined with a belief that the Salic law was outdated, resulted in the movement to change the succession law so that Frederick&#x27;s eldest daughter, the then Princess Margrethe, could inherit the throne. Thus, the Salic law was changed to male-preference primogeniture in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers.

Prince Knud had three children. His sons married without the monarch&#x27;s permission and lost both their royal titles and succession rights. Only Knud&#x27;s daughter, the unmarried Princess Elisabeth, retained her rights to the throne. Since her death, the line of succession has consisted only of descendants of King Frederik IX.

Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s youngest sister, Anne-Marie, married King Constantine II of Greece in 1964. As she was marrying a foreign ruler, although he was himself a prince of Denmark, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her and her descendants&#x27; rights to the Danish throne.

In 2008, the Danish parliament voted in favour of instituting absolute primogeniture, which would make the Danish monarch&#x27;s first-born child heir apparent regardless of gender, similar to Sweden and Norway. The bill was voted through two successive parliaments, and submitted to a referendum. The change in succession law did not affect the immediate line of succession as all of Margrethe II&#x27;s descendants would hold the same positions under both laws. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary became parents to twins born on 8 January 2011. Upon their birth, the twins assumed the fourth and fifth place in the line of succession, according to the absolute primogeniture principle adopted, thereby not giving Prince Vincent precedence over his older sister Princess Isabella.

In 2022, Queen Margrethe II stripped the children of her son Prince Joachim of their princely titles, though they remain in the line of succession (see Count of Monpezat#2023 style changes for details).

<text>White Oleander is a 1999 novel by American author Janet Fitch. In the fashion of a picaresque novel, it deals with themes of motherhood, telling the story of a girl named Astrid who is separated from her mother, Ingrid, and placed in a series of foster homes. It was chosen for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in May 1999, after which it became a national bestseller and was adapted into a 2002 film.

==Plot summary==
Astrid Magnussen is a 12-year-old girl living in Los Angeles, California with her mother, Ingrid Magnussen, a self-centered and eccentric poet. Astrid&#x27;s father, Klaus Anders, left before Astrid was old enough to remember him. Ingrid begins dating a man named Barry. Eventually, Ingrid discovers that Barry is cheating on her with younger women, so she breaks into Barry&#x27;s house and poisons him with a mixture of DMSO and oleander sap. Barry dies, and Ingrid is charged with his murder. Sentenced to life in prison, she promises her daughter that she will come back. Astrid is shuffled from one foster home to another for years. First, she joins Starr, a former stripper, and recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Starr has two children of her own, as well as two other foster children. Astrid (who is 14 by this time) has a sexual relationship with Starr&#x27;s live-in boyfriend, Ray. As his interest in Starr diminishes, Starr relapses. One night, after confronting Ray over his relationship with Astrid (out of jealousy and not concern), Starr shoots Astrid with a .38. Astrid is hospitalized for a few weeks, at which time she begins abusing the prescription drug Demerol.

After recovery Astrid is sent to live with Ed and Marvel Turlock, and their two small children, essentially as an unpaid babysitter. Astrid dislikes the couple, partially due to her dislike of the house, and partially due to Marvel&#x27;s racism. In particular, she makes racist comments about their next-door neighbor, a beautiful African-American sex worker named Olivia Johnstone, whom Astrid befriends. Astrid admires Olivia&#x27;s beauty, wealth, and hedonistic lifestyle. The Turlocks send Astrid away when they discover she associates with Olivia. Next, Astrid is sent to the home of a Hispanic woman named Amelia Ramos. Despite her wealth, Amelia starves her foster children, and Astrid resorts to eating from the garbage at school. Astrid eventually gets a new caseworker who finds her a new placement. A former actress, Claire Richards, and her husband, Ron, are Astrid&#x27;s next foster parents. Claire ensures Astrid&#x27;s comfort. For once, Astrid is doing well in school and pursuing art. Astrid continues corresponding with Ingrid in prison but becomes increasingly bitter towards her mother. Meanwhile, Claire suspects that Ron is having an affair. Claire, emotionally disturbed, dies by suicide after overdosing.

Astrid, now 17, is placed in MacLaren Children&#x27;s Center (known as &quot;Mac&quot;) where she meets an artistic boy named Paul Trout. They bond, but Paul is sent to a group home and Astrid leaves for a new foster parent. Astrid&#x27;s final home is with Russian immigrant Rena Grushenka. Astrid, still underage, has a sexual relationship with Rena&#x27;s boyfriend, Sergei. One day, after getting high on LSD, Astrid begins to have memories of a woman named Annie. Meanwhile, Ingrid and her lawyer begin to build a case to get Ingrid released from prison. However, their case depends on Astrid: if she testifies that Ingrid did not murder Barry, Ingrid will likely not be sentenced. Astrid realizes that she is in a position of power over her mother and asks Ingrid who Annie is. Ingrid reveals that Annie was a babysitter with whom Ingrid left Astrid for over a year. Astrid is upset and gives Ingrid a choice: to have her testify or to see her daughter return to the person her mother knew her as. Ingrid makes the choice not to ask Astrid to lie for her. Two years later, Astrid is 20 and living with Paul in a rundown flat in Berlin. Astrid spends her time buying suitcases and transforming them into individual art pieces representing her different foster homes. Ingrid is released from prison after a new trial acquits her. Astrid realizes that if she returns to California to reunite with Ingrid, she must abandon Paul. She chooses to stay with him but longs to go.

==Major characters== 
Astrid Magnussen: the main character, she is twelve years old when the novel opens. Artistic, shy and in the sway of her manipulative mother. The novel depicts her loss of naivety, sexual awakening, and attempts at self-definition.

Ingrid Magnussen: Astrid&#x27;s manipulative mother, who is jailed early in the novel for her murder of her lover Barry. When with Astrid, she often forgets she has a daughter and focuses on her eclectic art. Later, she attempts to control Astrid from jail.

Starr: Astrid&#x27;s first foster mother, she is a former stripper turned outspoken Christian. She is recovering from alcoholism and drug use and lives in a trailer with her children. She first shows kindness to Astrid but later grows jealous of Astrid&#x27;s relationship with Ray.

&#x27;Uncle&#x27; Ray: Starr&#x27;s boyfriend, whose children call him &quot;Uncle Ray.&quot; A seemingly kind carpenter, he begins a sexual relationship with Astrid who is, at the time, 14. Thus the relationship is an example of sexual predation.

Olivia Johnstone: An African-American high-class sex worker Astrid befriends while living with her second foster family, the Turlocks. Olivia introduces Astrid to a luxurious, hedonistic lifestyle.

Claire Richards: Astrid&#x27;s fourth foster mother, who notices Astrid&#x27;s artistic talent and encourages her to pursue school. Claire has a weak relationship with her husband, poor self-esteem, and commits suicide after encouragement from Ingrid.

Paul Trout: An artistic boy Astrid meets while staying at MacLaren Children&#x27;s Center (known as &quot;Mac&quot;), a facility for foster children who can&#x27;t find placements. Astrid later develops a romance with Paul.

Rena Grushenka: Astrid&#x27;s final foster mother, a tough, business-savvy Russian woman. She is abrasive but encourages Astrid to make sound financial decisions and to become a good negotiator.

==Themes== 
Motherhood is a primary theme of the novel. Astrid struggles to define herself against her biological mother and her various foster mothers, while still searching for the love and acceptance her mother cannot provide from jail. The art pieces Astrid creates at the end of the novel are metaphors for her various mothers and homes.

The novel also deals with the nature of art; self-reflection and creation; survival of the fittest; and perfection versus imperfection.

==Origins==
The short story of the same name appeared in the Fall/Winter 1994 issue of &quot;Black Warrior Review&quot;. &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; &quot;for that year&quot; included it in their list of distinguished short fiction.

==Reception==
The novel received good reviews and had a typical publication run for a debut novel. After being named to Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in 1999, the popularity of the book skyrocketed. It became a national best seller. Currently, it has a 3.95 out of 5 star rating on Goodreads.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted into a film, &quot;White Oleander&quot;, released in 2002 starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Renée Zellweger.

<text>Benjamin Nathan Cardozo (May 24, 1870 – July 9, 1938) was an American lawyer and jurist who served on the New York Court of Appeals from 1914 to 1932 and as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1932 until his death in 1938. Cardozo is remembered for his significant influence on the development of American common law in the 20th century, as well as for his philosophy and vivid prose style.

Born in New York City, Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 after attending Columbia Law School. He won an election to the New York Supreme Court in 1913 but was appointed to the New York Court of Appeals the following year. He won election as chief judge of that court in 1926. As chief judge, he wrote majority opinions in cases such as &quot;Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.&quot;

In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to the U.S. Supreme Court to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Cardozo served on the Court until his death in 1938 and formed part of the liberal bloc of justices known as the Three Musketeers. He wrote the Court&#x27;s majority opinion in notable cases such as &quot;Nixon v. Condon&quot; (1932) and &quot;Steward Machine Co. v. Davis&quot; (1937).

==Early life and family==
Cardozo, the son of Rebecca Washington (née Nathan) and Albert Jacob Cardozo, was born in 1870 in New York City. Both Cardozo’s maternal grandparents, Sara Seixas and Isaac Mendes Seixas Nathan, and his paternal grandparents, Ellen Hart and Michael H. Cardozo, were Western Sephardim of the Portuguese-Jewish community, and affiliated with Manhattan’s Congregation Shearith Israel. Cardozo had his bar mitzvah at Shearith Israel in June of 1883. Their ancestors had immigrated to the British colonies from London, England, before the American Revolution.

The family were descended from Jewish-origin New Christian conversos. They left the Iberian Peninsula for Holland during the Inquisition. There they returned to the practice of Judaism. Cardozo family tradition held that their marrano (New Christians who maintained crypto-Jewish practices in secrecy) ancestors were from Portugal, although Cardozo’s ancestry has not been firmly traced to that country. But ”Cardozo” (archaic spelling of &quot;Cardoso&quot;), ”Seixas”, and ”Mendes” are the Portuguese, rather than Spanish, spelling of those common Iberian surnames.

Benjamin Cardozo had a fraternal twin, his sister Emily. They had four other siblings, including an older sister Nell and older brother.

Benjamin was named for his uncle, Benjamin Nathan, a vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, who was murdered in 1870. The case was never solved. Among their many cousins, given their deep history in the US, was the poet Emma Lazarus. Other earlier relations include Francis Lewis Cardozo (1836–1903), Thomas Cardozo, and Henry Cardozo, free men of color of Charleston, South Carolina. Francis became a Presbyterian minister in New Haven, Connecticut, after education in Scotland, and was elected Secretary of State of South Carolina during the Reconstruction era. Later he worked as an educator in Washington, DC, under a Republican administration.

Albert Cardozo, Benjamin Cardozo’s father, was a judge on the Supreme Court of New York (the state’s general trial court) until 1868. He was implicated in a judicial corruption scandal sparked by the Erie Railway takeover wars and was forced to resign. The scandal also led to the creation of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. After leaving the court, the senior Cardozo practiced law for nearly two decades more until his death in 1885.

When Benjamin and Emily were young, their mother Rebecca died. The twins were raised during much of their childhood largely by their sister Nell, who was 11 years older. Benjamin remained devoted to her throughout his life. 

===Education===
One of Benjamin’s tutors was Horatio Alger. When the Cardozos engaged Alger in 1883 to tutor Benjamin and his older sister Elizabeth, they were unaware that Alger had a history of likely molesting teen boys during his time as a minister in Brewster, Massachusetts, from 1864-1866. There is no evidence that Alger continued committing these crimes after the ones he was alleged of during his ministry, from which he was expelled in 1866 following an inquiry in which he failed to deny the boys&#x27; description of events. In reviewing Cardozo’s life, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye stated Alger provided Cardozo with a superb education, and a love of poetry.
At age 15, Cardozo entered Columbia University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, earning his BA in 1889 and his MA in 1890. He was admitted to Columbia Law School in 1889. Cardozo wanted to enter a profession that could enable him to support himself and his siblings, but he also hoped to restore the family name, which had been sullied by his father’s actions as a judge. Cardozo left law school after two years without a law degree, as only two years of law school was required to sit for the bar during this era in New York.

==Legal career==
===Law practice===
Cardozo passed the bar examination in 1891 and began practicing appellate law alongside his older brother. Benjamin Cardozo practiced law in New York City until year-end 1913 with Simpson, Warren and Cardozo.

Interested in advancement and restoring the family name, Cardozo ran for a judgeship on the New York Supreme Court. In November 1913, Cardozo was elected by a large margin to a 14-year term on that court and took office on January 1, 1914.

===New York Court of Appeals===
In February 1914, Cardozo was designated to the New York Court of Appeals under the Amendment of 1899. He was reportedly the first Jewish person to serve on the Court of Appeals.

In January 1917, he was appointed by the governor to a regular seat on the Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Samuel Seabury. In November 1917, he was elected on the Democratic and Republican tickets to a 14-year term on the Court of Appeals.

In 1926, he was elected, on both tickets again, to a 14-year term as Chief Judge. He took office on January 1, 1927, and resigned on March 7, 1932 to accept his appointment to the United States Supreme Court.

His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings.

In 1921, Cardozo gave the Storrs Lectures at Yale University, which were later published as &quot;The Nature of the Judicial Process&quot;, a book that remains valuable to judges today. Shortly thereafter, Cardozo became a member of the group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world.

While on the Court of Appeals, he criticized the exclusionary rule as developed by the federal courts, saying: ”The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered”. He noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.

===United States Supreme Court===
On February 15, 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Cardozo as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Cardozo’s appointment that &quot;seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended.&quot; The Democrat Cardozo&#x27;s appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history that was not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee&#x27;s contribution to law.

He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 24, 1932, and was sworn into office on March 14. During a radio broadcast soon after Cardozo&#x27;s confirmation, Clarence C. Dill, a Democratic senator from Washington, called Hoover&#x27;s appointment of Cardozo &quot;the finest act of his career as President.&quot; The entire faculty of the University of Chicago Law School had urged Hoover to nominate Cardozo, as did the deans of the law schools at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign to make room for him if Hoover had his heart set on someone else (Stone had suggested to Calvin Coolidge that he should nominate Cardozo in 1925 before Stone). Hoover originally demurred; he was concerned that there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court. Justice James McReynolds was a notorious anti-Semite (and once on the Court, McReynolds directed antagonistic antisemitic behavior toward Cardozo, something he had been sheltered from in his prior life). When the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure.

Cardozo was a member of the Three Musketeers, along with Brandeis and Stone, who were considered to be the liberal faction of the Supreme Court. During his tenure in the Court, Cardozo wrote opinions that stressed the necessity for the tightest adherence to the Tenth Amendment.

===Honors===
Cardozo received the honorary degree of LL.D. from several colleges and universities, including: Columbia (1915); Yale (1921); New York (1922); Michigan (1923); Harvard (1927); St. John’s (1928); St. Lawrence (1932); Williams (1932); Princeton (1932); Pennsylvania (1932); Brown (1933); and Chicago (1933).

==Personal life==

As an adult, Cardozo no longer practiced Judaism (he identified as an agnostic), but he was proud of his Jewish heritage. 

Of the six children born to Albert and Rebecca Cardozo, only his twin sister Emily married. She and her husband did not have any children.

Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; book review of Richard Polenberg&#x27;s book on Cardozo:


In late 1937, Cardozo had a heart attack, and in early 1938, he suffered a stroke. He died on July 9, 1938, at the age of 68. He was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery in Queens.

In 1939, renowned Judge Learned Hand eulogized Cardozo, describing him as able to &quot;weigh the conflicting factors of his problem without always finding himself on one scale or the other&quot; and noting that &quot;his gentle nature had in it no acquisitiveness&quot; and that he was able to get outside himself and &quot;from this self-effacement came a power greater than the power of him who ruleth a city.&quot; Hand stated that Cardozo &quot;was wise because his spirt was uncontaminated, because he knew no violence, or hatred, or envy, or jealousy, or ill-will.&quot; Hand found &quot;it was this purity that chiefly made [Cardozo] the judge we so much revere; more than his learning, his acuteness, and his fabulous industry.&quot; He asked that people grasp the rare good fortune that a person with Cardozo&#x27;s qualities existed, pause to &quot;take count of our own coarser selves,&quot; and take in the lesson Cardozo taught through example, &quot;a lesson quite at variance with most that we practice, and much that we profess.&quot;

Cardozo&#x27;s evaluation of himself showed the same flair as his legal opinions:

In truth, I am nothing but a plodding mediocrity—please observe, a plodding mediocrity—for a mere mediocrity does not go very far, but a plodding one gets quite a distance. There is joy in that success, and a distinction can come from courage, fidelity and industry.

===Ethnicity===
Cardozo was the second Jewish justice to be appointed to the Supreme Court. The first was Louis Brandeis, whose family was Ashkenazi.

Cardozo was born into the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community, which had traditions distinct from the Ashkenazi. Since the appointment of Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the 21st century, some commentators have suggested that Cardozo should be considered the &quot;first Hispanic justice&quot;.

In response to this controversy, Cardozo biographer Andrew Kaufman questioned the usage of the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; in Justice Cardozo&#x27;s lifetime: &quot;Well, I think he regarded himself as a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula&quot;. Cardozo &quot;confessed in 1937 that&quot; after centuries in British North America, &quot;his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions&quot;. His ancestors had lived in England, the British colonies, and the United States since the 17th century.

Some Latino advocacy groups, such as the National Association of Latino Elected Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association, consider Sonia Sotomayor to be the first Hispanic justice, as in their view she was raised in Hispanic culture.

<text>Doorway pages (bridge pages, portal pages, jump pages, gateway pages or entry pages) are web pages that are created for the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes (spamdexing). A doorway page will affect the index of a search engine by inserting results for particular phrases while sending visitors to a different page. Doorway pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge use some form of cloaking. This usually falls under Black Hat SEO.

If a visitor clicks through to a typical doorway page from a search engine results page, in most cases they will be redirected with a fast Meta refresh command to another page. Other forms of redirection include use of JavaScript and server side redirection, from the server configuration file. Some doorway pages may be dynamic pages generated by scripting languages such as Perl and PHP.

==Identification==
Doorway pages are often easy to identify in that they have been designed primarily for search engines, not for human beings. Sometimes a doorway page is copied from another high ranking page, but this is likely to cause the search engine to detect the page as a duplicate and exclude it from the search engine listings.

Because many search engines give a penalty for using the META refresh command, some doorway pages just trick the visitor into clicking on a link to get them to the desired destination page, or they use JavaScript for redirection.

More sophisticated doorway pages, called &quot;Content Rich Doorways&quot;, are designed to gain high placement in search results without using redirection. They incorporate at least a minimum amount of design and navigation similar to the rest of the site to provide a more human-friendly and natural appearance. Visitors are offered standard links as calls to action.

Landing pages are regularly misconstrued to equate to Doorway pages within the literature. The former are content rich pages to which traffic is directed within the context of pay-per-click campaigns and to maximize SEO campaigns.

Doorway pages are also typically used for sites that maintain a blacklist of URLs known to harbor spam, such as Facebook, Tumblr and Deviantart.

==Cloaking==
Doorway pages often also employ cloaking techniques for misdirection. Cloaked pages will show a version of that page to human visitor which is different from the one provided to crawlers—usually implemented via server-side scripts. The server can differentiate between bots, crawlers and human visitors based on various flags, including source IP address or user-agent. Cloaking will simultaneously trick search engines to rank sites higher for irrelevant keywords, while displaying monetizing any human traffic by showing visitors spammy, often irrelevant, content. The practice of cloaking is considered to be highly manipulative and condemned within the SEO industry and by search engines, and its use can result in significant penalty or the complete removal of sites from being indexed. 

==Redirection==
Webmasters that use doorway pages would generally prefer that users never actually see these pages and instead be delivered to a &quot;real&quot; page within their sites. To achieve this goal, redirection is sometimes used. This may be as simple as installing a meta refresh tag on the doorway pages. An advanced system might make use of cloaking. In either case, such redirection may make your doorway pages unacceptable to search engines.

==Construction==
A content-rich doorway page must be constructed in a search-engine-friendly manner, or it may be construed as search engine spam, possibly resulting in the page being banned from the index for an undisclosed amount of time.

These types of doorways utilize (but are not limited to) the following:

* Title-attributed images for keyword support
* Title-attributed links for keyword support

==In culture==
Doorway pages were examined as a cultural and political phenomenon along with spam poetry and flarf.

<text>The Sturmpanzerwagen A7V was a heavy tank introduced by Germany in 1918 during World War I. One hundred chassis were ordered in early 1917, ten to be finished as fighting vehicles with armoured bodies, and the remainder as &quot;Überlandwagen&quot; cargo carriers. The number to be armoured was later increased to 20. They were used in action from March to October 1918, and were the only tanks produced by Germany in World War I to be used in combat, as well as being the first operational German Tank. It was developed as a response to British tanks. While certain publications have attempted to claim the A7V was an improvement over its British competition, there is nothing to support this suggestion. It was less capable across rough terrain, slower, required a far larger crew to operate and ultimately never had any success comparable to that of the British ‘Land Ships’.

==History==
After the first British tanks appeared on the Western Front, in September 1916, the German War Ministry formed a committee, under the auspices of its &quot;Allgemeines Kriegsdepartement, Abteilung 7 Verkehrswesen&quot; (&quot;General War Department, Section 7, Transportation&quot;), to investigate tank development.

The project to design and build the first German tank was placed under the direction of Joseph Vollmer, one of Germany&#x27;s foremost automobile designers. It was to weigh around 30 tons, be capable of crossing ditches up to wide, have armament including a cannon at the front and rear as well as several machine-guns, and reach a top speed of at least . The running gear was based on the American Holt tractor, copied from examples loaned by the Austro-Hungarian Army. After initial plans were shared with the army in December 1916, the design was extended to be a universal chassis that could be used as a base for both a tank and unarmoured &quot;Überlandwagen&quot; (&quot;over-land vehicle&quot;) cargo carriers.

The first prototype was completed by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft at Berlin-Marienfelde and tested on 30 April 1917. A wooden mockup of a final version was completed in May 1917 and demonstrated in Mainz with 10 tons of ballast to simulate the weight of the armor. During final design, the rear-facing cannon was removed and the number of machine-guns was increased to six. The first pre-production A7V was produced in September 1917, followed by the first production model in October 1917. The tanks were given to Assault Tank Units 1 and 2, founded on 20 September 1917, each with five officers and 109 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.

===Naming===
The tank&#x27;s name was derived from that of its parent organization, &quot;Allgemeines Kriegsdepartement, Abteilung 7 (Verkehrswesen)&quot; (General War Department, Section 7, Transport). In German, the tank was called &quot;Sturmpanzerwagen&quot; (roughly &quot;armoured assault vehicle&quot;).

==Design==

The A7V was long and wide, and the maximum height was . The tank had 20 mm of steel plate at the sides, 30 mm at the front and 10 mm for the roof; however, the steel was not hardened armour plate, which reduced its effectiveness. It was sufficient to stop machine-gun and rifle fire, but not larger calibre rounds.

The crew officially consisted of at least 17 soldiers and one officer: commander (officer, typically a lieutenant), driver, mechanic, mechanic/signaller, 12 infantrymen (six machine gunners, six loaders), and two artillerymen (main gunner and loader). A7Vs often went into action with as many as 25 men on board.

==Armament==
The A7V was armed with six 7.92 mm MG08 machine guns and a 5.7 cm Maxim-Nordenfelt cannon mounted at the front. Some of these cannons were of British manufacture and had been captured in Belgium early in the war; others were captured in Russia in 1918 and appear to have included some Russian-made copies.

Some A7Vs originally were built with two forward-facing machine guns instead of a 57 mm gun. Most were converted to carry a 57 mm before entering service. Number 501, &quot;Gretchen&quot;, took part in the action at St. Quentin before her 57 mm was fitted.

===Ammunition===
The A7V carried between 40 and 60 cartridge belts for its machine guns, each of 250 rounds, giving it a total of . Officially, it carried 180 shells for the 57 mm gun, of which 90 were canister, 54 were armor-piercing, and 36 were high-explosive; in practice, however, A7V crews stowed up to 300 57 mm rounds for combat.

==Propulsion==

Power came from two centrally mounted Daimler 4-cylinder petrol engines delivering each; the A7V carried of fuel. The top speed was about on roads and across country. The 24 wheel suspension was individually sprung – an advantage over the unsprung British tanks. The A7V&#x27;s power-to-weight ratio was 5.1 kW/ton (6.8 hp/ton), it could cross trenches up to wide, and its ground clearance was .

Compared to that of other World War I tanks, the A7V&#x27;s road speed was quite high, but the vehicle had very poor off-road capability and a high centre of gravity, which made it prone to getting stuck or overturning on steep slopes. The large overhang at the front and the low ground clearance meant that trenches or very muddy areas were impassable. The driver&#x27;s view of the terrain directly in front of the tank was obscured by the vehicle&#x27;s hull, which meant that there was a blind spot of about . However, in open terrain, the A7V could be used to some success, and offered more firepower than the armoured cars that were available.

==Combat history==

===St. Quentin Canal===
The A7V was first used in combat on 21 March 1918. Five tanks of &quot;Abteilung I&quot; (Detachment I) under the command of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Greiff were deployed north of the St. Quentin Canal. Three of the A7Vs suffered mechanical failures before they entered combat; the remaining pair helped stop a minor British breakthrough in the area, but otherwise saw little combat that day.

===Villers-Bretonneux===


Three detachments (&quot;Abteilungen&quot;) of tanks were assigned to an attack in April 1918 at Villers-Bretonneux at the head of the four German divisions spread over a front. Two tanks broke down en route, but the 13 that saw action achieved some success, and the British recorded that their lines were broken by the tanks.

The first and second tank-against-tank combat in history took place on 24 April 1918 when three A7Vs (including chassis number 561, known as &quot;Nixe&quot;) taking part in an attack with infantry incidentally met three British Mark IVs (two female machine gun-armed tanks and one male with two 6-pounder guns) near Villers-Bretonneux. During the battle, tanks on both sides were damaged. According to the British lead tank commander, Second Lieutenant Frank Mitchell, the female Mk IVs fell back after being damaged by armour-piercing bullets. They were unable to damage the A7Vs with their own machine guns. Mitchell then attacked the lead German tank, commanded by Second Lieutenant Wilhelm Biltz, with the 6-pounders of his own tank and knocked it out. He hit it three times, and killed five of the crew when they bailed out. He stated that he then went on to rout some infantry with case shot. The two remaining A7Vs in turn withdrew. As Mitchell&#x27;s tank withdrew from action, seven British Whippet tanks also engaged the German infantry. Three of these were knocked out in the battle, and it is unclear if any of them engaged the retreating German tanks but they did carry out an attack on two German battalions in the open to the rear causing them to break and flee. Mitchell&#x27;s tank lost a track towards the end of the battle due to damage from an exploding mortar shell and was abandoned. The damaged A7V limped back to the German lines, but eventually broke down. It was later destroyed by a German demolition squad, to prevent its capture and reuse by the Allies. During the same day however, another tank-against-tank fight took place where an A7V engaged a group of Whippet tanks and destroyed one of them.

A counterattack later re-established the Allied line, by which time three A7Vs were out of action in No Man&#x27;s Land or behind German lines. Nixe was badly damaged, and a German team destroyed it with explosive charges during the night of the 24th. Elfriede had overturned; it was righted and recovered from No Man&#x27;s Land three weeks later by French troops and British tanks, and handed over to the French for examination. Mephisto lay stuck in a crater behind German lines for almost three months. After the area was taken by Australian troops, in July, the tank was towed to the rear by British tanks and, eventually, transported to Australia.

===Other actions===
In May, A7Vs were used with limited success in an attack on the French near Soissons, during the Third Battle of the Aisne.

On 15 July, at Reims (during the Second Battle of the Marne), the Germans put eight A7Vs and 20 captured Mk IVs against the French lines. Although 10 of the Mk IVs were lost in this action, no A7Vs were lost.

The final use in World War I of A7Vs was in a small but successful action on 11 October 1918, near Iwuy.

===Assessment===
Germany did not consider the A7V a success and planned other designs. However, the end of the war meant none of the other tanks in development or planned ones – such as the &quot;Sturmpanzerwagen Oberschlesien&quot; and the 120-ton K-Wagen – would be finished.

With only 20 produced, the A7V made only a very minor contribution to the German war effort in World War I, and the approximately 50 captured British Mark IV tanks (renamed &quot;Beutepanzer&quot; in German operation) the Germans fielded in action during the war outnumbered the A7V. In contrast, the French produced over 3,600 of their light Renault FT, the most numerous tank of World War I, and the British over 2,500 of their Mark I, II, III, IV, V, and V* heavy tanks.

==After the war==
Two vehicles closely resembling the A7V, one of which was named &quot;Hedi&quot;, were among several used by &quot;Kokampf&quot;, a &quot;Freikorps&quot; tank unit, to quell civil unrest in Berlin in 1919. They were constructed using the chassis from &quot;Überlandwagen&quot; and armed with four MG08/15 machine guns. It is not known whether the vehicles were armour-plated.

There is a popular myth that France handed over several A7Vs to Polish forces, which used them during the Polish–Soviet War in 1919–1920. However, reliable sources dismiss the idea because the fate of each A7V that saw service in World War I is known and includes no transfers to Poland and there is no known official record or photographic evidence of A7Vs in Polish service.

The design of the A7V is featured on the 1921 Tank Memorial Badge, awarded to German veterans of World War I who served as tank crewmen.
==A7V chassis listing==
==Variants==

* A7V-U: (&quot;umlaufende Ketten&quot; = &quot;tracks running all the way round&quot;). An attempt to reproduce the all-terrain capability of the British tanks, the A7V-U was still based on the Holt chassis but had a rhomboidal hull and all-round tracks. The cab was similar to, but bigger than, that on the A7V and was mounted on top of the forward part of the hull. Two 57 mm guns were carried in sponsons similar to the British type. The prototype was built in June 1918; trials showed that it was nose-heavy and had a high centre of gravity, and the 40-ton weight caused manoeuvrability problems. On the assumption that the problems could be rectified, 20 were ordered in September 1918, the same month work on the design was halted.

Drawings for two improved designs were prepared, but the war ended before any were produced.

Thirty chassis were assigned for completion as &quot;Überlandwagen&quot; supply carriers, but not all were completed before the end of the war.

* A7V Flakpanzer: Its engine was placed under the driver&#x27;s compartment, which had a tarpaulin holder to cover the driver from bad weather, ammo boxes were placed around the driver&#x27;s compartment and beneath the gun themselves. It is claimed that it was armed with two Russian 76 mm divisional gun M1902 field guns on the first two prototypes of the A7V Flakpanzer. The third prototype of the A7V Flakpanzer was armed with a Krupp-Manufactured 7.7 cm (3.03 in) leichte Feld Kanone 1896 n/a, only one l.F.K 1896 was mounted onto the vehicle. No paperwork related or mentioning these weapons has been found.

==Surviving example==

The only surviving A7V is &quot;Mephisto&quot;, which was abandoned by its crew during the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918. It was recovered three months later by British and Australian troops, and taken to Australia in 1919 as a trophy. The vehicle stood outside the old Queensland Museum in Bowen Hills, Brisbane, under an open-sided shelter for many years until being moved into the new Queensland Museum on Southbank in 1986. It was damaged by floodwater in 2011, and taken for restoration to the Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich, Queensland. After restoration it was displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, from 2015 until 2017. It has now been returned to the Queensland Museum.

The cannon from A7V 504 &quot;Schnuck&quot; is on display at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester.

==Replicas==
There are numerous modern replicas, made to look like the original, many made of wood and modern materials:

* A running replica was built in 2009 by Bob Grundy of British Military Vehicles, Wigan, UK, a company that specialises in the restoration of old military vehicles. The replica is constructed of plywood and angle iron, using the engine, transmission and tracks from two Fordson County Crawlers – tracked agricultural vehicles – and is painted to represent A7V number 504, &quot;Schnuck&quot;. It was purchased by The Tank Museum, Bovington, in November 2012. It is on display inside the museum, and takes part in outdoor displays alongside the museum&#x27;s replica British Mark IV that was constructed for the film &quot;War Horse&quot;.
* A static replica is in the Deutsches Panzermuseum in Munster. It is named &quot;Wotan&quot;, but is largely based on the surviving example, &quot;Mephisto&quot;.
* A mobile mock-up of an A7V appears in the East German feature film &quot;Trotz Alledem&quot; (1972), the story of Karl Liebknecht and the 1919 Spartacist uprising in Berlin.
* A mock-up is among the vehicles at the Milovice Tankodrome in the Czech Republic.

<text>The common asparagus beetle (&quot;Crioceris asparagi&quot;) is an important pest of asparagus crops both in Europe and in North America. Asparagus is its only food plant. The beetle is 6.0 mm to 9.5 mm long and slightly elongated. It is metallic blue-black in color with cream or yellow spots on its red-bordered elytra. The larvae are fat gray grubs with dark heads.

The adult beetles and the larvae strip the needle-like leaves off the asparagus fronds, depriving the plants of the ability to photosynthesize and store energy for future years. Additionally, they chew the spears and lay a lot of eggs on them, rendering the crop unusable. The larvae feed on the plants for a few weeks, then drop to the ground to pupate. One year may see two or three generations of the beetle. The adults overwinter in a dormant state underground or in nearby leaf litter.

The parasitic wasp, &quot;Tetrastichus coeruleus&quot;, occurring mainly in the United States and Europe, can cause up to 71% mortality in the field and has been successfully used for biological control.

Various insecticides (such as carbamates, pyrethroids, spinetoram, and spinosad) can be considered for pest control.

The similar spotted asparagus beetle (&quot;Crioceris duodecimpunctata&quot;) is also a pest as an adult, feeding on tender shoots and leaves, but since the larvae feed only on the asparagus berries it is not considered to be as important.

<text>Eddie Asner (; November 15, 1929 – August 29, 2021) was an American actor. He is most notable for portraying Lou Grant on the sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and drama &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, making him one of the few television actors to portray the same character in both a comedy and a drama.

Asner is the most honored male performer in the history of the Primetime Emmy Awards, having won seven – five for portraying Lou Grant (three as Supporting Actor in a Comedy Television Series on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and two as Lead Actor in a Dramatic Television Series on spin-off &quot;Lou Grant&quot;. His other Emmys were also for performances in two miniseries: &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976), and &quot;Roots&quot; (1977).

Asner acted in the films &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1966), &quot;They Call Me Mister Tibbs!&quot; (1970), &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot; (1981), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), and &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; (2011). He also played Santa Claus in several films and voiced Carl Fredricksen in the Pixar animated film &quot;Up&quot; (2009).

Asner starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1994–1995), and &quot;&quot; (2011–2017). He also acted extensively in numerous television series such as &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, &quot;Briarpatch&quot;, &quot;Working Class&quot;, and &quot;Dead to Me&quot;. He also voiced J. Jonah Jameson in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot; (1994–1998), and Uncle Ben in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; (2008).

== Early life and education ==
Asner was born November 15, 1929, in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. His Ashkenazi Jewish immigrant parents, Lizzie (&quot;née&quot; Seliger; 1885–1967, from Odessa, Ukraine), a housewife, and Morris David Asner (1879–1957, from Lithuania (Vilna Governorate or Grodno Governorate)), ran a second-hand shop and junkyard. His four older siblings were Ben J. Asner (1915–1986), Eve Asner (1916–2014), Esther Edelman (1919–2014) and Labe Asner (1923–2017). He was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family and given the Hebrew name Yitzhak.

Asner attended Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, Kansas, and the University of Chicago. He studied journalism in Chicago until a professor advised him there was little money to be made in the profession. He had been working in a steel mill, but he quickly switched to drama, debuting as the martyred Thomas Becket in a campus production of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;. He eventually dropped out of school, going to work as a taxi driver, worked on the assembly line for General Motors, and other odd jobs before being drafted in the military in 1951.

Asner served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War and appeared in plays that toured Army bases in Europe.

==Career==
=== 1955–1969: Early work and television roles ===

Following his military service, Asner helped found the Playwrights Theatre Company in Chicago, but left for New York City before members of that company regrouped as the Compass Players in the mid-1950s. He later made frequent guest appearances with the successor to Compass, The Second City. In New York City, Off-Broadway roles included Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum in the revival of &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; and in Otway&#x27;s Venice Preserv&#x27;d in late 1955. Asner scored his first Broadway role in &quot;Face of a Hero&quot; alongside Jack Lemmon in 1960, and began to make inroads as a television actor, having made his TV debut in 1957 on &quot;Studio One&quot;. In two notable performances on television, Asner played Detective Sgt. Thomas Siroleo in the 1963 episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; titled &quot;It Crawled Out of the Woodwork&quot; and the reprehensible ex-premier Brynov in the 1965 &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; episode &quot;The Exile&quot;. He made his film debut in 1962, in the Elvis Presley vehicle &quot;Kid Galahad&quot;.

Before landing his role with Mary Tyler Moore, Asner guest-starred in television series including four episodes of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; starring Robert Stack, the syndicated crime drama &quot;Decoy&quot;, starring Beverly Garland, two episodes of &quot;Naked City&quot; in 1961, and &quot;Route 66&quot; in 1962 (the episode titled &quot;Welcome to the Wedding&quot;) as Custody Officer Lincoln Peers. He was cast on Jack Lord&#x27;s ABC drama series &quot;Stoney Burke&quot; and in the series finale of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Reporter&quot;, starring Harry Guardino. He also appeared on &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;The Invaders&quot;. In 1963, Asner appeared as George Johnson on &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode &quot;Echo of Another Day&quot;. In 1968 he was the villain Furman Crotty in the Wild Wild West episode &quot;The Night of the Amnesiac&quot;.

=== 1970–1982: &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Lou Grant&quot; ===

Asner was best known for his character Lou Grant, who was first introduced on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in 1970. In 1977, after Moore&#x27;s series ended, Asner&#x27;s character was given his own show, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; (1977–82). In contrast to the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; series, a thirty-minute award-winning comedy about television journalism, the &quot;Lou Grant&quot; series was an hour-long award-winning drama about newspaper journalism. For his role as Grant, Asner was one of only two actors to win an Emmy Award for a sitcom and a drama for the same role (the second being Uzo Aduba). In addition he made appearances as Lou Grant on two other shows: &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;. Other television series starring Asner in regular roles include &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;, &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot;, and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. He also starred in one episode of the Western series &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Gun&quot; (1997), as well as portraying art smuggler August March in an episode of the original &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (1975) and reprised the role in the &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2012) remake. He also appeared as a streetwise veteran police officer in an episode of the 1973 version of &quot;Police Story&quot;.

Asner was acclaimed for his role in the ABC miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, as Captain Davies, the morally conflicted captain of the &quot;Lord Ligonier&quot;, the slave ship that brought Kunta Kinte to America. The role earned Asner an Emmy Award, as did the similarly dark role of Axel Jordache in the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976). In contrast, he played a former pontiff in the lead role of &quot;Papa Giovanni: Ioannes XXIII&quot; (&quot;Pope John XXIII&quot; 2002), an Italian television film for RAI.

=== 1983–2009: Established actor and voice work ===

Asner had an extensive voice acting career. In 1987, he played the eponymous character, George F. Babbitt, in the L.A. Classic Theatre Works&#x27; radio theater production of Sinclair Lewis&#x27; novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;. Asner won one Audie Award and was nominated for two Grammy Awards and an additional Audie for his audiobook work. He also provided the voices for Joshua on &quot;Joshua and the Battle of Jericho&quot; (1986) for Hanna-Barbera, J. Jonah Jameson on the 1990s animated television series &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994–98); Hoggish Greedly on &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; (1990–95); Hudson on &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994–96); Jabba the Hutt on the radio version of &quot;Star Wars&quot;; Master Vrook from &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and its sequel; Roland Daggett on &quot;&quot; (1992–94); Cosgrove on &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;; Ed Wuncler on &quot;The Boondocks&quot; (2005–14); and Granny Goodness in various DC Comics animated series. He also voiced Napoleon, Cornelia&#x27;s younger sister&#x27;s cat in the Disney show &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;, and Kid Potato, the Butcher&#x27;s dad in the PBS Kids hit show &quot;WordGirl&quot;. He was even nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program but lost to Eartha Kitt for Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Pets!&quot;. Asner provided the voice of famed American orator Edward Everett in the 2017 documentary film &quot;The Gettysburg Address&quot;.

Asner provided the voice of the main protagonist Carl Fredricksen in the Academy Award-winning Pixar film &quot;Up&quot; (2009). He received critical acclaim for the role, with one critic going so far as to suggest &quot;They should create a new category for this year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Vocal Acting in an Animated Film and name Asner as the first recipient.&quot; He appeared in the mid- to late-2000s decade in a recurring segment on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, entitled &quot;Does This Impress Ed Asner?&quot; He was cast in a Country Music Television comedy pilot, &quot;Regular Joe&quot;.

In 2001, Asner was the recipient of the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Asner won more Emmy Awards for performing than any other male actor (seven, including five for the role of Lou Grant). In 1996, he was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame.

=== 2010–2021: Later roles ===
In July 2010, Asner completed recording sessions for &quot;Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders&quot;; a documentary on the 1974 DeFeo murders in Amityville, New York. Asner served as the narrator for the film, which covers a forensic analysis of the murders, the trial in which 23-year-old DeFeo son Ronald DeFeo Jr., was convicted of the killings, and the subsequent &quot;haunting&quot; story which is revealed to be a hoax. Also in 2010, Asner played the title role in &quot;FDR&quot;, a stage production about the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he subsequently continued to tour the play throughout the country. In January 2011, Asner took a supporting role on CMT&#x27;s first original sitcom &quot;Working Class&quot;. He made an appearance in the independent comedy feature &quot;Not Another B Movie&quot;, and had a role as billionaire Warren Buffett in HBO&#x27;s economic drama &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; (2011). In 2013, he guest starred as Mr. Finger in &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;.

Asner also provided voice-over narration for many documentaries and films about social activism, including &quot;Tiger by the Tail&quot;, a documentary film detailing the efforts of Eric Mann and the Campaign to keep General Motors&#x27; Van Nuys assembly plant running. He also recorded for a public radio show and podcast, &quot;Playing On Air&quot;, appearing in Warren Leight&#x27;s &quot;The Final Interrogation of Ceaucescu&#x27;s Dog&quot; with Jesse Eisenberg, and Mike Reiss&#x27;s &quot;New York Story.&quot; Asner was the voice-over narrator for the 2016 documentary &quot;Behind the Fear: The Hidden Story of HIV&quot;, directed by Nicole Zwiren, a controversial study on the AIDS debate. A 2014 documentary titled &quot;My Friend Ed,&quot; directed by Sharon Baker, focused on the actor&#x27;s life and career. It won Best Short Documentary at the New York City Independent Film Festival. During interviews for a 2019 book on the history of Chicago theater, Asner told the author he preferred to be credited for his work as &quot;Edward&quot; rather than &quot;Ed&quot; because he felt the longer name held the page or screen better.

In 2018, Asner was cast in the Netflix dark comedy, &quot;Dead to Me&quot;, which premiered on May 3, 2019. The series also stars Christina Applegate, Linda Cardellini, and James Marsden. Asner also had a recurring guest role in the 2018–present series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, portraying Johnny Lawrence&#x27;s step-father, Sid Weinberg, in seasons one and three. A memorial tribute to Asner preceded the credits in Cobra Kai season 4, episode 1, &quot;Let&#x27;s Begin&quot;. In 2020 he guest starred in an episode of the eleventh and final season of &quot;Modern Family&quot; and in 2021 played himself in a sketch on &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Real&quot;. The 2019 feature documentary by Kurt Jacobsen and Warren Leming entitled &quot;Ed Asner: On Stage and Off&quot; premiered at the American Documentary Film Festival in Palm Springs, which Asner attended, and since screened at a dozen more festivals, including a European premiere at the Oxford International Film Festival. In 2013, he played Santa in &quot;Christmas on the Bayou&quot;.

Beginning in 2016, Asner took on the role of Holocaust survivor Milton Salesman in Jeff Cohen&#x27;s acclaimed play &quot;The Soap Myth&quot; in a reading at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Bruno Walter Theatre in New York City. He subsequently toured for the next three years in &quot;concert readings&quot; of the play in more than a dozen cities across the United States. In 2019, PBS flagship station WNET filmed the concert reading at New York&#x27;s Center for Jewish History for their All Arts channel. The performance, which is available for free, world-wide live-streaming, co-stars Tovah Feldshuh, Ned Eisenberg, and Liba Vaynberg.

In the week before his death, Asner told his frequent collaborators, Greg Palast and Leni Badpenny, that he soon would be doing three one-act plays.

=== 2021–present: Posthumous releases ===
Asner had completed several roles in a number of TV series and films at the time of his death in August 2021, including three of his final productions released posthumously on the Disney+ streaming service. He returned to reprise his voice role as Carl Fredricksen from the Pixar film &quot;Up&quot; in the Disney+ animated miniseries of shorts &quot;Dug Days&quot; (2021), which was the first to premiere, just three days after his death. Asner&#x27;s cameo appearance as the Ghost of Claude in the Halloween special &quot;Muppets Haunted Mansion&quot; (2021) was posthumous, and he provided the voice of Grandpa Heffley in the Disney+ animated film adaptation &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules&quot; (2022), released over a year after his death. The final short film in the &quot;Dug Days&quot; series, &quot;Carl&#x27;s Date&quot;, which includes Asner&#x27;s recorded voice-over performance as Carl Fredricksen, did not premiere on Disney+, but it was released separately in theaters along with the Pixar animated feature film &quot;Elemental&quot; on June 16, 2023, nearly two years after his death and also served as the finale of the &quot;Up&quot; franchise. These were Asner&#x27;s last acting works overall for Disney and were all dedicated to his memory.

Asner also appeared posthumously in &quot;Deadly Draw&quot; (2023), &quot;A Fargo Christmas Story&quot; (2023), and &quot;Altered Reality&quot; (2024). At least two other projects, which would include Asner&#x27;s final film roles, have yet to announce release dates: &quot;Scarlett&quot; (a television drama film) and &quot;Unplugged&quot; (an animated film).

==Activism==
===Politics===
He played a prominent role in the 1980 SAG strike. He was also active in a variety of other causes, such as the movement to free Mumia Abu-Jamal and the movement to establish California One Care, single-payer health care in California, for which he created a television advertisement. He endorsed Dennis Kucinich in the 2004 United States presidential election, and Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. He was formerly a member of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and was a member of DSOC&#x27;s successor, the Democratic Socialists of America.

The sudden cancellation of &quot;Lou Grant&quot; in 1982 was the subject of much controversy. The show had high ratings, being in the ACNielsen top ten throughout its final month on the air. However, the CBS television network declined to renew it. Asner believed that his left-wing political views, as well as the publicity surrounding them, were the actual root causes for the show&#x27;s cancellation. In 2011, Asner endorsed Democratic candidate Marcy Winograd who finished 4th in the 16-candidate primary behind eventual winner Janice Hahn, in California&#x27;s 36th congressional district special election. From 2011 to 2015, Asner worked with filmmaker Nicole Zwiren on the feature-length documentary &quot;Behind the Fear&quot; which addresses HIV/AIDS denialism. The film was released in 2016 with Asner as the narrator.

Asner endorsed 9/11 conspiracy theories, including voicing qualified support for the 9/11 truth movement. In 2004, he signed a statement released by the group 9/11 Truth that included a call for a new investigation into some elements of the September 11 attacks that he questioned. Asner confirmed his support for the statement in 2009. In April 2004, Asner wrote an open letter to &quot;peace and justice leaders&quot; encouraging them to demand &quot;full 9–11 truth&quot; through the organization &quot;9-11 Visibility Project&quot;. In 2011, Asner hosted the Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth documentary on the collapse of 7 World Trade Center, which endorses the theory that the building was taken down by controlled demolition. Asner also narrated the documentary film &quot;The Oil Factor: Behind the War on Terror&quot;.

===Nonprofit organizations===
Asner was on the Entertainment Board of Directors for The Survivor Mitzvah Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing direct emergency aid to elderly and impoverished Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe. Asner was a member of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, a free speech organization that is dedicated to protecting comic book creators and retailers from prosecutions based on content. He served as an advisor to the Rosenberg Fund for Children, an organization founded by the children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, which provides benefits for the children of political activists, and was a board member for the wildlife conservation organization Defenders of Wildlife. Asner also sat on the advisory board for Exceptional Minds, a non-profit school and a computer animation studio for young adults on the autism spectrum.

Asner was a supporter of Humane Borders, an organization based in Tucson, Arizona, which maintains water stations in the Sonoran Desert for use by undocumented migrants, with the goal of preventing deaths by dehydration and exposure. He was the master of ceremonies at that organization&#x27;s volunteer dinner in fall 2017.

In November 2017, The Ed Asner Family Center was founded by Asner&#x27;s son, Matt, and daughter-in-law, Navah Paskowitz. The Center provides arts and vocational enrichments, counseling services, and support groups and camps to special needs individuals and their families.

=== SAG involvement ===
Asner served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild, in which capacity during the 1980s he opposed United States policy in Central America, working closely with the Alliance for Survival.

On March 30, 2012, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) completed a merger of equals, forming a new union SAG-AFTRA. Asner was adamantly opposed to such a merger, arguing that the planned merger would destroy the SAG&#x27;s health plan and disempower actors. Asner and a group of fellow actors and voice-actors, including Martin Sheen and Ed Harris, filed (but later dropped) a lawsuit against SAG president Ken Howard and several SAG vice presidents, seeking to have the merger overturned and to have the two unions separated to their pre-merger organizations.

=== Community theater ===
In 2021, Asner traveled to Monte Rio, California to support the reopening, revitalization, and shifted focus of the local Monte Rio Theater.

== Personal life and death ==
Asner was married to Nancy Lou Sykes from 1959 to 1988. They had three children, twins Matthew and Liza, and Kate. In 1987, he had a son named Charles with Carol Jean Vogelman. Asner was a parent and a grandparent to autistic children and was involved with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Autism Speaks. He also served as a board member and adviser for Aspiritech, a nonprofit organization that trains high-functioning autistic persons to test software and perform quality-assurance services for companies.

Asner became engaged to producer Cindy Gilmore in 1991. They married on August 2, 1998. Gilmore filed for legal separation on November 7, 2007. Asner filed for divorce in 2015.

Asner died of natural causes at his home in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on August 29, 2021, at the age of 91. He was buried at Sheffield Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri, on September 12.

Numerous celebrities paid tribute to Asner, including Maureen McCormick, George Takei, Mark Hamill, Michael McKean, Bradley Whitford, Josh Gad, Mia Farrow, Andy Richter, Katie Couric, Denis O&#x27;Hare, Mira Sorvino, Eric Stonestreet, Niecy Nash, Yvette Nicole Brown, Michael Moore, Rosario Dawson, Rosanna Arquette, Ben Stiller, The Muppets, William Baldwin, Greg Weisman, William Zabka, Ralph Macchio, Bob Peterson, Bill Farmer, and Zooey Deschanel.

<doc id="594845" wikidata="Q5505949" url="?curid=594845" title="Front vowel">
<text>A front vowel is a class of vowel sounds used in some spoken languages, its defining characteristic being that the highest point of the tongue is positioned approximately as far forward as possible in the mouth without creating a constriction that would otherwise make it a consonant. Front vowels are sometimes also called bright vowels because they are perceived as sounding brighter than the back vowels.

Near-front vowels are essentially a type of front vowel; no language is known to contrast front and near-front vowels based on backness alone.

Rounded front vowels are typically centralized, that is, near-front in their articulation. This is one reason they are written to the right of unrounded front vowels in the IPA vowel chart.

==Partial list==
The front vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* close front unrounded vowel 
* close front compressed vowel 
* near-close front unrounded vowel 
* near-close front compressed vowel 
* close-mid front unrounded vowel 
* close-mid front compressed vowel 
* open-mid front unrounded vowel 
* open-mid front compressed vowel 
* near-open front unrounded vowel 
* open front unrounded vowel 
* open front rounded vowel 

There also are front vowels without dedicated symbols in the IPA:

* close front protruded vowel 
* near-close front protruded vowel 
* close-mid front protruded vowel 
* mid front unrounded vowel or 
* mid front compressed vowel or 
* mid front protruded vowel or 
* open-mid front protruded vowel 

As above, other front vowels can be indicated with diacritics of relative articulation applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as , or for a near-close front unrounded vowel.

==Articulatorily fronted vowels==

In articulation, fronted vowels, where the tongue moves forward from its resting position, contrast with raised vowels and retracted vowels. In this conception, fronted vowels are a broader category than those listed in the IPA chart, including , , and, marginally, mid-central vowels. Within the fronted vowels, vowel height (open or close) is determined by the position of the jaw, not by the tongue directly. Phonemic raised and retracted vowels may be phonetically fronted by certain consonants, such as palatals and in some languages pharyngeals. For example, may be fronted to next to or .

==Effect on preceding consonant==

In the history of many languages, for example French and Japanese, front vowels have altered preceding velar or alveolar consonants, bringing their place of articulation towards palatal or postalveolar. This change can be allophonic variation, or it can have become phonemic.

This historical palatalization is reflected in the orthographies of several European languages, including the and of almost all Romance languages, the and in Norwegian, Swedish, Faroese and Icelandic, and the , and in Greek. English follows the French pattern, but without as much regularity.
However, for native or early borrowed words affected by palatalization, English has generally altered the spelling after the pronunciation (Examples include &quot;cheap, church, cheese, churn&quot; from , and &quot;yell, yarn, yearn, yeast&quot; from .)
== Occurrences ==

According to PHOIBLE, // is the most common phonemic front vowel, occurring in around 92% of inventories, while // is the least common, occurring in only one inventory on the database.

<text>Gilbert Shelton (born May 31, 1940) is an American cartoonist and a key member of the underground comix movement. He is the creator of the iconic underground characters &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;, &quot;Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Wart-Hog&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Shelton was born in Dallas, Texas, on May 31, 1940. His father, George Shelton, worked for Firestone, which moved the family around the southeast during the 1940s. They settled in Houston, Texas, where he graduated from Lamar High School. He attended Washington and Lee University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in the social sciences in 1961. His early cartoons were published in the University of Texas humor magazine &quot;The Texas Ranger&quot;.

=== Early career ===
Directly after graduation, Shelton moved to New York City and got a job editing automotive magazines, where he would sneak his drawings into print. Early work of his was published in Warren Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; The idea for the character of &quot;Wonder Wart-Hog&quot;, a porcine parody of Superman, came to him in 1961. The following year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get a student deferment from the draft. The first two &quot;Wonder Wart-Hog&quot; stories appeared in &quot;Bacchanal&quot;, a short-lived college humor magazine, in the spring of 1962. That same year, he published (in zine form) Frank Stack&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Jesus&quot;, one of the first underground comix; Stack wrote and drew the comic strip under the name Foolbert Sturgeon.

Shelton then became editor of &quot;The Texas Ranger&quot; and published more &quot;Wonder Wart-Hog&quot; stories.

After switching from graduate school to art school (where he befriended singer Janis Joplin) for two years, he was finally drafted, but Army doctors declared him medically unfit after he admitted to taking psychedelic drugs. After this, in 1964 and 1965, he spent some time in Cleveland, where his girlfriend Pat Brown (another UT alum) was studying at the Cleveland Institute of Art. He applied for a job at the Cleveland-based American Greeting Card Company (where a fellow underground comic artist Robert Crumb had worked) but was turned down.

The period of 1965–1968 was an itinerant one for Shelton: he moved to New York to work for the underground paper &quot;East Village Other&quot;, and to Los Angeles to work for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;. Then Shelton became art director for the Vulcan Gas Company, a rock music venue in Austin, Texas, where he worked with Jim Franklin. He created a number of posters in the style of contemporary California poster artists such as Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. After a year of this, he moved to San Francisco in 1968, hopeful that being closer to the action would enable him to do more poster work.

That same year, Millar Publishing Company, who had been publishing regular Wonder Wart-Hog stories since 1966, published two issues of &quot;Wonder Wart-Hog&quot;. 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine, and only 40,000 of each were sold.

=== Underground comix star ===
Also in 1968 Shelton self-published &quot;Feds &#x27;n&#x27; Heads&quot;, a collection of strips first published in the Austin underground paper &quot;The Rag&quot;. The comic featured Wonder Wart-Hog and what became his most famous strip, &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;. The first edition of &quot;Feds &#x27;N&#x27; Heads&quot; was hand-collated, folded, and stapled by Shelton in his garage, with an initial print run of 5,000 copies; it proved so popular that it was later re-issued multiple times by the San Francisco-based publisher the Print Mint, selling over 200,000 total copies by 1980.

In 1969, Shelton co-founded Rip Off Press with three fellow &quot;expatriate&quot; Texans: Fred Todd, Dave Moriaty, and cartoonist Jack Jackson. Rip Off Comix published 13 issues of &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; comic from 1971 to 1997, with many issues undergoing multiple printings. Shelton created a spin-off strip, &quot;Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot;, in 1969.

During this period, Shelton was also a regular contributor to &quot;Zap Comix&quot; and other underground titles, including &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;, &quot;Yellow Dog&quot;, &quot;Arcade&quot;, &quot;The Rip Off Review of Western Culture&quot;, and &quot;Anarchy Comics&quot;. Along with R. Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, &quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez, and two artists with reputations as psychedelic poster designers, Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin, Shelton became part of the &quot;&quot;Zap&quot; collective,&quot; which remained mostly constant throughout the nearly 50-year history of &quot;Zap.&quot;

In the 1970s, Shelton managed the Rip Off Press Syndicate, which sold weekly content, including Shelton&#x27;s own strips, to alternative newspapers and student publications. Much of the material produced for the syndicate was eventually published in the company&#x27;s long-running anthology &quot;Rip Off Comix&quot;, which had debuted in 1977.

Shelton designed the cover art for the 1973 album &quot;Doug Sahm and Band&quot;, as well as The Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;.

He also illustrated the cover of the early classic computer magazine compilation &quot;The Best of Creative Computing Volume 2&quot; in 1977.

In 1979, Universal Studios paid Shelton and Rip Off Press $250,000 for the rights to make a live-action &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; film. Shelton used his share (which was the bulk of the money) to finance repeated trips to Europe, and to eventually settle down in France. Meanwhile, the Universal-produced &quot;Freak Brothers&quot; film never made it to production.

=== Later work ===
Shelton&#x27;s &quot;Not Quite Dead&quot;, done in collaboration with French cartoonist Pic, appeared in &quot;Rip Off Comix&quot; #25 (Winter 1989) and in six &quot;Not Quite Dead&quot; comic books (1993–1996).

A new Wonder Wart-Hog story appeared in &quot;Zap Comix&quot; #15 (Last Gasp, 2005), as well as &quot;The Complete Zap&quot; boxed set (Fantagraphics, 2014) which contained &quot;Zap&quot; #16; and a new &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; story appeared in &quot;Zap&quot; #16 as well.

&quot;Fifty Freakin&#x27; Years with the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; was published in 2017 by Knockabout Comics. It contains new strips by Shelton, as well as his written introduction.

== Music ==
In 1966 Shelton formed the Gilbert Shelton Ensemble and released a 45 record on ESP Records, &quot;If I Was A Hells Angel,&quot; b/w &quot;Southern Stock Car Man,&quot; backed by members of the Austin psychedelic rock band The Conqueroo, consisting of Tom Bright, Bob Brown and Ed Guinn.

Since moving to France, Shelton has become part of a rhythm and blues group, the Blum Brothers, featuring Shelton on vocals and piano. The band features fellow cartoonist musician Bruno Blum on vocals and guitar. A Blum-produced album was recorded but not released. The Blum Brothers played at the Jockomo, a New Orleans-style bar in the 11th arrondissement of Paris.

== Personal life ==
Shelton and his wife, literary agent Lora Fountain, left San Francisco in 1979. They were residents of Barcelona, (Catalonia, Spain) in 1980–1981, and moved to France in 1984.

There have been several attempts to film Shelton&#x27;s Freak Brothers characters and over the years several film rights options have been taken on his work. None went to production. In 1978, the unauthorized pornographic film &quot;Up in Flames&quot; was released, which &quot;ripped off the Freak Brothers [and R. Crumb&#x27;s] Mr. Natural all in one go.&quot;

It was reported that Universal&#x27;s acquisition of the Freak Brothers film rights in 1979 was in order to prevent competition against the Cheech &amp; Chong franchise. Although a script was written, the film was never made.

At one point, the Freak Brothers&#x27; antics were reportedly being turned into a Broadway musical after a stop motion animated film, titled &quot;Grass Roots&quot; and produced by Celluloid Dreams, fell through..

Finally, in 2021, an animated series called &quot;Freak Brothers&quot; featuring the voices of Pete Davidson, John Goodman and Woody Harrelson, premiered on the streaming service Tubi. It was renewed for a second season, which began in June 2023.

=== Music ===
==== &quot;Set My Chickens Free&quot; ====
Shelton&#x27;s strip &quot;Set My Chickens Free,&quot; published in issue #1 of the &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot; comic (1968) has been used in multiple music projects:
* In 1969, the words were set to music by The Hub City Movers and recorded as &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;; re-released in 1983 as &quot;Set Your Chickens Free&quot;.
* In David Carradine&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Grasshopper&quot; (and 1976 single &quot;Cosmic Joke&quot;), he uses the words in &quot;Chicken Song.&quot;
* In 1994, Merle Haggard used the words in his song &quot;Set My Chickens Free,&quot; released on his studio album &quot;1994&quot;.

=== Literature ===
Shelton&#x27;s &quot;Set My Chickens Free&quot; cartoon was also published on page 128 of Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Steal This Book&quot; (1971), illustrating its third section, &quot;Liberate!&quot;

<text>A central vowel, formerly also known as a mixed vowel, is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a central vowel is that the tongue is positioned approximately halfway between a front vowel and a back vowel. (In practice, unrounded central vowels tend to be further forward and rounded central vowels further back.)

==List==
The central vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* close central unrounded vowel 
* close central protruded vowel 
* close-mid central unrounded vowel (older publications may use )
* close-mid central rounded vowel (older publications may use )
* mid central vowel with ambiguous rounding 
* open-mid central unrounded vowel (older publications may use )
* open-mid central rounded vowel (older publications may use )
* near-open central vowel with ambiguous rounding (typically used for an unrounded vowel; if precision is desired, may be used for an unrounded vowel and for a rounded vowel)

There also are central vowels that do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA:
* close central compressed vowel 
* near-close central unrounded vowel , , or (unofficial symbol: )
* near-close central protruded vowel , , or (unofficial symbol: )
* near-close central compressed vowel 
* mid central unrounded vowel or (commonly written )
* mid central protruded vowel or (commonly written as if it were close-mid)
* mid central compressed vowel 
* open central unrounded vowel (commonly written as if it were front)
* open central rounded vowel

<text>A back vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a back vowel is that the highest point of the tongue is positioned relatively back in the mouth without creating a constriction that would be classified as a consonant. Back vowels are sometimes also called dark vowels because they are perceived as sounding darker than the front vowels.

Near-back vowels are essentially a type of back vowels; no language is known to contrast back and near-back vowels based on backness alone.

The category &quot;back vowel&quot; comprises both raised vowels and retracted vowels.

==Articulation==
In their articulation, back vowels do not form a single category, but may be either raised vowels such as or retracted vowels such as .

==Partial list==
The back vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* close back unrounded vowel 
* close back protruded vowel 
* near-close back protruded vowel 
* close-mid back unrounded vowel 
* close-mid back protruded vowel 
* open-mid back unrounded vowel 
* open-mid back rounded vowel 
* open back unrounded vowel 
* open back rounded vowel 

There also are back vowels that do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA:

* close back compressed vowel or 
* near-close back unrounded vowel or 
* near-close back compressed vowel or 
* close-mid back compressed vowel or 
* mid back unrounded vowel or 
* mid back rounded vowel or 

As here, other back vowels can be transcribed with diacritics of relative articulation applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as , or for a near-close back rounded vowel.

==Occurrence==

According to PHOIBLE, the most common phonemic back vowel is //, occurring in approximately 88% of languages, while the most uncommon phonemic back vowel is //, occurring in only 2% of recorded inventories.

<doc id="594856" wikidata="Q1045948" url="?curid=594856" title="Carterton, New Zealand">
<text>Carterton () is a small town in the Wellington Region of New Zealand and the seat of the Carterton District (a territorial authority or local government district). It lies in a farming area of the Wairarapa in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located southwest of Masterton and northeast of Wellington. The town has a population of ), out of a total district population of .

Carterton was founded in 1857. Originally known as &quot;Three Mile Bush&quot;, it served as housing for workers building the road between Wellington and Masterton. It was later renamed after Charles Carter, who was in charge of the building of the Black Bridge over the Waiohine River south of the town. The town describes itself as New Zealand&#x27;s daffodil capital, holding a Daffodil Festival each year on the second Sunday in September, with the main event taking place at Middle Run along Gladstone Road.

==History==

Carterton was the first place in the world to elect a transgender mayor, Georgina Beyer. Beyer went on to set another world&#x27;s first record, becoming the MP for the Wairarapa electorate in 1999.

On 7 January 2012, a hot air balloon crashed just north of the town, killing eleven people and making headlines around the world. The balloon came into contact with a high-voltage power line supplying the town, resulting in the balloon catching fire and the town losing power briefly. In 1956, along with Masterton, Carterton became the joint first town in New Zealand to use the 111 Emergency Number.

==Landmarks==
Carterton&#x27;s town clock is located on High Street next to the post office. The existing tower was put into operation in September 1962, replacing the original clock tower atop the post office that was damaged in the 24 June 1942 Wairarapa earthquake.

The Bank of New South Wales, showing confidence in Carterton, built a beautifully ornate bank building on the corner of Park Road and High Street North in 1912. This building is listed in the historic buildings list found in the Wairarapa Combined District Plan. In 1982, the Bank of New South Wales became Westpac and continued to occupy the building until a devastating earthquake in Christchurch (6.3 on the Richter scale) severely damaged many unreinforced masonry buildings in February 2011. After an unfavourable engineers&#x27; assessment the bank shifted out of the building approximately 150 metres south in High Street North. The building underwent substantial seismic strengthening and re-opened as the Carterton Free Presbyterian Church in July 2017.

Historic Carterton railway station is located west of the town centre off Belvedere Road. The station building at the station is original, having been built when the railway opened in 1880, and has accepted passenger services ever since. It is currently leased from KiwiRail Network by the Wairarapa Railway Restoration Society.

The Carterton District library was established in 1874 and is one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest public libraries. The library building, built in 1881, on Holloway Street is the oldest purpose built library in the country.

The Carterton Events Centre is also on Holloway Street. Opened in October 2011, this state-of-the-art, multi-purpose community facility is available for community and commercial use. Centrally located in the Wairarapa region, the Centre provides modern, flexible, spaces for all manner of events, shows, exhibitions, meetings and community gatherings. Interconnection of spaces throughout the Centre allows for separation and opening up of spaces to cater for different needs. The Events Centre belongs to the Carterton community, through the Carterton District Council.

Carterton&#x27;s Memorial Square is on the corner of High Street and Park Road and holds Carterton&#x27;s World War One memorial, positioned centrally. The red granite pillar, apparently broken off at the top, symbolising the lives cut short by the war. The memorial was unveiled on 13 February 1921 by Minister of Internal Affairs George Anderson. Since the 1930s, Memorial Square has been administered under an act of parliament – the Carterton and District Memorial Square Act (1932).

On Sundays, from 22 February 2015, the Square began to host Carterton Farmers&#x27; Market. This weekly produce and craft event was born of the 2014 Place Making Carterton project, initiated by the Carterton District Business (Inc) group and Carterton District Council.

Located 10 minutes from the Square is Stonehenge Aotearoa, built by members of The Phoenix Astronomy Society, it is a modern adaptation (opened in 2005) of the Stonehenge ruins on the Salisbury Plain of England.

It has a roll of students as of It was founded as a private school in 1978 and was originally sited at Ponatahi, southwest of Carterton. The school moved to its current site over the 1996–97 summer holidays, and integrated into the state education system in April 1998.

<doc id="594857" wikidata="Q956444" url="?curid=594857" title="Sanctification in Christianity">
<text>In Christianity, sanctification (or in its verb form, sanctify) literally means &quot;to set apart for special use or purpose&quot;, that is, to make holy or sacred (compare ). Therefore, sanctification refers to the state or process of being set apart, i.e. &quot;made holy&quot;, as a vessel, full of the Holy Spirit. The term can be used to refer to objects which are set apart for special purposes, but the most common use within Christian theology is in reference to the change brought about by God in a believer, begun at the point of salvation and continuing throughout the life of the believer. Many forms of Christianity believe that this process will only be completed in Heaven, but some (particularly conservative Quaker and Methodist traditions, inclusive of the Holiness movement) believe that entire sanctification is possible in this life.

==Roman Catholicism==
The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that:
Saint Paul of the Cross stated that &quot;Prayer, good reading, the frequent reception of the sacraments, with the proper dispositions, and particularly the flight of idleness—these are, believe me, the means of sanctifying yourself.&quot;

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; &quot;sanctity&quot; differs for God, individual, and corporate body. For God, it is God&#x27;s unique absolute moral perfection. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine gift. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church&#x27;s holiness is beyond human power, beyond natural power.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==

Orthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis, whereby humans take on divine properties, and in a particular sense, participate in the being of God. A key scripture supporting this is . In the 4th century, Athanasius of Alexandria taught that God became Man that man might become God. Essentially, man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This Church&#x27;s version of salvation restores the likeness of God in man. One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.

==Lutheranism==
Martin Luther taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather believers together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.

Luther also viewed the Ten Commandments as means by which the Holy Spirit sanctifies. &quot;Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a commend of divine doctrine, as to what we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God, and the true fountain and channel from and in which everything must arise and flow that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten Commandments no work or thing can be good or pleasing to God, however great or precious it be in the eyes of the world...whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, angelic man, far above all holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with them, and try your best, apply all power and ability, and you will find so much to do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or holiness.&quot;

Pietistic Lutheranism heavily emphasizes the &quot;biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification.&quot;

==Anabaptism==
Anabaptist belief emphasizes that sanctification is initiated by being born again by the Spirit of God and then practiced by following or being a disciple of Christ. The role of the Spirit, Word of God, suffering, self-denial as well as the community of believers in sanctification is also considered essential. Sanctification is believed to be a process that begins with conversion and continues throughout the Christian life. Perfectionism or eradication of the flesh is rejected and it is considered necessary to take up the cross and deny yourself daily to truly be a disciple of Christ. When a believer steps out of the sanctification process, his salvation is seen as jeopardized. Sanctification is seen as mortifying the deeds of the flesh, cleansing impure motives and thoughts of the mind and heart as well as glorifying the Father through worship, obedience and faith working in love.

==Anglicanism==
A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that “there is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies”. A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: “Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God&#x27;s work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.” Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception.

The 16th century Anglican theologian Richard Hooker (1554–1600) distinguished between the “righteousness of justification” that is imputed by God and the “righteousness of sanctification” that comprises the works one does as an “inevitable” result of being justified.

Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are “two steps in a long process”.

A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are “inseparable”. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is “found in Christ&#x27;s work alone”. “Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.”

==Baptist==
Baptists believe in progressive sanctification, the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth.

==Reformed==
It is not clear that John Calvin, in his &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion,&quot; conceives of sanctification as a doctrine separate from justification. There is no separate treatment there of a doctrine of sanctification. Instead, the clearest references he makes to the process of the Christian&#x27;s growth in holiness appear in Book III of the Institutes, which concerns the work of the Holy Spirit. There he intermixes the grace by which justification is accomplished and the grace that empowers the Christian toward moral reform. Following Augustine, Calvin embraces a non-perfectionist account of sanctification as progressive but incomplete until eschatological consummation:&quot;I insist not that the life of the Christian shall breathe nothing but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be desired, and ought to be attempted. I insist not so strictly on evangelical perfection, as to refuse to acknowledge as a Christian any man who has not attained it. In this way all would be excluded from the church, since there is no man who is not far removed from this perfection, while many, who have made but little progress, would be undeservedly rejected.&quot; Against those who &quot;maintain the perfection of holiness in the present life,&quot; Calvin replies:&quot;...we deem it sufficient briefly to reply with Augustine, that the goal to which all the pious ought to aspire is, to appear in the presence of God without spot or blemish; but as the course of the present life is at best nothing more than progress, we shall never reach the goal until we have laid aside the body of sin, and been completely united to the Lord.&quot; But the imperfection of sanctification in this life is not, for Calvin, an excuse for slackness in the search thereof. The grace of justification is not separable from the grace that makes one perform good works and the grace that perfects what is deficient in the works of the regenerate:“Justification, moreover, we thus define: the sinner being admitted into communion with Christ is, for his sake, reconciled to God; when purged by his blood he obtains the remission of sins, and clothed with righteousness, just as if it were his own, stands secure before the judgment seat of heaven. Forgiveness of sins being previously given, the good works which follow have a value different from their merit, because whatever is imperfect in them is covered by the perfection of Christ, and all their blemishes and pollutions are wiped away by his purity, so as never to come under the cognizance of the divine tribunal. The guilt of all transgressions, by which men are prevented from offering God an acceptable service, being thus effaced, and the imperfection which is wont to sully even good works being buried, the good works which are done by believers are deemed righteous, or, which is the same thing, are imputed for righteousness.” 

==Methodism==
In Wesleyan–Arminian theology, which is upheld by the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the holiness movement), Methodism teaches that sanctification has three components—initial, progressive, and entire:

As such, &quot;sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the new birth&quot;. With the Grace of God, Methodists &quot;do works of piety and mercy, and these works reflect the power of sanctification&quot;. Examples of these means of grace (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion (work of piety), and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy). Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. As such, in &quot;sanctification one grows to be more like Christ.&quot; This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth (first work of grace) has its goal as Christian perfection, otherwise known as entire sanctification (second work of grace), which John Wesley, the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart &quot;habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor&quot; and as &quot;having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked&quot;. To John Wesley the work of entire sanctification was distinctly separate from regeneration, and was &quot;wrought instantaneously, though it may be approached by slow and gradual steps.&quot; A more complete statement of Wesley&#x27;s position goes like this:&quot;It is that habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, &#x27;from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;&#x27; and, by consequence, the being endued with those virtues which were also in Christ Jesus; the being so &#x27;renewed in the spirit of our mind,&#x27; as to be &#x27;perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.&#x27;&quot;This is the doctrine that by the power of God&#x27;s sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion: 

Terming the experience of entire sanctification the baptism of the Holy Spirit, John William Fletcher, the systematic theologian of Methodism, emphasized that the experience of entire sanctification through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit cleanses the believer from original sin and empowers the believer for service to God.

Justification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God&#x27;s holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it. A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14: &quot;Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.&quot; The importance of &quot;growth in grace&quot;, according to Methodist doctrine, is important before and after entire sanctification:

In the same vein, in addition to entire sanctification, the Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association affirms a belief in &quot;the progressive growth in grace toward Christian maturity through a consistent Christian life of faith and good works.&quot;

Wesleyan theology teaches that the state of entire sanctification can be lost through willful sin:

If a person backslides but later decides to return to God, he or she must confess his or her sins and be entirely sanctified again (see conditional security).

John Wesley taught outward holiness as an expression of &quot;inward transformation&quot; and theologians in the Wesleyan/Methodist tradition have noted that the observance of standards of dress and behaviour should follow the new birth as an act of obedience to God.

==Pentecostalism==
There are two Pentecostal positions on sanctification, entire sanctification and progressive sanctification.

Entire sanctification as a second work of grace, is the position of Pentecostal denominations that originally had their roots in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, such as Apostolic Faith Church, Calvary Holiness Association, International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland) and Church of God in Christ. These denominations differ from the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the Holiness Movement) in that they teach the possibility of a third work of grace—glossolalia.

Progressive sanctification is the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth. This is the position of other Pentecostal denominations, such as Assemblies of God and The Foursquare Church.

==Quakerism==
George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, taught Christian perfection, also known in the Friends tradition as &quot;Perfectionism&quot;, in which the Christian believer could be made free from sin. In his &quot;Some Principles of the Elect People of God Who in Scorn are called Quakers, for all the People throughout all Christendome to Read over, and thereby their own States to Consider&quot;, he writes in section &quot;XVI. Concerning Perfection&quot;:
The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and &quot;focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith&quot;. George Fox emphasized &quot;personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin&quot; in his teaching on perfectionism. For the Christian, &quot;perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world&quot;.

Some Quaker denominations were founded to emphasize this teaching, such as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends.

==Keswickianism==
Keswickian theology, which emerged in the Higher Life Movement, teaches a second work of grace that occurs through &quot;surrender and faith&quot;, in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctification is viewed as a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ&#x27;s matchless grace. To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy. In the Church&#x27;s scriptural canon, one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3:35, in the Book of Mormon: Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, also expounded on the meaning of sanctity.

<text>&#x27; (WEL; &quot;World Ice Theory&quot; or &quot;World Ice Doctrine&quot;), also known as &#x27; (&quot;Glacial Cosmogony&quot;), is a discredited cosmological concept proposed by Hanns Hörbiger, an Austrian engineer and inventor. According to his ideas, ice was the basic substance of all cosmic processes, and ice moons, ice planets, and the &quot;global ether&quot; (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe. Hörbiger did not arrive at his ideas through research, but said that he had received it in a &quot;vision&quot; in 1894. He published a book about the theory in 1912 and heavily promoted it in subsequent years, through lectures, magazines and associations.

==History==

By his own account, Hörbiger was observing the Moon when he was struck by the notion that the brightness and roughness of its surface were due to ice. Shortly after, he dreamt that he was floating in space watching the swinging of a pendulum which grew longer and longer until it broke. &quot;I knew that Newton had been wrong and that the sun&#x27;s gravitational pull ceases to exist at three times the distance of Neptune&quot;, he concluded. He worked out his concepts in collaboration with amateur astronomer and schoolteacher Philipp Fauth whom he met in 1898, and published it as in 1912. Fauth had previously produced a large (if somewhat inaccurate) lunar map and had a considerable following, which lent Hörbiger&#x27;s ideas some respectability.

It did not receive a great deal of attention at the time, but following World War I Hörbiger changed his strategy by promoting the new &quot;cosmic truth&quot; not only to people at universities and academies, but also to the general public. Hörbiger thought that if &quot;the masses&quot; accepted his ideas, then they might put enough pressure on the academic establishment to force his ideas into the mainstream. No effort was spared in popularising the ideas: &quot;cosmotechnical&quot; societies were founded, which offered public lectures that attracted large audiences, there were cosmic ice movies and radio programs, and even cosmic ice journals and novels.

During this period, the name was changed from the Graeco-Latin to the Germanic [WEL] (&quot;World ice theory&quot;). The followers of WEL exerted a great deal of public pressure on behalf of the ideas. The movement published posters, pamphlets, books, and even a newspaper &quot;The Key to World Events&quot;. Companies owned by adherents would only hire people who declared themselves convinced of the WEL&#x27;s truth. Some followers even attended astronomical meetings to heckle, shouting, &quot;Out with astronomical orthodoxy! Give us Hörbiger!&quot;

Supporters of the idea were Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the leading theorist behind the early development of the National Socialist Party in Germany in 1923, and later both Hitler and Himmler. Esoteric and pseudo-scientific views were quite popular among the Nazi elite at the time, and WEL appealed to them because it represented a &quot;Germanic&quot; all-encompassing alternative to a natural science viewed as Jewish and soulless. 

Despite Hitler&#x27;s claim that the WEL constituted an &quot;Aryan&quot; theory, a number of Jewish intellectuals supported the theory: for example, Viennese author Egon Friedell, who explained the World Ice Theory in his 1930 &quot;Cultural History of the Modern Age&quot;. Hans Schindler Bellamy, a Jewish member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, was also a proponent. He continued to advocate the viewpoint after he had fled Vienna following the Anschluss. On the left wing Raoul Hausmann also supported the theory, and corresponded with Hörbiger. 

Two organizations were set up in Vienna concerned with the idea: the and the &quot;Hörbiger Institute&quot;. The first was formed in 1921 by a group of enthusiastic adherents of the idea, which included engineers, physicians, civil servants, and businessmen. Most had been personally acquainted with Hörbiger and had attended his many lectures.

==Premise==
According to the idea, the solar system had its origin in a gigantic star into which a smaller, dead, waterlogged star fell. This impact caused a huge explosion that flung fragments of the smaller star out into interstellar space where the water condensed and froze into giant blocks of ice. A ring of such blocks formed, that we now call the Milky Way, as well as a number of solar systems among which was our own, but with many more planets than currently exist.

Interplanetary space is filled with traces of hydrogen gas, which cause the planets to slowly spiral inwards, along with ice blocks. The outer planets are large mainly because they have swallowed a large number of ice blocks, but the inner planets have not swallowed nearly as many. One can see ice blocks on the move in the form of meteors, and when one collides with Earth, it produces hailstorms over an area of many square kilometers, while when one falls into the Sun, it produces a sunspot and gets vaporized, making &quot;fine ice&quot;, that covers the innermost planets.

It was also claimed that Earth had had several satellites before it acquired the Moon; they began as planets in orbits of their own, but over long spans of time were captured one by one and slowly spiralled in towards Earth until they disintegrated and their debris became part of Earth&#x27;s structure. One can supposedly identify the rock strata of several geological eras with the impacts of these satellites. It was believed that the destruction of earlier ice-moons were responsible for the Flood.

The last such impact, of the &quot;Tertiary&quot; or &quot;Cenozoic Moon&quot; and the capture of our present Moon, is supposedly remembered through myths and legends. This was worked out in detail by Hörbiger&#x27;s English follower Hans Schindler Bellamy; Bellamy recounted how as a child he would often dream about a large moon that would spiral closer and closer in until it burst, making the ground beneath roll and pitch, awakening him and giving him a very sick feeling. When he looked at the Moon&#x27;s surface through a telescope, he found its surface looking troublingly familiar. When he learned of Hörbiger&#x27;s idea in 1921, he found it a description of his dream. He explained the mythological support he found in such books as &quot;Moons, Myths, and Man&quot;, &quot;In the Beginning God&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Revelation is History&quot;. It was believed that our current Moon was the sixth since Earth began and that a new collision was inevitable. Believers argued that the great flood described in the Bible and the destruction of Atlantis were caused by the fall of previous moons.

Hörbiger had various responses to the criticism that he received. If it was pointed out to him that his assertions did not work mathematically, he responded: &quot;Calculation can only lead you astray.&quot; If it was pointed out that there existed photographic evidence that the Milky Way was composed of millions of stars, he responded that the pictures had been faked by &quot;reactionary&quot; astronomers. He responded in a similar way when it was pointed out that the surface temperature of the Moon had been measured in excess of 100 °C in the daytime, writing to rocket expert Willy Ley: &quot;Either you believe in me and learn, or you will be treated as the enemy.&quot;

Astronomers generally dismissed his views and the following they acquired as a &quot;carnival&quot;. As Martin Gardner argued in Chapter Three of his &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;, Hörbiger&#x27;s ideas have much in common with those of Immanuel Velikovsky.

<text>Nagapattinam (&quot;nākappaṭṭinam&quot;, previously spelt Nagapatnam or Negapatam) is a town in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the administrative headquarters of Nagapattinam district. The town came to prominence during the period of Medieval Cholas (9th–12th century CE) and served as their important port for commerce and east-bound naval expeditions. The Chudamani Vihara in Nagapattinam constructed by the Srivijayan king Sri Mara Vijayattungavarman of the Sailendra dynasty with the help of Rajaraja Chola I was an important Buddhist structure in those times. Nagapattinam was settled by the Portuguese and, later, the Dutch under whom it served as the capital of Dutch Coromandel from 1660 to 1781. In November 1781, the town was conquered by the British East India Company. It served as the capital of Tanjore district from 1799 to 1845 under Madras Presidency of the British. It continued to be a part of Thanjavur district in Independent India. In 1991, it was made the headquarters of the newly created Nagapattinam District. Nagapattinam is administered by a Special grade municipality covering an area of and had a population of 102,905 as of 2011.

A majority of the people of Nagapattinam are employed in sea-borne trading, fishing, agriculture and tourism. Kayarohanaswami Temple and Soundararajaperumal Temple, Nagapattinam are the major Hindu pilgrimage sites. Nagapattinam is the base for tourism for Sikkal, Velankanni, Poompuhar, Kodiakkarai, Vedaranyam, and Tharangambadi. Roadways is the major mode of transport to Nagapattinam, while the city also has rail and sea transport.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nagapattinam&quot; is derived from &quot;Nagar&quot; referring to people from Sri Lanka who settled here and &quot;pattinam&quot; referring to town. It was also called &quot;CholakulaVallipattinam&quot; during the period of Kulottunga I, named after one of his queens, when it was one of the important ports. Ptolemy refers to Nagapattinam as Nikam and mentions it as one of the most important trade centres of the ancient Tamil country. This view is doubtful as there are no contemporary evidences to prove the existence of a metropolis in the name of &quot;Nikama&quot; or &quot;Nikam&quot;. Nagapattinam was referred by early writers and the Portuguese as &quot;the city of Coromandel&quot;. Appar and Tirugnanasambandar, the 7th-century saint poets refer to the city as &quot;Nagai&quot; in their verses in &quot;Tevaram&quot;. The town was originally called &quot;Nagai&quot; and the word &quot;Pattinam&quot; was attached during the Chola era when it emerged as an important port.

==History==
There are urn burials in and around the city from the Sangam period indicating some level of human habitation. Except the mention in Ptolemy as &#x27;Νίγαμα Μετρόπολις,&#x27; there are no direct references to Nagapattinam during the 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE). The neighbouring port, Kaveripoompattinam (modern day Poompuhar), was the capital of the Chola kingdom of the Sangam Age, referred to widely in Tamil scriptures such as &quot;Paṭṭiṉappālai&quot;.

The Soundarajaperumal temple finds a mention in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; in the Utharkanda Gyana Yoga section. The temple is revered in &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;, the 5th to 9th century CE Vaishnava canon, by Alvars. It is considered one of the important temples visited by Thirumangai Alvar. The Alvar has sung praise, imagining himself as a lady and Soundaraja as his lover. The temple is classified as a &quot;Divya Desam&quot;, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book.

The early works of &quot;Tevaram&quot; by the 7th-century poets Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mention the town had fortified walls, busy road building and a busy port. The inscriptions from the Kayarohanswami temple indicate the construction was initiated during the reign of the Pallava king, Narasimha Pallava II (691–729 CE).

<text>Peter Alexander Goehr (; 10 August 1932 – 26 August 2024) was a German-born English composer of contemporary classical music and academic teacher. A long-time professor of music at the University of Cambridge, Goehr influenced many notable contemporary composers, including Thomas Adès, Julian Anderson, George Benjamin and Robin Holloway.

Born in Berlin, Goehr grew up in London surrounded by musicians, including his father, the conductor Walter Goehr. Goehr emerged as a central figure in the Manchester School of post-war British composers, including Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle, in his early twenties. He joined Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s masterclass in Paris in 1955. Back in England and working for the BBC, he experienced an international breakthrough in 1957 with his cantata &quot;The Deluge&quot; in 1957, conducted by his father Walter Goehr. He composed &quot;Little Symphony&quot; in 1963 as a memorial to his father, arriving at a serialism that allowed expressive freedom. He combined avant-garde techniques with elements from music history in works of many genres including the Piano Trio (1966), his first opera, &quot;Arden Must Die&quot; (1966), the music-theatre piece &quot;Triptych&quot; (1968–1970), the orchestral &quot;Metamorphosis/Dance&quot; (1974), and the String Quartet No. 3 (1975). He founded the Music Theatre Ensemble in 1967.

Goehr first lectured in the United States, at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston from 1968 and at Yale University, then at the Southampton University from 1970. He was professor of music at the University of Leeds from 1971 and at Cambridge University from 1976 to 1999. Goehr returned to a more traditional way of composing with &quot;Psalm IV&quot; in 1976. He wrote the opera &quot;Arianna&quot; in 1995, setting the libretto of Monteverdi&#x27;s lost opera. He focused on chamber music in later years.

== Life and career ==
=== Youth and studies ===
Peter Alexander Goehr was born in Berlin, on 10 August 1932. He came from a musical Jewish family; his mother Laelia (née Rivlin), from Kyiv, was a pianist who had appeared with Vladimir Horowitz at age 12, and his father Walter Goehr was a Schoenberg pupil and pioneering conductor of Schoenberg, Messiaen and Monteverdi. The family moved to Britain a few months after the boy was born. His father became an influential conductor in London, leading the world premiere of Tippett&#x27;s &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;. The boy attended Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire, where he was known as &quot;an anti-establishment political activist, flirting with the Communist Party&quot;. He received lessons from a composer colleague of his father, Allan Gray. Although these premises pointed to Goehr&#x27;s future in music, his efforts as a composer were not encouraged by his father.

Goehr worked for the music publisher Schott after leaving school. A girl he met on the train to work recruited him for a left-wing Zionist party, and he spent two years in a training kibbutz in Essex. He was then sent to Manchester for political work, where he wrote his first piece, described as &quot;a sort of Zionist pageant with songs&quot;.

Goehr studied composition at the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1952 to 1955, with Richard Hall. He became friends there with Peter Maxwell Davies, Harrison Birtwistle, trumpeter Elgar Howarth and pianist John Ogdon. He influenced Davies, a clarinetist, and Birtwhistle who studied to teach, to focus on composition. As students, the five founded the New Music Manchester Group, which performed works by its members and also introduced compositions of the European avant-garde. In 2024, Andrew Davies described the group as a &quot;distinctive, progressive force in what was the generally parochial and conservative world of British music in the early 1950s&quot;.

A seminal event in Goehr&#x27;s development was hearing the UK premiere of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla Symphony&quot; in 1953, conducted by his father. The interest in non-Western music (for instance Indian raga) sparked by the meeting with Messiaen&#x27;s music combined with the interest in medieval modes shared with Davies and Birtwistle largely influenced Goehr&#x27;s first musical imaginings. His first acknowledged compositions date from these years: &quot;Songs for Babel&quot; (1951) and the Piano Sonata, Op. 2, which was dedicated to the memory of Prokofiev. The piano sonata in one movement was played at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1954 by Hedi Stock-Hug.

In 1955, Goehr left Manchester to go to Paris and study with Messiaen at the Conservatoire de Paris, and he studied counterpoint privately with Yvonne Loriod. He remained in Paris until October 1956, becoming friends with Pierre Boulez and involved in the serialist avant-garde movement of those years. Goehr experimented with Boulez&#x27;s technique of &quot;bloc sonore&quot;. Eventually Goehr left pure serialism, which he came to consider a cult modelled after twelve-tone works by Anton Webern, forbidding references to any other music:
=== Return to the UK, 1956–1976 ===
Upon his return to Britain, Goehr experienced an international breakthrough as a composer with the performance of his cantata &quot;The Deluge&quot; in 1957, conducted by his father. The work was inspired by writings of Sergei Eisenstein. While the music could be seen as derived from Webern&#x27;s twelve-tone cantatas, it strives for the harmonic tautness and sonority of Prokofiev&#x27;s cantatas based on Eisenstein. It was regarded &quot;to have more harmonic coherence and considerably more dramatic impact than most serial music of the time&quot;, as his obituary in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted.

Goehr worked for the BBC as a musical assistant from 1960 to 1967. He received two more cantata commissions from the BBC; &quot;Sutter&#x27;s Gold&quot; for choir, baritone and orchestra was unsuccessful. Singers found it impossibly difficult to perform, and critics dismissed it when it was first performed at the 1961 Leeds Festival. Goehr listened to criticism and described his position:

Goehr was encouraged by his friend, the choral conductor John Alldis, to compose more choral music such as &quot;Two Choruses&quot; in 1962, which used a combination serialism and modality, to become an approach for years to come. His quest for expressiveness led him to his &quot;Little Symphony&quot;, Op. 15 (1963), composed as a memorial to his father who had unexpectedly died. It is based upon a chord-sequence derived from music from Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, &quot;Catacombæ&quot; and &quot;Cum mortuis in lingua mortua&quot;, of which his father had written a harmonic analysis. Boulez, who had facilitated performances of Goehr&#x27;s works, refused to program &quot;Little Symphony&quot;. Goehr composed works of many genres including the Piano Trio (1966). He wrote &quot;Romanza&quot;, a cello concerto, in 1968 for Jacqueline du Pré and Daniel Barenboim. The orchestral &quot;Metamorphosis/Dance&quot; was premiered in 1974 by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bernard Haitink. He composed the String Quartet No. 3 in 1975–1976.
Goehr founded the Wardour Castle Summer School in Wiltshire with Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle in 1964, which led to a focus on opera and music theatre. In 1966 he wrote his first opera, &quot;Arden Must Die&quot;, based on a compilation of a Jacobean morality play by Erich Fried. The opera was premiered in German at the Hamburg State Opera in 1967.

In 1967 he founded the Music Theatre Ensemble, as a pioneer of musical theatre in England; in 1971 he completed a three-part cycle for music theatre &quot;Triptych&quot; of three works, &quot;Naboth&#x27;s Vineyard&quot; (1968) and &quot;Shadowplay&quot; (1970), both explicitly written for the Music Theatre Ensemble, while the third part, the cantata &quot;Sonata about Jerusalem&quot; was commissioned by Testimonium in Jerusalem and performed there in 1971 by the Israel Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Gary Bertini.

From the end of the 1960s Goehr held prestigious academic appointments. In 1968–69 he was the first composer-in-residence at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, and went on to teach at Yale University as an associate professor of music. Goehr returned to Britain as a visiting lecturer at Southampton University (1970–1971). In 1971 he was appointed West Riding Professor of Music at the University of Leeds. In 1976 Goehr became Professor of Music at Cambridge University and taught there until he retired in 1999. His students included some of England&#x27;s most notable composers to come, such as Thomas Adès, Julian Anderson, George Benjamin and Robin Holloway. In Cambridge he became a fellow of Trinity Hall.

=== 1976–1996 ===
In 1976, Goehr composed &quot;Psalm IV&quot; in a &quot;bright modal sonority&quot;, in a departure from serialism, towards more transparent sounds. He found a fusion of modal harmonics and the tradition of figured bass. Over the following twenty years he applied this approach to traditional genres such as symphonies, composing &quot;Sinfonia&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Symphony with Chaconne&quot; in 1987. In 1985 he composed &quot;... a musical offering (J. S. B. 1985) ...&quot;, written in memory of Johann Sebastian Bach. It was premiered by Oliver Knussen, who remained a close collaborator.

Goehr focused especially on vocal music, with many works reflecting socio-political themes. &quot;The Death of Moses&quot; (1992) uses Moses&#x27; refusal to die as an allegory for the victims of the Holocaust, while the opera &quot;Behold the Sun&quot; (1985) deals with the violent revolution of the Anabaptists in Münster of 1543. Non-political vocal works include &quot;Sing, Ariel&quot;, recalling Messiaen&#x27;s bird vocalization setting English poetry, and the 1995 opera &quot;Arianna&quot; to Ottavio Rinuccini&#x27;s historic libretto for Monteverdi&#x27;s lost &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot;, exploring the sounds of Italian Renaissance music. The opera was first performed at the Royal Opera House in London. His engagement with Monteverdi&#x27;s music dates back to the cantata &quot;The Death of Moses&quot;, which he described as &quot;Monteverdi heard through Varèse&quot;. He described his process for &quot;Arianna&quot;:
In 1987 the BBC invited Goehr to present the Reith Lectures. In a series of six lectures, titled The Survival of the Symphony he traces the importance of the symphony, and its apparent fall from grace in the 20th century. Goehr&#x27;s &quot;Colossos or Panic&quot; was premiered in 1992 by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa.

=== 1996–2024 ===
Although the last fifteen years of Goehr&#x27;s output received less coverage in both academic analysis and performances, they represent an interesting phase of his work. He wrote the opera &quot;Kantan and Damask Drum&quot; in 1999, premiered at the Oper Dortmund. It combined two plays from the Japanese Noh theatre tradition, with a short kyogen humorous interlude; he adapted the Japanese texts that date back to the 15th century. The music is inspired by the relationship between music and drama found in Noh theatre.

In the years following, Goehr focused on chamber music, composing works of &quot;unprecedented rhythmic and harmonic immediacy&quot;, such as the Piano Quintet in 2000 and the Fantasie for cello and piano in 2005, with sonorities reminiscent of Ravel. &quot;Marching to Carcassonne&quot; was written in 2003 for pianist Peter Serkin and the London Sinfonietta, alluding to neoclassicism. A set of piano pieces, &quot;Symmetry Disor.der Reach&quot;, recalling a Baroque suite, was premiered bv Huw Watkins in 2007. &quot;Manere&quot; for violin and clarinet (2008) is based on a fragment of medieval plainchant and explores musical ornamentation. &quot;Since Brass nor Stone&quot; for string quartet and percussion was inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet of the same name; it was written in 2008 in memory of Pavel Haas for percussionist Colin Currie and the Pavel Haas Quartet. It achieved the chamber category of the 2009 British Composer Awards. Goehr wrote &quot;…between the lines…&quot; in 2013 for the Scharoun Ensemble Berlin.

After a hiatus of almost ten years, Goehr returned to opera again with &quot;Promised End&quot; (2008–09), based on Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear. It was first performed by English Touring Opera in 2010. He wrote &quot;When Adam Fell&quot; simultaneously, a BBC commission for orchestra based on the chromatic bass from Bach&#x27;s chorale setting &quot;Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt&quot;, BWV 705, that Messiaen had pointed out to him. &quot;To These Dark Steps/The Fathers are Watching&quot; was written for tenor, children&#x27;s choir and ensemble in 2011–12, setting texts by the Israeli poet Gabriel Levin about the bombing of the Gaza Strip during the Iraq War; it was premiered in a concert of the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group conducted by Knussen marking Goehr&#x27;s 80th birthday.

&quot;Largo Siciliano&quot; (2012) was a trio praised for its balance between violin, horn and piano. The chamber symphony &quot;...between the lines...&quot; (2013), written on a commission from the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, is a monothematic work in four movements played without break, inspired by Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony, Op. 9. &quot;Two Sarabandes&quot; was composed for the Bamberg Symphony who premiered it conducted by Lahav Shani. A string quartet &quot;Ondering&quot; was premiered by the Villiers Quartet at the Royal Northern College of Music in 2023. Goehr died at his home in Cambridgeshire on 26 August 2024, at the age of 92.

== Works ==
=== Musical style ===
Many of Goehr&#x27;s works are studies in the synthesis of disparate elements. Examples include &quot;The Deluge&quot; (1957–1958), which was inspired by Eisenstein&#x27;s notes for a film, itself based on a writing by Leonardo da Vinci. Other works&#x27; inspirations range from the formal proportions of a late Beethoven piano sonata (&quot;Metamorphosis/Dance&quot;, 1973–1974) to a painting by Goya (&quot;Colossus or Panic&quot;, 1990), to the sinister humour of Bertolt Brecht (&quot;Arden Must Die&quot;, 1966) or to the Japanese Noh theatre (&quot;Kantan and Damask Drum&quot;, 1999).

Just as &quot;The Deluge&quot; takes its cue from an unfinished project (Eisenstein never finished the planned film), many of Goehr&#x27;s works include a synthesis of fragments or unfinished projects left by other artists. The cantata &quot;The Death of Moses&quot; resonates with Schoenberg&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;; the opera &quot;Arianna&quot; (1995) is the setting of the libretto of a lost opera by Monteverdi, and posthumously published prose fragments by Franz Kafka inspired or appear in &quot;Das Gesetz der Quadrille&quot; (1979).

On a strictly technical musical level, Goehr&#x27;s tried unifying the contrapuntal rigour and motivic workings of the First Viennese School and Second Viennese School with a strong sense of harmonic pacing and sonority. Goehr remained indebted to Messiaen, apparent in his lifelong commitment to modality as an integration of serialism and tonality, as well as in melodic writing inspired by bird-song.

== Honours ==
Goehr was an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a Churchill Fellow. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Plymouth. He became an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. His manuscripts are held by the Akademie der Künste in Berlin.

<doc id="594874" wikidata="Q786875" url="?curid=594874" title="Autoionization">
<text>Autoionization is a process by which an atom or a molecule in an excited state spontaneously emits one of the outer-shell electrons, thus going from a state with charge  to a state with charge , for example from an electrically neutral state to a singly ionized state.

Autoionizing states are usually short-lived, and thus can be described as Fano resonances rather than normal bound states. They can be observed as variations in the ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules, by photoionization, electron ionization and other methods.

==Examples==
As examples, several Fano resonances in the extreme ultraviolet photoionization spectrum of neon are attributed to autoionizing states. Some are due to one-electron excitations, such as a series of three strong similarly shaped peaks at energies of 45.546, 47.121 and 47.692 eV which are interpreted as 1s2 2s1 2p6 &quot;n&quot;p (1P) states for &quot;n&quot; = 3, 4 and 5. These states of neutral neon lie beyond the first ionization energy because it takes more energy to excite a 2s electron than to remove a 2p electron. When autoionization occurs, the &quot;n&quot;p → 2s de-excitation provides the energy needed to remove one 2p electron and form the Ne+ ground state.

Other resonances are attributed to two-electron excitations. The same neon photoionization spectrum considered above contains a fourth strong resonance in the same region at 44.979 eV but with a very different shape, which is interpreted as the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (1P) state. For autoionization, the 3s → 2p transition provides the energy to remove the 3p electron.

Electron ionization allows the observation of some states which cannot be excited by photons due to selection rules. In neon for example again, the excitation of triplet states is forbidden by the spin selection rule ΔS = 0, but the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (3P) has been observed by electron ionization at 42.04 eV. Ion impact by high energy H+, He+ and Ne+ ions has also been used.

If a core electron is missing, a positive ion can autoionize further and lose a second electron in the Auger effect. In neon, X-ray excitation can remove a 1s electron, producing an excited Ne+ ion with configuration 1s1 2s2 2p6. In the subsequent Auger process a 2s → 1s transition and simultaneous emission of a second electron from 2p leads to the Ne2+ 1s2 2s1 2p5 ionic state.

Molecules, in addition, can have vibrationally autoionizing Rydberg states, in which the small amount of energy necessary to ionize a Rydberg state is provided by vibrational excitation.

==Autodetachment==
When the excited state of the atom or molecule consists of a compound state of a neutral particle and a resonantly attached electron, autoionization is referred to as autodetachment. In this case the compound state begins with a net negative charge before the autoionization process, and ends with a neutral charge. The ending state will often be vibrationally or rotationally excited state as a result of excess energy from the resonant attachment process.

<text>The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was a New Deal agency created in 1937 to combat rural poverty during the Great Depression in the United States. It succeeded the Resettlement Administration (1935–1937).

The FSA is famous for its small but highly influential photography program, 1935–1944, that portrayed the challenges of rural poverty. The photographs in the Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information (FSA/OWI) Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944. This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy Stryker, who guided the effort in a succession of government agencies: the Resettlement Administration (1935–1937), the Farm Security Administration (1937–1942), and the Office of War Information (1942–1944). The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and nongovernmental sources, including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management (OEM), various branches of the military, and industrial corporations.

In total, the black-and-white portion of the collection consists of about 175,000 black-and-white film negatives, encompassing both negatives that were printed for use and those that were not printed at the time. Color transparencies also made by the FSA/OWI are available in a separate section of the catalog, FSA/OWI Color Photographs.

The FSA stressed &quot;rural rehabilitation&quot; efforts to improve the lifestyle of very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming.

Reactionary critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an alleged experiment in collectivizing agriculture—that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress, it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.

==Origins==
The projects that were combined in 1935 to form the Resettlement Administration (RA) started in 1933 as an assortment of programs tried out by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. The RA was headed by Rexford Tugwell, an economic advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, Tugwell&#x27;s goal moving 650,000 people into of exhausted, worn-out land was unpopular among the majority in Congress. This goal seemed socialistic to some and threatened to deprive powerful farm proprietors of their tenant workforce. The RA was thus left with only enough resources to relocate a few thousand people from and build several greenbelt cities, which planners admired as models for a cooperative future that never arrived.

The main focus of the RA was to now build relief camps in California for migratory workers, especially refugees from the drought-stricken Dust Bowl of the Southwest. This move was resisted by a large share of Californians, who did not want destitute migrants to settle in their midst. The RA managed to construct 95 camps that gave migrants unaccustomed clean quarters with running water and other amenities, but the 75,000 people who had the benefit of these camps were a small share of those in need and could only stay temporarily. After facing enormous criticism for his poor management of the RA, Tugwell resigned in 1936. On January 1, 1937, with hopes of making the RA more effective, the RA was transferred to the Department of Agriculture through executive order 7530.

On July 22, 1937, Congress passed the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. This law authorized a modest credit program to assist tenant farmers to purchase land, and it was the culmination of a long effort to secure legislation for their benefit. Following the passage of the act, Congress passed the Farm Security Act into law. The Farm Security Act officially transformed the RA into the Farm Security Administration (FSA). The FSA expanded through funds given by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act.

==Relief work==

One of the activities performed by the RA and FSA was the buying out of small farms that were not economically viable, and the setting up of 34 subsistence homestead communities, in which groups of farmers lived together under the guidance of government experts and worked a common area. They were not allowed to purchase their farms for fear that they would fall back into inefficient practices not guided by RA and FSA experts.

The Dust Bowl in the Great Plains displaced thousands of tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and laborers, many of whom (known as &quot;Okies&quot; or &quot;Arkies&quot;) moved on to California. The FSA operated camps for them, such as Weedpatch Camp as depicted in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

The RA and the FSA gave educational aid to 455,000 farm families during the period 1936–1943. In June, 1936, Roosevelt wrote: &quot;You are right about the farmers who suffer through their own fault... I wish you would have a talk with Tugwell about what he is doing to educate this type of farmer to become self-sustaining. During the past year, his organization has made 104,000 farm families practically self-sustaining by supervision and education along practical lines. That is a pretty good record!&quot;

The FSA&#x27;s primary mission was not to aid farm production or prices. Roosevelt&#x27;s agricultural policy had, in fact, been to try to decrease agricultural production to increase prices. When production was discouraged, though, the tenant farmers and small holders suffered most by not being able to ship enough to market to pay rents. Many renters wanted money to buy farms, but the Agriculture Department realized there already were too many farmers, and did not have a program for farm purchases. Instead, they used education to help the poor stretch their money further. Congress, however, demanded that the FSA help tenant farmers purchase farms, and purchase loans of $191 million were made, which were eventually repaid. A much larger program was $778 million in loans (at effective rates of about 1% interest) to 950,000 tenant farmers. The goal was to make the farmer more efficient so the loans were used for new machinery, trucks, or animals, or to repay old debts. At all times, the borrower was closely advised by a government agent. Family needs were on the agenda, as the FSA set up a health insurance program and taught farm wives how to cook and raise children. Upward of a third of the amount was never repaid, as the tenants moved to much better opportunities in the cities.

The FSA was also one of the authorities administering relief efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico during the Great Depression. Between 1938 and 1945, under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, it oversaw the purchase of 590 farms with the intent of distributing land to working and middle-class Puerto Ricans.

===Modernization===
The FSA resettlement communities appear in the literature as efforts to ameliorate the wretched condition of southern sharecroppers and tenants, but those evicted to make way for the new settlers are virtually invisible in the historic record. The resettlement projects were part of larger efforts to modernize rural America. The removal of former tenants and their replacement by FSA clients in the lower Mississippi alluvial plain—the Delta—reveals core elements of New Deal modernizing policies. The key concepts that guided the FSA&#x27;s tenant removals were: the definition of rural poverty as rooted in the problem of tenancy; the belief that economic success entailed particular cultural practices and social forms; and the commitment by those with political power to gain local support. These assumptions undergirded acceptance of racial segregation and the criteria used to select new settlers. Alternatives could only become visible through political or legal action—capacities sharecroppers seldom had. In succeeding decades, though, these modernizing assumptions created conditions for Delta African Americans on resettlement projects to challenge white supremacy.

===FSA and its contribution to society===
The documentary photography genre describes photographs that would work as a time capsule for evidence in the future or a certain method that a person can use for a frame of reference. Facts presented in a photograph can speak for themselves after the viewer gets time to analyze it. The motto of the FSA was simply, as Beaumont Newhall insists, &quot;not to inform us, but to move us.&quot; Those photographers wanted the government to move and give a hand to the people, as they were completely neglected and overlooked, thus they decided to start taking photographs in a style that we today call &quot;documentary photography.&quot; The FSA photography has been influential due to its realist point of view, and because it works as a frame of reference and an educational tool from which later generations could learn. Society has benefited and will benefit from it for more years to come, as this photography can unveil the ambiguous and question the conditions that are taking place.

===Photography program===

The RA and FSA are well known for the influence of their photography program, 1935–1944. Photographers and writers were hired to report and document the plight of poor farmers. The Information Division (ID) of the FSA was responsible for providing educational materials and press information to the public. Under Roy Stryker, the ID of the FSA adopted a goal of &quot;introducing America to Americans.&quot; Many of the most famous Depression-era photographers were fostered by the FSA project. Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Gordon Parks were three of the most famous FSA alumni. The FSA was also cited in Gordon Parks&#x27; autobiographical novel, &quot;A Choice of Weapons&quot;.

The FSA&#x27;s photography was one of the first large-scale visual documentations of the lives of African-Americans. These images were widely disseminated through the &quot;Twelve Million Black Voices&quot; collection, published in October 1941, which combined FSA photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam and text by author and poet Richard Wright.

===Photographers===
Fifteen photographers (ordered by year of hire) would produce the bulk of work on this project. Their diverse, visual documentation elevated government&#x27;s mission from the &quot;relocation&quot; tactics of a Resettlement Administration to strategic solutions which would depend on America recognizing rural and already poor Americans, facing death by depression and dust. FSA photographers: Arthur Rothstein (1935), Theodor Jung (1935), Ben Shahn (1935), Walker Evans (1935), Dorothea Lange (1935), Carl Mydans (1935), Russell Lee (1936), Marion Post Wolcott (1936), John Vachon (1936, photo assignments began in 1938), Jack Delano (1940), John Collier (1941), Marjory Collins (1941), Louise Rosskam (1941), Gordon Parks (1942) and Esther Bubley (1942).

With America&#x27;s entry into World War II, FSA would focus on a different kind of relocation as orders were issued for internment of Japanese Americans. FSA photographers would be transferred to the Office of War Information during the last years of the war and completely disbanded at the war&#x27;s end. Photographers like Howard R. Hollem, Alfred T. Palmer, Arthur Siegel and OWI&#x27;s Chief of Photographers John Rous were working in OWI before FSA&#x27;s reorganization there. As a result of both teams coming under one unit name, these other individuals are sometimes associated with RA-FSA&#x27;s pre-war images of American life. Though collectively credited with thousands of Library of Congress images, military ordered, positive-spin assignments like these four received starting in 1942, should be separately considered from pre-war, depression triggered imagery. FSA photographers were able to take time to study local circumstances and discuss editorial approaches with each other before capturing that first image. Each one talented in her or his own right, equal credit belongs to Roy Stryker who recognized, hired and empowered that talent.
These 15 photographers, some shown above, all played a significant role, not only in producing images for this project, but also in molding the resulting images in the final project through conversations held between the group members. The photographers produced images that breathed a humanistic social visual catalyst of the sort found in novels, theatrical productions, and music of the time. Their images are now regarded as a &quot;national treasure&quot; in the United States, which is why this project is regarded as a work of art.
Together with John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (not a government project) and documentary prose (for example Walker Evans and James Agee&#x27;s &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;), the FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the United States. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington, DC, as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to portray. Stryker&#x27;s agenda focused on his faith in social engineering, the poor conditions among tenant cotton farmers, and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers; above all, he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people&#x27;s lives. Stryker demanded photographs that &quot;related people to the land and vice versa&quot; because these photographs reinforced the RA&#x27;s position that poverty could be controlled by &quot;changing land practices.&quot; Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, for example, &quot;church&quot;, &quot;court day&quot;, and &quot;barns&quot;. Stryker sought photographs of migratory workers that would tell a story about how they lived day-to-day. He asked Dorothea Lange to emphasize cooking, sleeping, praying, and socializing. RA-FSA made 250,000 images of rural poverty. Fewer than half of those images survive and are housed in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress. The library has placed all 164,000 developed negatives online. From these, some 77,000 different finished photographic prints were originally made for the press, plus 644 color images, from 1600 negatives.

==Documentary films==
The RA also funded two documentary films by Pare Lorentz: &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;, about the creation of the Dust Bowl, and &quot;The River&quot;, about the importance of the Mississippi River. The films were deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==World War II activities==
During World War II, the FSA was assigned to work under the purview of the Wartime Civil Control Administration, a subagency of the War Relocation Authority. These agencies were responsible for relocating Japanese Americans from their homes on the West Coast to Internment camps. The FSA controlled the agricultural part of the evacuation. Starting in March 1942 they were responsible for transferring the farms owned and operated by Japanese Americans to alternate operators. They were given the dual mandate of ensuring fair compensation for Japanese Americans, and for maintaining correct use of the agricultural land. During this period, Lawrence Hewes Jr was the regional director and in charge of these activities.

==Reformers ousted; Farmers Home Administration==
After the war started and millions of factory jobs in the cities were unfilled, no need for FSA remained. In late 1942, Roosevelt moved the housing programs to the National Housing Agency, and in 1943, Congress greatly reduced FSA&#x27;s activities. The photographic unit was subsumed by the Office of War Information for one year, then disbanded. Finally in 1946, all the social reformers had left and FSA was replaced by a new agency, the Farmers Home Administration, which had the goal of helping finance farm purchases by tenants—and especially by war veterans—with no personal oversight by experts. It became part of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s war on poverty in the 1960s, with a greatly expanded budget to facilitate loans to low-income rural families and cooperatives, injecting $4.2 billion into rural America.

==The Great Depression==

The Great Depression began in August 1929, when the United States economy first went into an economic recession. Although the country spent two months with declining gross domestic product (GDP), the effects of a declining economy were not felt until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued.

Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future and a reduction in living standards for most ordinary Americans. The market crash highlighted a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits for industrial firms, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth.

<text>Walter Goehr (; 28 May 19034 December 1960) was a German composer and conductor who from 1937 lived and worked in the UK. He was the father of composer Alexander Goehr.

==Biography==
Goehr was born in Berlin, where he studied with Arnold Schoenberg and embarked on a conducting career, before being forced as a Jew to seek employment outside Germany after working for Berlin Radio in 1932. He was invited to become music director for the His Master&#x27;s Voice, so he moved to London. In 1937, he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the premiere recording of Bizet&#x27;s Symphony in C. During his years as a staff conductor for EMI, he conducted the orchestra for many recordings, including accompaniments for arias sung by Beniamino Gigli, Richard Tauber and Joseph Schmidt. In more popular items, his name appears on the record labels as &#x27;G. Walter&#x27; or &#x27;George Walter&#x27;. In addition, he conducted for many concerto recordings, including some by Benno Moiseiwitsch, Myra Hess and others. After the war he conducted for several smaller recording companies based in Europe, including for the concerto recordings of the short-lived Australian pianist Noel Mewton-Wood.

As well as teaching composition in Britain he also instructed pupils in conducting, one of whom was the young Wally Stott, later known as Angela Morley. In England he worked for the Columbia Record Company, and between 1945 and 1948 was conductor of the BBC Theatre Orchestra (the predecessor of today&#x27;s BBC Concert Orchestra); he was also a skilled arranger. In January 1946, he conducted the orchestra for the premiere performance of Louis MacNeice&#x27;s radio play &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, with music by Benjamin Britten, on the BBC Home Service. He was one of many musicians of European origin and training recruited by Michael Tippett for the staff of Morley College. Goehr conducted many important premieres at Morley, including the first British performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s of 1610.

His first successful composition was &quot;Malpopita&quot; in 1931, an opera especially designed for radio broadcast. This work was not scheduled for its first live performance until 6 May 2004, in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg, Abspannwerk Humboldt.

In 1942, he made a new arrangement of Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; with a subsidiary piano part. In 1946, he arranged a number of Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano pieces into the orchestral suite &quot;Pictures from the Crimea&quot;. In 1946, Goehr composed the music for the much acclaimed film &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, directed by David Lean. He wrote several other film scores. He was also well known for conducting film soundtracks, including &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot;, for which his friend Allan Gray had composed the score.

In 1952 he conducted the first recording of , conducting the in a live stage performance. The LP version, issued in 1954, won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954.

He also conducted the UK premiere of Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s in 1953.

He died in Sheffield City Hall, England, on 4 December 1960, immediately after conducting a performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

Goehr married his wife Laelia, a classically-trained pianist, cabaret artist and photographer, in the early 1930s. She took informal photography lessons with Bill Brandt and set up her own studios in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, where they lived from the start of World War II. Their son, composer and academic Alexander Goehr, was born in 1932.

<doc id="594885" wikidata="Q16238185" url="?curid=594885" title="Pi Kappa Alpha">
<text>Pi Kappa Alpha (), commonly known as Pike is a college fraternity founded at the University of Virginia in 1868. The fraternity has over 225 chapters and provisional chapters across the United States and abroad with over 15,500 undergraduate members and over 300,000 lifetime initiates.

==History==
Pi Kappa Alpha was founded on March 1, 1868, in Room 47 in West Range (The Range) at the University of Virginia by six graduate students: 
Three of the Founders had been former cadets, having served on both sides of the recently concluded Civil War. One had been a Union hospital officer, another a Confederate veteran, and a third, a repatriate. Expansion was considered early in the fraternity&#x27;s history; on March 1, 1869, exactly one year after the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at the University of Virginia was formed, the &quot;Beta chapter&quot; of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at Davidson College. Its &quot;Gamma chapter&quot; was placed at William and Mary just two years later, and a total of seven chapters formed in the first decade. This period of early growth slowed though, and by 1889 only four chapters remained active.

A call for a national convention was sent out, and delegates of three of the four active chapters met in what would become the &quot;junior founding&quot; of the fraternity at what they called the Hampden–Sydney Convention, held in a dorm room at Hampden–Sydney College. This marked the start of a new wave of prosperity and substantial growth and the end of almost a decade of decline. &quot;Theta chapter&quot;, at Rhodes College, took over the responsibilities of &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;, granting chapters for a short period before this duty was taken over by an administrative office. John Shaw Foster, a junior founder from &quot;Theta chapter&quot;, helped to reestablish &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at the University of Virginia. &quot;Theta chapter&quot; is the longest continual-running chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, having been founded in 1878. The four delegates to the Hampden–Sydney Convention are referred to as the Junior Founders.

Pi Kappa Alpha was not originally organized as a sectional fraternity; however, by constitutional provision it became so in 1889, and for twenty years would only open chapters south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Pi Kappa Alpha members have supported the nation&#x27;s armed conflicts in large numbers. In World War I, one out of every six members of the fraternity served in uniform. In World War II, 15,000 of its 33,000 active members served, including General Courtney Hodges, a four-star general and commander of the US First Army in Europe.

Sectarian and other restrictions that were in place during the early years have since been modified or removed entirely: Pi Kappa Alpha remained a southern fraternity until the New Orleans Convention in 1909 when the fraternity officially declared itself a national organization. Like many other social fraternities at the time, Pi Kappa Alpha had limited its membership to white males. All race restrictions were removed in 1964.

As of 2024, Pi Kappa Alpha has initiated more that 310,000 members. The fraternity&#x27;s headquarters are in Memphis, Tennessee.

==Symbols==
The fraternity&#x27;s rituals were based on those of Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Its colors are garnet and old gold. Its symbols are the shield, diamond, dagger, and key. Its flower is the lily of the valley. Its tree is the Oak. Its mascot is the White Horse. Its jewel is the Diamond.

&quot;Shield &amp; Diamond&quot; is the official quarterly publication of Pi Kappa Alpha. It was first printed in December 1890 by Robert Adger Smythe, who was then Grand Secretary and Treasurer, under the name &quot;The Pi Kappa Alpha Journal&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Shield &amp; Diamond&quot; in 1891.

The fraternity&#x27;s nickname is PIKE and its members are called Pikes.

==Activities==

===PIKE University===

Pike University is the name used for all of the fraternity&#x27;s leadership programs. The program is administered by the fraternity&#x27;s professional staff. It was founded in 1948 as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization for charitable, literary &amp; educational purposes. Events held by the university include the International Convention, the Academy, the Chapter Executives Conference, and several regional Leadership Summits. Pike University grants more than $100,000 in scholarships each year.

===PIKE Foundation===

In 1948, Pi Kappa Alpha established and chartered the &quot;Pi Kappa Alpha Memorial Foundation&quot; as a 501(c)(3) organization. The foundation grants $350,000 in scholarships and grants to undergraduate members each year. It also provides funding to the fraternity and its chapters for leadership programs, scholarships, and chapter house facilities. The foundation grants initiation fee scholarships to undergraduates inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Order of Omega, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi honoraries. 

The Pike Foundation also maintains and operates the Memorial Headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. This facility houses professional staff, the Harvey T. Newell Library, and the Freeman Hart Museum. The building is a war memorial built in 1988 to recognize the military services of members who died in the line of duty. A Gold Star Memorial was dedicated on August 1, 2008.

== Chapters ==
== Notable members ==
==Chapter and member misconduct==
Despite policies put in place by the national fraternity to curtail hazing behavior, local chapters have been involved in events which lead to deaths, sexual assault, and other misconduct.

=== Hazing deaths ===
*Samuel Mark Click, a pledge at Texas Tech University, was killed by a train while participating in a scavenger hunt as part of a hazing event in 1976.
*In 2002, Albert Santos, a pledge at the University of Nevada at Reno, drowned in a lake during a hazing ritual. He and several pledges were told to swim in a lake in their underwear; Santos could not swim.
*In 2012, Pi Kappa Alpha pledge David Bogenberger died of a cardiac arrhythmia triggered by alcohol poisoning. According to police, Bogenberger and other pledges were pressured into drinking large quantities of alcohol in a two-hour time at an unsanctioned Northern Illinois University event. Bogenberger and 18 other pledges drank to unconsciousness. Five fraternity officers and seventeen other members were convicted of misdemeanors in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in U.S. history. The chapter was suspended by the fraternity.
*In March 2021, fraternity pledge Stone Foltz died at the hospital due to alcohol intoxication after being forced to consume a fifth of Evan Williams whiskey. Eight members of the &quot;Delta Beta chapter&quot; at Bowling Green State University were criminally charged with first-degree felony involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, felonious assault, hazing, failure to comply with underage alcohol laws, and obstructing official business, third-degree felony involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, and obstructing justice. The international fraternity expelled all of the undergraduate members and revoked the chapter&#x27;s charter. In 2023, the parents of Stone Foltz filed a lawsuit against Bowling Green State for the wrongful death of their son.

=== Sexual assault ===

* In 1988, when three members of the Florida State University chapter were charged with the sexual battery of a freshman female student. Also in 1988 several members of Pi Kappa Alpha were arrested for a sexual assault that took place at Stetson University.
* In 2008, ten Pike members were arrested at Tulane University for pouring boiling water on pledges; the chapter was also accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several female students at the fraternity&#x27;s annual bacchanal.
* Florida International University suspended the fraternity in 2013 after the discovery of photos on Facebook of hazing and drug deals, as well as sexually explicit photos of women taken without their consent.
* In 2015, the Utah State University chapter president was charged with forcible sexual abuse, a felony, after allegedly inappropriately touching a female student who passed out at a party.
* In 2023, the Montana State University chapter was placed on probation by the university for reports of sexual assault; the chapter was suspended for sexual assault in 2013.

=== Other incidents ===

* In 2014, the leaders of the University of Arkansas chapter were asked to resign following an unauthorized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day party that incorporated racist stereotypes. 
* The University of Southern Mississippi chapter was closed from 2014 to 2018, following a hazing incident that led to the death of two mated flamingos that pledges stole from the local zoo. 
* In May 2017, the California State University, Chico chapter was charged with illegally cutting down 32 trees in the Lassen National Forest during an initiation of new pledges. They were also charged with possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud the United States. The chapter was sentenced to 9,800 hours of community service and a $4,000 fine after pleading guilty in the U.S. District Court. 
* In 2021, seven members of the University of Mississippi chapter were arrested for hazing a pledge who was told to ingest bleach, resulting in Grade 4 erosive esophagitis. 
* In 2023, the University of Arkansas chapter was suspended after a hazing video leaked on social media. The video leaked showed a pledge kneeling before an altar, holding another pledge&#x27;s hands while fraternity members chanted and paddled the kneeling pledges.

<text>Michaëlle Jean (; born September 6, 1957) is a Canadian former journalist who served as the 27th governor general of Canada from 2005 to 2010. She is the first Haitian Canadian and black person to hold this office.

Jean was the third secretary-general of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie from 2015 until 2019. She was the first woman to hold the position and held the position until the end of 2018.

Jean was a refugee from Haiti—coming to Canada in 1968—and was raised in the town of Thetford Mines, Quebec. After receiving two university degrees, Jean worked as a journalist and broadcaster for Radio-Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as well as also undertaking charity work, mostly in the field of assisting victims of domestic violence. In 2005, she was appointed governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Paul Martin, to replace Adrienne Clarkson as vicereine. She occupied the post until being succeeded by David Johnston in 2010. Early in her tenure, comments of hers recorded in some of the film works by her husband, Jean-Daniel Lafond, were construed as supporting Quebec sovereignty and her holding of dual citizenship caused doubt about her loyalties. But Jean denied separatist leanings, renounced her citizenship of France (acquired through her marriage), and eventually became a respected vicereine noted for her attention to the Canadian Forces, Aboriginal Canadians, and the arts, especially youth involvement in them. In 2010, Jean was appointed to a four-year term as the Special Envoy for Haiti for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.

Michaëlle Jean was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on September 26, 2012.

== Early life and education ==
Jean&#x27;s family hails from Haiti; she was born in Port-au-Prince, baptized at the Holy Trinity Cathedral, and spent winters in that city and summers and weekends in Jacmel, her mother&#x27;s hometown. Though her father worked as principal and teacher for a Protestant independent school in Port-au-Prince, Jean was educated at home, as her parents did not want her swearing allegiance to the then Haitian president, François Duvalier, as all Haitian schoolchildren were required to do.

With her family, Jean fled Haiti to escape Duvalier&#x27;s regime, under which Jean&#x27;s father was arrested and tortured in 1965. Jean&#x27;s father left for Canada in 1967 while she arrived with her mother and sister the following year; the family settled together at Thetford Mines, Quebec. Jean&#x27;s father, however, became increasingly distant and violent, and her parents&#x27; marriage eventually fell apart; she, with her mother and sister, then moved to a basement apartment in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood of Montreal.
Jean received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Italian and Hispanic languages and literature from the University of Montreal, and, from 1984 to 1986, taught Italian Studies there, while completing her Master of Arts degree in comparative literature. She then went on with language and literature studies at the University of Florence, the University of Perugia, and the Catholic University of Milan. Besides French and English, Jean is fluent in Spanish, Italian, and Haitian Creole, and can read Portuguese.

Concurrent with her studies between 1979 and 1987, Jean coordinated a study on spousal abuse and worked at a women&#x27;s shelter, which paved the way for her establishment of a network of shelters for women and children across Canada. She also involved herself in organizations dedicated to assisting immigrants to Canada obtain the entry they desired, and later worked for Employment and Immigration Canada and at the &quot;Conseil des Communautés culturelles du Québec&quot;, where Jean began writing about the experiences of immigrant women. She married French-born, Canadian filmmaker Jean-Daniel Lafond, and the couple adopted as their daughter Marie-Éden, an orphaned child from Jacmel. Through her marriage to Lafond, Jean has two stepdaughters.

== Journalism, broadcasting, and film careers ==
Jean became a reporter, filmmaker, and broadcaster for Radio-Canada in 1988, hosting news and affairs programs such as &quot;Actuel&quot;, &quot;Montréal ce soir&quot;, &quot;Virages&quot;, and &quot;Le Point&quot;; she was the first person of Caribbean descent to be seen on French television news in Canada. She then moved in 1995 to &quot;Réseau de l&#x27;information&quot; (RDI), Radio-Canada&#x27;s all-news channel, in order to anchor a number of programmes, &quot;Le Monde ce soir&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;Édition québécoise&quot;, &quot;Horizons francophones&quot;, &quot;Les Grands reportages&quot;, &quot;Le Journal RDI&quot;, and &quot;RDI à l&#x27;écoute&quot;, for example. Four years later, she was asked by CBC&#x27;s English language all-news channel, CBC Newsworld, to host &quot;The Passionate Eye&quot; and &quot;Rough Cuts&quot;, which both broadcast the best in Canadian and foreign documentary films. By 2004, Jean was hosting her own show, &quot;Michaëlle&quot;, while continuing to anchor RDI&#x27;s &quot;Grands reportages&quot;, as well as acting occasionally as anchor of &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot;.

Over the same period, Jean made several films with her husband, including the award-winning &quot;Haïti dans tous nos rêves&quot; (&quot;Haiti in All Our Dreams&quot;), in which she meets her uncle, the poet and essayist René Depestre, who fled from the Duvalier dictatorship into exile in France and wrote about his dreams for Haiti, and tells him Haiti awaits his return. She similarly produced and hosted news and documentary programming for television on both the English and French services of the CBC.

== Governor General of Canada ==
Jean was Canada&#x27;s first governor general of Caribbean origin; the third woman (after Jeanne Sauvé and Adrienne Clarkson); the fourth youngest (after the Marquess of Lorne, who was 33 years old in 1878; the Marquess of Lansdowne, who was 38 years old in 1883; and Edward Schreyer, who was 43 years old in 1979); the fourth former journalist (after Sauvé, Roméo LeBlanc and Clarkson); and the second after Clarkson to not only have neither a political nor military background, but also to be a visible minority, to break the tradition of Canadian-born governors general, and to be in an interracial marriage. Jean was also the first representative of Queen Elizabeth II to have been born during the latter&#x27;s reign, and her appointment saw the first child living in Rideau Hall, the official residence since Schreyer and his young family lived there in the early 1980s.

=== As governor general-designate ===
On August 4, 2005, it was announced from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada that Queen Elizabeth II had approved Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s choice of Jean to succeed Adrienne Clarkson as the Queen&#x27;s representative. At the time, Martin said of Jean that she &quot;is a woman of talent and achievement. Her personal story is nothing short of extraordinary. And extraordinary is precisely what we seek in a governor generalship—who after all must represent all of Canada to all Canadians and to the rest of the world as well.&quot; Almost immediately, there was speculation that Martin had been influenced by the political climate in Ottawa at the time, leading the Prime Minister to deny that rejuvenated popularity for his party in Quebec was a motivating factor in his decision.
From Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition, the upcoming appointment was met with mostly favourable comments, Jean&#x27;s predecessor applauded the choice, saying that Jean was &quot;an exciting and imaginative choice for Governor General.&quot; In her first remarks after this announcement, Jean herself encouraged Canadians to involve themselves in their communities, and stated that she wished to reach out to all Canadians, regardless of their background, and made it a goal to focus especially on Canadian youth and the disadvantaged.

However, by August 11, 2005, reports emerged of a forthcoming piece by René Boulanger for the Quebec sovereigntist publication &quot;Le Québécois&quot; that would reveal Jean and her husband&#x27;s support for Quebec independence, citing Lafond&#x27;s associations with former members of the terrorist organization, the &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot; (FLQ), specifically Jacques Rose. Though Boulanger admitted that he was motivated to incite a rejection of Jean by Anglophone Canadians, Gilles Rhéaume, former president of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, called on the Governor General-Designate to reveal how she voted in Quebec&#x27;s 1995 referendum on independence, and Members of Parliament, as well as some provincial premiers, demanded that Jean and her husband clarify where their sympathies lay. Then, four days after the Prime Minister publicly explained that Jean and her spouse had both undergone thorough background checks by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, there came to light, on August 17, the existence of a documentary in which Jean had been filmed with several hard-line Quebec separatists, all toasting &quot;to independence&quot; after Jean stated: &quot;Independence can&#x27;t be given, it must be taken.&quot;

That same day, Jean responded with a public statement, saying &quot;I wish to tell you unequivocally that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian and that we have the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... [We] have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement,&quot; and went on to say that in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: &quot;There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute,&quot; though some critics continued to argue that Jean&#x27;s response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.

The Queen held audience with Jean and her family on September 6, 2005, at Balmoral Castle. Though this type of meeting with a governor general-designate was standard, Jean&#x27;s was unique in that the presence of her young daughter marked the first time in Elizabeth&#x27;s reign that her designated viceroy-to-be had brought a child to an audience, which caused some protocol issues. The weekend was informal; for one dinner, coincidentally on the eve of Jean&#x27;s birthday, the Queen drove Jean and her family to a cottage on the Balmoral estate, where they were joined by Prince Philip and Prince Edward, who, along with the Queen, performed the cooking and washing up. Of it, Jean said &quot;[i]t was probably the best birthday of my life.&quot; The commission appointing Jean was issued on September 10 under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada.

Upon her return to Canada, Jean yet again became a target when the subject of her dual citizenship was raised, in particular the French variety she had obtained through her marriage to the French-born Lafond. A section of the French civil code forbade French citizens from holding government or military positions in other countries, yet Jean, as governor general, would hold a governmental position as the representative of Canada&#x27;s head of state, and, as such, would have a military role carrying out the duties of Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces, as constitutionally vested in the monarch. The French embassy in Ottawa stated that there was &quot;no question&quot; that the law would not be enforced in Jean&#x27;s case, but, on September 25, two days before her swearing-in, Jean made it public that she had renounced her French citizenship &quot;[in] light of the responsibilities related to the function of Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces&quot; and &quot;France acceded to my request by decree on September 23, 2005.&quot;

=== In office ===

At her investiture ceremony in the Senate chamber on September 27, 2005, Jean declared in a speech described as &quot;moving&quot; that &quot;the time of the Two Solitudes that for too long described the character of this country is past,&quot; and called for the protection of the environment, the shielding of culture against globalization, and an end to the marginalization of young people. According to one media account, &quot;the pomp and circumstance of Canada&#x27;s most significant state function were blended with humour, passion and even tears.&quot; while &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; columnist John Ibbitson reflected the general captivation with the new governor general in the following way:
Echoing her inaugural speech, the motto on the personal coat of arms created for Jean upon taking office as governor general was &quot;BRISER LES SOLITUDES&quot;, which translates into &quot;breaking down solitudes&quot;. One of her first acts as vicereine was then to launch an online chat with Canadians, as part of the larger project of creating within the Governor General&#x27;s domain name a website dubbed &quot;Citizen Voices: Breaking Down Solitudes&quot;, where users could engage each other in discussion forums and prominent individuals could post blog entries. The focus extended beyond simply the relationship between the traditional Two Solitudes of Francophones and Anglophones in Canada to include relations between peoples of all racial, linguistic, cultural, and gender groups.

Over the first two years of her mandate, Jean embarked on the traditional viceregal tours of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories. In British Columbia, Jean presented the Grey Cup at the 93rd Canadian Football League championship game; in Iqaluit, Nunavut, she opened the Toonik Tyme Festival, where she donated eighty books in Inuktitut, French, and English to the Centennial Library in commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 80th birthday; and, on May 4, 2006, she became the first governor general to address the Alberta legislature. During these tours, Jean also focused strongly on the plight of female victims of violence, meeting with representatives of women&#x27;s organizations, such as when, in 2007, she participated in a historic private discussion with aboriginal women chiefs and elders at Saskatchewan&#x27;s Government House. In contrast to her low approval ratings prior to her appointment, crowds were large and welcoming wherever Jean went. Only as her convoy arrived at the National War Memorial for her first Remembrance Day ceremony, on November 11, 2005, were Jean and Lafond greeted with disapproval from an audience, when veterans turned their backs on the Governor General and her consort to show contempt for two people the veterans felt had worked to break up the country they had fought to defend.

==== Military duties and welcomes overseas ====
The viceregal family undertook their first international trip in February 2006, journeying to Italy to attend the closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics, meet Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in Torino, and Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican. Three months later, Jean attended the investiture of René Préval as President of Haiti, Jean&#x27;s first visit to her homeland in her capacity as the Queen&#x27;s representative, and where she was greeted with enthusiasm in Jacmel. At the end of the year, between November 18 and December 11, 2006, Jean then embarked on a trip consisting of state visits to five African countries—Algeria, Mali, Ghana, South Africa, and Morocco—wherein the Governor General encouraged women&#x27;s rights. She also, in a precedent-breaking move, personally explained on her Citizen Voices website the role of the governor general in undertaking such trips and the reason behind these particular tours throughout Africa, after which she continued to post her observations and feelings on her experiences on the continent. In Mali, where she arrived on November 23, 2006, Jean was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the highway as her motorcade passed and, in the town of Benieli, she was presented with a goat, replete with a Canadian flag on its collar. Male vendors also gave Canadian journalists gifts to be passed on to Jean, provided that she also be given their telephone numbers. Further, during the South African leg of the tour, then President Thabo Mbeki praised the Queen-in-Council&#x27;s decision to appoint Jean as governor general, citing it as an example to European countries of how African immigrants could be treated.

Jean embraced her role as acting commander-in-chief, one of her first international duties being a trip, from October 29–30, 2005, to France for the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at Trenton, Ontario, of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women&#x27;s Day, stating: &quot;the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I am here to tell them that they are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan.&quot; Part of the Governor General&#x27;s itinerary included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, Royal Canadian Mounted Police teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.

==== &quot;Loose cannon&quot; accusation ====
There was, by early 2007, some perception that Jean&#x27;s schedule was seemingly thinner than that of her predecessors; an initial explanation of fatigue was further detailed by the Secretary to the Governor General as thyroid problems, and that the vicereine&#x27;s doctor had advised rest after Jean&#x27;s previously hectic diary. At the same time, some in the Ottawa Press Gallery opined that Jean had on a few occasions in the previous year overstepped the boundaries of an office that was expected to remain non-partisan; journalist Chantal Hébert said that the Governor General had &quot;been wading uncommonly deep in political territory over the past few months&quot;, citing Jean&#x27;s criticism of Quebec sovereigntists and her expressed support for the mission of Canadian troops in Afghanistan. Further, Michael Valpy penned a piece in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; critiquing Jean for inviting who Valpy described as &quot;potentially politically charged individuals&quot; to post on her Citizen Voices website. Jean had also made, at the roast-like annual National Press Gallery dinner, satirical remarks about Parti Québécois leadership candidate André Boisclair&#x27;s admitted cocaine use and, in a September 18, 2006 interview regarding a proposed subsidy for Canadians to travel domestically, she commented that Quebecers &quot;are sometimes very disconnected from the rest of Canada&quot; and that their isolation affected Canada&#x27;s unity. Jean later clarified her opinion by adding that Canadians from all provinces were disconnected from other parts of the country, and a September 26 editorial in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; supported Jean&#x27;s statements on the divisions between Canada&#x27;s peoples, saying that supporting national unity was a part of a governor general&#x27;s mandate; but, the ire of Quebec separatist politicians was not assuaged. Further, the content of a speech by Jean to mark the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was regarded as thinly veiled criticism of her Cabinet&#x27;s decision to end the Court Challenges Program and, into 2007, it was reported that Jean&#x27;s staff at Rideau Hall had been systematically removing royal portraits from the walls of the residence. All of this prompted Valpy to reveal that, early in his time as prime minister, Stephen Harper was told by Alex Himelfarb, then the Clerk of the Privy Council: &quot;Prime Minister, your biggest problem is in Rideau Hall,&quot; meaning Jean and her potential to be a &quot;loose cannon&quot;.

Jean carried out the regular ceremonial duties of state, such as dedicating the new Michael Lee-Chin Crystal at the Royal Ontario Museum on June 1, 2007 (following in the footsteps of her predecessor, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the governor general who opened the first expansion of the museum in 1914), and undertaking a state visit to Brazil, from July 6–15, 2007.

==== Parliamentary prorogation ====
In late 2008, the Governor General had to return to Canada in the midst of a state visit in Europe to contend with a parliamentary dispute, as a coalition of three opposition parties in parliament threatened to rescind their confidence in the Cabinet under the leadership of Stephen Harper and subsequently form the government. After two and half hours of deliberation, Jean chose to follow the constitutional precedent of accepting her prime minister&#x27;s advice, which was to prorogue parliament until late January 2009. At the end of Jean&#x27;s viceregal tenure, Peter H. Russell, one of the constitutional experts from whom Jean sought advice, disclosed that the Governor General granted the prorogation on two conditions: parliament would reconvene soon and, when it did, the Cabinet would produce a passable budget. This, Russell said, set a precedent that would prevent future prime ministers from advising the prorogation of parliament &quot;for any length of time for any reason.&quot; Jean thus prevented the approaching non-confidence vote, as well as a resulting situation wherein she would be required to choose between asking the coalition to form a government or dissolving parliament and dropping the writs, after having a federal election only six weeks earlier. Along with the subsequent prorogation of parliament in December 2009 and the earlier calling of an election in October 2008, Jean was for almost two years part of a controversy in the Canadian media that focused on the constitutional relationships between the governor general and the prime minister or the leaders of the parties in opposition.

==== Seal meat, new uniforms, and crisis in Haiti ====
During a tour of Nunavut in early 2009, the Governor General again garnered headlines when she participated in a traditional Inuit seal feast at a community festival, gutting a seal that had been recently killed by hunters and consuming a piece of the raw heart. While both her immediate predecessor and Prince Charles had previously partaken in raw seal meat in the Canadian Arctic, Jean&#x27;s simple act drew attention, both positive and negative, because of its coincidence with the European Parliament&#x27;s recent ban on the import of Canadian seal products. Dining on seal was a traditional aspect of the annual event and it was proper etiquette for the Governor General, as a guest, to take part. When asked by reporters what her motivations were, Jean replied: &quot;Take from that what you will.&quot;

A series of state visits followed in 2009, to Norway, Croatia, Greece, and Mexico, as well as another visit to Canadian troops in Afghanistan from September 8–9. In between these diplomatic missions, Jean presided on June 27 over the ceremonies in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for the consecration and presentation of the new Queen&#x27;s Colour to the Canadian navy; she wore at that time the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s naval uniform, marking the revival of a practice that had ceased following the tenure of Ray Hnatyshyn. She, along with Prince Charles, did the same at the 2009 Remembrance Day events in Ottawa, both at that time sporting Canadian army dress uniform. Then, in June 2010, Jean conducted a fleet review in Esquimalt Harbour, to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Canadian Navy.

The vicereine again won plaudits, though not universal, from the media and public for her actions following the earthquake that devastated her native Haiti on January 12, 2010, in which she lost her friend Magalie Marcelin, godmother to Jean&#x27;s daughter. The Governor General, with her prime minister, Stephen Harper, attended an emergency meeting at the Department of Foreign Affairs and then made a tearful speech, with parts in Haitian Creole, thanking the Cabinet for its swift action and the Canadian media for its coverage, as well as urging strength and courage to Haitians. She later attended a vigil in Montreal and, on January 25, 2010, met at Rideau Hall with Haitian prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive. After officially opening the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, on February 12, and the Winter Paralympics a month later, the Governor General made a visit to Haiti, from March 8–10, 2010, to observe the devastation and Canadian assistance being meted out there and to meet with President Préval.

==== End of tenure ====
Jean announced to the press in early 2010 that she would step out of the viceregal role near the end of the traditional, but not official, five-year period. The then official opposition leader, Michael Ignatieff, publicly advocated the extension of Jean&#x27;s tenure, in doing so breaking the tradition of keeping consultations on the next governor general among the prime minister and opposition party leaders confidential. Polls conducted around that time showed that Jean had earned an approval rating of 60%, and a constitutional expert at the University of Toronto called her performance as governor general &quot;superb&quot;, though some of her missteps were noted.
On May 10, 2010, Princess Margriet of the Netherlands presented Jean with a new tulip cultivar named the &quot;Michaëlle Jean tulip&quot;; with deep maroon petals; it was designed to reflect the Governor General&#x27;s personal tastes. This carried on the tradition of Dutch royalty giving tulips as gifts to Canada.

Summaries of Jean&#x27;s time as the Queen&#x27;s representative emerged by mid-2010; Jean was regarded as having fulfilled the role in an admirable, though not perfect, fashion. It was noted that she used the office, her speaking abilities, and photogenic nature to Canada&#x27;s advantage, promoting freedom, human rights, and urban youth, and to bring attention to socio-economic problems in the country&#x27;s north. She was commended for her dedication to the arts, Aboriginal Canadians, the Armed Forces, and her outreach to Haiti following the earthquake there, but critiqued for specific incidents, such as referring to herself as Canada&#x27;s head of state and making public comments that skirted the political. Her ability to personally connect with those she met was also noted, as well as her frequent displays of emotion; commentators dubbed her the &quot;empathizer-in-chief&quot;.

== Post-viceregal life ==
In the weeks before Jean&#x27;s departure from the viceregal office, the Cabinet announced that the Michaëlle Jean Foundation would be established by the federal Crown-in-Council to focus on promoting education, culture, and creativity among youth from rural, northern, and/or poor communities in Canada. It was also reported that the Secretary-General of the United Nations would be appointing Jean to act as special envoy to Haiti for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, with an aim to fight poverty and illiteracy and raise international funds. She was on November 8, 2010, appointed for a four-year term. Although the position&#x27;s office is located in Paris, France, Jean opted to remain in Canada and base herself out of space provided by the University of Ottawa and rented by the Michaëlle Jean Foundation. In early 2011, Jean made a call for the overhaul of Haiti&#x27;s education system, as &quot;the cornerstone of the impoverished nation&#x27;s future prosperity.&quot; Also that year, it was announced that Jean had been appointed as Chancellor of the University of Ottawa; she began her term on February 1, 2012, and stepped down in 2015.

In 2023, Jean was announced as the distinguished keynote speaker for Canada&#x27;s Supporting Women in Film Trades (SWIFT) 2023 Conference held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. At a SWIFT press conference at Frank Digital&#x27;s Studio, the event&#x27;s Executive Director Adam Smoluk praised Jean&#x27;s accomplishments and stated, &quot;As a woman who made strides in male-dominated fields including politics, journalism, and filmmaking, Jean was a natural choice to headline the conference.&quot;

== Secretary-General of La Francophonie ==
Secretary-General of La Francophonie Abdou Diouf, in April 2011, appointed Jean as the &quot;Grand Témoin de la Francophonie&quot; for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, with the task of promoting the French language and ensuring compliance by the London Olympic Organising Committee with rule 24 of the Olympic Charter, which gives French the status of an official language of the Olympic Games.

In 2014, the Canadian federal government, along with the provincial governments of Quebec and New Brunswick, as well as the government of Haiti endorsed Jean&#x27;s candidacy to be Diouf&#x27;s successor as Secretary-General of La Francophonie. On November 30, 2014, the representatives of governments of the 57-member organization chose Jean for the position by consensus after the four other candidates withdrew.

Her four-year mandate began January 5, 2015, and she has since promoted democratic procedures—particularly in respect to elections in the Central African Republic, Niger, Comoros, and Benin—education, and the rights of women and girls.

Jean sought a mandate for a second four-year term at the 2018 Francophonie Summit in Armenia, however, France and eventually Canada supported the consensus candidate, Rwandan foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo. Jean has been criticized for expenses such as spending $500,000 to renovate her Paris apartment, a $50,000 bill for four nights at Manhattan&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria hotel, the acquisition of a $20,000 piano and the $1-million price tag for a youth-engagement program carried out aboard the replica of a historic 18th century ship, the &quot;Hermione&quot;.

Jean was defeated in her bid for a second term when the 2018 Francophonie summit held in Armenia agreed, by consensus, to elect Rwandan foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo as secretary-general. Jean&#x27;s term in office ended on January 2, 2019.

== Chancellor of St. Paul&#x27;s University College ==

Jean was named to succeed Jean Paul Gladu as chancellor of St. Paul&#x27;s University College in late October 2020. The school, which is affiliated with the University of Waterloo, offers programs in Indigenous Studies, International Development, Canadian Studies and Human Rights while also being home to the Waterloo Indigenous Student Centre, the Student Refugee Program, and GreenHouse, a nationally-recognized social enterprise incubator.

== Head of the Fédération haïtienne de football ==

Jean was given the mandate to revive Haitian soccer from 2021 to 2022 after a sex scandal involving the former president. Jean and her three colleagues were to organize the election of the next FHF executive committee. None of them were eligible for the vacancies.

<doc id="594895" wikidata="Q389781" url="?curid=594895" title="Ridge Racer">
<text>is a series of racing video games created by Namco and owned by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The first game, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; (1993), was originally released in arcades for the Namco System 22 hardware, later ported to the PlayStation one year later as a launch title. It was met with several sequels and spin-off games for multiple platforms, the latest being the mobile game &quot;Ridge Racer Draw &amp; Drift&quot; (2016) and the latest mainline game, developed in-house, was &quot;Ridge Racer 7&quot; (2006). Gameplay involves the player racing against computer-controlled opponents to be the first to finish in a race. Drifting is a core aspect of the series and is used to keep speed while turning corners; &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; pioneered the real-life technique in video games. The series is considered influential to the racing game genre.

== History ==
&quot;Ridge Racer&quot; is a spiritual successor to &quot;Sim Drive&quot; (1992), a racing simulation game met with a limited release in Japanese arcades using an actual body of a Mazda Eunos Roadster. Originally meant as an F1 racing game, similar to Namco&#x27;s own &quot;Pole Position&quot; and &quot;Final Lap&quot; series, it was instead replaced with racing on mountain roads, a popular trend for Japanese car enthusiasts at the time. The PlayStation version was a launch title for the console and an astounding success for both Namco, prompting the creation of several sequels for arcades and home platforms.

Earlier &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; games received critical acclaim for their graphics, gameplay, and musical score, many citing it as a contributing factor to the success of the PlayStation in its early years. Later entries were criticized for straying too far from the source material and lack of content, with &quot;Ridge Racer Vita&quot; (2011) being the first game to receive generally negative reception from critics; its base content was considered extremely lacking, with the player forced to obtain the vast majority of additional content by purchasing DLC. The last mainline title, &quot;Ridge Racer Unbounded&quot; (2012) received mixed-to-average reception from critics.

Two other versions of the game were released for arcades: Ridge Racer Full Scale, which featured a replica Eunos Roadster that the player sat in to control the game, and Ridge Racer: 3-Screen Edition, which used three different monitors to provide a peripheral vision effect, similar to Namco&#x27;s earlier game &quot;Driver&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (1991).

==Common elements==

The basic gameplay of the &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; series has remained relatively consistent throughout each installment. The objective is to race against computer-controlled opponents to finish each track in first place — the player begins the game in last place, and have a limited number of laps around the track to complete where they can overtake opponents. Some entries have a time limit that the player must race against, with each completed lap extending the timer; if the timer reaches zero, the game ends regardless of which lap the player was on. Later entries remove the timer and instead requires the player to finish the race in a minimum-assigned place to advance to the next course.

Unlike other racing games, which usually feature closed circuits, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; instead has races laid out on streets, beaches, cities and mountains, taking place in the fictional coastal metropolis &quot;Ridge City&quot; — circuit tracks are included in some entries. Nearly every entry in the series features the original tracks from &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; and &quot;Ridge Racer 2&quot;, sometimes modified to accompany for certain mechanics. Players can drift their car around corners to maintain speed, as most of the tracks were based on real-world locations that were not intended for race speeds. &quot;Ridge Racer Unbounded&quot; (2012) removes the drifting mechanic in favor of vehicular combat, similar to the &quot;Burnout&quot; franchise.

The playable cars each have their own stats and mechanics, such as a faster speed or improved drifting. Many of these are also named after older Namco video games, including &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, &quot;NebulasRay&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, &quot;Bosconian&quot; and &quot;Solvalou&quot;. The PlayStation sequel &quot;R4: Ridge Racer Type 4&quot; introduces the concept of racing teams for the series, all being named after &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, &quot;Mappy&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot; and &quot;Galaga&quot;. Similar to Namco&#x27;s own &quot;Tekken&quot; series, several games feature classic Namco arcade games as short minigames that play during loading screens, a mechanic that was later trademarked by Namco — the PlayStation home port of the original &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; features &quot;Galaxian&quot;, while &quot;Ridge Racers&quot; features &quot;New Rally-X&quot;. Completing these minigames will award the player with new tracks or cars, sometimes unlocking a full emulated version of the minigame to play.

===Automakers===
Starting with &quot;Rage Racer&quot;, each game offers cars with fictional automakers and model names. Certain manufacturers specialize in a particular component of their cars&#x27; performance, such as top speed, grip, and acceleration:

* Kamata (based on Mitsubishi and Nissan) – A Japanese brand specializing in basic all-rounder sports coupes and hatchbacks. They also make the Angelus supercar, one of the fastest cars in the entire series.
* Terrazi (based on Honda) – A Japanese brand specializing in all-rounder cars with bizarre designs, including the Wildboar (a futuristic three-wheeled car exclusive to &quot;Ridge Racer Type 4&quot;).
* Lizard/Danver (based on Ford and General Motors) – An American brand specializing in muscle and sports cars with high acceleration. In &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; lore, Danver have acquired the names and assets of the Bayonet and Hijack from Lizard following their bankruptcy and liquidation, which occurs after the events of &quot;Ridge Racer Type 4&quot;.
* Âge (Âge Solo in &quot;Ridge Racer Type 4&quot;, based on Renault) – A French brand specializing in compacts and sports cars with excellent grip.
* Assoluto (based on Ferrari and Lamborghini) – An Italian brand specializing in high-performance sports cars and supercars with high top speeds and unique designs.
* Rivelta/Soldat (based on Bugatti and Ferrari) – A French-Italian brand specializing in supercars. They also make the Rumeur hatchback, a car with incredible top speed and handling, as well as the Crinale, or &quot;13th Racing&quot;, known as the original &quot;Devil&quot; car that was the rival of the Kamata Angelus. By the events of &quot;Ridge Racer (2004)&quot;, French automaker Soldat had bought out Italian manufacturer, Rivelta.
* Gnade (based on Audi and BMW) – A German brand specializing in all-rounder luxury and sports coupes and sedans.
* Himmel (based on Porsche) – A German brand specializing in rear-engined sports cars.
* Sinseong Motors (based on Hyundai) – A South Korean brand exclusive to &quot;Ridge Racer 7&quot; that specializes in luxury sports coupes.
* Lucky &amp; Wild (based on General Motors) - First introduced in &quot;Ridge Racer 3D&quot;, they are an American manufacturer of modern muscle cars and is a fellow rival to Danver. They are also the manufacturer of the Wisdom, formerly a trademark of the now-defunct Lizard. The name of this manufacturer is taken from the Namco arcade game of the same name.

=== Reiko Nagase ===

Designed by Kei Yoshimizu, Reiko Nagase is a virtual idol fictional character who is the mascot and &quot;host&quot; of the &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; series. Described as a race queen from Tokyo, Reiko officially first appeared and was named in &quot;Rage Racer&quot; (1996), in the game&#x27;s full motion video intro directed by Kei Yoshimizu from Keica, also appearing in-game. In &quot;R4: Ridge Racer Type 4&quot; (1998), she was given more prominence, as the opening animation, which used a song by Kimara Lovelace, was a short story starring her. &quot;Type 4&quot; also introduced a redesign to her 3D model by Kei Yoshimizu. This is when Namco started giving more exposure to the character, heavily using her image to promote the game. She also appears in &quot;Ridge Racer 64&quot; (2000).

In 2000, Namco decided to replace Reiko in &quot;Ridge Racer V&quot; with newcomer . The character also influenced Namco to create other virtual idols: the aforementioned Hitomi Yoshino, whose most notable appearance outside Japan was in &quot;MotoGP 2&quot; and &quot;MotoGP 3&quot;; Rena Hayami of &quot;&quot;; and several characters under the name in the &quot;Ace Combat&quot; series, who bear a resemblance to Reiko Nagase. One of them, a selectable wingman in &quot;Ace Combat 2&quot; (1997), was officially identified as Reiko&#x27;s younger sister born. Reiko also made appearances in other games – most of them featuring her in the white-and-red outfit from the &quot;R4: Ridge Racer Type 4&quot; promotional artwork – including &quot;Anna Kournikova&#x27;s Smash Court Tennis&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;, and as a bot in 2024&#x27;s &quot;Astro Bot&quot;. In March 1999, she was featured in the PlayStation 2 pre-launch real-time technology demo program as the &quot;Ridge Racer Girl&quot;. The character has also been featured in other products licensed by Namco, including the first and sixth wave of Namco Gals gashapon and other figurines and garage kits by various manufacturers.

==Reception==
The original &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; was very well received by critics for its 3D graphics, audio, and the drifting mechanics. It also received an admirable port to the PlayStation, where it became one of the best selling titles in the console&#x27;s early lifetime. It is also considered as playing a part in giving Sony&#x27;s system an edge over rival Sega&#x27;s Saturn during 1994–1995.

Its sequels during the 1990s were also highly successful, in particular &quot;Ridge Racer Type 4&quot;, often considered the series&#x27; best. Its sequel &quot;Ridge Racer V&quot; received more mediocre reviews, but the subsequent PSP title achieved very high praise. The series&#x27; &#x27;idol&#x27; mascot Reiko Nagase, who has appeared in most games since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Rage Racer&quot;, has often been rated among the most recognizable female characters in video games.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; series as number 11 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;there are certainly better car simulations, but when it comes to fun, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, the game that helped make PlayStation cool, is the one we come back to&quot;.

The 2011 Vita title was negatively received for various reasons, whilst the latest console game, &quot;Ridge Racer Unbounded&quot;, was marked with a departure from the drifting style and mechanics of what the series is known for, experimenting with a more destructive style similar to the &quot;Burnout&quot; series, although &quot;Ridge Racer 3D&quot;, a launch title for the 3DS, was better received compared to &quot;Vita&quot; and &quot;Unbounded&quot;. The game was never as popular as its previous main titles and never had a Japanese release either.

<text>Elinor Glyn ( Sutherland; 17 October 1864 – 23 September 1943) was a British novelist and scriptwriter who specialised in romantic fiction, which was considered scandalous for its time, although her works are relatively tame by modern standards. She popularized the concept of the &quot;it girl&quot;, and had tremendous influence on early 20th-century popular culture and, possibly, on the careers of notable Hollywood stars such as Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson and, especially, Clara Bow.

==Early life and family background==
Elinor Sutherland was born on 17 October 1864 in Saint Helier, Jersey, in the Channel Islands. She was the younger daughter of Douglas Sutherland (1838–1865), a civil engineer of Scottish descent, and his wife Elinor Saunders (1841–1937), of an Anglo-French family that had settled in Canada. Her father was said to be related to the Lords Duffus.

Her father died when she was two months old; her mother returned to the parental home in Guelph, in what was then Upper Canada, British North America (now Ontario) with her two daughters. Here, young Elinor was taught by her grandmother, Lucy Anne Saunders (&quot;née&quot; Willcocks), daughter of Sir Richard Willcocks, a magistrate in the early Irish police force, who helped to suppress the Emmet Rising in 1803. Richard&#x27;s brother Joseph also settled in Upper Canada, publishing one of the first opposition papers there, pursuing liberty, and dying a rebel in 1814. The Anglo-Irish grandmother instructed young Elinor in the ways of upper-class society. This training not only gave her an entrée into aristocratic circles on her return to Europe, it also led to her reputation as an authority on style and breeding when she worked in Hollywood in the 1920s. Her grandfather on her mother&#x27;s side, Thomas Saunders (1795–1873) was a direct descendant of the Saunders family who had possessed Pitchcott Manor in Buckinghamshire for several centuries.

The family lived in Guelph for seven years at a stone home that still stands near the University of Guelph. Glyn&#x27;s mother remarried in 1871 to David Kennedy, and the family returned to Jersey when Glyn was about eight years old. Her subsequent education at her stepfather&#x27;s house was by governesses. Glyn&#x27;s elder sister grew up to be Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, famous as a fashion designer under the name &quot;Lucile&quot;.

==Life and career==
Elinor married on 27 April 1892, at the age of 28. Her husband was Clayton Louis Glyn (13 July 1857 – 10 November 1915), a wealthy but spendthrift barrister and Essex landowner who was descended from Sir Richard Carr Glyn, an 18th-century Lord Mayor of London. The couple had two daughters, Margot and Juliet, but the marriage foundered on mutual incompatibility.

Glyn began writing in 1900, starting with &quot;Visits of Elizabeth&quot;, serialised in &quot;The World&quot;, a book based on letters to her mother, although Lady Angela Forbes claimed, in her memoirs, that Glyn used her as the prototype of Elizabeth. As Glyn&#x27;s husband fell into debt from around 1908, she wrote at least one novel a year to keep up her standard of living. 

Her marriage was troubled, and Glyn began having affairs with various British aristocrats. Her novel &quot;Three Weeks&quot;, about a Balkan queen who seduces a young British aristocrat, was allegedly inspired by her affair with Lord Alistair Innes Ker, brother of the Duke of Roxburghe, sixteen years her junior, which scandalized Edwardian society.

Around 1907, Glyn toured the United States, resulting in her book &quot;Elizabeth visits America&quot; (1909).&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=LpI6AQAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg.org/11900&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Glyn had a long affair between circa 1907 and 1916 with Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy of India. Society painter Philip de László painted her in 1912, when she was 48. Curzon is presumed to have commissioned it and had given Glyn the sapphires she wears in the portrait. In 1915, Curzon leased Montacute House, in South Somerset, for him and Glyn, now a widow as her husband had died that autumn at the age of 58 after several years of illness. Curzon asked Glyn to decorate Montacute House and with Glyn away from London, Curzon courted heiress Grace Duggan. Glyn learned of Curzon and Duggan&#x27;s engagement from the morning papers and burnt 500 love letters in the bedroom fireplace, never speaking to Curzon again.

Glyn pioneered risqué, and sometimes erotic, romantic fiction aimed at a female readership, a radical idea for its time. In her novel &quot;The Man and the Moment&quot; (1914), she coined the use of the word &quot;it&quot; to mean a characteristic that &quot;draws all others with magnetic force. With &#x27;IT&#x27; you win all men if you are a woman–and all women if you are a man. &#x27;IT&#x27; can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.&quot; Her use of the word is often erroneously taken to simply be a euphemism for sexuality or sex appeal.

During World War I, Glyn became a war correspondent, working in France. At the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 28 June 1919, Glyn was one of only two women present.&lt;ref name=&quot;online-literature/elinor-glyn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Glyn went to Hollywood, for the filming of her novel &quot;The Great Moment&quot;. In 1919, she signed a contract with William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s International Magazine Company to write stories and articles that included a clause for the motion picture rights. She was brought over from England to write screenplays by the Famous Players–Lasky production company.
She wrote for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and other Hearst press titles, advising women on how to keep their men and imparting health and beauty tips. &quot;The Elinor Glyn System of Writing&quot; (1922) gives insights into writing for Hollywood studios and magazine editors of the time.

Glyn was one of the most famous women screenwriters in the 1920s. She has 28 story or screenwriting credits, three producing credits, and two credits for directing. Her first script was called &quot;The Great Moment&quot; and starred Gloria Swanson. 

Glyn was responsible for many screenplays in the 1920s, including &quot;Six Hours&quot; (1923) and the film version of her novel &quot;Three Weeks&quot; (1924). Other films she wrote were &quot;His Hour&quot; (1924), directed by King Vidor; &quot;Love&#x27;s Blindness&quot; (1926), about a marriage that is done strictly for financial reasons; &quot;Man and Maid&quot; (1925), about a man who must choose between two women; &quot;The Only Thing&quot; (1925); and &quot;Ritzy&quot; (1927). Three screenplays based on Glyn&#x27;s novels and a story in the mid to late twenties, &quot;Man and Maid&quot;, &quot;The Only Thing&quot;, and &quot;Ritzy,&quot; did not do well at the box office, despite the success Glyn gained with her first project, &quot;The Great Moment&quot;, which was in the same genre. In 1929 she wrote her first non-silent film, &quot;Such Men Are Dangerous&quot;, her last film writing in the United States.

Apart from being a scriptwriter for the silent movie industry, working for both MGM and Paramount Pictures in Hollywood in the mid-1920s, she had a brief career as one of the earliest female directors. In addition to being credited as an author, adapter, and co-producer on the 1927 film adaptation of &quot;It&quot;, she also made a cameo appearance.

She is credited with the re-styling of Gloria Swanson from giggly starlet to elegant star. The duo connected again when &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot; was made into a silent film that was released in 1922. The Sam Wood–directed film stars Swanson and Rudolph Valentino as a romantic pair. In 1927, Glyn helped to make a star of actress Clara Bow, for whom she coined the sobriquet &quot;the It girl.&quot; In 1928, Bow also starred in &quot;Red Hair&quot;, which was based on Glyn&#x27;s 1905 novel of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg/17821&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a comedy vehicle to demonstrate the supposed passion of red-haired people. 

Glyn returned home to England in 1929 in part because of tax demands. With her return she set out to form her own production company, Elinor Glyn Ltd. Her family had established a company in 1924, Elinor Glyn Ltd, to which she signed her copyrights, receiving an income from the firm and an annuity in later life. The firm was an early pioneer of cross-media branding. After she started the company, she began working as a film director as well. Paying out of her own pocket, she directed &quot;Knowing Men&quot; in 1930, which showed a more traditionalist view of men as sexual harassers. The project was a disaster, and the screenwriter Edward Knoblock sued Glyn so that the work could not be released. Elinor Glyn Ltd produced a second film in 1930, &quot;The Price of Things&quot;, which was also unsuccessful and was never released in the US. As her company failed and she exhausted her finances, Glyn decided to retire from film work and instead focus on her first passion, writing novels.

==Death==
After a short illness, Glyn died on 23 September 1943, at 39 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London, aged 78, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. Her ashes lie above the door to the Jewish Shrine at the west end of the columbarium.

==Descendants==
* Margot Elinor Glyn, later Margot, Lady Davson OBE (June 1893 – 10 September 1966 in Rome); she married Sir Edward Rae Davson, 1st Baronet (14 September 1875 – 9 August 1937) in 1921 and had two sons:
**Anthony Glyn (13 March 1922 – 20 January 1998), author, previously Sir Geoffrey Leo Simon Davson, 2nd Baronet. He was born Geoffrey Leo Simon Davson, but he changed his name to Anthony Geoffrey Ian Simon Glyn by deed poll in 1957. In 1937, at the age of 15, he inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy (created in 1927) and became known as Sir Geoffrey Davson, 2nd Baronet. He was a prolific writer and in 1955 he published an entertaining if tactful biography of his maternal grandmother, Elinor Glyn. In 1946, he married his first cousin, Susan Rhys-Williams, daughter of Sir Rhys Rhys-Williams Bt. They had two daughters, Victoria and Caroline. The baronetcy thus passed to his younger brother, Christopher Davson.

==References in popular culture==

* A scene in Glyn&#x27;s most sensational work, &quot;Three Weeks&quot;, inspired the doggerel:
:&quot;Would you like to sin&quot;
:&quot;With Elinor Glyn&quot;
:&quot;On a tiger skin?&quot;
:&quot;Or would you prefer&quot;
:&quot;To err with her&quot;
:&quot;On some other fur?&quot;
* In his autobiography, Mark Twain describes the time he met Glyn, when they had a wide-ranging and frank discussion of &quot;nature&#x27;s laws&quot; and other matters not &quot;to be repeated,&quot; which Glyn published.&lt;ref name=&quot;twainquotes/ElinorGlynInterview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* She occasionally cited herself in the third person in her own books, as in &quot;Man and Maid&quot; (1922), when she has a character refer to &quot;that &#x27;It as something &quot;Elinor Glyn writes of in her books&quot;.
* In the 1923 film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, one title card says: &quot;Nobody believes in these Commandment things nowadays—and I think Elinor Glyn&#x27;s a lot more interesting.&quot;
* In the 1925 film &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, at around 1 hour and 2 minutes into the film, the following title appears: &quot;For a woman with all her money she&#x27;s got rotten taste in books. And me dying for Elinor Glyn&#x27;s latest!&quot;
* In S. J. Perelman&#x27;s series of pieces &quot;Cloudland Revisited&quot;, as a middle-aged man, he re-reads and describes the &quot;risqué&quot; novels that had thrilled him as a youth. The essay &quot;Tuberoses and Tigers&quot; deals with Glyn&#x27;s &quot;Three Weeks&quot;. Perelman described it as &quot;servant-girl literature&quot;, and called Glyn&#x27;s style &quot;marshmallow&quot;. He also mentions a film version of the book made by Samuel Goldwyn in 1924, in which Aileen Pringle starred. Perelman recalled Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;seductive&quot; image of Pringle &quot;lolling on a tiger skin.&quot;
* The Sigmund Romberg comic song &quot;It&quot; with lyrics by Edward Smith is featured in his popular operetta &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926).
* Glyn is also mentioned in a 1927 Lorenz Hart song &quot;My Heart Stood Still,&quot; from &quot;One Damn Thing After Another&quot;:
:&quot;I read my Plato&quot;
:&quot;Love, I thought a sin&quot;
:&quot;But since your kiss&quot;
:&quot;I&#x27;m reading missus Glyn!&quot;
* She made cameo appearances as herself in the 1927 film &quot;It&quot; and in the 1928 film &quot;Show People&quot;.
* Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; writes in her novel &quot;Unnatural death&quot; (1927 &quot;Never had he met a woman in whom &#x27;the great &quot;It, eloquently hymned by Mrs Elinor Glyn, was so completely lacking.&quot;

* In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;Men at Arms&quot; (the first of the &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy), an (RAF) Air Marshal recites the poem (above) upon spotting a polar bear rug by the fire in a London club, of which he has just wangled membership (p. 125). To this, another member responds, &quot;Who the hell is Elinor Glyn?&quot; The Air Marshal replies, &quot;Oh, just a name, you know, put in to make it rhyme.&quot; This was both a snub to the Air Marshal and a literary snubbing of Glyn by Waugh.
* In Stanley Donen&#x27;s 1954 biopic about Romberg, &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot;, the musical number &quot;It&quot; from the &quot;Artists and Models (revue)&quot; segment features dancer Ann Miller singing about Elinor Glyn and Sigmund Freud.
* In the 1962 film version of Meredith Willson&#x27;s musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;, Marian Paroo the librarian asks the prudish Mrs Shinn, the mayor&#x27;s wife, if she would not rather have her daughter reading the classic Persian poetry of Omar Khayyam than Elinor Glyn, to which Mrs Shinn replies: &quot;What Elinor Glyn reads is &quot;her&quot; mother&#x27;s problem!&quot;
* In &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, after Elizabeth Bellamy&#x27;s disastrous marriage, she meets a new lover, the social-climber Julius Karekin. After a passionate night, he sleeps while she reads part of Chapter XI of &quot;Three Weeks&quot; aloud.
* In the 2001 film &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;, Elinor Glyn, played by Joanna Lumley, is one of the guests aboard William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s yacht on the fateful weekend Thomas Ince died. Lumley, as Glyn, provides voice-over narration at the beginning and end of the film.
* In season five, episode three of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (set in 1924), the character Tom Branson refers to the scandalous nature of Elinor Glyn&#x27;s novels.
*In Chapter 2 of &quot;The Women&quot; by Hilton Als (1996), which discusses Dorothy Dean, Als juxtaposes Dean with Glyn. Als writes, &quot;This perceived antagonism with heterosexual men provided Dean with the resistance she needed to argue against her conventional fantasy of being someone&#x27;s girlfriend, someone&#x27;s Lady Glyn.&quot;

<text>was a town located in Ichishi District, Mie Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 11,480 and a density of 607.73 persons per km2. The total area was 18.89 km2.

On January 1, 2005, Mikumo, along the town of Ureshino (also from Ichishi District), and the towns of Iinan and Iitaka (both from Iinan District), was merged into the expanded city of Matsusaka and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

<text>A soda straw (or simply straw) is a speleothem in the form of a hollow mineral cylindrical tube. They are also known as tubular stalactites. Soda straws grow in places where water leaches slowly through cracks in rock, such as on the roofs of caves. Soda straws in caves rarely grow more than a few millimetres per year and may average one tenth of a millimetre per year. A soda straw can turn into a stalactite if the hole at the bottom is blocked, or if the water begins flowing on the outside surface of the hollow tube. Soda straws can also form outside the cave environment on exposed concrete surfaces as a type of calthemite, growing significantly faster than those formed on rock.

== Formation ==
These tubes form when calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate dissolved in the water comes out of solution and is deposited. In soda straws, as each drop hovers at the tip, it deposits a ring of mineral at its edge. It then falls and a new drop takes its place. Each successive drop of water deposits a little more mineral before falling, and eventually a tube is built up. Stalagmites or flowstone may form where the water drops hit the cave floor.

Soda straws are some of the most fragile of speleothems. Like helictites, they can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, soda straws are rarely seen within arm&#x27;s reach in show caves or others with unrestricted access. Kartchner Caverns in southern Arizona has well-preserved soda straws because of its recent discovery in 1974 and highly regulated traffic.

==Outside the cave environment==

Straws can also form beneath man-made structures and grow significantly faster than in the natural cave environment. These forms are classified as calthemites as opposed to the speleothems growing in natural environments. Their chemistry differs from those found in caves because they are derived from concrete, lime, mortar or other calcareous material.
Calthemite soda straws have been recorded as growing up to per day in length, which is hundreds of times faster than speleothem soda straw growth rates typically averaging 2 mm or less per year.

Calthemite straws are on average just 40% the mass per unit length of speleothem straws of equivalent external diameter. This is because calthemite straws have a thinner wall thickness and less-dense calcium carbonate structure compared to speleothem straws.

A calthemite straw can vary in outside diameter as it grows in length. Changes in diameter can take a matter of days or weeks and are due to changes in drip rate over time. Slow dripping calthemite straws tend to be slightly larger in diameter than fast-dripping straws. As a comparison, because of the much &quot;slower growth rate of speleothem (cave) straws, there is more chance that fluctuation in drip rate may be averaged out and the straw external diameter remains reasonably constant.&quot;

<text>Cyberware is a relatively new and unknown field (a proto-science, or more adequately a &quot;proto-technology&quot;). In science fiction circles, however, it is commonly known to mean the hardware or machine parts implanted in the human body and acting as an interface between the central nervous system and the computers or machinery connected to it.

More formally:
:&quot;Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain&quot;.

Examples of potential cyberware cover a wide range, but current research tends to approach the field from one of two different angles: interfaces or prosthetics.

==Interfaces (&quot;headware&quot;)==
The first variety attempts to connect directly with the brain. The data-jack is probably the best-known, having heavily featured in works of fiction (even in mainstream productions such as &quot;Johnny Mnemonic,&quot; the cartoon &quot;Exosquad&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix&quot;). It is the most difficult object to implement, but it is also the most important in terms of interfacing directly with the mind. In science fiction the data-jack is the envisioned I/O port for the brain. Its job is to translate thoughts into something meaningful to a computer, and to translate something from a computer into meaningful thoughts for humans. Once perfected, it would allow direct communication between computers and the human mind.

Large university laboratories conduct most of the experiments done in the area of direct neural interfaces. For ethical reasons, the tests are usually performed on animals or slices of brain tissue from donor brains. The mainstream research focuses on electrical impulse monitoring, recording and translating the many different electrical signals that the brain transmits. A number of companies are working on what is essentially a &quot;hands-free&quot; mouse or keyboard. This technology uses these brain signals to control computer functions. These interfaces are sometimes called &quot;brain-machine interfaces&quot; (BMI).

The more intense research, concerning full in-brain interfaces, is being studied, but is in its infancy. Few can afford the huge cost of such enterprises, and those who can find the work slow-going and very far from the ultimate goals. Research has reached the level where limited control over a computer is possible using thought commands alone. After being implanted with a Massachusetts-based firm Cyberkinetics chip called BrainGate, a quadriplegic man was able to compose and check email.

==Prosthetics (&quot;bodyware&quot;)==

The second variety of cyberware consists of a more modern form of the rather old field of prosthetics. Modern prostheses attempt to deliver a natural functionality and appearance. In the sub-field where prosthetics and cyberware cross over, experiments have been done where microprocessors, capable of controlling the movements of an artificial limb, are attached to the severed nerve-endings of the patient. The patient is then taught how to operate the prosthetic, trying to learn how to move it as though it were a natural limb.

Crossing over between prostheses and interfaces are those pieces of equipment attempting to replace lost senses. An early success in this field is the &quot;cochlear implant&quot;. A tiny device inserted into the inner ear, it replaces the functionality of damaged, or missing, hair cells (the cells that, when stimulated, create the sensation of sound). This device comes firmly under the field of prosthetics, but experiments are also being performed to tap into the brain. Coupled with a speech-processor, this could be a direct link to the speech centres of the brain.

<doc id="594939" wikidata="Q4974295" url="?curid=594939" title="Brood X">
<text>Brood X (Brood 10), the Great Eastern Brood, is one of 15 broods of periodical cicadas that appear regularly throughout the eastern United States. The brood&#x27;s first major emergence after 2021 is predicted to occur during 2038.

==Characteristics==

Every 17 years, Brood X cicada nymphs tunnel upwards &quot;en masse&quot; to emerge from the surface of the ground. The insects then shed their exoskeletons on trees and other surfaces, thus becoming adults. The mature cicadas fly, mate, lay eggs in twigs, and then die within several weeks. The combination of the insects&#x27; long underground life, their nearly simultaneous emergence from the ground in vast numbers and their short period of adulthood allows the brood to survive even massive predation.
Brood X is endemic in Indiana, Ohio, southeastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, East Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, DC, and other areas throughout the eastern United States. The brood contains three species, &quot;Magicicada septendecim&quot;, &quot;Magicicada cassini&quot; and &quot;Magicicada septendecula&quot;, that congregate on different trees and have different male songs.
== History ==
=== 1700s emergences ===
The first known description of an emergence of Brood X appeared in a May 9, 1715, entry in the journal of Rev. Andreas Sandel, the pastor of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Gloria Dei&quot; Swedish Lutheran Church. In 1737, botanist John Bartram wrote a letter that described the periodicity of the brood&#x27;s emergences and his 1732 observations of the insect&#x27;s insertion of their eggs into the small branches of trees northwest of Philadelphia. Bartram later recorded in greater detail within two manuscripts the brood&#x27;s May 1749 emergence.

Pehr Kalm, a Finnish naturalist visiting Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1749 on behalf of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, observed in late May that year&#x27;s emergence of Brood X. When reporting the event in a paper that a Swedish academic journal published in 1756, Kalm wrote: 
Kalm then described Rev. Sandel&#x27;s report and one that he had obtained from Benjamin Franklin that had recorded in Philadelphia the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas during early May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years.

Kalm further noted that others had informed him that they had seen cicadas only occasionally before the insects emerged from the ground in Pennsylvania in large swarms on May 22, 1749. He additionally stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749. The 1715 and 1732 reports, when coupled with his own 1749 and 1750 observations, supported the previous &quot;general opinion&quot; that he had cited.

Kalm summarized his findings in a book translated into English and published in London in 1771, stating:There are a kind of &quot;Locusts&quot; which about every seventeen years come hither in incredible numbers ... In the interval between the years when they are so numerous, they are only seen or heard single in the woods.

Moses Bartram, a son of John Bartram, described the 1766 emergence of Brood X in an article entitled &quot;Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years&quot; that a London journal published in 1768. Bartram noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and &quot;entered the first opening that they could find&quot;. He reported that he had been able to discover them below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them deep.
In April 1800, Benjamin Banneker, who lived near Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a &quot;great locust year&quot; in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be &quot;full as numerous as the first&quot;, and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects (Brood X) &quot;may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me&quot;. Describing an effect that the pathogenic fungus, &quot;Massospora cicadina&quot;, has on its host, Banneker&#x27;s record book stated that the insects:... begin to Sing or make a noise from first they come out of the Earth till they die. The hindermost part rots off, and it does not appear to be any pain to them, for they still continue on Singing till they die.

=== 1902 emergence ===
Brood X was present in Nassau and Suffolk counties on New York&#x27;s Long Island, which was the easternmost territory for the brood.

=== 1919 emergence ===
Nassau County farmers in Massapequa and Farmingdale reported cicada damage to fruit trees from the brood&#x27;s emergence.

=== 1936 emergence ===
The Nassau County Farm Bureau warned drivers that the brood&#x27;s emergence in the area might be heavy enough to clog radiators as the brood began to emerge in mid-June.

=== 1970 emergence ===
Long Island homeowners described the noise from Brood X as &quot;tremendous.&quot;

=== 1987 emergence ===
Brood X was present on Long Island. A horticultural expert from New York&#x27;s extension office predicted that the brood&#x27;s territory on Long Island would decrease because of development.

=== 2004 emergence ===
The brood had a major emergence during the spring of 2004. The Baltimore region&#x27;s emergence began around May 11 and was falling silent by June 5. Emergences began in the Washington, D.C., area and in Ohio around May 13. The D.C. area&#x27;s emergence was peaking by May 21.

Long Island&#x27;s population of Brood X had nearly disappeared by the time of the 2004 emergence. An entomologist with Cornell University&#x27;s integrated pest management program suggested that widespread tree removal during development and pesticide use on the island had caused the brood&#x27;s extirpation there.

=== 2021 emergence ===

The brood&#x27;s 2021 expected emergence in 15 states (Delaware, Illinois, Georgia, Indiana, New York, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Michigan), as well as in Washington, D.C., began in April. Emergent cicadas were observed in western North Carolina during mid-April.

Although a cold snap delayed emergences, more of the insects appeared as temperatures rose into the 60s. By May 6, large numbers of the insects had emerged there, while others had been reported in Maryland near Washington, D.C., and on the Tennessee-North Carolina border.

By May 7 the brood was emerging in the Philadelphia area, in Pittsburgh, and in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By May 10, people were reporting emergences in Washington, D.C., Bethesda, Maryland, Knoxville, Tennessee, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago and St. Louis and by May 19 in Baltimore. By May 20 the emergence was reaching its peak in Washington, D.C. and its inner suburbs. On June 8, small numbers of cicadas were heard in Connetquot River State Park Preserve in Suffolk County on New York&#x27;s Long Island.

On June 8, while the press corps was preparing to cover Joe Biden&#x27;s first trip abroad of his presidency, its chartered plane was grounded at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia after cicadas clogged the plane&#x27;s auxiliary power unit. The next day, Biden swatted a cicada that had landed on his neck while he was standing on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before boarding Air Force One to begin his flight to England.

By June 16, the population of living cicadas was declining and dead cicadas were accumulating in the Washington metropolitan area. The cicadas were gone from the Washington–Baltimore area by June 21. On July 26, the eggs that the cicadas had laid in the area were hatching.

Many reports of itchy oak leaf mite (&quot;itch mite&quot;) (&quot;Pyemotes herfsi&quot;) bites on people&#x27;s necks, shoulders and chests appeared in the Washington metropolitan area in late July and August, after the emergence had ended. The mite usually feeds on oak leaf gall midge (&quot;Polystepha pilulae&quot;) larvae and other insects, but becomes an ectoparasite of periodical cicada eggs and quickly reproduces when those are available.

=== Off-cycle emergences ===
Significant numbers of periodical cicadas, believed to be Brood X emergents that were four years early, appeared throughout the brood&#x27;s range in 2000 and in the Baltimore, Maryland–Washington, D.C. area in May 2017.

== Popular culture ==
During a year that Brood X emerged and Ogden Nash was living in Baltimore, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine published Nash&#x27;s June 12, 1936, poem &quot;Locust-Lovers, Attention!&quot;. Nash&#x27;s 1938 collection &quot;I&#x27;m a Stranger Here Myself&quot; reprinted the humorous verse. His poem &quot;The Sunset Years of Samuel Pride&quot; mentions the 17–year cyclical swarms of the &quot;locusts&quot;.

Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Day of the Locusts&quot; in his 1970 album &quot;New Morning&quot; refers to the Brood X cicadas that were noisily present in Princeton, New Jersey in June 1970 when Dylan received an honorary degree from Princeton University.

When Brood X re-emerged in 1987, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed in a radio address: &quot;Like the cicadas, the big spenders are hatching out again and threatening to overrun Congress.&quot; He then asked his listeners to support a balanced budget amendment and the line item veto to &quot;make the cicadas in Congress go back underground.&quot;

Brood X next emerged in 2004. During that year&#x27;s presidential election campaign, the Republican National Committee placed on the web an advertisement that compared Democratic candidate John Kerry to a periodical cicada. The ad portrayed a cicada&#x27;s face changing into a picture of a confused-looking Kerry while stating: Every 17 years, cicadas emerge, morph out of their shell, and change their appearance. Like a cicada, Senator Kerry would like to shed his Senate career and morph into a fiscal conservative, a centrist Democrat opposed to taxes, strong on defense.&quot;

Nate Powell&#x27;s 2008 graphic novel &quot;Swallow Me Whole&quot; thanks &quot;brood X cicadae of 2004&quot; on its acknowledgments page. His book&#x27;s front cover and last page contain cartoons depicting cicada swarms.

In 2015, singer-songwriter Keith M. Lyndaker Schlabach recorded the song &quot;Cicadance&quot; at the Rolling Ridge Study Retreat Community (RRSRC) near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The song&#x27;s background contains a field recording of the sound that Brood X produced at the RRSRC during its 2004 emergence. The song, which celebrates the brood, also references the brood&#x27;s most recent prior emergence in 1987.

During the brood&#x27;s 2021 emergence, country singer Toby T. Swift released the novelty song &quot;Cicada Love Call&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee. The song, which Swift first wrote during the brood&#x27;s 2004 emergence, compares to a cicada a woman who is trying to re-join her reluctant ex-husband after leaving him for another man 17 years earlier.

Also during the brood&#x27;s 2021 emergence, singer-songwriter Sue Fink released her &quot;Cicada Suite&quot;, which contains two songs entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Berate a Cicada&quot; and &quot;Hymn of the Cicada&quot;. The first song begins with a recording of the insect&#x27;s sound. Fink issued &quot;Cicada Suite&quot; on cicada-shaped flash drives.

<text>Henri Joseph Anastase Perrotin (December 19, 1845 – February 29, 1904) was a French astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets. Some sources give his middle name as Athanase.

In his early career, he and Guillaume Bigourdan were assistants of Félix Tisserand at Toulouse Observatory. Later, he was the first director of the Nice Observatory in Nice, France from 1884 until his death. He made observations of Mars and attempted to determine the rotation period of Venus. He also calculated perturbations in the orbit of 4 Vesta.

In the literature, he is sometimes referred to as Henri Perrotin and sometimes as Joseph Perrotin (this is indeed one and the same person). He is also referenced in H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; as &quot;Perrotin of Nice&quot;. His 6 asteroid discoveries are credited by the Minor Planet Center to &quot;J. Perrotin&quot;.

He won the Prix Lalande in 1875 and 1883. The Martian crater Perrotin and the inner main-belt asteroid 1515 Perrotin were named in his honor.

<doc id="594944" wikidata="Q5498609" url="?curid=594944" title="Frederick Reiken">
<text>Frederick Reiken (born 1966) is an American author from Livingston, New Jersey He has published three novels to critical acclaim, and he teaches creative writing at Emerson College.

== Early life and education ==
Reiken was born in New Jersey in 1966, and he attended the Pingry School. He earned a B.A. in Biology at Princeton University in 1988, where for his senior thesis he researched the behavioral ecology of island feral horses. He earned an M.F.A. at the University of California, Irvine, in 1992.

Reiken is married and has two daughters.

== Career ==

Reiken began thinking of himself as a writer after a poetry class at Princeton with J. D. McClatchy. In addition, Paul Auster&#x27;s introductory fiction course and John McPhee&#x27;s &quot;Literature of Fact&quot; course encouraged him to follow both his passions, science and writing. Following graduation in 1988, he went to the Negev desert as a wildlife biology researcher studying the population dynamics of &quot;Persian onagers&quot;, a species of wild ass.

After completing his M.F.A., in 1992–1993 he was an artist-in-residence and then assistant director at Cummington Community of the Arts.

From 1992 to 1998, he was a reporter, nature writer, and columnist at the Daily Hampshire Gazette. In 1997 he published his first novel.

In 1992, he began writing sketches that would eventually become his second novel, published in 2000. His third novel was published in 2010.

Reiken&#x27;s essays and short stories have been published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Western Humanities Review, &quot;Glimmer Train,&quot; and &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;.

Since 1999, Reiken has taught creative writing at Emerson College in Boston.

== Critical response ==
Reiken&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Odd Sea&quot; (1998), won the Hackney Literary Award and was selected one of the best first novels of the year by &quot;Library Journal&quot; and &quot;Booklist&quot;. Jane Vandenburgh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the novel covers &quot;mainly psychological terrain&quot;, of a family &quot;who must somehow cope with the mysterious disappearance of the oldest son, 16-year-old Ethan...which eloquently remind us that the unfathomable can indeed happen, that the unbearable must be bravely withstood&quot;. Judith Rosen wrote it is &quot;a contemporary tale of loss based loosely on &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.&quot; Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said it is &quot;a haunting first novel that takes a horrifying family calamity and turns it into a form of magic... [Reiken] has skillfully balanced this pain against the hopefulness of the narrator.&quot;

Reiken&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Lost Legends of New Jersey&quot; (2000), was listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Notable Book&quot; list. Critic Gary Krist wrote, &quot;Whether he&#x27;s depicting the mournful uneasiness of two siblings on a last moonlit bike ride or the bewilderment of an estranged father giving himself over to the healing power of a Jacques Cousteau special, Reiken knows how to charge the quietest domestic scenes with consequence and emotion.&quot;

His third novel, &quot;Day for Night&quot; (2010), was favorably reviewed by Patrick Ness of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who wrote it is &quot;a portmanteau novel: discrete stories from different points of view that combine to tell a larger narrative&quot;. S. Kirk Walsh of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;A thought-provoking, intricate portrait of the far-reaching, intergenerational implications of the Holocaust —and how fortuitous circumstances can bring people from both sides of a tragedy closer together, and, in some cases, further apart.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==

* 1997 Hackney Award for First Novel, &quot;The Odd Sea&quot;
* &quot;2000 New York Times&quot; Notable Books of the Year, &quot;The Lost Legends of New Jersey&quot;

<doc id="594952" wikidata="Q5037270" url="?curid=594952" title="Car dealerships in the United States">
<text>In the United States, a car dealership is a business that sells cars. A car dealership can either be a franchised dealership selling new and used cars, or a used car dealership, selling only used cars. In most cases, dealerships provide car maintenance and repair services as well as trade-in, leasing, and financing options for customers.

Used car dealers can carry cars from various different manufacturers, while nearly all new car dealerships are franchises associated with one or more manufacturers. Some new car dealerships may carry multiple brands from the same manufacturer. In some locales, dealerships have been consolidated and a corporation may control a chain of dealerships representing several different manufacturers.

In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales were historically prohibited in almost every state by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by dealers. However, following efforts by Tesla in the 2010s, this has changed considerably. Economists have characterized these regulations as a form of rent-seeking that extracts rents from manufacturers of cars, increases costs for consumers, and limits entry of new car dealerships while raising profits for incumbent car dealers. Research shows that as a result of these laws, retail prices for cars are higher than they otherwise would be. 

==Selling cars==
Most car dealerships display their inventory in a showroom and on a car lot. Under U.S. federal law, all new cars must carry a sticker showing the offering price and summarizing the vehicle&#x27;s features. Salespersons, predominantly those who only work on commission, negotiate with buyers to determine a final sales price. In many cases, this includes negotiating the price of a trade-in; the dealer&#x27;s purchase of the buyer&#x27;s current automobile. Negotiation from the dealership&#x27;s perspective is the course of dealing that occurs beginning when a salesperson negotiates a deal to the point where the customer makes an offer on the new vehicle, often including the customer&#x27;s current vehicle as part of the deal.

The salesperson then brings the offer, plus a sign of good faith from the customer, which can be a check with a deposit or a credit card, to the sales manager. This is also known as the booking amount, which is usually refundable. The sales manager returns options for the monthly payment, financing, and pricing options available to the customer in a process referred to as &quot;desking&quot; the deal. If the customer and sales manager agree on the terms, they sign off on the option chosen. The next step is a purchase and sales agreement or a sales agreement, and the actual monetary down payment is generated. The manager and customer sign this paperwork, and then the customer is handed off to the &quot;box,&quot; or the finance and insurance office where various add-ons are often sold that include special waxing, wheel protection, or often, extended warranty services. The final paperwork is also printed out at this phase. A percentage of people believe that desking is part of the negotiation process, it only occurs once the salesperson has a legitimate offer on the vehicle from the customer and can hand the sales manager a token of good faith, as noted.

A car dealer orders vehicles from the manufacturer for inventory and pays interest (called flooring or floor planning). Dealer holdbacks are a system of payments made by manufacturers to their dealers. The holdback payments assist the dealer&#x27;s ability to stock their inventory of vehicles and improve the profitability of dealers. Typically the holdback amount is around 1% to 3% of the vehicles&#x27; manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP). Hold-back is usually not a negotiable part of the price a consumer would pay for the vehicle, but dealers will give up the dealer holdback to get rid of a car that has been sitting in its inventory for a long time, or if the additional sale will bring them up to the manufacturer&#x27;s additional incentive payments for reaching unit bonus targets. The holdback was originally designed to help offset the cost the new car dealer has for paying interest on the money that is borrowed to keep the car in inventory but is in effect lowering the dealer&#x27;s gross profit, and thus the sales commissions paid to employees. The holdback allows dealerships to promote at- or near-invoice price sales and still achieve comfortable profits on such transactions.

With the advent of the Internet, the process of selling cars has undergone a considerable change. More than 70% of car purchases in the United States start with research on the Internet. It empowers buyers with knowledge of the features of comparable cars and the prices and discounts offered by different dealers within the same geographic area. This helps the buyers during price negotiations and puts further pressure on the profit margin of the dealer.

== Trading for cars ==
To an average dealer, the actual cash value of a trade is an opinion of what the vehicle could reasonably be sold for at auction in six weeks to three months, less any reconditioning costs should the dealer be unable or unwilling to re-sell the trade to the public. Since most states have requirements for a dealer to warranty or even guarantee a used vehicle for a certain amount of time and or mileage if sold to the public at a certain price, a dealer must make a profit selling the previously traded car (now a used car).

Trade-in value is an important facet of the car deal. Many websites offer trade-in value estimates. However, most of these values are estimated from a theoretical chart that may or may not be based on recent average sales prices of a particular make and model. If a particular make and model has less accurate data available from recent auction prices the dealer will be more cautious in the appraisal of the car.

A dealer may have a manager who appraises each vehicle offered for trade. This person will often be the person who also attends used car auctions, often buying and selling on behalf of the dealer. This person will have a realistic idea of the actual cash value of the trade. A dealer will look at a trade for body damage, windshield damage, engine noise, and known problems with a particular model, and price it to re-sell it at a profit.

== Additional services ==
Most car dealers offer a variety of financing options for the purchase of cars, including loans and leases. Financing can be highly profitable for dealerships. There have been some scandals involving discriminatory or predatory lending practices, and as a result, vehicle financing is heavily regulated in many states. For example, in California, there must be several signs prominently posted on the premises, and the contract must contain several prominent warnings, such as the words &quot;THERE IS NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD&quot;.

Although the terms of installment contracts are negotiated by the dealer with the buyer, few dealers make loans directly to consumers. In the business, such dealers are called &quot;Buy Here Pay Here&quot; dealerships. These stores can make loans directly to customers because they have some means of recovering the vehicle if the customer defaults on the loan. The means by which &quot;Buy Here Pay Here&quot; dealers can recover a vehicle vary by state.

Most dealers utilize indirect lenders. This means that the installment loan contracts are immediately &quot;assigned&quot; or &quot;resold&quot; to third-party finance companies, often an offshoot of the car&#x27;s manufacturer such as GM Financial, Ally Financial, or banks, which pay the dealer and then recover the balance by collecting the monthly installment payments promised by the buyer. To facilitate such assignments, dealers generally use one of several standard form contracts pre-approved by lenders. The most popular family of contracts for the retail installment sale of vehicles in the U.S. are sold by business process vendor Reynolds and Reynolds; their contracts have been the subject of extensive (and frequently hostile) judicial interpretation in lawsuits between dealers and customers.

The dealer has the option of marking up the interest rate of the contract and retaining a portion of that markup. For example, a bank may give a wholesale money rate of 6.75% and the dealer may give the consumer an interest rate of 7.75%. The bank would then pay the dealer the difference or a portion thereof. This is a regular practice because the dealership is selling the contract to a bank just like it sold a car to the customer. Most banks or states strictly limit the amount a contract rate may be marked up (by giving a range of rates at which they will buy the contract). In many cases, this amounts to little difference in the customer&#x27;s payment as the amount borrowed is small by comparison to a mortgage and the term shorter.

Customers may also find that a dealer can get them better rates than they can with their local bank or credit union. However, manufacturers often offer a low-interest rate OR a cash rebate, if the vehicle is not financed through the dealer. Depending upon the amount of the rebate, it is prudent for the consumer to check if applying a larger rebate results in a lower payment due to the fact that s/he is financing less of the purchase. For example, if a dealer has an interest rate offer of 7.9% financing OR a $2000.00 rebate and a consumer&#x27;s lending source offers 8.25%, a consumer should compare at the credit union what payments and total interest paid would be, if the consumer financed $2000.00 less at the credit union. The dealer can have their lending institution check a consumer&#x27;s credit. A consumer can also allow his or her lending source to do the same and compare the results. Most financing available at new car dealerships is offered by the financing arm of the vehicle manufacturer or a local bank.

Dealers may also offer other services. These additional services can include:
* Service contracts: While any vehicle sold in the United States now comes standard with some degree of manufacturer&#x27;s warranty coverage, customers have a wide range of choices to cover their vehicle from mechanical failure beyond that point. Service contracts &quot;may&quot; have the same terms of coverage as the vehicle&#x27;s original manufacturer&#x27;s warranty, but often they do not. Often service contracts carry a deductible as might any insurance contract. Because of the vast number of choices, it is important for consumers to be aware of the coverages before entering into an agreement. Usually, these service contracts do not cover regular maintenance items such as brakes, fluids, or filters. In some states, particularly Florida, the cost of such agreements is heavily regulated.

There are three main types of service contracts offered. The first is offered by the manufacturer through the dealership and is usually good at any dealership in the US that has that same franchise. When warranty repair work is required, the dealer submits a claim to the manufacturer and is reimbursed for the repair less the deductible paid by the consumer. Under this type of service agreement, there is usually no incentive for the dealer to do anything but repair the car as reimbursement from the manufacturer is usually profitable.

The second service contract is usually a simple insurance policy that the dealer purchases wholesale and is administered through a third party working for the dealer. This &quot;third party&quot; can often be a major insurance company. This money collected by the dealer from the consumer is put in a &quot;reserve&quot; fund for the length and/or term of the service contract. When a repair is required, the dealer authorizes the repair with the third-party administrator, usually before the repair is done. The third-party deducts the repair expense from the dealer&#x27;s reserve fund. The fewer payments or deductions made on the service contract the greater the profit to the dealer as any unused portion of the &quot;reserve&quot; is given back to the original selling dealer less an administration fee when the service contract retires.

The third type of service contract can be purchased directly from a few automobile insurance companies.
* GAP insurance: GAP insurance is protection for the loan in the event that the vehicle is lost as the result of an accident or theft. A GAP policy ensures that in the event of a total loss, the remaining payments are made on the loan so that a customer does not have to pay for a vehicle he or she no longer possesses. Many states regulate GAP insurance (New York, for example, does not allow dealerships to profit from the sale of GAP insurance).
* Credit/Life/Disability insurance: It is important to note that this kind of insurance is a profit center for the dealership, working similarly to the second type of service contract described above in this article and cannot be required as a condition of the loan. Customers / Borrowers often have the option of purchasing protection for their loan should the borrower become disabled and unable to work for a period during the time the borrower is required to make payments. Often the coverage begins on the 31st or 32nd day of disability: Meaning the borrower has to be unable to work for a period greater than 30 days before a claim can be filed. Often the borrower is required to submit paperwork to validate a disability claim. Credit Life insurance will usually cover the entire remaining balance of a loan if the borrower dies within the term of the contract. Customers can often obtain this coverage from their own insurance companies. Consumers should compare rates and policies with their own insurance companies. See Consumer Reports for their opinion
* Aftermarket accessories: Many dealerships offer accessories that are not offered by the manufacturer directly. These can be dangerous for consumers as some dealerships engage in illegal &quot;payment packing&quot;---that is, quoting an inflated monthly payment for the car in order to entice customers to agree to purchase aftermarket products offered at inaccurately low costs. One salesman for an accessories distributor was fired after he started asking questions about the legality of this practice; the resulting jury verdict of $480,003 against his former employer for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was upheld in full by a California appellate court in 2007. As with Credit/Life/Disability insurance, there are many ways a consumer can purchase these options outside the dealership.
* Maintenance agreements: Many dealerships that have their own service shops will offer pre-paid maintenance agreements. These are sometimes offered directly through the manufacturer (such as Saturn&#x27;s Basic Care or Car Care programs) or by the dealership alone. Because of the vast differences in programs that can exist from dealership to dealership, it is important to know what is covered under the plan and what are the recommended service intervals (see below).
*Lease Here Pay Here Contracts: With lease-to-purchase programs, customers are given a vehicle to lease for a time period that can range from 12 months up to 36 months. These vehicles are used as opposed to new ones typically obtained from a new car dealer. The dealership that leases these cars is often scrutinized due to the fact that they normally serve the public that does not have strong financial abilities to maintain the obligation.
The dealers are not held to the lending standards that most banks are, and also at times of bankruptcy are completely exempt in times of default leading the car dealership with the opportunity to repossess at any time regardless of breach of contract. Some other pro-advocates say the monthly obligation on leases is cheaper because there are no sales taxes on the vehicle as opposed to the amount a buyer may pay if they are making loan payments on a new or used car purchase.

Car dealers also provide maintenance and in some cases, repair services for cars. New car dealerships are more likely to provide these services since they usually stock and sell parts and process warranty claims for the manufacturers they represent. Maintenance is typically a high-margin service and represents a significant profit center for automotive dealers.

== Regulation ==
In the United States, most aspects of operating a car dealership are regulated at the state level. Car titles are issued and transferred by the individual states through their respective Departments of Motor Vehicles. The purchase price of a vehicle usually includes various fees which the dealer forwards to the state DMV to transfer the vehicle&#x27;s title to the buyer. In many states, the DMVs also license and regulate car dealerships. In many states, car dealerships are capable of submitting all necessary forms to the DMV on behalf of the customer and are authorized to issue temporary paperwork to the customer to prove that the transaction is in process, allowing the customer to avoid a trip to the nearest DMV office.

Consumer complaints against car dealerships are usually investigated by the Attorney General&#x27;s office in the state where the dealership is located. In states where the DMV licenses and regulates car dealerships, the DMV may have responsibility for initially handling consumer complaints and the state AG&#x27;s office becomes involved only when there is evidence that a dealer may have committed a crime.

==Perceptions==

===Customer experience===
According to one survey, more than half of dealership customers would prefer to buy directly from the manufacturer, without any monetary incentives to do so. An analyst report of a direct sales model is estimated to cut the cost of a vehicle by 8.6%. This implies an even greater demand currently exists for a direct manufacturer sales model. However, laws in many U.S. states prohibit manufacturers from selling directly, requiring customers to buy new cars through a dealer.

===Discrimination===
Studies have found that some auto dealerships charge higher interest rates or otherwise raise their prices to females and ethnic minorities, including Asians, and African Americans. These issues have sometimes resulted in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, against the dealers on the basis of discrimination based on nationality.

<text>Ian Richard Parmenter, OAM (24 July 1945 – 13 April 2024) was an English-born Australian media professional and author with a half-century experience in newspapers, magazines, television and radio. He presented 450 five-minute programs of the cookery show &quot;Consuming Passions&quot; on the Australian ABC television network. The program was also broadcast in 19 other countries.

==Life and career==
Parmenter was born in London, England after the end of World War II, his father was a brewer and his mother was a housewife. He moved to Belgium aged nine with his family, where he learnt cooking from a Belgian housekeeper with his first dish being their style of chips. He attended a Montessori school in Belgium before boarding in England at King&#x27;s School, Rochester, where he was expelled for partying. He became a journalist in Fleet Street, London, before moving to Australia in 1971. He joined the ABC in Perth and qualified as a TV producer in 1974. He developed a culinary flair in private life, having no professional experience in foodservice.

Parmenter also wrote several recipe collections and three books, listed below. In 1999 he moved to the Western Australian town of Margaret River, where he had purchased a cottage shortly after &quot;Consuming Passions&quot; first aired.

In the 2011 Australia Day Honours, Parmenter was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the food and tourism industries as an event director, author, journalist and broadcaster.

Parmenter died on 13 April 2024, at the age of 79.
