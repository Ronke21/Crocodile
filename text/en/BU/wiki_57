<doc id="599922" wikidata="Q6546792" url="?curid=599922" title="Montreal Impact (1992–2011)">
<text>The Montreal Impact () was a Canadian professional soccer club based in Montreal, Quebec. Founded in 1993, the team played in various leagues in the second tier of the United States soccer league system, beginning with the American Professional Soccer League. They later played in the A-League/USL First Division, the USSF D2 Pro League, and the North American Soccer League. Following the 2011 season, the Impact were replaced by a team of the same name which joined Major League Soccer in 2012.

The team played its home games at until 2008 when it moved to the new Saputo Stadium where it played until its move to MLS. The team&#x27;s colours were blue and white.

The Impact also operated a reserve team, the Trois-Rivières Attak, from 2006 until 2010 which played in the Canadian Soccer League until 2010 when the Impact created their own Montreal Impact Academy. They also used to operate an indoor team (of the same name) in the NPSL (at the Bell Centre, then at ) with many of the same players, from 1997–1998 to 1999–2000.

On May 7, 2010, Impact owner Joey Saputo was granted a Major League Soccer expansion franchise set to begin play in Saputo Stadium in 2012. Although, in a legal sense, the MLS team is an entirely separate legal entity, the new team (now known as CF Montréal) retained the name Montreal Impact until 2021 and maintains the team&#x27;s legacy in MLS.

==History==

The Impact club was founded in 1992 by the Saputo family, as the owners of the Montreal Supra of the Canadian Soccer League did not pursue an APSL franchise by the deadline set by the U.S. league. The Montreal ownership and front office split with their main financial sponsor announcing the start of a new APSL club on December 13, 1992, with the Supra coach. In 1993, the APSL was trying to gain the USSF Division 1 sanctioning required by FIFA with the award of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the estimated $60 million in World Cup profits; it was seen as a league with much more upside than the CSL. They became a dominant club in the APSL (1993–1996) and the A-League (1997–2004), renamed the USL First Division (2005). The team did not compete during the 1999 A-League season. Their main rivals were the Rochester Rhinos and the Toronto Lynx prior to the latter&#x27;s move to the USL Premier Development League.

Following a lacklustre first year, the Impact surprised the defending champion Colorado Foxes (1–0) on October 15, 1994, at home in front of a sold out Montreal crowd to claim their first league title. Subsequently, the team finished first or tied for first during the regular season in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2003 without making it back to the final. The Impact lost to archrivals Rochester in their first four playoff encounters, in 1996, 1998, 2002 and 2003, before finally defeating them in 2004 en route to their second title. The club was favoured to repeat in 2005, but after a near-flawless season (3 losses in 28 games) the Impact were ousted in the semi-finals by the eventual champions, the Seattle Sounders (2–2, 1–2). The team also won the inaugural Voyageurs Cup in 2002 and successfully defended this title from 2003 to 2008. In 2009, the Impact were crowned at home for their third title, beating the Vancouver Whitecaps FC by an aggregate score of 6–3 in a Cinderella ending to a tumultuous season.

In 2004, the Impact finished first in the A-League&#x27;s Eastern Conference before disposing of Rochester (1–0, 1–0), Syracuse (2–0, 1–1), and Seattle (2–0) in the playoffs to capture their second championship, 10 years after their first. The final in Montreal saw an all-time-record 13,648 fans at Stadium (whose seating capacity for the day was adjusted from 10,100). The MVP was Mauricio Vincello who scored the winner at the 33rd minute of play. Frederick Commodore sealed the game with a goal at the 78th minute.

At the gate, the Impact had always been solid within the league before 1999 with average crowds of 4,000–5,000. After disappointing seasons in 2000 and 2001 (where the average gate was between 2,000 and 3,000 people), the team had new record attendances in 2002 (over 5,000 on average), 2003 (over 7,000 on average), 2004 (over 9,000 on average) and 2005–2006 (over 11,000 on average). The all-time single-game high was the 55,571 fans in attendance for the 2009 CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final against Santos Laguna (Mexico) at Olympic Stadium in Montreal.

In 1999, the owners had a conflict with the league and withdrew the team from competition, but did play indoor soccer that year in the National Professional Soccer League. After resurfacing in 2000, the club went bankrupt during the 2001 season when the then-owners were Ionian. Administered until the end of the season by one of the original pillars, Joey Saputo, the club rose from its ashes in 2002, set up as a nonprofit organization owned by the Quebec government, Hydro-Québec, and Saputo. It also attracted many big-time sponsors such as the National Bank of Canada, Bell Canada and Coca-Cola, among others. The team&#x27;s mandate is to develop local talent and to serve as a representative of Montreal for tourism. Since the Impact&#x27;s renaissance in 2002, Quebec-born players have played a much more central role in the Canada national team, after many years of non-selection. For the 2005 Gold Cup, players Gabriel Gervais, Sandro Grande, Patrick Leduc, Adam Braz and Ali Gerba, as well as former player Patrice Bernier and Quebec-born Olivier Occean were all called to the national team and did well by most accounts. The visibility helped Grande and Ali, who both transferred to Scandinavia shortly after the tournament. On July 15, 2006, the team won the 200th victory in its history.

For the first time in its history, the Montreal Impact contracted players to 10 months out of the year in 2008. This extended training camp was a first for the Montreal Impact and many in the media have stated that it is a move to next level in professional soccer. They began the year at the soccer training centre, Soccerplexe Catalogna before travelling to Italy for more training and three exhibition games against Italian clubs. They drew their first match 0–0 against third division Arezzo, lost their second match 1–0 against second division Frosinone and finally won their third encounter 1–0 against fourth division Cassino.

In 2008, the Montreal Impact won the Canadian Championship, gaining the chance to represent Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. The tournament features the best teams in all of North and Central America and the Caribbean Islands. The Impact won two legs against Real Estali 1–0 and 0–0 to secure a spot in the tournament. Montreal competed then in the group stage where they defeated Joe Public FC of Trinidad 2–0 and 4–1 and CD Olimpia of Honduras 2–1 and 1–1. They finished off against Atlante FC of Mexico which they tied 0–0 and then lost 2–1.

On February 25, 2009, the team won the first leg of the quarterfinals match 2–0 against Santos Laguna from Mexico. The match was played at Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium in front of a club-record crowd of 55,571. The second leg was held on March 5, 2009, at Corona Stadium, in Torreon, Mexico, where the Impact led 2–1 at the half (4–1 on aggregate). With the Impact only a few minutes from a semi-final berth, Santos Laguna&#x27;s Carlos Quintero scored twice in stoppage time to rally the homeside to a 5–2 victory, thus eliminating the Impact from the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League 5–4 on aggregate. Following the match, head coach John Limniatis commented that his side &quot;should have done better&quot;, noting that it was &quot;unfortunate to finish this way&quot;.

For the 2009 Canadian Championship, the Montreal Impact were eliminated early to the disappointment of fans. In the final match of the Voyageurs Cup, with the Impact already eliminated, Head Coach Marc Dos Santos decision to field a number of reserve team players drew controversy from fans of both the Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. The team went on to suffer its worst defeat in history, by losing 6–1 to archrival Toronto FC of Major League Soccer. Toronto FC needed to win by 4 goals to advance to the CONCACAF Champions League 2009-10 preliminary round. As a result, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC were eliminated on goal differential, despite holding the same record as Toronto FC.

The Montreal Impact won their third championship in its history, Saturday October 17, 2009, in front of a sellout crowd of 13,034 at Saputo Stadium, defeating the Vancouver Whitecaps FC 3–1, (6–3 on aggregate goals), in the First Division USL final championship, which was the first all Canadian First Division USL Final. All three of Montreal&#x27;s championships have been won at home. Montreal had an up and down year that involved firing their coach and struggling early on, so winning the championship was a pleasant surprise to their fans. All the players agreed this championship was more special than their first two because they were expected to win those ones, while the 2009 edition was a surprise finalist, that most experts thought wouldn&#x27;t advance out of the quarterfinals.

In November 2009 the Impact announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new North American Soccer League, which would begin play in 2010. The league, which has yet to be sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation or the Canadian Soccer Association, would also comprise the Atlanta Silverbacks, Carolina Railhawks, Crystal Palace Baltimore, Miami FC, Minnesota Thunder, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Vancouver Whitecaps and a brand new team led by St. Louis Soccer United.

After lawsuits were filed and heated press statements exchanged, the USSF declared they would sanction neither league for the coming year, and ordered both to work together on a plan to temporarily allow their teams to play a 2010 season. The interim solution was announced on January 7, 2010, with the USSF running the new USSF D-2 league comprising clubs from both USL-1 and NASL.

===The Impact and Major League Soccer===

Towards the end of 2007, much speculation had been made about a possible franchise move from USL First Division to Major League Soccer. The construction of the expandable Saputo Stadium further suggested such an interest on the part of the Impact to move up to the top level American-Canadian league.

Chairman Joey Saputo held talks with George Gillett (former owner of Montreal Canadiens and co-owner of Liverpool F.C.) regarding possible joint ownership of an MLS franchise.

On July 24, 2008, MLS announced they were seeking to add two expansion teams for the 2011 season, of which Montreal was listed as a potential candidate.

On November 22, 2008, the team&#x27;s bid for an MLS franchise, was not retained by commissioner Don Garber. In response to Vancouver&#x27;s successful bid in March 2009, Impact GM Nick De Santis commented that he expected chairman Joey Saputo to pursue and ultimately realize his vision of Montreal as an MLS franchise someday.

On May 16, 2009, the Montreal Gazette reported that MLS commissioner Don Garber and Montreal Impact president Joey Saputo have resumed talks for an expansion team to begin play in 2011.

On May 7, 2010, it was officially announced by MLS commissioner Don Garber that Montreal had been granted the league&#x27;s 19th franchise, and will begin play in the 2012 season.

==Colours and badge==
The team&#x27;s colours were blue and white, and the team&#x27;s logo featured a stylized fleur-de-lis in blue and silver, overlaid with the Impact wordmark and a traditional hex-stitched soccer ball in flight. The fleur-de-lis is a globally recognized symbol of French heritage, and features prominently on the flag of Quebec as a reflection of French-Canadian culture. The badge featured stars to represent the league titles it won. Titles won in 1994 and 2004 resulted in the addition of the first two stars. A third star was added after the club won the USL First Division in 2009.

==Stadium==

* ; Montreal, Quebec (1993–2007)
* Stadium at Université Laval; Quebec City, Quebec 3 games (2003–2005)
* Stadium at ; Sherbrooke, Quebec 2 games (2004–2005)
* Saputo Stadium; Montreal, Quebec (2008–2011)

The Impact played its home games at Saputo Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium which opened in May 2008. As the name suggests, the stadium was funded privately (mainly by the Saputo family), and cost $14.1 million CAD to build, with one-half of the cost paid by the Saputo family, and the rest coming from other private-sector contributions. Saputo Stadium was also the Impact&#x27;s administrative headquarters and also includes a training field, 20 corporate boxes and full player welfare areas.

Prior to its 2012 expansion, Saputo Stadium seated 13,034 supporters in three main stands, and was expanded to seat 20,341. It is located just east of Olympic Stadium in the city&#x27;s east end. Prior to moving to the new stadium, the Impact played their home games at mainly , with a handful of games also being held in stadia on University campuses at Université Laval and .

==Club culture==

===Supporters===
The Montreal Impact had one of the most vocal groups of supporters in the USSF D-2, the UM02, which stands for Ultras Montréal 2002. The group was created in 2002, after the re-opening of the Montréal Impact, when a group of fans decided to bring organized and vocal support to Impact games. Since their start in 2002, the group had grown from a handful of friends to a group that regularly numbers in the hundreds. The largest number of people within the group was during the February 25 match against Santos Laguna. Their slogan is &quot;Toujours Fidèles&quot; which is French for &quot;Always Faithful&quot;. The UM02 has a rivalry with the supporters of the Rochester Rhinos which was at that time the Rochester Stampede, as well as the organized support of rival Toronto FC. The UM02 were located in section 132 of Saputo Stadium, the designated supporters section before the stadium was reconfigured for MLS.

===Rivalries===
Montreal Impact had a rivalry with the Rochester Rhinos, when the two were in the USL&#x27;s First Division. In games between the two franchises, it was not uncommon for supporters of the two teams to travel to the opposing sides&#x27; stadium.

The Impact also had a rivalry with MLS side Toronto FC. Toronto FC and Montreal Impact both participated in the Canadian Championship annually along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2009, the Impact suffered its worst defeat, losing 6–1 to Toronto FC. The lopsided loss by the Impact eliminated the Vancouver Whitecaps from the 2009 Canadian Championship, thus causing resentment among some Whitecaps fans towards the Impact. As a result, another chapter was added to the rivalry between the Whitecaps and the Impact.

==Broadcasting==
The Montreal Impact had a French language television deal with Radio-Canada that ran through the 2011 season. Philippe Germain did the play-by-play and Guillaume Dumas was the colour commentator. Pre-game, post-game and half-time shows featured Marie-José Turcotte and former Impact star Gabriel Gervais.

CKGM (The Team 990) was the Impact&#x27;s English language radio broadcaster. Brian Wilde handled the play-by-play while Noel Butler was the colour commentator. CKAC is the Impact&#x27;s French language broadcaster with Jean-Philippe Bertrand is the play-by-play announcer, Francis Millien is the colour commentator and Jeremy Filosa reports from the sidelines.

<doc id="599923" wikidata="Q218186" url="?curid=599923" title="Vytautas the Great">
<text>Vytautas the Great (; 27 October 1430) was a ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He was also the prince of Grodno (1370–1382), prince of Lutsk (1387–1389), and the postulated king of the Hussites.

In modern Lithuania, Vytautas is revered as a national hero and was an important figure in the national rebirth in the 19th century. &quot;Vytautas&quot; is a popular male given name in Lithuania. In commemoration of the 500-year anniversary of his death, Vytautas Magnus University was named after him. Monuments in his honour were built in many towns in independent Lithuania during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. Vytautas knew and spoke the Lithuanian language with his cousin Jogaila.

==Struggle for power==

===1377–1384===

Vytautas&#x27; uncle Algirdas had been Grand Duke of Lithuania until his death in 1377. Algirdas and Vytautas&#x27; father Kęstutis had ruled jointly in the form of diarchy, with Algirdas governing the east and Kęstutis the west, primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Order. Algirdas was succeeded by his son Jogaila, and a struggle for power ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės with the Teutonic Order against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered this in 1381, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke. However, Jogaila escaped and raised an army against Kęstutis. The two sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kęstutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kęstutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate.

In 1382, Vytautas escaped from Kreva and he sought help from the Teutonic Order, who were negotiating with Jogaila at the time. Jogaila and the Order agreed to the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order part of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified and in summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order resumed. Vytautas was baptised as a Catholic, receiving the name of Wigand (Lithuanian: &quot;Vygandas&quot;). Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila. In January 1384, Vytautas promised to cede part of Samogitia to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevėžis River, in return for recognition as Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, in July of the same year, Vytautas broke with the Order and reconciled with Jogaila. He then burned three important Teutonic castles, and regained all Kęstutis&#x27; lands, except for Trakai.

===1385–1392===
In 1385, Jogaila concluded the Union of Krewo with Poland, under which he married Jadwiga of Poland and became King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło.
Vytautas participated in the Union and in 1386 was re-baptised as a Catholic, receiving the name Alexander. In 1386 Vytautas paid homage to Jagiello, after his coronation as king of Poland.

Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as regent in Lithuania. However, Skirgaila was unpopular with the people and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become Grand Duke. In 1389, he attacked Vilnius but failed. In early 1390, Vytautas again allied with the Teutonic Order through the Treaty of Königsberg (1390). Vytautas had to confirm his agreement of 1384, and cede Samogitia to the Order. His army now invaded Lithuania. Also, to gain more influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Moscow in 1391.

The Polish nobles were unhappy that their new king spent too much time on Lithuanian affairs. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not benefit Poland. In 1392, Jogaila sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jogaila and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kęstutis&#x27; lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Jogaila. After Vytautas&#x27; death, all his lands and powers would revert to Jogaila.

==Grand Duke of Lithuania==
===Policy towards the East===

Vytautas continued Algirdas&#x27; vision to control as many Ruthenian lands as possible. Much of the territory was already under the Grand Duke&#x27;s rule, but the rest was controlled by the Mongols. Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, sought help from Vytautas when he was removed from the throne in 1395 after his defeat by Timur. An agreement was reached that Vytautas would help Tokhtamysh to regain power, and the Horde would cede more lands to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in return. In 1398, Vytautas&#x27; army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to ethnic Lithuania.

Continuing attempts on the part of Poland to subordinate Lithuania drove Vytautas for the third time into the arms of the Order, and by the Treaty of Salynas in October 1398, Vytautas, who now styled himself , ceded his ancestral province of Samogitia to the knights, formed an alliance with them for the conquest and partition of Pskov and Novgorod the Great.
Inspired by his successful campaign against Timur, Vytautas and Jogaila won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania. The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. Over twenty princes, including two brothers of Jogaila, were killed, and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This came as a shock to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler, George of Smolensk, and not re-conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. Vytautas waged a war in 1406–1408 against his son-in-law Vasili I of Moscow and Švitrigaila, a brother of Jogaila who with the support of the Teutonic Order had declared himself grand prince. A major stand-off between the two armies ended without a battle in the Treaty of Ugra, by which Velikiy Novgorod was granted to Jogaila&#x27;s brother Lengvenis, and the important city of Pskov to Jogaila&#x27;s envoy Jerzy Nos, the latter settlement a clear violation of the treaty of Raciąż. The war with Muscovy ended in December 1408, on terms that made further conflict with the Teutonic Order inevitable, despite Hermann II of Celje&#x27;s attempt to negotiate a solution.

===Wars against the Teutonic Order===

In the Treaty of Salynas Vytautas had transferred Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights. Samogitia was especially important for the Order because it separated the Teutonic Knights, based in Prussia, from the Livonian Order, based in Latvia. The two orders desired to unite and form a mighty force. However, the knights ruled Samogitia for only three years, because on 13 March 1401, the Samogitians, supported by Vytautas, rebelled and burned two castles. The knights received support from Švitrigaila, brother of Jogaila, who desired to take Vytautas&#x27; title. In 1404 Peace of Raciąż was signed, which in essence repeated the Treaty of Salynas: Samogitia was transferred to the Teutonic Knights. Poland promised not to support Lithuania in case of another war. The knights promised to support Vytautas in the east and not to support any Gediminid who could have claims to the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, the treaty did not solve the problems, and all the parties prepared for war.

In 1408, Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitian matters. In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights began, as the rebels burned Skirsnemunė castle. Both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410, Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald. The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. From now on, Poland-Lithuania began to be regarded in the west as a great power, and Vytautas stood in high favour with the Roman curia.

As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received Samogitia for his lifetime. However, the parties could not agree on the border. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to mediate the dispute. In 1413, it was declared that the whole right bank of the Nemunas (Neman River) was Samogitia and therefore belonged to Lithuania. The Teutonic Knights disagreed and a new war started in 1414. The war lasted for just a few months, and the dispute was brought to the Council of Constance. Even though the dispute was not resolved, the Samogitians had a chance to present their case to the leaders of Europe. It is seen as an important event in the diplomatic history of Lithuania. Several other mediation attempts failed, and yet another war with the Teutonic Order started in 1422. After several months of fighting, the Treaty of Lake Melno was signed. Samogitia was returned to Lithuania in perpetuity, while the city of Memel (present-day Klaipėda) and surrounding territories stayed with the Order. This border, as established by the treaty, remained stable for some 500 years until the Memel Territory dispute of 1923. With peace established, Vytautas could now concentrate on reforms and the relationship with Poland.

===Relationship with Poland===
In 1399 Jadwiga of Poland and her newborn died in childbirth. Jogaila&#x27;s power in Poland was jeopardised as he was a foreigner king with no other ties to the throne but his wife. Also, the defeat at Vorskla forced a re-evaluation of the relationship between Poland and Lithuania. The result was the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. Vytautas was granted wide autonomy, but after his death the title and powers of Grand Duke of Lithuania were to be transferred to the king of Poland. In case Jagiełło died first without an heir, the Polish nobility agreed not to elect a new king without consulting Vytautas. The unique feature of this union was that the Lithuanian nobility presented their own document: for the first time somebody other than dukes played a role in the state matters.

Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horodło with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania.

In January 1429, at the Congress of Lutsk it was proposed by Sigismund, king of Hungary, that Vytautas should be crowned King of Lithuania. It resulted in a great crisis between Vytautas, king Władysław and Polish nobles. The envoys who were transporting documents supporting Vytautas&#x27;s coronation and proposing an alliance between Lithuania, Hungary and the Teutonic Order were stopped at the Polish-Lithuanian border in the autumn of 1430. Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle, ending the whole affair. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Vytautas &quot;was certainly the most imposing personality of his day in Eastern Europe, and his martial valour was combined with statesmanlike foresight.&quot;

===Reforms===
Vytautas backed the economic development of his state and introduced many reforms. Under his rule the Grand Duchy of Lithuania gradually became more centralised, as local princes with dynastic ties to the throne were replaced by the governors loyal to Vytautas. The governors were rich landowners who formed the basis for the Lithuanian nobility. During Vytautas&#x27; rule, the influential Radvila (Radziwiłł) and Goštautas families began their rise.

In 1398, Vytautas brought over families of the Karaim (388 families) and Tatar peoples. Their principal role was to guard the castle and the bridges, but they also served as translators, farmers, traders, and diplomats. He retains a very high reputation among them, with the anniversary of his death being officially celebrated in 1930 in the kenesa in Vilnius.

==Family==
Born in 1350 in the castle of present-day Old Trakai (Senieji Trakai), Vytautas was the son of Kęstutis and his wife Birutė. Vytautas was a cousin and childhood friend of Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), who became King of Poland in 1386. Around 1370, he married Anna, who gave birth to Sophia of Lithuania. Sophia was married to Vasily I, Grand Prince of Moscow, and mother and regent to their son Vasili II. After Anna&#x27;s death in 1418, Vytautas married her niece Juliana Olshanska, daughter of Ivan Olshanski who outlived him. Because of the relationship between the two women, the Bishop of Vilnius was unwilling to perform the ceremony without a papal dispensation; however, Jan Kropidło did not have such scruples and married them on 13 November 1418. According to the 16th century Bychowiec Chronicle, his first wife was Maria Łukomska, however, this is not confirmed by other sources.

==Depictions==

A sculpture for Vytautas is display on the Millennium of Russia monument in Veliky Novgorod.

Vytautas appears in several works of fiction dealing with the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order. He appears in the narrative poem &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz. He was portrayed by Józef Kostecki in &quot;Knights of the Teutonic Order&quot;, the 1960 adaptation of the famous novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz.

In 2014, a short animation was produced by &quot;Four Directions of Fairy Tales&quot; (Cztery Strony Bajek) in association with the Association of Polish Karaims, portraying the Karaim story of Vytautas and his magic horse, with voiceovers in several languages, including Karaim, Polish, English, and Lithuanian.

In the video game &quot;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&quot;, Vytautas featured as a cavalry hero.

Vytautas is also mentioned in Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s fictitious novel &quot;The Corrections&quot;, which attributes his death in 1430 to Lithuania&#x27;s gradual downfall as a &quot;global player&quot;.

<doc id="599925" wikidata="Q1350663" url="?curid=599925" title="Geoff Murphy">
<text>Geoffrey Peter Murphy (12 October 1938 – 3 December 2018) was a New Zealand filmmaker, producer, director, and screenwriter best known for his work during the renaissance of New Zealand cinema that began in the second half of the 1970s. His second feature &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; (1981) was the first New Zealand film to win major commercial success on its soil. Murphy directed several Hollywood features during the 1990s, before returning to New Zealand as second-unit director on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. Murphy was also a scriptwriter, special effects technician, schoolteacher and trumpet player at different times. He was married to Merata Mita, a film director, actor, writer.

==Early life==
Murphy grew up in the Wellington suburb of Highbury, and attended St. Vincent de Paul School in Kelburn and St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Wellington, before training and working as a schoolteacher.

==Blerta==
Murphy was a founding member of the hippy musical and theatrical co-operative Blerta, which toured New Zealand and Australia performing multi-media shows in the early 1970s. Blerta were later allowed to make their television series, spawning what is arguably Murphy&#x27;s first feature film, the 75-minute-long &quot;Wild Man&quot;. Several Blerta members would work on Murphy&#x27;s films, including drummer and Blerta founder Bruno Lawrence, who had starring roles in &quot;Utu&quot; and &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot;.

==Early films==
Murphy made his name with road movie &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; (1981), the first New Zealand film to attract large-scale audiences in its home country. Made on a low budget, the film followed three people travelling from the top of the North Island to the bottom of the South Island, to growing infamy along the way. Murphy directed the film and co-produced it with Nigel Hutchinson. Murphy next directed the Māori Western &quot;Utu&quot; (1983) and the last-man-on-Earth piece &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot; (1985).

==Hollywood==
By the 1990s Murphy had begun a decade working outside of New Zealand, mostly in the United States. In this period he directed films such as &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, &quot;Freejack&quot;, which featured Emilio Estevez and Mick Jagger, and Steven Seagal sequel &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;. The latter proved his most successful film at the international box-office, grossing more than US$100 million worldwide.

==Return to New Zealand==
Murphy returned to New Zealand and assisted Peter Jackson on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films; made a documentary film chronicling the Blerta phenomenon; and directed the thriller &quot;Spooked&quot;, featuring Cliff Curtis. In the later 2000s, he directed the New Zealand television comedy series &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, worked on the remastered DVD release of &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;, and was 2nd-unit director on &quot;&quot;.

In 2013 Murphy was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2013 Rialto Channel New Zealand Film Awards. The same year saw the release of a restored and re-edited version of possibly his most ambitious film, &quot;Utu&quot;, under the title &quot;Utu Redux&quot;.

Murphy was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film, in the 2014 New Year Honours. In the same year, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by Massey University.

Murphy died on 3 December 2018.

<text>The Venera 11 ( meaning &quot;Venus 11&quot;) was a Soviet uncrewed space mission which was part of the Venera program to explore the planet Venus. Venera 11 was launched on 9 September 1978 at 03:25:39 UTC.

Separating from its flight platform on December 23, 1978 the lander entered the Venus atmosphere two days later on December 25 at 11.2 km/s. During the descent, it employed aerodynamic braking followed by parachute braking and ending with atmospheric braking. It made a soft landing on the surface at 06:24 Moscow Time (03:24 UT) on 25 December after a descent time of approximately 1 hour. The touchdown speed was 7 to 8 m/s. Information was transmitted to the flight platform for retransmittal to Еarth until it moved out of range 95 minutes after touchdown. Landing coordinates are .

==Flight platform==
After ejection of the lander probe, the flight platform continued on past Venus in a heliocentric orbit. Near encounter with Venus occurred on December 25, 1978, at approximately 35,000 km altitude. The flight platform acted as a data relay for the descent craft for 95 minutes until it flew out of range and returned its own measurements on interplanetary space.

Venera 11 flight platform carried solar wind detectors, ionosphere electron instruments and two gamma ray burst detectors – the Soviet-built KONUS and the French-built SIGNE 2. The SIGNE 2 detectors were simultaneously flown on Venera 12 and Prognoz 7 to allow triangulation of gamma ray sources. Before and after Venus flyby, Venera 11 and Venera 12 yielded detailed time-profiles for 143 gamma-ray bursts, resulting in the first ever catalog of such events. The last gamma-ray burst reported by Venera 11 occurred on January 27, 1980.

List of flight platform instruments and experiments: 
* 30–166 nm Extreme UV spectrometer
* Compound plasma spectrometer
* KONUS Gamma-ray burst detector
* SNEG Gamma-ray Burst detector
* Magnetometer 
* 4 Semiconductor counters
* 2 Gas-discharge counters
* 4 Scintillation counters
* Hemispherical proton telescope

The mission ended in February, 1980. Venera 11 is currently in heliocentric orbit, with perihelion of 0.69 AU, aphelion of 1.01 AU, eccentricity of 0.19, inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 284 days.

==Lander==
The lander carried instruments to study the temperature and atmospheric and soil chemical composition. A device called Groza was intended to search for lightning on Venus. Both Venera 11 and Venera 12 had landers with two cameras, each designed for color imaging, though Soviet literature does not mention them.
Each failed to return images when the lens covers did not separate after landing due to a design flaw. The soil analyzer also failed.
A gas chromatograph was on board to measure the composition of the Venus atmosphere, as well as instruments to study scattered solar radiation. Results reported included some evidence of lightning, a high Ar36/Ar40 ratio, and the discovery of carbon monoxide at low altitudes.

List of lander experiments and instruments:

* Backscatter Nephelometer
* Mass spectrometer – MKh-6411
* Gas chromatograph – Sigma
* X-Ray fluorospectrometer
* 360° Scanning photometer – IOAV
* Spectrometer (430–1170 nm)
* Microphone/anemometer 
* Low-frequency radio sensor
* 4 Thermometers
* 3 Barometers
* Accelerometer – Bizon
* Penetrometer – PrOP-V
* Soil analysis device
* 2 Color cameras
* Small solar batteries – MSB

<text>The Venera 12 ( meaning Venus 12) was an uncrewed Soviet space mission designed to explore the planet Venus. Venera 12 was launched on 14 September 1978 at 02:25:13 UTC.

After separating from its flight platform on 19 December 1978, the Venera 12 lander entered the Venus atmosphere two days later at . During its descent, the lander employed aerodynamic braking followed by parachute braking, ending with atmospheric braking. After a nearly one-hour descent, a soft landing was made at 06:30 Moscow time (0330 UT) on 21 December. Touchdown speed was ; landing coordinates are . Continuing for about 110 minutes after touchdown, the lander transmitted data to the flight platform for about 110 minutes until the flight platform, which remained in a heliocentric orbit, moved out of range. Venera 11 and 12 carried identical instruments.

==Flight platform==
The Venera 12 flight platform carried solar wind detectors, ionosphere electron instruments, and two gamma ray burst detectors – the Soviet-built KONUS and the French-built SIGNE 2. The SIGNE 2 detectors were simultaneously flown on Venera 12 and Prognoz 7 to allow for triangulation of gamma ray sources. Before and after the Venus flyby, Venera 11 and Venera 12 yielded detailed time-profiles for 143 gamma-ray bursts, resulting in the first ever catalog of such events. The last gamma-ray burst reported by Venera 12 occurred on 5 January 1980. Venera 12 used its ultraviolet spectrometer to study comet Bradfield (C/1979 Y1) on 13 February 1980, and reported spectrophotometric data until 19 March 1980.

The list of flight platform instruments and experiments are:

* 30–166 nm Extreme UV spectrometer
* Compound plasma spectrometer
* KONUS Gamma-ray burst detector
* SNEG Gamma-ray burst detector
* Magnetometer 
* 4 Semiconductor counters
* 2 Gas-discharge counters
* 4 Scintillation counters
* Hemispherical proton telescope

The active phase of the science mission for the flight platform ended in April 1980. Venera 12 is currently in heliocentric orbit, with perihelion of 0.69 AU, aphelion of 1.01 AU, eccentricity of 0.19, inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 284 days.

==Lander==
The Venera 12 descent craft carried instruments designed to study the detailed chemical composition of the atmosphere, the nature of the clouds, and the thermal balance of the atmosphere. These instruments included a gas chromatograph to measure the composition of the Venus atmosphere, instruments to study scattered solar radiation and soil composition, and a device named Groza which was designed to measure atmospheric electrical discharges. Results reported included evidence of lightning and thunder, a high 36Ar/40Ar ratio, and the discovery of carbon monoxide at low altitudes.

Each of the Venera 11 and Venera 12 included landers with a pair of cameras, each of which was designed for color imaging. A design flaw prevented the lens caps from separating, resulting in all cameras failing to capture and return images.

The list of lander experiments and instruments are:
* Backscatter nephelometer
* Mass spectrometer – MKh-6411
* Gas chromatograph – Sigma
* X-ray fluorospectrometer
* 360° scanning photometer – IOAV

<text>Venera 9 (), manufacturer&#x27;s designation: 4V-1 No. 660, was a Soviet uncrewed space mission to Venus. It consisted of an orbiter and a lander. It was launched on June 8, 1975, at 02:38:00 UTC and had a mass of . The orbiter was the first spacecraft to orbit Venus, while the lander was the first to return images from the surface of another planet.

==Orbiter==

The orbiter entered Venus orbit on October 20, 1975. Its mission was to act as a communications relay for the lander and to explore cloud layers and atmospheric parameters with several instruments and experiments. It performed 17 survey missions from October 26, 1975, to December 25, 1975.

The orbiter consisted of a cylinder with two solar panel wings and a high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface. A bell-shaped unit holding propulsion systems was attached to the bottom of the cylinder, and mounted on top was a sphere which held the lander.

===Orbiter design===
The instruments composing the orbiter included:
* 1.6–2.8 μm IR spectrometer
* 8–28 μm IR radiometer
* 352 nm UV photometer
* 2 photo-polarimeters (335–800 nm)
* 300–800 nm spectrometer
* Lyman-α (alpha) H/D spectrometer
* Bistatic radar mapping
* CM, DM radio occultations
* Triaxial Magnetometer
* 345–380 nm UV camera
* 355–445 nm camera
* 6 electrostatic analyzers
* 2 modulation ion traps
* Low-energy proton / alpha detector
* Low-energy electron detector
* 3 semiconductor counters
* 2 gas-discharge counters
* Cherenkov detector

==Lander==

The lander was encased in a spherical shell before landing to help protect it from the heat of entry as it slowed from to . This sphere was then separated with explosive bolts and a three-domed parachute was deployed which slowed the lander further to at an altitude of above the planet.

The descent through the cloud layer took about 20 minutes, during which time the lander took measurements of the atmosphere and radioed the information to the orbiter. To minimize lander damage in the hot atmosphere, the parachute was released at an altitude of , and the ring-shaped aerodynamic shield provided braking. The Venusian atmosphere is so dense near the surface that this shield provided a descent rate of as the lander touched down. The landing device, a hollow ring surrounding the lower part of the lander, was partly crushed upon touchdown to take up most of the landing impact.

On October 20, 1975, the lander spacecraft separated from the orbiter, and landing was made with the Sun near zenith at 05:13 UTC on October 22. &quot;Venera 9&quot; landed within a radius of , near Beta Regio, on a steep (20°) slope covered with boulders (suspected to be the slope of the tectonic rift valley, Aikhylu Chasma). The entry sphere weighed and the surface payload was .

It was the first spacecraft to return an image from the surface of another planet. Many of the instruments began working immediately after touchdown and the cameras were operational 2 minutes later. These instruments revealed a smooth surface with numerous stones. The lander measured a light level of 14,000 lux, similar to that of Earth in full daylight but no direct sunshine.

A system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load. This system, plus pre-cooling prior to entry, permitted operation of the lander for 53 minutes after landing, at which time radio contact with the orbiter was lost as the orbiter moved out of radio range. During descent, heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells, three parachutes, a disc-shaped drag brake, and a compressible, metal, doughnut-shaped landing cushion. The landing was about from the &quot;Venera 10&quot; landing site.

&quot;Venera 9&quot; measured clouds that were thick with bases at altitude. It also measured atmospheric chemicals including hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, bromine and iodine. Other measurements included surface pressure of about , temperature of , and surface light levels comparable to those at Earth mid-latitudes on a cloudy summer day. &quot;Venera 9&quot; was the first probe to send back television pictures (black and white) from the Venusian surface, showing no shadows, no apparent dust in the air, and a variety of rocks which were not eroded. Planned 360-degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because one of two camera lens covers failed to come off, limiting pictures to 180 degrees. This failure recurred with &quot;Venera 10&quot;.

===Lander payload===
The lander payload was as follows:
* Temperature and pressure sensors
* Accelerometer
* Visible / IR photometer – IOV-75
* Backscatter and multi-angle nephelometers – MNV-75
* P-11 mass spectrometer – MAV-75
* Panoramic telephotometers (2, with lamps)
* Anemometer – ISV-75
* Gamma-ray spectrometer – GS-12V
* Gamma-ray densitometer – RP-75

<text>Venera 10 ( meaning &quot;Venus 10&quot;), or 4V-1 No. 661, was a Soviet uncrewed space mission to Venus. It consisted of an orbiter and a lander. It was launched on June 14, 1975, 03:00:31 UTC and had a mass of 5033 kg (11096 lb).

==Orbiter==
When the mission launched, the Soviet Union only disclosed that the mission&#x27;s objective was to explore Venus and the surrounding space. Western sources speculated that the spacecraft contained a lander.

The orbiter entered Venus orbit on October 23, 1975. Its mission was to serve as a communications relay for the lander and to explore cloud layers and atmospheric parameters with several instruments and experiments:

* 1.6–2.8 μm IR Spectrometer
* 8–28 μm IR Radiometer
* 352 nm UV Photometer
* 2 Photopolarimeters (335–800 nm)
* 300–800 nm Spectrometer
* Lyman-α H/D Spectrometer
* Bistatic radar mapping
* CM, DM radio occultations
* Triaxial Magnetometer
* 345–380 nm UV Camera
* 355–445 nm Camera
* 6 Electrostatic analyzers
* 2 Modulation Ion Traps
* Low-Energy Proton / Alpha detector
* Low-Energy Electron detector
* 3 Semiconductor counters
* 2 Gas-Discharge counters
* Cherenkov detector

The orbiter consisted of a cylinder with two solar panel wings and a high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface. A bell-shaped unit holding propulsion systems was attached to the bottom of the cylinder, and mounted on top was a sphere which held the landers. To reach Venus, the spacecraft traveled in a heliocentric orbit from Earth to the planet with perihelion of 0.72 AU, apohelion of 1.02 AU, eccentricity of 0.17, inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 294 days.

==Lander==

On October 23, 1975, the lander separated from the orbiter, and touched down with the sun near zenith, at 05:17 UT, on October 25.
A system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load. This system, plus precooling prior to entry, permitted operation of the spacecraft for 65 minutes after landing. During descent, heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells, three parachutes, a disk-shaped drag brake, and a compressible, metal, doughnut-shaped, landing cushion.

It landed near the border area between Beta Regio and Hyndla Regio (within a 150 km radius of ), three days after the touchdown of, and 2200 km from Venera 9. Venera 10 measured a surface windspeed of 3.5 m/s. Other measurements included atmospheric pressure at various heights, and temperature, and surface light levels. Venera 10 was the second probe to send back black and white television pictures from the Venusian surface (after Venera 9). Venera 10 photographs showed lava rocks of pancake shape with lava or other weathered rocks in between. Planned 360 degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because, as with Venera 9, one of two camera lens covers failed to come off, limiting pictures to 180 degrees.

The lander communicated with Earth using the Venera 10 orbiter as a communication relay.

Lander payload:

* Temperature and pressure sensors
* Accelerometer
* Visible / IR photometer – IOV-75
* Backscatter and multi-angle nephelometers – MNV-75
* P-11 Mass spectrometer – MAV-75
* Panoramic telephotometers (2, with lamps)
* Anemometer – ISV-75
* Gamma-ray spectrometer – GS-12V
* Gamma ray densitometer – RP-75
* Radio Doppler experiment

<text>Beauchief Abbey is a medieval monastic house now serving as a parish church in the southern suburbs of Sheffield, England.

==History==
The abbey was founded by Robert FitzRanulph de Alfreton. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that it was founded in 1183. However, Samuel Pegge in his &quot;History of Beauchief Abbey&quot; noted that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, who was one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1173. Tanner stated that Robert FitzRanulf was one of the murderers of Thomas Becket and founded the abbey to expiate his guilt. Pegge also disputed this fact, showing that Robert FitzRanulf had no connection with the murder. The abbey once contained an alabaster altar-piece, which depicted the death of Thomas Becket. In the 1879 the altarpiece was known to be in the possession of a Mr. Foljambe, of Osberton, near Worksop.
The abbey was of the Premonstratensian order founded by Saint Norbert at Prémontré in France. Members of the order are known as White Canons. Beauchief was a small house comprising around 12 to 15 canons plus lay brothers. It had the full range of monastic buildings including the abbey church, cloisters, chapter house, dormitory and refectory. A stream provided water to the Abbey and to fish ponds.

As with most monastic sites, Beauchief was an industrial as well as a religious centre. Farming on the Beauchief estate and on outlying manors was important, and the monastery also controlled iron smelting, mineral extraction, woodland industries and mills on the River Sheaf from which Sheffield takes its name.

The Abbey was dissolved in 1537 and the estate became the property of Sir Nicholas Strelley, from whom it descended to the Pegge family through the marriage of Edward Pegge of Ashbourne, Derbyshire to Gertrude Strelley, heiress of the Strelley&#x27;s, in Norton on 17 July 1648. In 1671 Edward Pegge built Beauchief Hall using stone from the now ruined Abbey. In 1923 the estate was purchased by Mr Frank Crawshaw. Some of the land was sold for housing development but much was presented to Sheffield Corporation.

==Beauchief Park today==

Today only the western tower of the Abbey remains, together with some ruins (including a wall) to the immediate south-east. The tower is attached to a chapel (now a church) built in the 17th century, but what remains is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The foundations of other buildings are visible and the medieval fishponds still exist. Much of the old estate is now occupied by two golf courses (Abbeydale Golf Club and Beauchief Golf Club), but several areas of ancient woodland remain: Parkbank Wood to the East of the Abbey, Old Park Wood and Little Wood Bank to the south, Gulleys Wood in the centre of the park and Ladies Spring Wood to the west. Public footpaths run through the estate, including across the golf courses and through several of the woods. The Sheffield Round Walk arrives from Park Bank Wood, running eastwards through Chancet Wood and on to Graves Park.

===Ladies Spring Wood (also known as Totley Wood)===

This is an arc-shaped area of mature deciduous woodland on a steep bank facing the River Sheaf to the west. It was formerly managed for coppicing with standards—the remains of charcoal platforms and q-pits are still to be found here. It is currently managed by Sheffield City Council for wildlife and public recreation, and has two public footpaths running through. The trees today are mainly sessile oak, with birch and rowan on the upper slopes and ash and alder on the lower slopes and on the river terrace, with small numbers of other species also represented. The upper terrace is dominated by rhododendrons. The wood supports many birds, including white-throated dipper by the river and several species of hole-nesting birds including the nuthatch, the green woodpecker, the great spotted woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker.
There is significant evidence that this is primary ancient woodland, including:
* The name: &quot;Spring&quot; is Anglo-Saxon for coppicing, indicating that the wood existed (and was managed for coppicing) many hundreds of years ago.
* The shape. The wood&#x27;s edge has several bends and zig-zags, characteristic of the surrounding land being cleared over a long period of time.
* The location: The River Sheaf on its western border used to be the boundary between the parishes of Sheffield and Norton; and formerly the boundary between Yorkshire and Derbyshire; and before that, the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon states of Mercia and Northumbria. Woodland on such boundaries is often left undeveloped.
* The absence of evidence of early settlements or field boundaries.
It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its biological interest, under the name &quot;Totley Wood&quot;.

===Parkbank Wood===
This is also an old mature wood, though it has seen more active use in the past and may not be primary ancient woodland. There is again evidence of charcoal and white coal manufacture in the form of charcoal hearths and Q-pits, and also evidence of former quarrying and boundary ditches, which may indicate that the area was at one time cleared for agriculture. This is also now mostly mature sessile oak, and has public footpaths granting access, including the Sheffield Round Walk.

The parkland, though it has had its topography altered for the golf courses, still includes evidence of mediaeval ridge and furrow farming.

<doc id="599936" wikidata="Q944523" url="?curid=599936" title="Ulster Defence Regiment">
<text>The Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was an infantry regiment of the British Army established in 1970, with a comparatively short existence ending in 1992. Raised through public appeal, newspaper and television advertisements, their official role was the &quot;defence of life or property in Northern Ireland against armed attack or sabotage&quot; but unlike troops from Great Britain they were never used for &quot;crowd control or riot duties in cities&quot;. At the time the UDR was the largest infantry regiment in the British Army, formed with seven battalions plus another four added within two years.

It consisted mostly of part-time volunteers until 1976, when a full-time cadre was added. Recruiting in Northern Ireland at a time of intercommunal strife, some of its (mostly Ulster Protestant) members were involved in sectarian killings. The regiment was originally intended to more accurately reflect the demographics of Northern Ireland, and began with Catholic recruits accounting for 18% of its soldiers; but by the end of 1972, after the introduction of internment this had dropped to around 3%. It is doubtful if any other unit of the British Army has ever come under the same sustained criticism as the UDR.

Uniquely in the British Army, the regiment was on continuous active service throughout its 22 years of service. It was also the first infantry regiment of the British Army to fully incorporate women into its structure. In 1992, the UDR was amalgamated with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment. In 2006, the regiment was retroactively awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.

==Background==
The UDR was raised in 1970, soon after the beginning of the Northern Ireland &quot;Troubles&quot;. Before then, the main security forces were the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC), otherwise known as the &quot;B Specials&quot;. Catholics were reluctant to join what they saw as unionist militias that lacked impartiality leading to the forces becoming almost entirely Protestant.

Large scale intercommunal rioting in 1969 stretched police resources in Northern Ireland, so the British Army was deployed to assist the police. On 28 August 1969 security in Northern Ireland, including the USC, was put under the direct control of the General Officer Commanding in Northern Ireland, General Ian Freeland.

The USC, which had no training in riot control, was mobilised to assist the RUC. A catalogue of incidents ensued, such as Specials from Tynan shooting dead an unarmed civil rights demonstrator in Armagh on 14 August 1969. While the Northern Ireland cabinet remained supportive of the USC, it was put to them at a London meeting on 19 August that disbanding the USC was top of the British government&#x27;s agenda.

The Hunt Report commissioned by the Government of Northern Ireland published on 3 October 1969, recommended that the RUC &quot;should be relieved of all duties of a military nature as soon as possible&quot;. Further; a &quot;locally recruited part-time force, under the control of the G.O.C., Northern Ireland, should be raised&quot; ... and that it &quot;together with the police volunteer reserve, should replace the Ulster Special Constabulary&quot;. The new force was to be &quot;impartial in every sense&quot; and &quot;remove the responsibility of military-style operations from the police&quot;.

The British government accepted the findings of the Hunt Report and published a Bill and white paper on 12 November 1969 to begin the process of establishing the UDR. Parliamentary debate in Westminster highlighted concerns that members of the USC were to be allowed to join the new force.

A working party was set up at Headquarters Northern Ireland (HQNI) chaired by Major General A.J. Dyball of the Royal Ulster Rifles, then the deputy director of operations in Northern Ireland. The team included a staff officer from the Ministry of Defence (MOD), a member of the Ministry of Home Affairs (Stormont) and Lieutenant Colonel S Miskimmon, the USC staff officer to the RUC. After discussions, they advocated a strength of 6,000 men (2,000 more than the Hunt recommendations), combat dress for duties, a dark green parade uniform, county shoulder titles, and a &quot;red hand of Ulster&quot; cap badge. The rank of &quot;volunteer&quot; was suggested for private soldiers. They recommended that each battalion should have a mobile force of two platoons, each equipped with a Land Rovers fitted for radio plus three &quot;manpack&quot; radio sets.

After the presentation to the Ministry of Defence, a government white paper confirmed the agreed aspects of the new force and its task as:

==Name==
When the Ulster Defence Regiment Bill, the legislation establishing the regiment, was being debated in Parliament there was considerable discussion about its proposed name. An amendment to the legislation was proposed that would have given the regiment the name &quot;Northern Ireland Territorial Force&quot;. Proponents of this amendment were concerned to ensure that the word &quot;Ulster&quot; be removed from the name of the regiment. They argued that the name &quot;Ulster&quot; evoked emotive resistance from many Catholics in Northern Ireland and that the term &quot;Ulster&quot; had been associated with the Orange organisations and other organisations perceived as excluding Catholics e.g. the Ulster Protestant Volunteers, the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Special Constabulary. They argued &quot;Ulster&quot; had strong party political and partisan connotations and would deter Catholic participation in the new regiment. One speaker said the name &quot;Ulster&quot; would &quot;frighten the Catholics away&quot;. They also argued that as three of Ulster&#x27;s nine counties were not in Northern Ireland, the title was inaccurate, especially given that persons from outside of Northern Ireland would be prohibited by law from joining the regiment.

For the British government&#x27;s part, those defending the proposed name argued that the term &quot;Ulster&quot; should still be included because of precedent; in the past, it had been attached to certain regiments in Northern Ireland. Another opponent of the amendment disagreed that Catholics would be put off joining because of the force. He pointed to the Ulster Unionist Party as an example of an organisation that included the word Ulster and had many Catholic members. The Under-Secretary of State for the Army said &quot;the Government considered that the use of the word &#x27;Ulster&#x27; is, frankly, unimportant&quot;. Another speaker said a majority in Northern Ireland prefer the word &quot;Ulster&quot;. The proposed amendment was defeated and the UDR got its name.

==Formation and recruitment==

The Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1969 (c. 65) received royal assent on 18 December 1969 and was brought into force on 1 January 1970.

General Sir John Anderson GCB, KCB DSO (5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards) was appointed as the first Colonel Commandant. He came to be known as the &quot;Father of the Regiment&quot;. The first regimental commander was a WW2 veteran of some distinction, Brigadier Logan Scott-Bowden CBE, DSO, MC &amp; Bar.

Regimental Headquarters was set up in a small bungalow behind the NAAFI shop at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn.

Recruitment began on 1 January with a press conference. Advertisements appeared in local newspapers informing the Northern Ireland public that: &quot;There&#x27;s a new regiment in the army. We want you to help us form it.&quot; A coupon was provided for applicants to fill in, alternatively, those interested could pick up an information leaflet and application form from their local army barracks, TA Centre, Post Office, police station or library. A one-minute television commercial was produced which included a personal appeal by Brigadier Scott-Bowden. Recruiting was open to all &quot;male citizens of good character&quot; between the ages of 18 and 55. Application forms were sent to all members of the USC, which was soon to be wound up.

Vetting was carried out by a Regular Army team of mostly retired officers from outside Northern Ireland including a vice admiral and a number of major generals. Each applicant had to provide two references and the referees would be interviewed by a vetting officer. Applicants were divided into three categories: those who were immediately deemed acceptable, those who were to be immediately rejected, and those whose applications threw up doubt about their suitability. All applications were supposed to be submitted to the RUC Special Branch and Criminal Investigation Department, but in practice, this didn&#x27;t always happen because of the initially high number of applicants.

On 13 January 1970 seven &quot;training majors&quot; from the regular army reported for duty. None had served in Northern Ireland previously. Their job was to raise each battalion and have it ready for duty on 1 April. These came to be known as TISOs (training, intelligence, and security officers). Each was assisted by a regular army quartermaster, a corporal clerk, a civil service Clerical Officer to act as Chief Clerk, and a typist.

Premises were acquired from diverse sources including wooden huts in army training centres, USC huts or whatever accommodation could be found in regular army barracks or Territorial Army Centres.

Seven battalions were formed initially: 1st (County Antrim); 2nd (County Armagh); 3rd (County Down); 4th (County Fermanagh); 5th (County Londonderry); 6th (County Tyrone) and 7th (City of Belfast). On 1 April 1970 the regiment joined the British Army&#x27;s Order of Battle and became operational.

===Commissioned officer recruitment===
For each battalion there was a minimum requirement of:
* 1 lieutenant colonel
* 6 majors
* 7 captains
* 25 lieutenants (including 2nd lieutenants)

To recruit company and platoon officers, Scott-Bowden and his subordinates were obliged to award instant commissions to people deemed suitable. The ideal candidates were sought in the USC, reserve forces, university Officers&#x27; Training Corps and Army Cadet Force. In various battalions officers of company and platoon rank could be found who had served in the USC, the Regular and Territorial Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Marines, the Indian Army and even the United States Army. In addition to the problem of finding officers there had to be observance of the Protestant/Catholic ratio but by March 1971, 18 Catholic officers had been recruited and the total number of officers was just enough for battalions to function at their current strengths. This rose to 23. All seven battalions were led by former commandants of the USC.

===Non-commissioned officer recruitment/appointment===
For each battalion there was a minimum requirement of:
* 1 Regimental Sergeant Major (Warrant Officer 1st Class (WO1))
* 7 Warrant Officers 2nd Class (WO2)
* 25 Sergeants
* 25 Corporals
* 25 Lance Corporals

The appointment of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) was carried out in a variety of ways too. In most cases, men were selected who had previously held non-commissioned rank in any of the armed forces or the USC. In at least one case (2 UDR) they were chosen by the men themselves. In some battalions, men were appointed as lance corporals (l/cpl) on a duty-by-duty basis to assess their worth. In the Newry (C) company of 3 UDR], many of the recruits had formerly been soldiers in the local territorial company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, including the company commander. It was a simple matter to appoint men who had previously been his NCOs and he supplemented these with former sergeants from the USC. The filling of senior NCO posts in this manner did have a drawback in that many men of comparatively young ages who had considerable years of service before retirement or promotion created a &quot;promotion block&quot;.

===USC recruitment===
The response from the B Specials was mixed. Some felt betrayed and resigned immediately, while others made application to join the UDR as soon as forms were available. Others joined the newly formed RUC Reserve instead, especially in Belfast, where during the first month of recruiting, only 36 Specials applied to join the UDR compared to an average of 29% – 2,424, one thousand of whom were rejected, mainly on the grounds of age and fitness. Around 75% of the men of the Tyrone B Specials applied, of whom 419 were accepted and, as a result, 6 UDR started life as the only battalion more or less up to strength, and remained so during its history. In five of the seven battalions, former Specials made up more than half of personnel; in 4 UDR, it reached 87%. The story was different in Belfast (10%) and the rest of Antrim (42%), where the figures were more balanced, with a correspondingly higher proportion of Catholic recruits.

Some former B Specials felt so aggrieved at the loss of their force that they booed and jeered passing UDR patrols. Most anger seemed to be in County Down, where the USC District adjutant actively campaigned to persuade his men not to apply.

===Catholic recruitment===
The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; stated on 18 February 1970 that the first two soldiers reported as signing up were a 19-year-old Catholic and a 47-year-old Protestant. The regiment began with Catholic recruits accounting for 18% of the membership. Many were ex-regular soldiers, &quot;eager to get back into uniform&quot;. By 1987 Catholic membership was 4%.

===Recruitment summary===
By March 1970, there had been 4,791 applications to join, of which 946 were from Catholics and 2,424 from current or former members of the B-Specials. 2,440 had been accepted, including 1,423 from current or former B-Specials.

As the percentage of recruits from both communities did not reflect the religious demographics of Northern Ireland, it never became the model Lord Hunt intended. Catholics continued to join the regiment, but the numbers were never representative. They were highest in 3 UDR, which had the highest percentage of Catholics throughout the Troubles, beginning with 30%, although this was a much lower percentage than that of the battalion area. Some sections were staffed entirely by Catholics, which led to protests from the B Specials Association that in 3 UDR &quot;preference for promotion and allocation of appointments was being given to Catholics&quot;. This was partially explained by the fact that in the mostly Catholic town of Newry, the Territorial Army company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers had been disbanded in 1968 and the vast majority of its soldiers had joined the UDR en masse.

The company commander of C Company, (Newry), 3 UDR, was the former commander of the TA unit and was pleased to see that virtually all of his TA soldiers were on parade, in the TA Centre, in exactly the same drill hall as they had previously used, for the first night of the new regiment. He noted there were some former B Specials in the room and observed they did not initially associate with the others – not on the grounds of religion but because the former TA soldiers all knew each other socially and sat together on canteen breaks whereas the former specials kept to their group of comrades, but within a week both had melded together.

By 1 April 1970, only 1,606 of the desired 4,000 men had been enlisted, and the UDR began its duties much under strength. The regiment continued to grow, however. In 1973 numbers peaked at 9,100 (all part-time) and at the time of amalgamation had stabilised its numbers at 2,797 permanent cadre soldiers and 2,620 part-time.

==Structure==

===Command structure===

Unlike the USC, who were controlled by the Stormont government in Belfast, the UDR was under the direct command of the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland (GOCNI), the commander of the British Army in Northern Ireland. A six-man UDR Advisory Council (three Protestant and three Catholic) was formed and chaired by the colonel commandant. Its brief was &quot;to advise the GOCNI on policy for the administration of the Ulster Defence Regiment, in particular on recruitment; and on such specific matters as the GOCNI might refer to the council.&quot;

The regiment would be commanded by a regular army brigadier. Battalions were to be commanded by &quot;local members of the force&quot;.

Commanding officers were initially former County Commandants from the disbanded USC. All were men of previous military experience, such as Dublin-born Desmond Woods who had at one time been the youngest winner of the Military Cross (serving with the Royal Ulster Rifles) and Michael Torrens-Spence DSO, DSC, AFC. All were appointed lieutenant colonel on a one-year contract. However, some of these men were already past retirement age and after their year&#x27;s contract was up they were replaced by lieutenant colonels from the regular army, the first of these being Lt Col Dion Beard of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment (1 RTR) who took over at 3 UDR on 15 February 1971. The policy of appointing regular officers was not universally popular within the regiment, with the public or with some politicians, but the British Army persisted in replacing former USC commanding officers and by the time of amalgamation, around 400 regular army officers had served in these posts, some of whom went on to achieve general officer rank.

A newspaper for the regiment was published, called &quot;Defence&quot;. Commanders were able to communicate their views through this as well as through Part 2 Orders (routine orders) which, as with every British Army unit, were displayed on company noticeboards and were compulsory reading.

===Battalion structure===

The first seven battalions raised made the UDR the largest infantry regiment in the British Army at that time. Two years later, four more were added, taking the total to eleven – 8th (County Tyrone); 9th (Country Antrim); 10th (City of Belfast) and 11th (Craigavon).

The regiment was described in 1972 as:

Organised into 11 Battalions (59) companies: two in Belfast and the remainder cover county or sub-county areas. Seven of the eleven are commanded by regular commanding officers. In addition the training majors, quartermaster, regimental sergeant majors, chief clerks, and signaller NCOs are also regulars. There are a number of &#x27;conrate&#x27; (full-time UDR) posts in each unit, including adjutants, permanent staff instructors, security guards, etc. Many of the officer and senior rank conrates are ex-regulars. The remainder are part-timers. Their main tasks are guarding key points, patrolling, and surveillance, and manning vehicle checkpoints. They do not operate in the &#x27;hard&#x27; areas of Belfast, and are not permitted to become involved in crowd confrontations anywhere. Men are armed with self-loading rifles or sub-machine guns. The current strength of the Regiment is 7910.

Until 1976 the full-time cadre were &quot;conrates&quot; (so called because they had a &quot;consolidated rate of pay&quot;) whose duties consisted of guarding bases and carrying out administrative tasks. The role of the regiment was expanded by raising full-time platoons, known as &quot;Operations Platoons&quot;, to perform duties on a 24-hour basis. The first of these was raised at 2 UDR under the command of a sergeant. By the end of the 1970s, the permanent cadre had been raised to sixteen platoons. These were then increased to company strength with the conrate role being phased out and full-time UDR soldiers undertaking their own guard duties and administration.
The full-time element eventually increased to more than half the total personnel.

In 1990, the regiment&#x27;s numbers stood at 3,000 part-time and 3,000 full-time soldiers, with 140 attached regular army personnel in key command and training positions. The standard of training of the permanent cadre made them suitable to be used in much the same way as regular soldiers and it was not uncommon for regular army units to then come under local command and control of a UDR Battalion Headquarters.

The dispersal of UDR soldiers into their areas of responsibility was through sub-barracks of platoon or company size. Battalion headquarters would usually be located in the county town, but not always as some counties had two battalions. Guarded by conrate soldiers, these barracks would become doubly active after 6 as part-time soldiers arrived for evening duties. After Ulsterisation began in 1976, many battalion headquarters had full-sized permanent cadre companies and these would maintain a 24-hour presence in the battalion&#x27;s &quot;tactical area of responsibility&quot; (TAOR).

An example of this structure can be seen in the make-up of 2 UDR based at Drumadd Barracks in Armagh:
Sub-headquarter units would maintain contact with their own patrols and HQ by radio. In many cases the radios were operated by Greenfinches (female soldiers), whose husbands or sons and/or daughters were on one of the active patrols, which led to tense moments when mobile units or foot patrols came under attack and submitted a &quot;contact report&quot; by radio.

==Uniform, armament and equipment==

===Uniform===
The early image of the regiment, due to equipment and uniform shortages, was of a rag-tag bunch using World War II weaponry, old army uniforms and carrying pockets full of loose change in order to make reports from public telephone boxes. Many of the soldiers were veterans of earlier campaigns with the British Army or had been in the Special Constabulary and were middle-aged; this earned them the public nickname of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; – the sobriquet given to the Home Guard during World War II.

After equipment shortages were resolved, male soldiers dressed in a similar fashion to regular army units. Camouflage jackets were worn and headgear was a distinctive dark green beret with a gold coloured &quot;Maid of Erin&quot; style harp, surmounted by St Edward&#x27;s Crown (in later years this was dulled down by blackening, a common practice for units of the British army when wearing cap badges on operational duties). The badge was a direct copy of the Royal Ulster Rifles cap badge with the Latin motto removed from its base. Female &quot;Greenfinch&quot; soldiers wore combat jackets and rifle green skirts with the UDR beret and cap badge. For ceremonial occasions men wore a rifle green version of British Army (No.1 Temperate ceremonial). Female &quot;best dress&quot; was a rifle green jacket and skirt. The beret was retained as headgear for men and women in best dress. On the formation of operations platoons, narrow coloured slides were adopted and worn on the shoulder straps in battalion colours. These indicated to the trained eye that the wearers were full-time soldiers. They were dispensed with as the operations platoons expanded into full-time rifle companies and were replaced by battalion-specific epaulette slides. Rank badges were as for infantry NCOs and officers and worn in the same fashion.

===Armaments===
Initially, the weapons issued were of WW2 vintage such as Lee–Enfield No.4 rifles and Sten submachine guns. In early 1972 the rifles were replaced with the standard issue L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR). Other weaponry became available too: 9 mm Browning pistols (Browning 9mm), the Sterling submachine guns (SMG), the L4A4 Light Machine Guns (Bren LMG) and L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)s. Small stocks of Federal Riot Guns (FRG) were kept and used to fire plastic bullets to knock down doors and other obstacles during search operations. A number of Carl Gustav (Charlie G) 84 mm recoilless rifles were stocked but rarely deployed as the weapon was unsuited to most operations. (see Boat Sections below). SLRs were replaced in 1988 by the SA80 and at the same time machine guns were superseded by the Light Support Weapon. Metal caltrops were used at vehicle check points to puncture tyres on cars trying to escape roadblocks.

For personal protection off duty, some soldiers were issued with a Walther PP. Major Ken Maginnis acquired permission for some to purchase Browning 9mm pistols at £200 each. These were deemed to be more effective. In the late 1980s the Walther PP was replaced by the Walther P5, considered a more practical weapon because of its size and ballistic capabilities. Any soldier considered to be at particularly high risk would be permitted to keep his rifle at home. This policy was known as &quot;weapons out&quot; and was reduced by 75%, when SLRs replaced Lee–Enfields in 1972, due to the high number of rifles stolen by paramilitaries.

The weapons out policy was eventually discontinued on the introduction of the SA80 rifle by that time only a small number were held at home by soldiers of 6 UDR.

====Weapons used by the Ulster Defence Regiment====
Firearms

===Equipment===

====Transport====

The standard patrol vehicle was the 3/4 ton Land Rover used extensively throughout the British armed forces. Following withdrawal from police service, a number of Shorland armoured cars were allocated to the regiment. Rarely used after initial service because the turret weapon was a GPMG and deemed unsuitable for urban use due to its rapid rate of fire. The Shorland was not generally popular due to its instability on the road. This was due to the heavy turret. However, some battalions continued to use them into the 1980s in high-risk area because of the increased protection plate armour gave over Makrolon polycarbonate armour fitted to Land Rovers. The tough Shorlands saved the lives of a number of people on patrol.

Units were sometimes deployed by Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps helicopters for rapid insertion or for duties in areas of greatest threat where it was unwise to use &quot;green transport&quot; (wheeled).

====Boat patrols====
Several battalions were supplied with rigid Dell Quay Dory craft for patrolling waterways shared with the Republic of Ireland in an attempt to prevent gun-running across these narrow channels such as Carlingford Lough. Assisted by land-based Decca Marine radar mounted on a Land Rover, deployed at Killowen Point. These boats were armed with Bren light machine guns and carried a Carl Gustav 84mm anti-tank weapon in addition to the rifles and sub-machine guns normally carried by soldiers. The shore-based dories proved inadequate and a paper was submitted by 3 UDR in 1972, recommending a naval vessel to be stationed in the centre of Carlingford Lough to assist with the suppression of gun-running. This suggestion was adopted and to the end of the security situation a small warship was on station off the coast of the Warrenpoint/Rostrevor shoreline. This intervention was called Operation Grenada. Gun-running across these coastal estuaries ceased as a result. 3 UDR continued to use dories and radar on stretches of the coast. The radar was withdrawn from use and later dispatched to the south Atlantic during the Falklands War on board the and lost when the ship was sunk after being hit by two Argentine Exocet missiles. The 4th Battalion also carried out waterway patrols on upper and lower Lough Erne.

====Communications====
At first there were not enough radios to issue to each patrol and those available were of the PYE &quot;Bantam&quot; type used by the police, which did not have sufficient range. As a result, UDR patrols were issued with pockets of small change to use in telephone boxes in order to effectively report back to base. When radios were issued they were of the type used by the regular army such as Larkspur A41 manpacks, B47 and C42 vehicle mounted sets. Over time these were replaced with &quot;Stornophones&quot; as vehicle sets with preselected frequencies which operated on the NINET rebroadcast system, working through masts strategically placed on various high points throughout Northern Ireland such as Slieve Croob. Pyephones continued to be used for foot patrols but the range of these sets gradually improved. Each battalion was able to communicate with other battalions using C42&#x27;s and B47&#x27;s installed in the battalion or company Operations room (Ops Room) or Communications Centre (Comcen) as well as the BID 150 system of cryptic coding and scrambler telephone system.

====Dogs====
Search dogs were originally provided by the regular army but eventually a UDR dog section was formed to provide more immediate assistance in search operations. One of the dog handlers, Corporal Brian David Brown of 3 UDR together with his Labrador dog Oliver was killed in Kilkeel by an IRA bomb in 1986. Cpl Brown was posthumously awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal.

====The Yellow Card====

All members of the British Armed Forces, including the UDR, carried a number of small information cards to assist in the execution of their duties in Northern Ireland. These were generally referred to by their colour. The most important of these was the Yellow Card which contained the rules for opening fire.

This content of this information card was seen as vitally important and all soldiers were taught to be entirely familiar with it as it contained specific instructions to be followed when opening fire on a suspected enemy. Requiring, &quot;total understanding and instantaneous recall of the provisions...&quot; Warnings were to be issued to allow suspects to surrender. Soldiers could only shoot without warning &quot;if there is no other way to protect themselves or those whom it is their duty to protect from the danger of being killed or seriously injured.&quot; The card was amended in 1980 to carry the words &quot;Firearms must only be used as a last resort&quot;. The use of the card was debated in Parliament.

==Personnel==

===Training===
25% of the new recruits in 1970 had no previous military or special constabulary experience. Training was done by a team of regular soldiers attached to each unit headed up by a training major, assisted by former instructors from the armed forces who were recruits themselves.

The annual training commitment for each part-time soldier was twelve days and twelve, two-hour training periods. Part of which included attendance at annual training camp. As an incentive, any soldier who fulfilled his training was given an annual bounty of £25-£35, later increased to £150 for the first year, £250 for the second and £350 for the third and subsequent years. This bounty in modern terms would be worth £1674 per year. Pay was also given for training days but this was less than the rate for operational duty.

As with all British military recruits, training started with an introduction to basic battle skills and the book of the same name, which, where possible, was issued to each individual soldier. Instruction was also given on the Army marksmanship pamphlet &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot;.

Part-time (and later, permanent cadre) soldiers were required to attend an annual camp for a seven-day period. Camps were located at:

These camps not only provided intensive training but they included days out and social events where soldiers could relax and drop their guard, well away from the troubled areas they normally patrolled.

From 1975 onwards specially trained search teams were created to comb the countryside and derelict buildings for illegal stashes of weapons and explosives. Some of these dumps were booby trapped and particular care and alertness was needed.

Training continued to be done at each battalion&#x27;s own HQ until 2 July 1979 when the UDR Training Centre opened at the old weekend training camp at Ballykinlar, County Down. The first recruit courses as the centre for permanent cadre troops were four weeks long and the subjects included physical training, foot drill, assault course, range firing, foot and mobile patrol procedures (including vehicle stops), map reading, signals, first aid and a grounding in legal responsibilities. The first recruit course passed out on 28 July 1979 and the salute was taken by Brigadier David Miller, Commander UDR. Courses were not just for permanent cadre and included training for:platoon commanders, platoon sergeants, potential NCOs, skill-at-arms, surveillance, intelligence, photography and search updating.

In 1990 the UDR Training Centre became responsible for all military training in Northern Ireland. Under the command of a regular army lieutenant colonel seconded to the UDR. The centre then ran courses for the regular army and RAF Regiment individual reinforcements on search team training, combat medics, skill-at-arms, and NCO training; as well as the management of the extensive weapon ranges at Ballykinlar.

===Family===
In some cases several members of a family would join the same unit. This led to husbands, wives, sons and daughters, even grandparents serving together. Whilst this did create a good &quot;esprit de corps&quot; there were problems created. Once anyone in a family joined the Ulster Defence Regiment the entire household, even children, had to be educated on personal safety. The hours were long and soldiers had to forfeit a normal family life. On duty too there were issues. Family members had to be split into different patrols and vehicles so that if one unit was attacked an entire family would not run the risk of being killed or wounded at the same time. In 1975 there were eighty four married couples serving and fifty three family groups of three or more.

UDR soldiers lived in their own civilian homes, (except for attached regular army personnel who were given &quot;quarters&quot;).

Many lived in Protestant or Catholic enclaves which put them within easy reach of local paramilitary or community groups. The years 1972–73 saw paramilitary threats from loyalist and republican sources. Of the 288 incidents of intimidation reported, all but twelve were from Protestants who had been threatened from within their own community. Sometimes this was to gain information or to persuade soldiers to join (or remain within) loyalist organisations. The intimidation included: threatening letters and phone calls, abduction, shots fired from passing cars and off-duty soldiers being assaulted.

In the early days some even lived in what would later become known as &quot;hard line areas&quot; such as Private Sean Russell of 7 UDR who lived in the New Barnsley Estate in Belfast. This led to many UDR soldiers becoming targets for various paramilitary groups whilst off duty and indeed Sean Russell was subsequently targeted and killed whilst at home, in front of his family.

==Resignation of Catholic soldiers==
In 1970–71, Catholics made up about 36% of the population and about 18% of the UDR. By the end of 1972 the number of Catholics in the UDR had dropped to 3% and never rose above that figure again. There are a number of reasons for this. In the early years of the conflict, relations soured between the Catholic community and the Army. This was mainly due to incidents such as the Falls Curfew, internment, Bloody Sunday and Operation Motorman. There were also frequent claims of UDR soldiers abusing Catholics at checkpoints and during house searches. Many Catholic soldiers left the regiment due to pressure and intimidation from their own community, and the IRA&#x27;s policy of singling out Catholic soldiers for assassination. Catholics within the regiment also reported being intimidated by Protestant fellow soldiers. Other Catholics resigned in protest at what they saw as the Army&#x27;s harsh and biased treatment of their community, especially after Operation Demetrius (the introduction of internment). The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; reported that 25% of the regiment&#x27;s Catholics resigned in 1971, half of those in the months following Operation Demetrius. By the end of 1972, the vast majority had resigned or simply stopped turning up for duty.

Senior officers attempted to halt the exodus of Catholics, allowing battalion commanders to appear on television (not usually permitted for the rank of lieutenant colonel in those days). Appeals were made to religious and political leaders and extra personal security measures were introduced. Brigadier Scott-Bowden&#x27;s successor in 1972 was Brigadier Denis Ormerod, a Catholic whose mother&#x27;s family came from the Republic of Ireland. His second-in-command (Deputy Commander UDR), Colonel Kevin Hill, was also Catholic, as was his successor Colonel Paddy Ryan. Ormerod admitted in his memoirs that his religion and appointment as the senior Catholic Army officer in Northern Ireland helped him considerably in his rapport with religious leaders of his own faith but that these appointments created unease with Protestants leading to meetings with concerned unionist politicians including, notably, Ian Paisley.

By 1981, less than 2% (160) of serving UDR soldiers were Catholic, the bulk of whom were ex-servicemen and women with the British Army from non-Irish backgrounds. Some were former regular British soldiers who had been deployed in Northern Ireland and later settled there. However, their Catholicism gave them little common ground with the Nationalist/Catholic community in Northern Ireland.

==Operational role==
Although an integral part of the British Army the UDR&#x27;s duties did not require it to be called upon to serve outside Northern Ireland. This type of engagement was subsequently referred to as &quot;Home Service&quot; and was similar to the model adopted by the short-lived Home Service Force raised in the UK in 1982.

The primary function of the regiment was to assist the RUC by &quot;guarding key points and installations, to carry out patrols and to establish check points and road blocks against armed guerrilla-type attacks&quot;.
Patrols and vehicle checkpoints on public roads were designed to hinder the activities of paramilitary groups and to reassure the law-abiding general public. Writing in 1991, Ken Maginnis recounted that the Regiment had originally been formed as a &quot;sop to Unionism&quot; and it was never intended to have a &quot;serious&quot; operational role, with UDR soldiers at first being assigned to &quot;demeaning&quot; and pointless posts such as guarding water reservoirs.

The first operational deployment of the regiment was by the 2nd and 6th battalions, deploying 400 soldiers in an 8th Infantry Brigade operation along the border with the Irish Republic in Armagh, Tyrone and Fermanagh to intercept the movement of munitions into Northern Ireland. As the force was initially part-time the presence of its soldiers was mostly felt during evenings and weekends. It was expected to answer to general call-outs, and was mobilised on a permanent basis on several occasions such as Operation Motorman to provide assistance to the police and army. As the regiment acquired more full-time soldiers it assumed duties previously assigned to the police or Army in support of Operation Banner. By 1980, the full-time element had matched the numbers of part-timers and the regiment&#x27;s role had expanded to include tactical responsibility for 85% of Northern Ireland, supporting the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

===1974 Ulster Workers Council Strike===
The first Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike took place between 15 and 28 May 1974. This is arguably the greatest test of integrity and loyalty the UDR had to endure, along with the RUC. The regiment was not called out but 3 UDR, then at annual camp in Magilligan was deployed on Sunday 19 May by road and air to the south Tyrone and south Fermanagh areas usually patrolled by 4 UDR and 6 UDR. Two days previously on 17 May loyalist paramilitaries had carried out a series of bombings in Dublin and Monaghan. The authorities believed the Provisional IRA would retaliate so had provided the 3rd Battalion as reinforcements to the local battalions.

Despite there being no call out UDR soldiers flocked to their bases for duty. They were frustrated in not being able to take any direct action against the strikers but the only orders they got were to &quot;stand back and observe&quot;. A patrol from 7 UDR was able to prevent loyalists from throwing stones and bottles at regular troops in the Ballybeen estate in Dundonald. Barricades preventing soldiers from the Newtownabbey company of 10 UDR who lived in Monkstown from getting to their base were lifted when the platoon commander and platoon sergeant went down and warned the people manning the barricades that they would &quot;regret it in the future&quot; if they continued to prevent the UDR from getting out on patrol.

Some soldiers took their turn manning the barricades alongside the UDA. These were men who lived in UDA dominated housing estates and had been threatened. Those soldiers in such areas who did not take a turn on duty were not allowed to get out of the estates to report for duty and had their cars and homes damaged and in some cases they and their wives were refused service in local shops following the strike.

There were two reported instances of loyalists trying to subvert the loyalty of UDR units. One was against an entire company of 3 UDR and one against a platoon from the 8th battalion. Both failed.

Units from 7 UDR took up positions around key points at the shipyards, an oil refinery in Sydenham and an electricity sub station in the Castlereagh hills. Forty drivers were drafted in from 1, 9 and 10 UDR battalions to assist the Royal Corps of Transport. Eventually 10 UDR and regular units forcibly dismantled the barricades in Monkstown.

Prior to the strike some army commanders and the Brigadier UDR had expressed doubts about who the UDR was loyal to and who they would support in the event of such an action by loyalists. Brigadier Baxter later commented: &quot;During the strike the UDR came of age&quot;.

===Ulsterisation===
During the 1970s, the British government introduced the Ulsterisation policy in Northern Ireland, which called for the disengagement of non-Ulsters troops from the region and replacing them with the UDR and RUC. This was done as British policymakers perceived the death of soldiers from Great Britain to be far more consequential in terms of British public opinion than what could be portrayed as &quot;Irish people killing and policing Irish people&quot;. The term &quot;Ulsterisation&quot; was coined by the media. The then Assistant Chief Constable of the RUC, Jack Hermon, summed it up when he said, &quot;Ulstermen need to learn to live together and be policed by Ulstermen. If they have to kill, let them kill each other, not English soldiers.&quot;

A report commissioned in 1976 recommended:
* An increase in the establishment of the RUC and RUC Reserve
* Creation of RUC &quot;mobile support units&quot;
* An increase in the conrate establishment of the UDR so it could take over from the regular Army
* A 24-hour military presence by the UDR

The scheme was hampered by the shortfall of conrate officers in the UDR who could take on the role of operations officers. It also placed heavier demands upon senior NCO &quot;watchkeepers&quot; in the operations rooms, or and communication centres (comcens).

The main outcome of Ulsterisation was the creation of the &quot;Province Reserve UDR&quot; (PRUDR) whereby each of the 56 available companies would take it in turns to operate anywhere in the province, although in practice this normally meant in South Armagh.

==Women&#x27;s UDR (Greenfinches)==

In the early days of the regiment female members of the Royal Military Police accompanied patrols when available to enable female suspects to be searched. There were never enough of these RMP searchers so in 1973 an act was passed in Parliament to recruit women into the regiment. On 16 August 1973 a regular army officer from the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps, Major Eileen Tye, took up the post of &quot;Commander Women&quot; at HQUDR. By September 352 women had been enrolled and the first enlistments were carried out at 2 UDR&#x27;s HQ in Armagh on the 16th. This use of women as an integrated part of the regiment preceded similar usage in the regular army by 20 years, and paved the way for the disbandment of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps in 1992.

The only available clothing was mostly ATS surplus from WWII. Many women were unhappy with the semi-formal skirts and knee length boots they had to wear in all weathers. Eventually the regulations were relaxed and by the time of the merger women were wearing full combat uniform. The women soldiers also wore a silk cravat in their battalion colour.

A team of WRAC instructors led by WO2 Brooker was assigned to train the women in a one-week course consisting of drill, army organisation, map reading, searching of women and vehicles, radio procedure and basic first aid. Their assignment finished after one year when Greenfinches with the relevant experience were assigned to take over as instructors.

The first recruits were largely from the executive and professional classes. Some were wives of serving UDR soldiers and others were married to soldiers on long-term (accompanied) posting to Northern Ireland, including the wives of some commanding officers. Some soldiers (male and female) were inclined to settle in Northern Ireland after their time in the army was finished and for female ex-soldiers and the wives of male ex-soldiers being a Greenfinch seemed to be an attractive and familiar career.

The country and border battalions welcomed the use of women as essential in the searching of women and children but the city based battalions were slower to see the advantages and to some extent resented the presence of Greenfinches at first. In the short-term all came to appreciate the value of having females with patrols. Through time the role of women was expanded as it was realised that their higher pitched voices were more suited to radio transmission than men. Tasked to relieve RMP women at the Belfast city centre segment gates they learned how to accept abuse from the public and how to avoid traps that could be set for them while they searched other women; i.e., razor blades placed in pockets.

Some women were trained in the use of &quot;Sea Watch&quot; radar to assist seaborne patrols in those battalions with fast boats.

Initially a part-time female officer was appointed in each battalion to supervise the women soldiers but through time the women came under command of the Officer Commanding (OC) of the company they were assigned to. In later years some women became battalion adjutants or company commanders and a few were attached to brigade staffs throughout Northern Ireland.

Accommodation for changing and toilet facilities was another problem faced early on and it took several years for the all-male environments of UDR bases to adapt to suit female needs.

The name &quot;Greenfinch&quot; applied to the women&#x27;s UDR comes from the system of radio &quot;appointment titles&quot; (codewords) used by the army to identify certain people or branches of the service. Male soldiers in the regiment were identified as &quot;Greentop&quot; and women were given the codeword &quot;Greenfinch&quot; with female commanders being referred to as &quot;Goldfinch&quot;. This became their working nickname. It is still applied today to women in the Royal Irish Regiment.

The recruitment of women soldiers peaked in 1986 with 286 permanent cadre and 530 part timers but the establishment never dropped below 700 from 1978 onwards.

===Women&#x27;s operational role===
Greenfinches were used to deny terrorists the use of women and children in paramilitary activities. On patrol they were used to search for explosives, weapons, ammunition and documents, as well as driving patrol vehicles, operating radios and acting as interviewers. The use of females in barracks included clerical, catering and store-keeping duties in addition to staffing &quot;Operations Rooms&quot; and &quot;Intelligence Cells&quot;, released male soldiers for operational duties.

===Training===
Women soldiers were required to pass annual skills tests to qualify for grades and pay increments. If these tests were failed the Greenfinch concerned would be downgraded and suffer a drop in wages. They received regular &quot;role specific&quot; training which included: person and vehicle searching, map reading, first aid, signals, personal security and terrorist recognition; as well as regimental history, military etiquette, rank structure and dress regulations, and also fitness training. They were advised to maintain a high degree of fitness.

Although not armed on duty Greenfinches were trained to fire a full range of weapons and taught how to make a weapon &quot;safe&quot; as part of the training on dealing with casualties. HQUDR ran a .22 shooting competition.

Some Greenfinches were issued with (or purchased) personal protection weapons (PPW&#x27;s) if considered to be at high risk.

===Pregnancy, marriage and pay===
Issues which affected other servicewomen also applied to Greenfinches. Rules regarding pregnancy, marriage, and pay. To join, married women were required to submit written permission from their husbands and those with children were obliged to sign a declaration confirming childcare arrangements.

Ministry of Defence regulations concerning women soldiers meant that Greenfinches would be discharged in the fourth month of pregnancy. If they returned to their unit after maternity leave they were required to retake the basic recruits course. Their previous service did not count towards medal entitlement or promotion. Some sympathetic battalion commanders avoided putting female soldiers through this by sending them on extended, long term leave but keeping them &quot;on strength&quot;.

The European Court ruled against the Ministry of Defence in 1990 and awarded compensation to 78 former Greenfinches totaling £370,000. Regulations then changed and all British servicewomen were subsequently allowed 48 weeks unpaid maternity leave, following which they could return to duty without preconditions.

A study in 1988 showed that half the women serving were married and 42% were mothers, with two thirds of their children being infants or of school age.

===Women casualties===
Four Greenfinches were killed as active servicewomen between 1974 and 1992. The first was Private Eva Martin, age 28, fatally wounded by rocket fragments on 3 May 1974 during a PIRA attack on 6 UDR&#x27;s outlying base at the Deanery, Clogher. She was also the first female from the security forces to die in the Troubles.

==Opposition forces==
During the concept stage of the UDR the major armed threat to the state was the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Following a split in this organisation the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) was formed in December 1969, just days before recruiting was to begin for the regiment.

PIRA became and remained the priority for the UDR, although threats to life and property also existed from other organisations. The Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) (the remnants of the &quot;old IRA&quot;) continued to commit acts of violence as did the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), another offshoot from the &quot;old IRA&quot;. Threats to the public peace also came from loyalist organisations such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) which used the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Ulster Freedom Fighters when killing, and a selection of other groupings who emerged during the Troubles. As the PIRA campaign continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it and other groups increasingly targeted Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers as well as others from the forces of law and order.&quot;

Methods of attack included sniping, bombs and other tactics used by guerrilla armies when facing an enemy with superior forces. There were however open actions between the regiment and the IRA, which varied in style and tactics between the urban setting of Belfast and rural areas.

There were few conventional attacks, but notably, on 2 May 1974, up to forty IRA men attacked the isolated 6 UDR Deanery base at Clogher, County Tyrone. A sustained assault lasted for around twenty minutes, during which it was hit by rockets, mortars, and small-arms fire. F/Private Eva Martin was fatally wounded during this attack, the first female UDR soldier to be killed by enemy action.

The IRA developed home-made mortars referred to as &quot;barrack-busters&quot;. Normally fixed to the back of a commercial vehicle such as a builder&#x27;s lorry, the vehicle would be parked in position near a barracks and the devices fired by timing device or remote controlled sending missiles made from gas cylinders into the barracks compound. The largest of these was 12 tubes fired at 3 UDR&#x27;s Kilkeel base &quot;The Abbey&quot; in 1992. Bases were also attacked in other ways such as the truck bomb which destroyed 2 UDR&#x27;s Glenanne Barracks killing three soldiers and wounding many more.

Some mortars could also be fired horizontally. The first recorded use of this weapon was against a mobile patrol from 2 UDR on 1 March 1991. Two soldiers died. The funeral of one, Private Paul Sutcliffe, an Englishman, was held in Barrowford, Lancashire – the only UDR funeral to be held outside Northern Ireland. The second casualty, Private Roger Love, from Portadown died after three days.

On 8 November 1987 the Provisional IRA bombed the cenotaph at Enniskillen in what became known as the Remembrance Day bombing. 200 UDR soldiers were about to march onto the square beside the memorial when the bomb exploded.

Because the UDR did not live in barracks like other soldiers but lived at home (in many cases with families), they were vulnerable to attack when off-duty. A number of soldiers were issued with personal weapons. Some of these were stolen from soldiers homes. Part-time soldiers were most at risk as they had day jobs which often took them to unsafe areas. Most UDR soldiers killed in the Troubles were attacked off-duty.

Forty-seven former soldiers were killed after leaving the UDR. Others, especially in the Fermanagh border area, were forced to move to safer areas, had to sell their homes and, sometimes, their land as a result of imminent threat.

In February 2010 &quot;about a dozen&quot; former UDR soldiers in Mid-Ulster were warned by the PSNI that they were under threat from dissident Republicans.

==Casualties==
Between 1 April 1970 and 30 June 1992, a total of 197 soldiers were killed as active servicemen. Another 61 were killed after they had left the UDR. Three members of the UVF and one UDA member killed during the conflict were also soldiers of the regiment at the time of their deaths.

Two UDR soldiers were killed by the regular army, three by loyalist paramilitaries, and the remaining 192 by republican paramilitaries (mainly the Provisional IRA). 22 died &quot;by their own hand&quot; and 220 died of natural causes, mostly heart attack. Four Greenfinches were killed during the Troubles, Private Eva Martin, L/Cpl Jean Leggett, Cpl Heather Kerrigan and Pte Margaret A. Hearst.

During this time soldiers of the UDR were responsible for the killing of six civilians and two members of the IRA.

The first UDR soldier to be killed was Private Winston Donnell, aged 22, from the Strabane Company of 6 UDR, who was Killed in action on 9 August 1971 at a vehicle checkpoint (as part of the internment call-out) close to the Clady Bridge border crossing.

The first serving Catholic to be killed was 32-year-old part-time Private Sean Russell of 7 UDR, who was shot dead on 8 December 1971, in front of his wife and children, by members of the Irish Republican Army who burst into his home in the predominantly Catholic area of New Barnsley, Belfast. The last was part-time Private William Megrath of 11 UDR who was shot dead in July 1987 as he drove through the Twinbrook area of west Belfast on his way home from his civilian job.

The last UDR soldier to be killed was L/Cpl Ken Newell of 4/6 UDR who was kidnapped and shot on 26 November 1991 in South Armagh. Another soldier kidnapped with him was set free near Crossmaglen not far from where Cpl Newell&#x27;s body was found.

Attacks did not stop after amalgamation. Six soldiers who had served with the UDR were killed on active duty with the Royal Irish Regiment (Home Service Battalions).

==Paramilitary infiltration of the UDR==
Members of extremist groupings managed to join the UDR despite the vetting process. Their purpose in doing so was to obtain weapons, training and intelligence. Several stolen weapons were used in the commission of sectarian killings, attempted killings and robberies.

Vetting procedures were carried out jointly by Army Intelligence and the RUC&#x27;s Special Branch and if no intelligence was found to suggest unsuitability individuals were passed for recruitment and would remain as soldiers until the commanding officer was provided with intelligence enabling him to remove soldiers with paramilitary links or sympathies.

===Loyalist infiltration===
When the regiment was formed, the UDA did not yet exist; it would not be established until September 1971. Dual membership was initially acceptable to the military authorities as the UDA was not seen as a threat to the state. This changed when on 29 November 1972, the GOCNI, on instructions from Westminster, announced that dual membership of UDR and paramilitary organisations would not be tolerated and began a purge which saw 171 soldiers with links to the UDA discharged by the end of 1975. Lt Col Dion Beard (1RTR) commander of 3 UDR issued a battalion order:

A similar statement was issued by the commanding officer of 11 UDR when Ian Paisley&#x27;s Third Force was established in 1981. The media reported that he had issued a battalion order to the effect that any soldier who became involved in the Third Force would be dismissed.

During the regiment&#x27;s 22-year history, loyalist raids were mounted against 3 UDR, 5 UDR, 7 UDR, 10 UDR, and 11 UDR. Subsequent to a raid against 11 UDR&#x27;s C company, Lurgan on 20 October 1972, the guard commander, Sgt. Billy Hanna MM, was convicted of supplying arms and information to loyalist paramilitaries. Most were recovered in follow up operations, but some were later proven to have been used by loyalist organisations to carry out crimes, including murders. Most stolen weapons were taken by loyalist organisations, but a number of soldiers were killed by members of the IRA who attacked their homes to steal rifles. By the end of 1972, according to a Ministry of Defence in a parliamentary answer, 193 UDR weapons had been stolen, 130 in raids on armouries or points of duty. Only 76 stolen weapons had been recovered at that point. An August 1973 draft document prepared by British military intelligence asserted that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of UDR weapons stolen up to that point were in the possession of loyalist paramilitaries.

An article on the newly established regiment published in &quot;Fortnight&quot; magazine in October 1972 noted several court cases involving UDR soldiers in the preceding weeks. On 18 September a member of the UDR, William Wright, of Portadown, was granted bail after appearing on an arms charge at Hillsborough. Wright reportedly shouted &quot;no surrender&quot; as he left the court with two other men who had been similarly charged. The following day a former member of the UDR, John Haveron, was remanded in a Belfast court after being charged with the attempted murder of three men outside the Imperial Hotel on 17 September. On 23 September an instructor in the UDR, Peter Wally, was cleared of a murder charge but later received 18 months imprisonment on a charge of wounding with intent in relation to an incident at a taxi depot on 1 June. On 28 September two members of the UDR were charged with assault and possession of arms. Neither Private Robert Lawrence nor Private Reginald Jamieson were prosecuted. A day later another UDR member, Alexander Thompson, appeared before the same court on a charge of possession of arms and ammunition. The author warned that the regiment was being increasingly perceived as an organisation similar to its “B-Specials” predecessor and it would “only take a few more charges similar to the ones outlined above to discredit the UDR completely”.

In June 1973 loyalists bombed a pub in Crossgar, County Down, injuring a young Catholic woman. Three men were later convicted and sentenced to nine years imprisonment; two of them were serving UDR soldiers.

In May 1974 a Catholic couple, James and Gertrude Devlin, were shot dead outside their home near Donaghmore, County Tyrone. The UVF claimed responsibility and a UDR soldier was later sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders. The couple&#x27;s daughter, who was also shot and injured in the attack, recalled a man in military uniform stopping their car before it was riddled with automatic gunfire. The Devlins were a prominent Catholic family in the area; James was involved in the Tyrone county football team and Gertrude was a popular librarian. Both were also active in the SDLP. The UDR soldier later convicted for the killings, William Leonard, was further convicted of a series of bombings targeting Catholics in the Dungannon area. A former UDR solder was also convicted. At a later trial Leonard was also convicted of holding up a bus from the Republic of Ireland, robbing a passenger, then dousing the bus in petrol and setting it alight. 

In November 1974 Catholic man Kevin Regan died five days after being shot during a UVF gun attack on Maguire&#x27;s Bar in Larne, County Antrim. A serving UDR soldier was later sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.

In February 1975 Catholic woman Colette Brown, a mother of four, was shot dead by Loyalists in Larne, County Antrim. No specific group claimed responsibility. UDR Lance-Corporal Jack McAuley was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.

Two soldiers from the 11 UDR&#x27;s C Company (also UVF members) were convicted of the 1975 killing of three musicians from The Miami Showband. This attack was led by Robin Jackson, a former UDR soldier who had been discharged for &quot;undisclosed reasons&quot;. Two soldiers from 11 UDR&#x27;s E Company, Portadown (also UVF members), died in the premature explosion of their own bomb.

The Miami Showband killings were carried out by the Glenanne gang; a secret informal Loyalist alliance that included members of the UDR, RUC, and UVF. According to &quot;Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland&quot;, by Anne Cadwallader, permutations of the group killed about 120 people – almost all of whom were Catholic civilians with no links to Irish republican paramilitaries. The Cassel Report investigated 76 killings attributed to the group and found evidence that UDR soldiers and RUC officers were involved in 74 of those. Another key figure was Robert McConnell, a serving corporal in 2 UDR. The report by Justice Henry Barron into the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 33 people lists him as a suspect; UDR Captain John Irwin was identified by John Weir in his affidavit as providing the explosives for the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Former Glenanne Gang members named him as being involved in numerous other attacks, including the Reavey and O&#x27;Dowd killings. Several other UDR soldiers participated in terrorist attacks attributed to the Glenanne Gang.

In October 1975 a UDR soldier from Islandmagee, County Antrim, William Workman, was accused in court of being an active member of the UVF who had for two years instructed UVF members in the usage of firearms. In an alleged police statement Workman had admitted to being a member of the UVF.

In June 1976 a full-time UDR soldier, Richard Long, based at Carryduff, County Down, shot and killed a Protestant man, David Spratt when he fired several shots into the home of a Catholic man at Comber, County Down. Spratt was the brother-in-law of his intended victim. Long was later sentenced to life imprisonment, having resigned from the UDR as soon as he was arrested and charged.

In October 1976 UDR soldier Samuel Farrell from County Fermanagh was charged in the Special Criminal Court in Dublin with conspiracy and causing an explosion in relation to a loyalist car bomb attack at Pettigo, County Donegal, in September 1973. Farrell admitted to acting as getaway driver on the night of the bombing.

In 1977, the Army investigated D and G companies of 10 UDR based at Girdwood Barracks, Belfast. The investigation concluded that 70 soldiers had &quot;links&quot; to the UVF. Following this two were dismissed on security grounds. 30 NCOs from D Company were suspected of fraudulently &quot;siphoning off&quot; between £30,000 – £47,000. A large percentage of this was suspected of going to the UVF. It was also alleged that UVF members socialized with soldiers in their mess. The investigation was halted after a senior UDR officer claimed it was harming morale. Details of the investigation were discovered in 2011.

In 1979 Benjamin Redfern was convicted of three sectarian murders in County Londonderry; Catholic farmer Liam Chivers near Ballymoney on 21 November 1972 and another Catholic man Joseph McAuley the following night, and John Bolton in October 1975. Redfern was crushed to death in a refuse lorry while trying to escape the Maze prison in August 1984. The killings were the work of a UDA cell of which several participants were also serving UDR soldiers. One member, Robert Davis, who had been a full-time member of 5 UDR, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 71-year-old Samuel Millar. In January 1976, Davis and another UDR soldier, Ronald Nelson, went to Millar&#x27;s Londonderry farm to persuade him not to give evidence against them in a case arising from the earlier armed robbery of £1,400 from a post office. When the elderly man refused to relent, Davis took an iron shaft from his car, used for killing foxes, and struck him on the head several times. Then he reversed his car over him, threw the body in the boot and buried it on the shore of Lough Neagh. However, a witness saw the burial and contacted the RUC&#x27;s confidential telephone line. During the ensuing search by security forces Davis and another UDR soldier, both in uniform, exhumed Millar&#x27;s body and travelled with the body propped up between them in the front of a military Land Rover and were waved through at least one checkpoint before weighting the body with a concrete post and dumping it in a flooded quarry. Ronald Nelson was jailed for ten years for his role in the armed robbery of 220 assorted weapons. including 148 L1A1 self-loading rifles, 35 Sterling SMGs and an L7A2 general purpose machine-gun, as well as 9,500 rounds of ammunition, eight grenades and a rocket from the armoury at the UDR base at Magherafelt in June 1975. The twelve-strong group of raiders transported the stolen weapons in two UDR vehicles. The RUC believed that the weapons, which were discovered at a farm, were discretely surrendered to redirect attention from the local UDA group which counted several of the local UDR soldiers among its members. Nelson was also convicted, with others, for his part in additional sectarian crimes including possessing firearms, car theft, armed robbery, arson and a petrol bomb attack on as Catholic-owned draper&#x27;s shop which caused £162,000 worth of damage. The gang was also linked to the death of a man in a premature explosion on a farm in County Londonderry in the early 1970s.

In November 1979 full-time UDR soldier James Gordon Murdock was refused bail on charges of membership of the UVF. Police believed Murdock was &quot;deeply involved&quot; in the organisation and if he was released on bail he would regroup remnants of the Markethill-based UVF unit.

In June 1980 the UDA shot dead Irish nationalist politician John Turnley in Carnlough, County Antrim. A Protestant who came from a unionist background, Turnley had been a member of the SDLP before helping to found the Irish Independence Party, which he later served as chairman. Three men were later convicted of his murder and that of Catholic man Rodney McCormick in Larne in August 1980. In 2016 it emerged that one of the three had been a member of the UDR.

In November 1980 UDR Private David Jameson was charged with loaning his legally-held pistol to the UVF and also robbery and hijacking. Jameson was seriously injured in an IRA bomb attack in April 1991. Jameson&#x27;s brother, Richard Jameson, was a senior member of the UVF who was killed in a Loyalist feud in January 2000.

In August 1981 a Catholic student, Liam Canning (19) was shot dead while walking along Alliance Avenue in the Ardoyne area of Belfast. The killing was initially claimed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), the UDA&#x27;s cover name, but UDR soldier Brian Roberts was later convicted. Roberts had used his UDR-issue Walther pistol. Roberts was also convicted of shooting and wounding two Catholic men in July 1981.

During 1982 and 1983 a UVF cell operated from a base operated by 9 UDR in Ballymena, County Antrim. Security was so lax a local UVF commander had access to a bar inside the base for several months even though he had &quot;known terrorist connections&quot; and a firearms conviction. Seven serving UDR soldiers of the Ballymena platoon were convicted of a range of terrorist offences in 1987, including involvement in the murder of a Catholic man by &quot;Shankill Butcher&quot; Lennie Murphy in September 1982. The rest of the platoon claimed they never suspected any paramilitary infiltration despite them being on duty together regularly. A BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary broadcast in 1990 alleged that an officer in the regiment said after the arrests &quot;Ulster will one day be grateful to these men&quot;. The Panorama investigative team confirmed the remark with the soldier to whom it was made; the soldier was so appalled he reported the officer to his superiors but no action was taken. The officer was still serving in the UDR at the time the documentary was broadcast.

In December 1983 serving UDR soldier Private Geoffrey Edwards was charged with the murder of Sinn Féin election worker Peter Corrigan in Armagh in October 1982 and six other attempted murders. In all, he admitted nineteen terrorist offences, although he refused to name his UVF accomplices. In 1985 Edwards was sentenced to life in prison, with six concurrent twenty-year sentences for attempted murder.

In 1984 an arms haul of twenty-eight firearms that included several rifles, revolvers, and home-made submachineguns as well as 5,000 rounds of ammunition was uncovered on the County Antrim farm of a serving UDR soldier. In court it was alleged he was hiding the weaponry on behalf of a member of Ian Paisley&#x27;s Third Force paramilitary group who had also been a member of the UDA and Tara. Both men pleaded guilty to arms charges in 1987.

In April 1985, the UFF/UDA claimed responsibility for shooting Catholic man Edward Love in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. A serving UDR soldier and member of the regular British Army were later found guilty of murder and both men served thirteen years in prison before being released under the Belfast Agreement.

In August 1986 the IRA shot dead a UDR sergeant, Denis Taggart, in the Shankill area of Belfast. According to loyalist sources Taggart was a member of the UVF as was his brother, Michael Taggart. Michael was a taxi driver employed by a taxi firm owned by another UVF member, Jacki Mahood. The Taggart brothers&#x27; father, also a UDR soldier, worked for the UVF-linked firm as did two other men later described in court despositions as being linked to the UDR. Michael Taggart and UDA member Jackie Courtney used the taxi service to facilitate the theft of intelligence documents on republican suspects from Girdwood Barracks in North Belfast by a UDR soldier, Joanne Garvin. The files were leaked by a member of the British Army&#x27;s Royal Scots, Corporal Cameron Hastie. The stolen documents were used to plan the killing of Catholic man Terence McDaid in 1988. Hastie and Garvin were both later arrested, charged, and convicted in 1989, serving short prison sentences. Garvin was expelled from the UDR while Hastie was permitted to rejoin the British Army and achieved the rank of major. 

In October 1986, four Catholic families, living in a housing estate in Ballymena, County Antrim, received threatening letters from the UDA, containing bullets, giving them a week to leave their homes. Three of the families fled the estate. The bullets had been supplied by a serving UDR soldier who was later imprisoned for two years.

In May 1987 loyalist paramilitaries murdered a Catholic charity worker, Dermot Hackett, near Drumquin, County Tyrone. Hackett had been subject to routine harassment and intimidation from members of the RUC and UDR following the killing of a UDR soldier in County Tyrone earlier that year. Hackett&#x27;s killing was a joint enterprise between the UDA and Ulster Resistance; according to author Martin Dillon &quot;there can be little doubt&quot; that UDR soldiers had provided the intelligence for the attack. The Ulster Resistance-UDA plan was solidified after the IRA shot dead Charles Watson, a former UDR soldier and loyalist tied to Ulster Resistance and the UVF. Another revenge attack took place the next day when an RUC officer fired several shots into a restaurant in Castlewellan, County Down, with a Third Force armband on his person.

In January 1988 Loyalist paramilitaries shot dead Catholic businessman Jack Kielty (father of comedian Patrick Kielty) in Dundrum, County Down. A serving UDR soldier was suspected of involvement in the killing yet continued to serve in the Army, even after a RUC investigating officer requested that he be discharged. Although he was eventually discharged a Police Ombudsman report released in 2016 revealed the suspect continued to attend RUC/UDR briefings despite being questioned by police in connection with the murder of Jack Kielty. The RUC also uncovered British army maps and a UDR photograph album containing montages of IRA suspects; fingerprints belonging to the soldier were later found to be on the recovered montage. An investigating officer said it became apparent at the time that the UDR soldier was the driver during an earlier attempt to murder another man, John O&#x27;Rourke, at Dundrum in January 1986. He was also arrested by police investigating the Loughinisland massacre in August 1994 and he was later identified in an anonymous message on the police confidential telephone line as one of the gunmen at Loughinisland. Solicitor Niall Murphy, who represented the families of the Loughinisland victims commented that &quot;at least three individuals and their families directly associated with the UVF unit in south Down were members of the UDR and also had close family members working locally at RUC establishments and within the police force itself.&quot;

In November 1988 firearms, 5,500 rounds of ammunition, hand grenades, and bomb-making material were discovered at the home of a former UDR soldier in Armagh. The arms find was linked to the loyalist paramilitary group Ulster Resistance. Another arms cache including an RPG-7 launcher with warheads, assault rifles, hand grenades, and 4,900 rounds of ammunition, also linked to Ulster Resistance, was found at the home of a UDR soldier in Richill, County Armagh.

In February 1989 solicitor Pat Finucane was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries from the UDA acting in collusion with elements of the British security forces. The 9mm Browning handgun used in the murder of Finucane had been stolen from a UDR armoury at Malone Barracks, Belfast by a serving UDR soldier. The same weapon had been linked to the attempted killing of a Catholic man in September 1988. Several other weapons were taken from the same armoury.

In August 1989 the UDA claimed responsibility for the murder of Catholic man Loughlin Maginn in County Down; it later emerged two of the UDA gunmen had also been serving UDR soldiers. When Maginn&#x27;s family denied he was a member of the IRA, the UDA attempted to justify the murder by releasing a 20-minute video, shot by soldiers from the UDR, which showed the wall of a police briefing room covered with photographs of IRA suspects. This incident prompted the Stevens Inquiries concerning alleged security forces collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Twenty-eight UDR soldiers were arrested as part of the investigation. Twenty-six belonged to the same company of 7/10 UDR. Six were later awarded damages. One was charged with activities linked to loyalist paramilitaries. The Stephens team caused &quot;intense anger&quot; as three hundred police had been used to surround the homes of suspects. This had identified them as UDR soldiers to their neighbours, potentially putting their lives at risk. Eleven moved house as a result, while the homes of 18 others were provided with &quot;additional security measures&quot; at a cost of £25,000.

In 1991 a former UDR soldier, Gordon David Stewart, from Portrush, County Antrim, was charged with possessing information likely to be useful to terrorists. Police found seven sheets of paper with hundreds of names and addresses and also newspaper cuttings, in relation to persons of interest to the security forces. Stewart claimed that four of the sheets he had found hidden by a river while on UDR patrol the previous year and failed to inform any of his superior officers, while the rest were information he had copied from UDR intelligence. Stewart had served four years in the regular British Army and four in the UDR. Police suspected he was an associate of UDA members or possibly a member of the UDA.

In December 1991, three serving UDR soldiers and a close associate were arrested and questioned for several days about the murder of four men in a gun attack by the UVF in Cappagh, County Tyrone in March 1991 before being released without charge. The RUC and British Army examination of intelligence relating to several murders and attempted murders between 1988 and 1991 &quot;highlighted concerns in relation to several members&quot; of 8 UDR based in County Tyrone. A Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report released by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) claimed the UDR men &quot;were also named as responsible for other murders&quot;. Minutes of a 2012 meeting between HET officials, Cappagh families and representatives of campaign group Relatives for Justice recorded that the HET believed there were &quot;probably four or five cases where UDR soldiers are linked to killings&quot;.

Other members of the UDR were also questioned about the murder of Sinn Féin member Tommy Casey near Cookstown in October 1990, before being released without charge. An intelligence report indicated the murder was carried out by south Tyrone UVF and that three men named as being involved were UDR soldiers. The suspects were arrested along with two others, also in December 1991.

In October 1992 a former UDR soldier, Rodney Davis, was alleged in court to have admitted copying names, address, and car number plates of republican suspects in south Down from his official UDR notebook and passing them to the UVF.

In 1999, David Jordan, a former UDR soldier, allegedly broke down in a bar and admitted to being part of a patrol that killed nationalist Councillor Patsy Kelly in 1974.

In January 2022, the Police Ombudsman published a report examining the RUC&#x27;s handling of paramilitary attacks by the UDA/UFF between 1989 and 1993 in the north west of Northern Ireland which included 19 murders and multiple attempted murders. The report summarised that a &quot;significant number of serving and former UDR members had links with loyalist paramilitaries&quot; in the region and this included senior figures within the North West UDA/UFF. This overlap in membership gave loyalist paramilitaries access to weapons, training, intelligence, and uniforms which &quot;added to their effectiveness in carrying out sectarian attacks.&quot; A leaked British military document that was posted to a local newspaper in 1992, claimed to have been sent by the UVF, contained the details of a number of republicans and also had the names of 28 UDR members named as being linked to loyalist paramilitaries. The Ombudsman&#x27;s report was of the opinion that the RUC was not proactive enough in pursuing serving UDR members who were also actively involved in loyalist paramilitary violence; in one example two UDR soldiers linked to loyalist paramilitaries attended several security force briefings where they had access to sensitive information. The report found &quot;no indications&quot; that police investigated one of the soldiers links to the UDA/UFF despite RUC Special Branch&#x27;s assessment that he had provided the intelligence for a murder in 1989. The other serving UDR soldier attended security force briefings at the same time as police were in possession of intelligence identifying him as having links to loyalist paramilitaries.

===Republican infiltration===
On 5 December 1972 William Bogle of 6 UDR was ambushed and killed at Killeter near the Tyrone/Donegal border. It was alleged that he was targeted by a former member of his own company &quot;possessed of strong republican views&quot; who moved across the border after the killing and is not known to have returned to Northern Ireland.

===Measures against infiltration===
* The Bray reforms
Brigadier Michael Bray adopted a zero-tolerance policy for any activity related to loyalism from the beginning of his tenure as Commander UDR. He instituted a number of safeguards including monitoring of entire battalions and six-month security reviews of all UDR personnel. An out of bounds list was compiled which included pubs and clubs known to be frequented by loyalist paramilitaries. Soldiers were cautioned as to whom they should socialise with. This was a concerted effort to remove anyone with dual membership from the regiment and to prevent peer pressure being applied.
* The Stevens Enquiry
The Stevens Report resulted in a tightening of control on even the most low-rated intelligence documents and heightened accountability. For the first time the RUC were given access to UDR vetting procedures and many soldiers found themselves under police observation for extended periods of time, in some cases resulting in their discharge. Stevens agreed there had been collusion between a small number of UDR soldiers who had &quot;gravely abused their positions of trust&quot; but that the issue was not &quot;widespread or institutionalised&quot;.

===The 1973 &quot;Subversion in the UDR&quot; report===
A draft document, entitled &quot;Subversion in the UDR&quot;, was amongst many released in 2005 and discovered in the Public Record Office. Some content appeared in &quot;The Irish News&quot; on 2 and 3 May 2006. Believed to have been prepared by British military intelligence in August 1973, it examines the issue of overlapping membership between the UDR and subversive organisations in the first three years of recruiting. &quot;Subversion&quot; was considered to be a &quot;strong support for, or membership of, organisations whose aims are incompatible with those of the UDR&quot; and attempts by soldiers to use their &quot;knowledge, skills, or equipment to further the aims of such organisations.&quot; It speculated that &quot;perhaps&quot; 5–15% of UDR soldiers were, or had been, full members of &quot;Protestant extremist groups&quot;. That the &quot;best single source of weapons, and the only significant source of modern weapons, for these groups was the UDR&quot; and that the British government knew UDR weapons were being used by loyalist paramilitaries, including the killing of a Catholic civilian and other attacks. The report admitted that there existed scarce intelligence on the full extent of infiltration of the UDR by loyalist paramilitaries:

The report illustrated how over 200 UDR weapons were lost or stolen by the end of 1972, although the rate of loss had decreased to 56 by 1973 when the report was written. This was suggested to be partially due to increased security and also that &quot;the reduced credibility of Protestant extremist groups in the eyes of the majority community, has made the subversion of UDR members more difficult.&quot; During 1973 the most successful loyalist extremist arms raids took place at the Department of Industrial and Forensic Science, and at firearms dealers in Belfast, Newtownards and Armagh, rather than on UDR locations. The report suggested there was no substantial threat of subversion from republican extremists in the regiment as the number of Catholics had decreased to under 4%. There were isolated incidents where Catholic UDR soldiers &#x27;lost&#x27; weapons in suspicious circumstances, but &quot;neither the number of weapons nor the threat is thought to be great&quot;.

The report concluded that except in limited circumstances subversion in the UDR has not compromised its ability to carry out its duties. This was caveated with the caution that there were &quot;predictable political circumstances&quot; in which the UDR might not only experience a much &quot;higher level&quot; of subversion than at the time of the report, but in which &quot;elements&quot; of the UDR might &quot;cease to be reliable.&quot; One such scenario considered was after the failure of political initiatives, unionist politicians might attempt to declare a unilateral declaration of independence for Northern Ireland to return power to the unionist community.

===Criminal convictions===
18 UDR soldiers were convicted of murder and 11 for manslaughter. Between 1970 and 1985, 99 were convicted of assault, whilst others were convicted of armed robbery, weapons offences, bombing, intimidation and attacks on Catholics, kidnapping, and membership of the UVF. Only a small proportion of the 40,000 individuals who served with the regiment were convicted of criminal activities, but the proportion was higher than for the regular British Army or RUC.

==Political controversy==

The Ulster Defence Regiment commanded uncritically fierce support from most Protestants in Northern Ireland but never gained the confidence of the Roman Catholic minority. This can partially be explained by the failure to attract and retain Catholics, and partially by the sectarian culture and character of the regiment, which became explicit following the introduction of internment without trial of suspected Irish Republicans after 1971.

Initially, the Nationalist political parties at Stormont encouraged Catholics to join. The first notable change to this was caused by the Parliament of Northern Ireland&#x27;s decision to introduce internment. None of those initially interned were Protestant, which led Catholics to understand that this was a measure directed entirely against their community. For the UDR it meant an increase in Republican propaganda against the regiment. After the introduction of internment, Catholic support for the regiment plummeted and the few Catholic soldiers that remained faced intimidation from their own communities.

Incidents where British troops killed Catholic civilians, such as the Ballymurphy and Bloody Sunday massacres (which occurred in August 1971 and January 1972 respectively) also served to convince Catholics that the UDR was a sectarian force. In 1971, 25% of the UDR&#x27;s Catholic soldiers chose to be discharged from the regiment. During 1972, another 108 Catholic soldiers chose to be discharged.

The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP)&#x27;s Ivan Cooper said in a 1972 statement that the regiment &quot;should be disbanded&quot;. The Alliance Party&#x27;s chairman Oliver Napier expressed concern about &quot;undesirables&quot; in the regiment in a statement in November 1972.

The SDLP called for full disbandment of the regiment as early as 1974 through the media and by applying pressure through the Irish government and became the major conduit for complaints against the UDR from Catholics. The SDLP remained opposed to the regiment and continually called for its disbandment &quot;due to the failure of the GOC to address the issue of Catholic recruiting and the regimental image&quot;. Although no official support was evident from the party leaderships various members (for example Seamus Mallon), condemned the killing of UDR soldiers and attended funerals, such as in the case of James Cochrane, a Catholic soldier from 3 UDR in Downpatrick who was killed in a culvert bomb attack on 6 January 1980.

After the Hillsborough Agreement the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) began a campaign with the apparent motive of reducing morale in the regiment and causing mass resignations by undermining the confidence of soldiers in their officers. During this period Ian Paisley announced to the press that soldiers in Ballymena had been requested to report to barracks to be disarmed prior to the part-time cadre being disbanded. The DUP press office claimed that the use of English officers and senior NCOs was &quot;London and Dublin insisting the UDR could not be trusted&quot;. and Peter Robinson, the deputy DUP Leader, advised soldiers not to co-operate with policemen who were attached to their patrols as they were there on the directions of the Anglo-Irish Council.

A military assessment in 1981 had concluded there was no long-term requirement for the UDR except for possibly a role in home defence. Any British government doubts about the future viability of the regiment were kept secret for fear of provoking a Unionist backlash and prompting the formation of new Unionist paramilitary groups. Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis interviewed for a BBC Panorama documentary in 1990 opined that disbanding the UDR would lead an increase in Loyalist paramilitary activity and the setting up of other paramilitary organisations.

The UDR&#x27;s sectarian image received corroboration from an unlikely source in February 1985 when Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux privately informed a Northern Ireland Office official of his &quot;concern about the way in which some UDR patrols abused their position in relation to members of the Catholic community&quot;.

The weekly republican newspaper An Phoblacht carried reports highlighting what it saw as naked state oppression. In its editorials An Phoblacht referred to the UDR as, &quot;not Dad&#x27;s Army but a sectarian militia&quot;. To help emphasise their message they produced posters which supporters pasted over walls in Republican areas such as &quot;The Loyalist Murderers&quot; and &quot;Blood Money,&quot; referring to the redundancy payments received by former UDR soldiers still serving with the Royal Irish Regiment at the end of Operation Banner (The official army title for operations in Northern Ireland). An Phoblacht claimed that the UDR had secret &quot;death squads&quot; sponsored by United Kingdom Special Forces and that members of the UDR (in collusion with British Intelligence) were behind the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

Journalist Ed Moloney, author of several books on The Troubles, described the UDR as a &quot;largely Protestant militia&quot;.

==Music==
Each battalion had a number of pipers who also participated in a centralised pipe band formally called the Pipes &amp; Drums of the Ulster Defence Regiment. Its uniform followed the traditional military dress for Irish pipers, consisting of a saffron kilt, bottle-green &quot;Prince Charlie&quot; jacket, bottle-green cape and bottle-green caubeen adorned with a double-size cap badge. Unlike other Irish regiments in the British Army, UDR pipers did not wear a hackle and the lining colour of the cloaks was unique to the regiment.

In June 1986, the regiment held its only tattoo which ran over a period of two days in good weather at Ravenhill rugby ground, Belfast. Some of the attractions for the 12,000 people who attended were:
* the Red Devils parachute team;
* Greenfinches abseiling from the top of one of the grandstands;
* UDR dogs;
* a mock ambush;
* Beating Retreat with the Pipes &amp; Drums of the UDR plus the bands of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Regiment and the RUC.

The crowd is reported to have created a &quot;deeply moving&quot; moment by humming the evening hymn &quot;The Day Thou Givest&quot;. At the end of the performance Brigadier Roger Preston and his wife were piped out of the arena on their way to retirement. Only one UDR Pipes &amp; Drums recording was publicly released: the 5 UDR Pipes &amp; Drums &quot;Irish &amp; Scottish Pipe Music&quot;, which includes recordings of the regimental and battalion marches as well as other songs.

==&quot;Options for Change&quot; and amalgamation==
After the fall of the Berlin Wall the United Kingdom began to reduce the size of its armed forced under the working title of Options for Change. Army strength was to be reduced from 160,000 to 110,000; the infantry to reduce from 55 battalions to 38. The GOC saw this as a perfect opportunity to streamline the UDR and also remove some of the more &quot;intractable problems&quot; with regards to image and career prospects. In a revolutionary plan he decided to merge the UDR with the Royal Irish Rangers; incorporating part-time soldiers into the regular army for the first time in history. The hope of the British Army&#x27;s commander was that the process of amalgamation with the Rangers, coupled with the change of name, would be a fresh start for what he says was a &quot;discredited UDR&quot;. The Rangers recruited from the South of Ireland, including many Catholics, and this would aid the process.

&quot;Project Infancy&quot; would also ensure that the Royal Irish Rangers, the last Irish infantry battalion of &quot;the line&quot; did not lose their training facilities and presence in Northern Ireland. The UDR, which was not regular line infantry was, in the words of one commander, &quot;like a fish without feathers&quot;. Incorporation as infantry of the line might provide UDR officers with career prospects which mirrored those of the regular army and hopefully resolve the problem of recruiting junior officers. To the GOC the prospect of having a larger number of Catholic officers and NCOs in the UDR would dampen much of the political furore surrounding the regiment. In a private memo to John MacGregor, Lord President of the Council in First Major ministry, then Defence Secretary Tom King emphasised that the merger was primarily motivated by the political controversy surrounding the UDR locally and in Anglo-Irish relations, and it was hoped the move would do away with the UDR&#x27;s &quot;sectarian stigma.&quot;

The plan was approved by early summer 1991 and proposed:
* The 2 battalions of the Royal Irish Rangers would amalgamate to create a single &quot;General Service&quot; battalion.
* The existing nine UDR battalions would be reduced to seven and designated &quot;Home Service&quot;.
* The part-time element would remain in the Home Service element but the new structure provided for general reduction when the time was right.
* The new regiment would be called the Royal Irish Regiment, reusing a name which had been lost on the disbandment of many famous Irish infantry regiments after partition in 1922.

In return the UDR would receive:
* A royal title.
* A direct line of succession through the regimental name to the Battle of the Boyne and other battles of the Williamite Wars.

The proposals were generally welcomed at senior level but there was predictable worry amongst the ranks that this was a precursor to disbandment. Unionist political parties protested, particularly the DUP who immediately relaunched their 1989 &quot;Hands Off the UDR&quot; campaign.

When it merged in 1992 the UDR had been on active service longer than any regiment since the Napoleonic Wars, having remained on operations from the day it was created to the day it was amalgamated.

==Awards, honours and decorations==
The most notable award to the Ulster Defence Regiment was the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross made by The Queen on 6 October 2006. The unit citation confers the right of the regiment to be known as &quot;The Ulster Defence Regiment CGC&quot;. During the award ceremony in Belfast the Queen paid tribute to the regiment:

:&quot;&quot;Your contribution to peace and stability in Northern Ireland is unique.&quot; &quot;Serving and living within the community had required &quot;uncommon courage and conviction&quot;. &quot;The regiment had never flinched despite suffering extreme personal intimidation. Their successes had &quot;come at a terrible price, many gave their lives. Today you have cause to reflect on the fine achievements, while remembering the suffering&quot;. &quot;The Home Service Battalions of the RIR and the UDR which had preceded them won the deepest respect throughout the land.&quot; So that their actions would always be remembered, the CGC was awarded to the RIR/UDR &quot;as a mark of the nation&#x27;s esteem&quot; with the citation, &quot;This award is in recognition of the continuous operational service and sacrifice of the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Regiment in Northern Ireland during Operation Banner.&quot;&quot;

In total 953 individuals received awards through the British honours system including: 12 Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medals; 2 Military Medals; 88 BEMs; 108 OBEs and 276 Mentions in Despatches, however for most UDR soldiers the presentation of decorations assumed the form of &quot;service&quot; or &quot;campaign&quot; medals including:
* The General Service Medal with &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; bar. (Awarded after 28 days service in the Operation Banner campaign)
* The Ulster Defence Regiment Medal
* Northern Ireland Home Service Medal
* The Accumulated Campaign Service Medal (Awarded after 1,000 operational (not training) days service in the campaign)
* The Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Ulster Defence Regiment)

The award of &quot;UDR specific&quot; long service medals had complex rules which meant that not very many were ever issued. The UDR medal was only issued to 1,254 of the 40,000 who served. Only 1,416 Accumulated Campaign Service medals were issued.

Officers who are awarded the Ulster Defence Regiment medal may use the post-nominal letters UD.

The most decorated UDR soldier was Corporal Eric Glass of 4 UDR who received both the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal and Distinguished Conduct Medal for bravery. Despite being gravely injured in an IRA ambush Glass managed to survive, killing one of his attackers, Joseph McManus in the process. An account of this (second) attack on Corporal Glass was carried in the Belfast News Letter.

In 1987, the regiment submitted a request for the issuing of colours to the Queen which was given consent. This was granted in 1991, when the Queen decided to present the colours herself: an honour which is normally reserved only for those regiments of which she is Colonel in Chief.
* 29 June 1991 – The first colours were presented by the Queen to five battalions at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn.
* November 1991 – 6 UDR was presented at St Lucia Barracks, Omagh by The Duke of Abercorn.
* April 1992 – The last colours were presented by The Duke of York in a ceremony near Edinburgh in April 1992, to 2/11 UDR, 7/10 UDR and 8UDR.

Up to May 2010, 232 Elizabeth Crosses and Memorial Scrolls have been issued to the families of UDR personnel whose deaths are officially attributed to their military service.

===Freedoms===
The City of Belfast and a number of boroughs throughout Northern Ireland paid their own tribute to the regiment by granting freedoms including: North Down, Larne, and Newtownards.

===Wilkinson Sword of Peace===
The community relations work of 7th/10th (City of Belfast) Battalion was recognised by the award of the Wilkinson Sword of Peace for 1990.

==UDR Memorials==

===The UDR Memorial, Lisburn===
A memorial to the UDR was erected in Lisburn, to &quot;recognise the self sacrifice of the soldiers, both men and women, from all traditions of the UK&quot;.
The Memorial is &quot;a 19-foot &#x27;heroic scale&#x27; bronze sculpture&quot; featuring &quot;bronze figures of a male UDR soldier and a female &#x27;Greenfinch&#x27; on operational duty...set upon an equally impressive Mourne granite plinth.&quot;.

Lisburn City Council leased the site to the UDR Memorial Trust at Market Square, Lisburn. Under the terms of the lease, the UDR Memorial Trust are permitted to use this for the erection of a memorial. The planning, erection and maintenance of the memorial is the responsibility of the UDR Memorial Trust.

The UDR Memorial is in addition to the UDR Roll of Honour situated beside Lisburn War Memorial, Castle Street, Lisburn that commemorates UDR personnel from the Lisburn area who died in the conflict.

The memorial group of statues was unveiled on 12 June 2011 by Viscount Brookeborough, one of the trustees of the UDR Memorial Trust. At the ceremony, Trust chairman Wesley Duncan said, &quot;It was unfortunate that there were members who did bad things and we&#x27;re not trying to hide that. But what we would say is that there&#x27;s almost 50,000 people who didn&#x27;t do bad things – who did good things, who were ordinary decent people who wanted to do the best they could for their country.&quot;

===National Arboretum===
On Saturday, 28 April 2012 a memorial to the UDR was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum by Colonel Sir Dennis Faulkner CBE (Patron of the Regimental Association) along with Memorial Trees in memory of those UDR Soldiers who were murdered after having left the Regiment. Memorial Trees in memory of all those who were killed while serving had already been planted some years ago. The memorial takes the form of a 6-foot Mourne granite monument. The event was attended by around 100 UDR families, joined by the Northern Ireland Minister of State, Hugo Swire, DUP Junior Minister Jonathan Bell and UUP deputy leader John McCallister. A parade to the monument was led by the band of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment.

<text>The Einstein–Szilard or Einstein refrigerator is an absorption refrigerator which has no moving parts, operates at constant pressure, and requires only a heat source to operate. It was jointly invented in 1926 by Albert Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd, who patented it in the U.S. on November 11, 1930 (). The three working fluids in this design are water, ammonia, and butane. The Einstein refrigerator is a development of the original three-fluid patent by the Swedish inventors Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters.

==History==
From 1926 until 1934 Einstein and Szilárd collaborated on ways to improve home refrigeration technology. The two were motivated by contemporary newspaper reports of a Berlin family who had been killed when a seal in their refrigerator failed and leaked toxic fumes into their home. Einstein and Szilárd proposed that a device without moving parts would eliminate the potential for seal failure, and explored practical applications for different refrigeration cycles. Einstein had worked in the Swiss Patent Office, and used his experience to apply for valid patents for their inventions in several countries. The two were eventually granted 45 patents in six countries for three different models.

It has been suggested that most of the actual inventing was done by Szilárd, with Einstein merely acting as a consultant and helping with the patent-related paperwork, but others assert that Einstein contributed design work to the project.

The refrigerator was less efficient than existing appliances, although having no moving parts made it more reliable; the introduction of Freon to replace refrigerant gases toxic to humans made it even less attractive commercially. The Great Depression of 1929 dried up funding for development, and the widespread political violence in Nazi Germany, where the inventors lived, particularly towards Jews such as Einstein and Szilard, contributed to the device&#x27;s lack of commercial success. (The inventors fled Germany in the early 1930s.) It was not immediately put into commercial production, although the most promising of the patents were quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux. Einstein and Szilárd earned $750 (the equivalent of $10,000 in 2017). A few demonstration units were constructed from other patents.

One variant, the Einstein–Szilard electromagnetic refrigerator used a Einstein–Szilard electromagnetic pump to compress a working gas, pentane. Although the refrigerator was not a commercial success, the Einstein–Szilard pump was later used for cooling breeder reactors, where its inherent reliability and safety were important.

In 2008, electrical engineers at Oxford University&#x27;s Energy and Power Group, part of the university&#x27;s Department of Engineering Science, revived the Einstein refrigerator as an attempt to produce a refrigerator suitable for use in rural areas without electricity. The group, led by Malcolm McCulloch noted that the design was still &quot;nowhere near commercialised&quot;, but might allow the efficiency of the original Einstein–Szilárd design to be quadrupled.

<text>Idheze Irri is one of the towns in the Isoko South Local Government area of Delta State, Nigeria.

The town has an estimated population of over 14,500 inhabitants. The area is surrounded by swampland.

The town has several oil wells that are run by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and Italy Eni Agip. The presence of crude oil pipelines across the region and frequent crude oil spills have been largely responsible for soil damage. This has led to large-scale frustrations with the oil companies, and has resulted in skirmishes and kidnappings for ransom in some neighboring communities. Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) responds by sponsoring projects such as clean water supply in Idheze Irri town.

On entering the town from the direction of Ozoro, a neighboring town, you will encounter a shrine and a river called Orobe.

<doc id="599950" wikidata="Q7995593" url="?curid=599950" title="White coal">
<text>White coal is a form of fuel produced by drying chopped wood over a fire. It differs from charcoal which is carbonised wood. White coal was used in England to melt lead ore from the mid-sixteenth to the late seventeenth centuries. It produces more heat than green wood but less than charcoal and thus prevents the lead evaporating. White coal could be used mixed with charcoal for other industrial uses than lead smelting. White coal was produced in distinctive circular pits with a channel, known as Q-pits. They are frequently found in the woods of South Yorkshire.

==Production==
Although traditionally made by drying chopped wood, white coal can be made from numerous waste products, most of which are formed into briquettes. Raw materials which can be used include:
* Groundnut shells
* Cotton hulls and stalks
* Castor seed shells
* Forest leaves; wood chips and shavings
* Sugarcane bagasse
* Rice husk and paddy straw
* Mustard waste
* Coir dust
* Coffee husk 
* Sunflower waste
* Maize stalks 
* Bajra (pearl millet) cobs
* Sesame seeds oil cake 
* Wheat straw

==Benefits==
Producers of white coal proclaim the following benefits from using the fuel:

* White coal is cheaper than coal and fire wood.
* There is no sulphur in the white coal, therefore no toxic gases.
* Moisture content is nil.
* Biomass briquettes have a higher practical thermal value.
* Briquettes have consistent quality, have high burning efficiency, and are ideally sized for complete combustion.
* Combustion is more uniform compared to coal and boiler response to changes in steam requirements is faster, due to higher quantity of volatile matter in briquettes.
* Low ash contents.
* The calorific value of the finished briquettes is approximately 3500 to 4000 kcal/kg.

India is fast becoming a major manufacturer and consumer of white coal. A large number of companies have switched their boiler fuels to use white coal instead of fossil fuels. White coal manufacturing capacity is increasing in the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.

The production of white coal (briquettes made of biomass) using agricultural and forest waste is more common in North India.

<text>In chocolate making, the Broma process is a method of extracting cocoa butter from roasted cocoa beans, credited to the chocolatier Domingo Ghirardelli. The Broma process involves hanging bags of chocolate liquor, made from roasted and ground cocoa beans, in a very warm room, above the melting point of cocoa butter (slightly above room temperature), and allowing the butter to drip off the bags, where it is collected. The Dutch process adds an extra processing step to the Broma process whereby, after the cocoa butter has been drained off, the beans are soaked in an alkaline solution to make them chemically neutral.

After removal, the cocoa butter can be used either to produce richer bars of chocolate, or, when combined with powdered milk and sugar, to create white chocolate. Once the Broma process is complete, the remaining dry cocoa beans are usually ground into cocoa powder, which is sold to consumers.

<doc id="599955" wikidata="Q4352603" url="?curid=599955" title="Gerry Brownlee">
<text>Gerard Anthony Brownlee (born 4 February 1956) is a New Zealand politician and the 32nd speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. He was first elected as a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives for Ilam in 1996, representing the National Party. He became a list MP in 2020.

Brownlee was a senior member of the Fifth National Government, serving as Leader of the House, Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was twice deputy leader of the National Party, first from November 2003 until November 2006 and again from July until November 2020. As the longest continuously serving member of Parliament, Brownlee became Father of the House in October 2022.

==Early life and family==
Brownlee was born in Christchurch to Leo (a sawmiller, who died in 1989) and Mary Brownlee. He is the eldest of five children. His uncle, Mark Brownlee, represented New Zealand in rowing at the Summer Olympic Games in 1964 and 1968, and his cousin Scott Brownlee (Mark&#x27;s son), represented New Zealand in rowing at the Olympics in 1992, 1996, and 2000.

A Roman Catholic, he attended St Bede&#x27;s College where he twice failed to gain University Entrance. After leaving high school, he worked in his family&#x27;s timber business and received training in carpentry. After qualifying as a builder, he retrained as a teacher and taught woodwork, technical drawing and Māori, over a period of twelve years, at Ellesmere College, and at his alma mater, St Bede&#x27;s. He stood as a candidate for the Canterbury Regional Council in 1992 on the Citizens&#x27; Association ticket, but was unsuccessful.

==Member of Parliament==



Brownlee first stood for National in the 1993 election, unsuccessfully contesting Sydenham against Jim Anderton, the Alliance leader. In the 1996 election he contested the nearby seat of Ilam, a longstanding conservative bastion, and won by a comfortable margin. He remained the MP for Ilam until losing his seat in the 2020 election. Before that his closest brush with defeat occurred in the 2002 election wherein he had a majority of 3,872 votes – 11.52%. Brownlee stood as a list-only candidate in 2023, fuelling speculation he would be National&#x27;s candidate for speaker should it win the election.

As a junior government MP from 1997 to 1999, Brownlee was a member of the education and science committee and the internal affairs and local government committee, and deputy chair of the social services committee. He chaired the Accident Insurance Bill committee in 1998. When National went into opposition in 1999, was appointed the party&#x27;s new junior whip and spokesperson for ACC. From 1999 to 2001, he was on the transport and industrial relations committee; in 2001, promoted to education spokesperson, he was on the education and science committee.

Brownlee has held senior roles within the National Party since October 2001, when the new National leader Bill English appointed him shadow leader of the House, a position he continued to hold under subsequent leaders Don Brash and John Key. Brownlee was the Leader of the House and a senior minister in the Fifth National Government, including Minister of Foreign Affairs. He returned to the shadow House leadership from 2018 to 2020. He was also deputy leader to Brash from 2003 to 2006 and to Judith Collins in 2020. 

Brownlee became Father of the House in October 2022, having the longest uninterrupted membership of the House of Representatives. On 24 November 2023, prime minister-designate Christopher Luxon announced that Brownlee would be nominated to be Speaker of the House.

== Opposition, 1999–2008 ==
Brownlee received criticism during the 1999 election campaign when he ejected Neil Able, a 60-year-old Native Forest Action campaigner, from the National Party&#x27;s 1999 election campaign launch. The ejection took place with what many, including watching journalists, considered excessive force. Neil Able started civil assault proceedings against Brownlee, seeking damages of $60,000. In 2002, a District Court judge found in favour of Able that Brownlee had &quot;used excessive and unnecessary force on Abel when he tried to remove him from a staircase handrail&quot;. Brownlee was ordered to pay Able $8,500 in damages. Brownlee later sought unsuccessfully to have $48,000 of his legal fees reimbursed by the Government.

Brownlee challenged the vacant deputy leadership of the National Party in 2001, but was defeated by Bill English. English eventually succeeded to the leadership later that year. In the English shadow cabinet, Brownlee was spokesperson for local government and energy, as well as shadow Leader of the House. By 2003, Brownlee was seen by Labour Party MP Phil Goff and Scoop columnist Paulo Politico as a potential challenger to English&#x27;s leadership. English was eventually replaced as National Party leader by former Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash. Brownlee was thought to be a possible deputy leader to Brash but declined to pursue the position, which went to Nick Smith.

Shortly after his election, however, Smith opted to take two weeks of stress leave, saying that the protracted leadership disputes had exhausted him. When Smith returned to Parliament, Brownlee challenged him for the deputy leadership. Informed of the challenge, Smith resigned, and on 17 November 2003 Brownlee won the caucus vote unopposed. Initially, Smith alleged that while he was on stress leave, &quot;a campaign to oust me was conducted in the media while I was under the leader&#x27;s instructions to make no comment.&quot; Audrey Young wrote in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; that Brownlee and Murray McCully were rumoured to have been behind the campaign to oust Smith as deputy leader.

After becoming a deputy leader, Brownlee continued his confrontational and colourful style of political debate. Following the controversy surrounding Brash&#x27;s Orewa Speech of 27 January 2004, Brownlee became the National Party&#x27;s spokesman for Maori Affairs in place of Georgina te Heuheu, who resigned from the position after refusing to endorse Brash&#x27;s comments. Brownlee&#x27;s approach to this portfolio involved criticising the government&#x27;s policies regarding perceived special treatment for Māori, an issue at the core of National&#x27;s 2005 election manifesto.

When Brash resigned as National Party Leader in November 2006, Brownlee was reported as &quot;probably&quot; considering a bid to remain in the deputy leadership; however, he stepped aside in place to allow former leader Bill English to take the deputy leadership and was appointed the third-ranked National Party MP by new party leader John Key.

== Fifth National Government, 2008–2017 ==

Following the election of the Fifth National Government in November 2008, Brownlee was appointed a member of the Executive Council of New Zealand and to Cabinet as Minister of Economic Development, Minister of Energy and Resources and as Associate Minister for the Rugby World Cup. He also became the Leader of the House. When the Canterbury earthquakes struck in 2010, Brownlee was appointed Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery. In the government&#x27;s second term (2011–2014), Brownlee was Minister of Transport. In its third term, he was Minister of Defence from November 2014 until May 2017, and thereafter Minister of Foreign Affairs until October 2017.

In April 2013, Brownlee was represented New Zealand in London at the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

=== Minister of Energy and Resources ===
In August 2009, Brownlee was criticised by Forest and Bird Spokesperson Kevin Hackwell for playing down government discussions to possibly allow more mining within conservation areas. Hackwell was reported as stating that &quot;If the Government&#x27;s to go down this line they could be buying a fight with the people of the Coromandel, with the people of New Zealand generally, who have put these areas aside and want them protected for their conservation values&quot;. The New Zealand mining industry was reported as welcoming the move.

In early December 2009, Forest and Bird released a leaked document that included the proposal to remove part of the conservation status of Mount Aspiring National Park to allow mining. The result of the controversy was that the government decided not to explore considerations amongst significant debate on the issue in the House, in submissions to the Select Committees and within the National Party&#x27;s own parliamentary caucus.

On the withdrawal Brownlee stated &quot;I suspect few New Zealanders knew the country had such considerable mineral potential before we undertook this process, and I get a sense that New Zealanders are now much more aware of that potential&quot;. He went on that it might contribute to economic growth and further stated that &quot;New Zealanders have given the minerals sector a clear mandate to go and explore that land, and where appropriate, within the constraints of the resource consent process, utilise its mineral resources for everyone&#x27;s benefit&quot;. An additional announcement from Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson pronounced that future National Park land would receive protections, stating that, &quot;This is an added layer of protection for New Zealand&#x27;s most highly valued conservation land...&quot;

=== Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery ===
As the Government&#x27;s most senior Christchurch-based MP, Brownlee led the Government&#x27;s work in earthquake recovery after the 2010, 2011 and 2016 earthquakes. Following National&#x27;s re-election in and , Brownlee additionally served as Minister of Transport, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Civil Defence. When Bill English became Prime Minister, Brownlee succeeded Murray McCully as Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 14 September 2010, Brownlee introduced the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2010 into the house with leave to pass the legislation in one sitting. This Bill was passed by the time the House adjourned at 10.02 pm.

Brownlee had little sympathy for attempts to preserve heritage buildings, saying not long after the 2011 quake: &quot;My absolutely strong position is that the old dungers, no matter what their connection, are going under the hammer.&quot; In 2012, it was reported that the idea of using part of Christchurch&#x27;s residential red zone for an international rowing regatta course known as East Lake had found the support of Brownlee as Earthquake Recovery Minister. In September 2012, Brownlee accused residents in Christchurch&#x27;s newly created TC3 zone of &quot;carping and moaning&quot; for comments they made in a survey conducted by the main local newspaper. The comments were about perceived inaction by the authorities, including the government. He apologised soon after.

=== Minister of Transport ===
In March 2012, Brownlee made controversial comments about Finland in a parliamentary session. Rejecting a New Zealand Labour Party plan to model the economy on Finland, he said Finland: &quot;has worse unemployment than us, has less growth than us, can hardly feed the people who live there, has a terrible homicide rate, hardly educates its people, and has no respect for women.&quot; Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, said that Finland would not take any action as the comments were clearly a device for internal politics rather than an attack on Finland. He continued to say: &quot;I doubt he even knows where Finland is.&quot;

In November 2014 Brownlee was fined $2000 by New Zealand&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority for a breach of airport security that occurred at Christchurch Airport on 24 July 2014. An official inquiry found that Brownlee and two of his aides had evaded airport security screening by entering a departure lounge through an exit door while in a rush to board a domestic flight.

=== Minister of Foreign Affairs ===
In May 2017, less than a week after being appointed as Foreign Minister, Brownlee was publicly corrected by Prime Minister Bill English, after claiming that a New Zealand-sponsored United Nations Security Council Resolution on Israel (about settlements in occupied territories) was &quot;premature&quot;. The Prime Minister said Brownlee was &quot;still getting familiar&quot; with the language used by his predecessor, Murray McCully, who had authorised the sponsorship of the resolution. Responding to questions in Parliament on Brownlee&#x27;s behalf, Deputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett commented that Brownlee&#x27;s use of the word &quot;premature&quot; was because the Government &quot;would have liked to give Israel notice of the resolution, and our part in that, but did not.&quot;

English said he had confidence that Brownlee was clear on New Zealand&#x27;s position now, a position that had not changed since the Government had chosen to push through the resolution. Brownlee had been a Cabinet minister at the time; however, the decision to co-sponsor the resolution (described by McCully and Bennett as being in line with New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;long-standing position&quot;) had not gone to Cabinet.

== Opposition, 2017–2023 ==
From 2018 to 2020, Brownlee served in Opposition as Shadow Leader of the House, and was the National Party Spokesperson for Disarmament, NZSIS, and GCSB. He was the deputy chairperson on the Privileges, Standing Orders, and Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committees, as well as a member of the Business Committee and the Parliamentary Service Commission.

On 14 July 2020, Brownlee was elected by the National Party parliamentary caucus as the Deputy Leader of the National Party following a leadership election held after the resignation of Party Leader Todd Muller that same day. Judith Collins was elected as the leader of the National Party.

In August 2020, Brownlee was widely criticised during the COVID-19 pandemic for comments he made that were widely interpreted to be promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding the NZ Government response to the pandemic. In particular, his comments were considered to imply that the Government was withholding information about confirmed cases, without providing any evidence that this was the case. Brownlee was also accused of attacking the integrity of independent public servants and promoting the propagation of misinformation.

During the 2020 New Zealand general election, Brownlee lost his seat of Ilam to Labour candidate Sarah Pallett by a final margin of 3,463 votes. Dominic Harris of news website &quot;Stuff&quot; described it &quot;perhaps the most unlikely of election night coups&quot;. Despite this defeat, Brownlee returned to Parliament due to ranking second on the National Party list.

On 6 November 2020, Brownlee announced his resignation as deputy leader of National. He was succeeded by Shane Reti.

Brownlee announced on 2 August 2022 that he would seek re-election at the 2023 New Zealand general election, although would not attempt to win back Ilam, instead opting to contest as a list only candidate, indicating he may become Speaker of the House should National form a Government following the election.

In September 2022, Brownlee was criticised by Rodney Jones and Jason Young for his response to the United Nations Xinjiang Report in saying that China is &quot;dealing with a terrorist problem&quot; and that China’s anti-terrorism laws were comparable to New Zealand’s and those of other countries.

During the 2023 New Zealand general election, Brownlee was re-elected to Parliament as a list MP.

In early November 2023, Brownlee accompanied the caretaker Deputy Prime Minister, Carmel Sepuloni, to the 2023 Pacific Islands Forum in his capacity as National’s foreign affairs spokesperson. There, he met with several non-Pacific representatives from Cuba, Portugal, France and South Korea in Rarotonga.

== Sixth National Government, 2023–present ==

Brownlee was nominated as Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 54th New Zealand Parliament. He was elected unopposed, after Debbie Ngarewa-Packer nominated his predecessor Adrian Rurawhe, who declined the nomination.

In November 2024, Brownlee&#x27;s initial decision to bar Newsroom journalist Aaron Smale from attending the National Apology ceremony at Parliament for survivors of abuse in state and faith-based care attracted criticism from both survivor groups and the Parliamentary Press Gallery, the latter of whom appealed the decision. Smale had previously asked Prime Minister Christopher Luxon whether there was a link between tough and crime policies and gang membership, and had also criticised Children&#x27;s Minister Karen Chhour for comparing the Government&#x27;s boot camp programme to the Māori battalion. On 11 November, Brownlee reversed the ban and permitted Smale access to the National Apology on the condition that he was accompanied by a fellow Newsroom journalist.

On 10 December 2024, Brownlee as Speaker disagreed with Clerk of the New Zealand House of Representatives David Wilson and Assistant Speaker Barbara Kuriger, ruling that the list of projects under the Fast-track Approvals Bill does not grant a private benefit. Earlier that day, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop had submitted an amendment paper with a large number of changes to the proposed legislation during the Committee of the House stage of the Fast-Track Approvals Bill. Based on the Clerk&#x27;s advice, Kuriger expressed concern that the listing of projects under the Fast-Track Bill benefitted specific people and should thus be classified as private legislation and removed from the Bill. The Government disagreed and recalled Brownlee, who overruled Kuriger. Brownlee&#x27;s decision was criticised by the opposition Labour and Green parties, with the former saying it had lost confidence in Brownlee&#x27;s role as Speaker of the House. The Fast-Track Approvals Bill passed its third reading on 17 December 2024.

== Political views ==
Brownlee has generally voted conservatively on conscience issues. In April 2013, Brownlee voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand. He voted against the Abortion Legislation Bill in 2019 and 2020 and against the End of Life Choice Bill in 2017 and 2019.

<doc id="599960" wikidata="Q4049557" url="?curid=599960" title="Sisyrinchium bellum">
<text>Sisyrinchium bellum, the western blue-eyed grass or Californian blue-eyed grass, is the common blue-eyed grass of California and Oregon in and west of the Sierra Nevada, its range extending south into Baja California. In parts of its range, western blue-eyed grass has previously been classified as &quot;Sisyrinchium eastwoodiae&quot;, &quot;S. greenei&quot; and &quot;S. hesperium&quot;, but these names are now considered synonyms.

&quot;Sisyrinchium bellum&quot; grows as a perennial plant in open places where there is some moisture, particularly grassy areas, though it can also be found in woodlands and at altitudes up to . Like other species of blue-eyed grasses that are locally dominant, it is generally known simply as &quot;blue-eyed grass&quot; within its natural range.

==Description==
The stems of &quot;Sisyrinchium bellum&quot; can grow as long as , though they are often shorter. Its leaves are grassy and tufted. The flowers are in diameter and purplish-blue, varying somewhat in color from a true blue to a definite purple; occasional white-flowering plants are found. It flowers from March to July with a peak in April. Dried in air, its seeds weigh between 1 and 4 mg. After flowering, it dies to the ground and is dormant over the summer.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Sisyrinchium bellum&quot; prefers some moisture and good drainage, but will tolerate summer dryness. It can be propagated by seed, and it self-sows. It can also be propagated by division of its rhizomes, and the flower stems can be rooted. It is moderately hardy and will tolerate temperatures down to .

==Uses==
The Ohlone used an infusion of the roots and leaves as a cure for indigestion and stomach pain, and similar uses are recorded from other Native American peoples.

<doc id="599963" wikidata="Q954794" url="?curid=599963" title="Goodbye Pork Pie">
<text>Goodbye Pork Pie is a 1981 New Zealand comedy film directed by Geoff Murphy, co-produced by Murphy and Nigel Hutchinson, and written by Geoff Murphy and Ian Mune. The film was New Zealand&#x27;s first large-scale local hit. One book described it as &quot;Easy Rider&quot; meets the Keystone Cops.

It was filmed during November 1979, using only 24 cast and crew. Its overheads were surprisingly minimal, to the point that the police cars used doubled as crew and towing vehicles, and that the director Geoff Murphy performed some of the stunts himself.

==Plot==
In the Northland town of Kaitaia in spring 1978, nineteen-year-old Gerry Austin (aka &#x27;Blondini&#x27;) opportunistically steals a wallet and uses the cash and driver&#x27;s licence inside a Hertz car rental office to rent a yellow Mini. With no particular aim in mind, he drifts down to Auckland. Meanwhile, in Auckland, the middle-aged John, has just had Sue, his girlfriend of six years, walk out on him and fly home to Invercargill. After a night on the bottle, John decides to go down to Invercargill.

Searching for transport, John notices Gerry being stopped by a traffic officer for failing to wear a seat belt. John intervenes and manages to get the officer off writing a ticket. As thanks, Gerry offers John a lift part of the way. The duo stop for petrol in northern Waikato but accidentally drive off without paying, drawing police attention to the car.

Further down the road, Gerry and John pick up Shirl, who is heading to Wanganui, and after informing the duo that she is a virgin, Gerry makes a bet that this will change before reaching Wanganui. After failing to pay for petrol on purpose in the central North Island, they are pursued by a motorcycle officer, with the duo ending up avoiding arrest by driving into a car wrecker.

Shirl does not leave at Wanganui, and decides to stay with the duo and head to Wellington. In Wellington, the trio meets Mulvaney, an old associate of John&#x27;s, who gives the trio overnight accommodation at his garage and supplies them with money and drugs in return for parts of the car. Leaving for the Interislander ferry the next morning, Gerry runs a red light and is immediately pursued by the police through central Wellington. The trio avoid the police by driving through the Wellington railway station and stowing the Mini in an empty boxcar being shunted onto the ferry.

Arriving in Picton in the South Island, the boxcar is attached to a train destined for Christchurch, and the trio enjoy a leisurely ride, decorating the wagon with the name &quot;Blondini&quot; and other items found in the train&#x27;s wagons. After a night of partying, Gerry finally wins his bet with Shirl. Arriving in Christchurch in the morning, the trio finds out the wagon is not leaving the city for the West Coast until that night, so spend the day on the town. Gerry and John return to the train, but notices Shirl is not there, and the train leaves without her.

After leaving the train, Gerry and John stop at a tearoom further down the coast. They find out from the television that Shirl was arrested for shoplifting, and that they are wanted in a national man-hunt of the &quot;Blondini Gang&quot;. Crossing back over the Southern Alps, the Mini is pursued by a determined police officer down the Lake Hāwea shoreline. He almost catches Gerry and John, but ends up driving off the road and down the bank trying to avoid a combine harvester blocking the road. The duo sell more parts off the car at Cromwell, but as they are short-changed John takes a full petrol can as extra payment.

At Dunedin, the duo meet Snout, who helps them avoid a police roadblock and buys more parts off the car. However, after he learns they are heading for Invercargill, he tips them off to the police. Stopping at McNab, Southland for conveniences, John is spotted by police; unable to find Gerry, he drives off in the Mini, not realising Gerry is underneath the car trying to remove the muffler. Gerry is arrested, but manages to escape from the police car and jumps on top of the fleeing Mini. The police try to PIT the Mini, and Gerry falls off and is hit by the pursuing police car. John says goodbye to the injured Gerry, then takes the car and proceeds to Invercargill.

John encounters a roadblock at the entrance to Invercargill and diverts through a cemetery to avoid it, but not before the Armed Offenders Squad shoots a hole in the Cromwell fuel can, spilling the petrol. Approaching Sue&#x27;s house, the insecure exhaust dragging along the road ignites the fuel, setting it alight. John reunites with Sue, but their reunion is short-lived when the burning Mini draws the attention of emergency services. With police surrounding the house, John finally admits defeat and surrenders.

==Impact==
Though coming after &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, the release of &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; is considered to be the coming-of-age of New Zealand cinema as it showed that New Zealanders could make successful films about New Zealand. It was the first really financially successful New Zealand film of modern times.

==Production==
&quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; was filmed chronologically over six weeks in late 1979, following the north to south route taken by the film&#x27;s protagonists. Filming began in the northern town of Kaitaia and ended in Invercargill, near the bottom of the South Island. Director Geoff Murphy, who co-produced the film with Nigel Hutchinson, had been good friends with star Tony Barry (Smith) as well as Bruno Lawrence before &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;. The three had played together in multi-media group Blerta.

Geoff Murphy cameos in the film as a man working at the second petrol station. Co-producer Nigel Hutchinson sells a banana milk shake &quot;with an egg in it&quot; to John a short time before Gerry falls off the car.

New Zealand band Street Talk provided most of the music heard in the film and formed a large part of the soundtrack, but the group had already broken up by the time the movie was released.

===Cars===
The yellow mini was a 1978 Mini 1000, registered IZ6393. Characters&#x27; names (Gerry) Austin and (Leslie) Morris echo British Leyland marques under which Minis were sold. Three 1978 Minis were used during filming. They were sourced from the New Zealand Motor Corporation (assemblers of British Leyland products in NZ). After filming was completed, two of the Minis that were undamaged were returned to The New Zealand Motor Corporation. The third, which had a hole cut in the roof and the front bodywork removed, was used for promotion and is still in New Zealand. Its actual registration is IX2992. A fourth, 1959 Mini was used for the final scene where it was burnt out. The Holden HQ police cars used in the film doubled as towing and support vehicles for the cast and crew. These were the police cars chasing the Mini throughout both the North and South Islands.

===Locations===
An early scene in the film shows John and his partner in a taxi, after she has left him, crossing the old Mangere Bridge. The new bridge, at the time of the film&#x27;s production, was on hold for a couple of years in an unfinished state due to prolonged industrial action.

When Gerry and John pick up Shirl, she is standing in front of the now-decommissioned Meremere coal-fired power station.

The first petrol station that fuel was stolen from is located in Pōkeno, and is now a camper van sales yard. The second petrol station the trio stole fuel from is located in National Park, at the intersection of State Highway 4 and State Highway 47.

On a wet and dismal day, Gerry and John drop Shirl off at an address in Wellington. This was in Palliser Rd, Mt Victoria. When the car pulls up, they are in front of a garage with a large number &#x27;24&#x27; painted on the front. This garage has since been removed.

John introduces Gerry to his friend Mulvaney at a workshop which was at 97 Aro St, Wellington. The building is still there but somewhat modified since the movie was shot.

The Interislander ferry that the Mini is stowed on between Wellington and Picton is the .

The Christchurch railway station where the Mini is stowed while in Christchurch was closed in 1993, replaced by a new station built in Addington. This building was used as a movie theatre and Science Alive from 1993, until the building was badly damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The building was demolished in 2012.

A later scene in the film shows Blondini and John in Cromwell, Central Otago. The part of Cromwell shown is now underwater, due to the Lake Dunstan hydroelectric project.

The scene at McNab, Southland where Gerry is caught by the police shows a decrepit old toilet block at the side of the road. It was actually a temporary structure built specifically for the film.

==Remake==

In 2014, a remake of the film was announced, with Matt Murphy – one of Geoff Murphy&#x27;s sons who had worked on the original version – as director. The same year, a re-enactment of the Lake Hāwea chase was filmed to promote the New Mini, which featured prominently in the remake, simply known as &quot;Pork Pie&quot;.

Filming of &quot;Pork Pie&quot; started in March 2016. Dean O&#x27;Gorman, James Rolleston and Ashleigh Cummings star as Jon (John), Luke (Gerry) and Kiera (Shirl) respectively. The film&#x27;s first trailer was released on 17 October 2016, with the film released in cinemas on 2 February 2017. The remake was not as successful as the original.

<text>Old Calendarists (Greek: &quot;palaioimerologitai&quot; or &quot;palaioimerologites&quot;), also known as Old Feasters (&quot;palaioeortologitai&quot;), Genuine Orthodox Christians or True Orthodox Christians (GOC; ), are traditionalist groups of Eastern Orthodox Christians that separated from mainstream Eastern Orthodox churches because some of the latter adopted the revised Julian calendar while Old Calendarists remained committed to the Julian calendar.&quot;&quot;

Old Calendarists are not in communion with any mainstream Eastern Orthodox churches.

&quot;Old Calendarists&quot; is another name for the True Orthodox movement in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus.

==Terminology==
Mainstream Eastern Orthodox Christians that use the old (Julian) calendar are not what is designated by the expression &quot;Old Calendarist&quot;, because they remain in communion with the Eastern Orthodox churches that use the new calendar (the Revised Julian calendar). Old Calendarists have severed communion with the mainstream Eastern Orthodox that follow the old calendar, because the latter maintained communion with Eastern Orthodox churches that had adopted the revised calendar. Thus, to be &quot;Old Calendarist&quot; is not the same thing as only following the old calendar. The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, is not Old Calendarist, but follows the old (Julian) calendar.&quot;&quot;

== History ==

=== Background ===
Until 1924, the Eastern Orthodox Church universally used the Julian calendar, whereas the Roman Catholic Church, under Pope Gregory XIII, conducted a calendar reform resulting in the Gregorian calendar in 1582. The difference between the two calendars is 13 days between 1900 and 2100.

==== 1923 Congress ====

In May 1923, the Pan-Orthodox Council of Constantinople, called by Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople, adopted the Revised Julian calendar. This new calendar was different to the Julian calendar, and would not diverge from the Gregorian calendar for a further 800 years. The Revised Julian calendar replaced the tabular date of Easter of the Julian calendar with an astronomical date of Easter. The astronomical Easter was unpopular and hardly used at all, and for the purpose of calculating the date of Easter the Julian calendar was restored. Not all Eastern Orthodox churches were represented at the congress or adopted its decisions, and the Russian Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Orthodox churches have continued to use the Julian calendar liturgically to this day.

=== Birth ===

==== Greece ====

In 1924, the Church of Greece adopted the Revised Julian calendar, also called &#x27;New calendar&#x27;. &quot;At first, resistance to the New Calendar was muted&quot;. The Old Calendarists in Greece were at first a small number of laymen, priests and monks, whose number grew over the years.&quot;&quot;

Before they were joined by bishops, the Old Calendarist movement in Greece was only composed of priests and laypeople, of which &quot;several hundreds monks from Athos&quot;.

In 1935, three bishops of the Church of Greece joined the movement and consecrated four new bishops for the movement.&quot;&quot; Of those three bishops, Metropolitan of Florina became the leader of the Greek Old Calendarist movement. Of the three bishops who had joined, Chrysostom of Zakynthos soon left the movement after the consecration and went back to the Church of Greece. Of the four bishops consecrated, two joined the Church of Greece. This left the Greek Old Calendarist movement with four bishops: Chrysostomos of Florina, Germanos of Demetria, Germanos of the Cyclades, and Matthew (Karpoudakis) of Vrestheni. Those remaining four bishops created an Old Calendarist Holy Synod.

While the Greek Old Calendarists were &quot;[o]riginally perhaps a million strong&quot;, they were severely persecuted by the State of Greece; Metropolitan Chrysostomos was imprisoned in Lesbos in 1951 as part of those persecutions.
===== Splits =====

The Greek Old Calendarists experienced schism in 1937, due to a disagreement on the validity of the sacraments performed by members of churches which have adopted the reformed calendar. After Chrysostomos, head of the Holy Synod, refused to declare the sacraments of the New Calendarists as graceless, bishop Matthew led the group which seceded from the Holy Synod.

After this, Matthew ordained a number of bishops himself, and formed a separate Holy Synod of which he was the head as archbishop of Athens. Matthew died in 1950.

After Chrysostomos&#x27; death in 1955, his group had no bishop until 1960, when two bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) consecrated archbishop. Akakios consecrated other bishops with the participation of another different ROCOR bishop. Akakios was succeeded by . Under Auxentios, &quot;complicated patterns of division and realignment occurred both within his own jurisdiction and among the followers of Archbishop Matthew&quot;. Due to this, in 1999 there were at least five different Greek Old Calendarist churches, each headed by a different archbishop of Athens. Additionally, there was also a &#x27;Cyprianite&#x27; Greek Old Calendarist Church, whose adjective derives from its leader, bishop Cyprian of Oropos and Phyli.

In 1971, the ROCOR tried to unite the factions of Greek Old Calendarists, but failed. In 1999, the most important groups of Greek Old Calendarists were the Chrysostomites, the Matthewites, and the Cyprianites.

==== Romania ====
Also in 1924, the Romanian Orthodox Church adopted the revised calendar; at this moment the Old Calendarist movement began in Romania. The abbot of Prokof, , became the head of the Old Calendarist movement in Romania. Hierarchs in Greece, supporting the Old Calendarists, did not manage to consecrate Tanase a bishop due to interventions of the Greek State.

By 1936, many parishes had left the Romanian Orthodox Church to become Old Calendarist, and more than forty new churches had been built for the use of Romanian Old Calendarist communities.

From 1935 and onwards, the Romanian government enacted &quot;drastic measures&quot; aimed to &quot;eradicate organized opposition&quot; to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Due to this, Romanian Old Calendarist churches and monasteries &quot;were razed&quot;, and Romanian Old Calendarists activists were incarcerated. &quot;Many, like Abbot Pambo, were killed and Glicherie Tănase was repeatedly imprisoned.&quot; Those persecutions went on &quot;until the collapse of the [Romanian] regime at the end of the Second World War.&quot;

In 1955, one bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan , joined the Old Calendarist movement in Romania. Before they were joined by a bishops, the Old Calendarist movement in Romania was only composed of priests and laypeople, of which &quot;several hundreds monks from Athos&quot;.

Metropolitan Galaction, while under house arrest, consecrated other Old Calendarist bishops: , , and Glycerius Tănase. Later, a Holy Synod of the Romanian Old Calendarists was &quot;formally established&quot;.

Since the Ceaușescu period, the Romania Old Calendarist Church &quot;has flourished, establishing a vigorous parochial and monastic life.&quot; Since the fall of Ceaușescu, the Romanian Old Calendarist movement &quot;has grown notably.&quot;

The Romanian Old Calendarist movement remained united, unlike the Greek Old Calendarist movement.

Metropolitan Galaction was the first head of the Romanian Old Calendarist, until his death in 1959. Galaction was succeeded as head by Tănase, who became the second leader of the Romania Old Calendarist Church, from 1960 until his death in 1985. Tanase was canonized by the Romania Old Calendarist Church in 1999.

==== Bulgaria ====

The Bulgarian Orthodox Church adopted the revised Julian calendar in 1968. The Protection Convent near Sofia became a center of the resistance to this adoption. In 1993, of Triadista was consecrated bishop by the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church to be hierarch of the Bulgarian Old Calendarists.

==== Ukraine ====

The Orthodox Church of Ukraine adopted the Revised Julian calendar in 2023. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church commonly referred to by the exonym Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate did not switch to the Revised Julian calendar.

== Intercommunion ==
In 1977, a declaration of intercommunion between the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church and the Romanian Old Calendarist Church was signed.

In 1994, an act establishing communion between the ROCOR and the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church established full communion between those two churches, as well as between Romanian and Bulgarian Old Calendarist churches. Those four churches were therefore &quot;in a single communion&quot;.

The Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church severed its communion with the ROCOR in 2005, because they considered the ROCOR was going to enter into a union with the Moscow Patriarchate, and had &quot;jettisoned&quot; its &quot;anti-ecumenist outlook&quot; as well as its cooperation with the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church. Two weeks prior to the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church&#x27;s decision, the ROCOR had severed communion with the Cyprianite Old Calendarist Church due to its leader consecrating a bishop in Ossetia as Bishop .

== Demography ==
In 1999, it was estimated that &quot;[t]here are probably over one million Old Calendarists in Romania, somewhat fewer in Greece, and considerably fewer in Bulgaria, Cyprus, and the [Eastern Orthodox] diaspora.&quot;

== Categories ==
There exists two trends within Old Calendarism. The first one is &quot;resistance Old Calendarism&quot;, the second is &quot;integrist Old Calendarism&quot;.

The first position &quot;expresses resistance to what it sees as unlawful innovation and walls itself off from churches using the new calendar and compromised by what is seen as the heresy of ecumenism. It refuses, however, to condemn the rites and sacraments of New Calendarists as devoid of grace, and seeks by witness and courteous dialogue to draw the [Eastern] Orthodox majority to its traditionalist outlook.&quot; This trend is to be found for example in among the True Orthodox of Cyprianite stance.

The second position &quot;rejects all New Calendarist churches, all those in communion with New Calendarists and all who refuse to reject the sacraments of the New Calendarists as outside the [Eastern] Orthodox Church and therefore as having sacraments devoid of grace.&quot; Churches which hold this position &quot;see themselves as the surviving [Eastern] Orthodox church, maintaining the integrity of [Eastern] Orthodox tradition in the face of massive apostasy.&quot; This trend is to be found for example in the Old Calendarist churches of the Matthewite succession.

In 1999, it was noted that &quot;a more recent cause of division, especially among Matthewites, is the icon of the Holy Trinity portraying God the Father as &quot;the Ancient of Days&quot;: some Old Calendarists reject the icon, others reject the rejecters as iconoclasts.&quot;

== Groups ==
Old Calendarist groups include:

* Greek Old Calendarists, composed of numerous churches of which are:
**Church of the Genuine Orthodox Christians of Greece (Kallinikos Synod)
**Holy Synod of Milan
** Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles

<text>The New Calendarists are Eastern Orthodox churches that adopted the Revised Julian calendar.&quot;&quot;

== Background ==
In the history of Christianity, divisions on which calendar to use were initiated after 1582, when the Catholic Church transitioned from the ancient Julian calendar to the new Gregorian calendar.

Eventually, by the 18th century, the Gregorian Calendar was officially adopted even in Protestant countries as the civil calendar, but still faced some opposition from smaller groups. In the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Gregorian calendar was officially introduced in 1752.

Around the same time, debates between those wanting to adopt the Gregorian Calendar and traditionalists wanting to keep the Julian calendar were also going on within several Eastern Catholic Churches. Those debates were focused mainly on ritual questions and ended in various compromises. The need for preservation of ritual differences, including various questions related to liturgical calendar, was consequently acknowledged by Rome.

==New Calendarists==

In 1923, the Revised Julian calendar was devised. Since then, several Eastern Orthodox Churches have introduced partial changes into their liturgical calendars. Those changes were based on the application of the Revised Julian calendar for the liturgical celebration of immovable feasts (including Christmas), thus reducing the use of the old Julian calendar to liturgical celebration of moveable feasts (feasts of the Easter cycle).

Thus, the Revised calendar use was introduced. It has been adopted by:
* the Ecumenical Patriarchate (March 1924)
* the Church of Greece (March 1924)
* the Church of Cyprus (March 1924)
* the Romanian Orthodox Church (later in 1924)
* the Patriarchate of Alexandria (in 1928)
* the Patriarchate of Antioch (in 1928)
* the Albanian Orthodox Church (April 1937)
* the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (in 1968)
* the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (in 2023)
The Orthodox Church in America (except for Alaska) also uses the revised calendar.

It was not adopted by the Eastern Orthodox Churches of:
* Jerusalem
* Georgia
* Russia
* Sinai
* the monasteries on the Mount Athos.
The Polish Orthodox Church has wavered between the two calendars; today it officially follows the old calendar.

In Eastern Orthodoxy, issues related to calendar reform did not produce break of communion or schisms between the mainstream churches, but they did cause disputes and internal schisms within some churches. The result of those conflicts was the emergence of the Old Calendarist movement, and consequent creation of separate churches, thus breaking the communion with those mother churches that accepted the calendar reform.

<text>Tanais ( &quot;Tánaïs&quot;; ) was an ancient Greek city in the Don river delta, called the Maeotian marshes in classical antiquity. It was a bishopric as Tana and remains a Latin Catholic titular see as Tanais.

==Location==
The delta reaches into the northeasternmost part of the Sea of Azov, which the Ancient Greeks called Lake Maeotis. The site of ancient Tanais is about 30 km west of modern Rostov-on-Don. The central city site lies on a plateau with a difference up to 20 m in elevation in the south. It is bordered by a natural valley to the east, and an artificial ditch to the west.

==History==
The site of Tanais was occupied long before the Milesians founded an emporium there. A necropolis of over 300 burial kurgans near the ancient city shows that the site had already been occupied since the Bronze Age, and that kurgan burials continued through Greek and into the Roman era.

Greek traders seem to have been meeting nomads in the district as early as the 7th century BC without a formal, permanent settlement. Greek colonies had two kinds of origins, &quot;apoikiai&quot; of citizens from the mother city-state, and &quot;emporia&quot;, which were strictly trading stations. Founded late in the 3rd century BC, by merchant adventurers from Miletus, Tanais quickly developed into an &quot;emporium&quot; at the farthest northeastern extension of the Hellenic cultural sphere. It was a natural post, first for the trade of the steppes reaching away eastwards in an unbroken grass sea to the Altai, the Scythian Holy Land, second for the trade of the Black Sea, ringed with Greek-dominated ports and entrepots, and third for trade from the impenetrable north, with furs and slaves brought down the Don. Strabo mentions Tanais in his &quot;Geography&quot; (11.2.2).

The site for the city, ruled by an archon, was at the eastern edge of the territory of the kings of Bosporus. A major shift in social emphasis is represented in the archaeological site when the propylaea gate that linked the port section with the agora was removed, and the open center of public life was occupied by a palatial dwelling in Roman times for the kings of Bosporus. For the first time there were client kings at Tanais: Sauromates (AD 175-211) and his son Rescuporides (c. AD 220), who both left public inscriptions.

In AD 330 Tanais was devastated by the Goths, but the site was occupied continuously up to the second half of the 5th century AD. Increasingly, the channel silted up, probably the result of deforestation, and the center of active life shifted, perhaps to the small city of Azov, halfway to Rostov.

The city was refounded around the 14th century by the Venetians. Later it was acquired by the maritime Republic of Genoa, who administered it 1332-1471 as Tana nel Mare Maggiore, being an important place for trade with the Golden Horde, like all their Black Sea colonies controlled by the Genoese Consul at Kaffa. It decayed again after 1368. In 1392 it was conquered by Timur, by the Ottoman Turks in 1471, by the Russians in 1696, again by the Turks in 1711 and by the Russian Empire in 1771.


==Archaeology==

In 1823, I. A. Stempkovsky first made a connection between the visible archaeological remains, which were mostly Roman in date, and the &quot;Tanais&quot; mentioned in the ancient Greek sources.

Systematic modern excavations began in 1955. A joint Russian-German team has recently been excavating at the site of Tanais, with the aim of revealing the heart of the city, the agora, and defining the extent of Hellenistic influence on the urbanism of the Bosporan Greek city, as well as studying defensive responses to the surrounding nomadic cultures.

In the book &quot;Jakten på Odin&quot;, author Thor Heyerdahl advanced a highly controversial idea postulating connections between Tanais and ancient Scandinavia. In preparation of the book, he conducted some archaeological research on the site of Tanais. Heyerdal`s idea was based on the old Norse sagas of Snorri Sturlason. (1178 - 1241)

Tanais Tablets are the most important historical discoveries in region of Tanais.

===Genetics===
9 Y-chromosome markers were obtained from a skeleton. The result was 389I=13, 389II=30, 458=15, 385=11, 393=13, 391=11, 635=23, 437=14, 448=19. This result is characteristic for haplogroup R1a.

<text>Robert Willis (25 January 1942 – 23 October 1999) was an English songwriter and talent manager who became the manager and eventually husband of singer Cilla Black.

==Career==
His first known recorded composition, &quot;Shy of Love&quot; was featured on the B-side of &quot;Love of the Loved&quot;, the debut release of Cilla Black in September 1963. During the sixties he was to write many songs for his then girlfriend to record and perform.

One of his most popular – &quot;Is It Love?&quot; – was featured in the beat film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; in 1965. He collaborated with Clive Westlake, Kenny Lynch and The Beatles producer George Martin on some songs.

After the death of Black&#x27;s manager, Brian Epstein, Willis took over her management duties and over the next thirty years, developed her popularity with television family audiences, and helped Black to become the highest-paid female presenter on television.

==Death==
On 23 October 1999, aged 57, Willis died of lung and liver cancer at the Royal Free Hospital in London. His funeral service was held on 1 November at Saint Mary the Virgin Church in Denham, Buckinghamshire. He was cremated.

==Personal life==
Willis had four brothers named Albert, Ronnie, Bertie, and Kenneth.

Willis married Cilla Black on 25 January 1969, his 27th birthday, at Marylebone Town Hall. To please her Catholic family, the couple were granted a dispensation to have their marriage blessed on 6 March 1969 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Liverpool&#x27;s Woolton suburb. (Willis was from an Anglican background.) They had three sons together: Robert (born 1970), Ben (born 1974), and Jack (born 1980). Their daughter Ellen (born 1975) lived for only two hours.

<text>FC Hansa Rostock () is a German association football club based in the city of Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The club is also called as &quot;the cog&quot; because of its club crest. They have emerged as one of the most successful clubs from the former East Germany after German reunification and have made several appearances in the top-flight Bundesliga. With over 28,000 club members, the club is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany.

After being in the Bundesliga for ten years, from 1995 to 2005, Rostock went into a steady decline. In 2012, the club was relegated to the 3. Liga for the second time, regaining its place in the 2. Bundesliga in 2021. They returned to the 3. Liga after three seasons following relegation in 2023–24.

==History==
The club was originally founded on 1 November 1954 as the multi-sport sports club SC Empor Rostock. The football squad, however, could not be recruited from local enterprise sports communities (, BSG) like the squad of the handball section, so a transfer of BSG Empor Lauter&#x27;s squad from Lauter to Rostock was considered. The area around Lauter, near the Czech border, was well represented in East German football by competitive sides, including Wismut Aue, Fortschritt Meerane and Motor Zwickau, so the footballers of &quot;BSG Empor Lauter&quot; were delegated to Rostock, over the futile protests of the team&#x27;s local supporters. Then SED First Secretary in Bezirk Rostock Karl Mewis and SED functionary Harry Tisch were instrumental in the relocation of BSG Empor Lauter to Rostock. Karl Lewis was allegedly the initiator of the relocation. This was not an uncommon occurrence in the 1950s of East German football, where clubs were regularly renamed, re-structured, dismantled or shuffled from city to city at the direction of well-placed communist officials. The new club would be sponsored by the fishing combine VEB Fischkombinat Rostock.

The wholesale transfer of the &quot;Lauterers&quot; to Rostock part way through the 1954–55 season led to the disappearance of that association from play. A new club was formed in 1956 as BSG Motor Lauter and on 1 August 1990, it took up the tradition of the original side to play as Lauterer Sportverein Viktoria 1913.

===Play in Rostock===

Newly formed SC Empor Rostock took the place of the former Lauter-based club in first division play in November 1954. They finished second the next season, but in 1956 plunged to 14th place and were relegated. They quickly bounced back, rejoining the DDR-Oberliga in 1958, before going on to become a very competitive side with a series of three vice-championships to their credit from 1962 to 1964, as well as several appearances in the final of the FDGB Pokal. The re-organization of East German sports in 1965 led to the association&#x27;s football department becoming independent as Fußball Club Hansa Rostock, which was designated as one of the country&#x27;s 10 dedicated football club intended to groom talent for the development of a strong East Germany national team. The new club&#x27;s name acknowledged Rostock&#x27;s history as one of the major trading centres of northern Europe&#x27;s Hanseatic League. FC Hansa Rostock would be sponsored by the maritime combine VEB Kombinat Seeverkehr und Hafenwirtschaft. And the club would be patronaged by the SED First Secretary of Bezirk Rostock, as well as future Free German Trade Union Federation chairman and Politburo member Harry Tisch.

By the 1970s, the club was consistently finishing in the lower half of the league table and was relegated to the second division DDR-Liga for a single season on three occasions late in the decade. They returned to form in the 1980s, and, as the football leagues of West Germany and East Germany were merged in 1990 after the re-unification of the country, Rostock won its first national championship in the final season of East German football, played out in the transitional NOFV-Oberliga. This is their only top flight title to date in play in East Germany or the unified Germany.

They also captured the last East German Cup with a 1–0 win over &quot;FC Stahl Eisenhüttenstadt&quot;.

===United Germany and the Bundesliga===

The club&#x27;s timely success earned them a place in the Bundesliga alongside Dynamo Dresden when the top-flight Bundesliga was briefly expanded from 18 to 20 teams for the 1991–92 season to accommodate two former East German teams. Hansa, however, was unable to stay up and was relegated after falling just a single point shy of SG Wattenscheid 09. Three seasons of tempering in the 2. Bundesliga would return the club to the top flight for the 1995–96 season. In ten years spent in the Bundesliga, the team&#x27;s best results were a pair of sixth-place finishes. In spite of frequent placings in the bottom-half of the league table, they would persist as the only former East German side able to consistently challenge the well-heeled clubs of the west. On 1 December 2002, Rostock became the first club to field six foreigners from the same country in a Bundesliga match (Rade Prica, Marcus Lantz, Peter Wibrån, Andreas Jakobsson, Magnus Arvidsson and Joakim Persson – all Swedes).

Hansa had a very poor first half in the 2004–05 season, earning only 1 win and 5 draws in 17 matches. They were unable to recover despite the late arrival of Finnish striker Jari Litmanen and at season&#x27;s end were relegated, leaving the former GDR without a club in the top flight for the first time since re-unification. Like other East German teams, they were the victims of a harsh economic reality as the wealthier, well-established western sides bought up the most talented eastern footballers as their clubs struggled to survive financially: Rostock&#x27;s Stefan Beinlich, Oliver Neuville and Victor Agali were just three players sent west in exchange for cash. After two years in the 2. Bundesliga, the club returned to the top-flight for the 2007–08 season, but was again relegated.

The club&#x27;s poor form continued in 2009–10 and they finished third-last. With this season, a new promotion/relegation format accompanied the introduction of the 3. Liga and Rostock faced a playoff versus the third place third division club FC Ingolstadt. Hansa lost both legs of the contest and was sent down to the 3. Liga, while Ingolstadt won promotion to the 2. Bundesliga alongside the top two third-tier teams which advanced automatically by virtue of their finishes. Their stay was a short one as they were sent back down after finishing bottom table in 2011–12.

Hansa Rostock drew an average home attendance of 11,433 in the 2016–17 3. Liga, the third-highest in the league.

==Fans==
A study published in 2007 by Sportfive reported Hansa&#x27;s fanbase to be the seventh largest in Germany, involving up to two million supporters. According to another study published in 2008 by Allensbach Institute, Hansa is the most popular German football club in the New Länder and the most popular club of the former GDR in reunited Germany. Hansa Rostock&#x27;s official anthem is &quot;FC Hansa, wir lieben Dich total&quot; (&quot;Hansa FC, We Totally Love You&quot;), recorded in 1995 by East German band Puhdys.

Hansa struggles with hooliganism, estimating up to 500 supporters to be leaning towards violence. The club itself, as well as some fans&#x27; associations, are anxious to curtail these in several ways. In 2005, the club successfully sued three streakers who disrupted their 2003 match against Hertha BSC to recoup the €20,000 they were fined by the German Football Association (DFB) for failing to maintain adequate security at their ground.

==Stadium==
The original Ostseestadion was built in 1954, with the participation of several hundred citizens of Rostock who helped for free. The first international match in the Ostseestadion of East Germany was on 26 September 1956. In 2001, the stadium was refurbished and modified to accommodate 30,000 spectators.

==Reserve team==
The club&#x27;s reserve team, FC Hansa Rostock II, has played as high as Regionalliga level, last playing in the Regionalliga Nord in 2009–10. The team currently plays in the tier five NOFV-Oberliga Nord. It first reached Oberliga level in 1992 and has won three league championships at this level, in 2000, 2005 and 2012.

In 1998, 2005 and 2006, it also won the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Cup, the local cup competition in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal through this, but never advanced past its first round.

<doc id="599982" wikidata="Q611878" url="?curid=599982" title="Kula Shaker">
<text>Kula Shaker are an English psychedelic rock band. Led by frontman Crispian Mills, the band came to prominence during the Post-Britpop era of the late 1990s. The band enjoyed commercial success in the UK between 1996 and 1999, notching up a number of Top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart, including &quot;Tattva&quot;, &quot;Hey Dude&quot;, &quot;Govinda&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Sound of Drums&quot;. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;K&quot;, reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. It was voted number 879 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000).

The band are known for their interest in traditional Indian music, culture and mysticism, with a number of their most famous songs, including &quot;Tattva&quot; and &quot;Govinda&quot;, featuring lyrics written in Sanskrit. The name Kula Shaker was itself inspired by Kulasekhara, an Indian king from the 9th century. In addition, many of the band&#x27;s songs feature traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar, tamboura and tabla, juxtaposed with guitar-heavy, Western rock instrumentation. Despite achieving commercial success, Kula Shaker were unpopular with some critics, with &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Simon Price describing them in 2014 as a &quot;joke band&quot;.

Kula Shaker disbanded in September 1999 but reformed in 2004 for sessions for the &quot;School of Braja&quot; compilation album. This led to plans for a full comeback, although the reformation was not widely publicised until the beginning of 2006. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Strangefolk&quot;, was issued in 2007 and their fourth, &quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot;, was released in 2010. The band returned with a mostly sold-out European tour and new album &quot;K 2.0&quot; in 2016 which was well received both by the media and the fans.

After taking an extended hiatus, the band released their sixth album, &quot;1st Congregational Church of Eternal Love and Free Hugs&quot; in June 2022 and their seventh album, &quot;Natural Magick&quot;, in 2024.

==Band history==
===Formation (1988–1995)===
The origin of Kula Shaker can be traced back to 1988 when Crispian Mills (son of actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting) met Alonza Bevan at Richmond upon Thames College in South-West London. The two went on to play together in a band named Objects of Desire, formed later that year. The band&#x27;s initial line-up consisted of Mills on lead guitar, Bevan on bass, Richard Cave on drums (until 1990) later Marcus French (aka Frog) on drums, Leigh Morris on rhythm guitar and Marcus Maclaine (then Hayley Mills&#x27; boyfriend) on lead vocals. In 1991, Paul Winterhart joined the band, replacing French on drums. During this period, Crispian and Alonza were also responsible for running the Mantra Shack, a psychedelic nightclub at the back of Richmond ice rink, and consequently, the Objects of Desire would often perform at the venue.

The Objects of Desire disbanded acrimoniously in March 1993, after which, Mills went on a spiritual pilgrimage, backpacking around India.. Upon returning to the UK he formed a new band named The Kays, with Bevan, Winterhart and Mills&#x27; cousin Saul Dismont on vocals. The band&#x27;s debut live performance was at the 1993 Glastonbury Festival. Within a year, Dismont had left the band, only to be replaced by organist Jay Darlington, who had previously been a member of several mod revival bands. After two years of touring and recording, The Kays elected to change their name and musical direction.

In May 1995, Mills suggested that the band take the name Kula Shaker, in honour of one of the twelve Alvars (saints of south India), the ninth-century Indian emperor and holy man, King Kulashekhara. In Indian culture, the name Kulashekhara is thought to be lucky or auspicious, and this appealed to the struggling band. Mills also posited that Kula Shaker&#x27;s music should follow a more spiritual and mystical direction in future, in line with his own growing interest in the philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. This new emphasis on Indian mysticism and instrumentation, dovetailed with the Beatlesque, 1960s derived influences already present in the band&#x27;s music, to create a sound heavily indebted to 1960s psychedelia.

===Mainstream success (1995–1999)===
In September 1995 Kula Shaker were joint winners of the In The City contest (along with Placebo), which quickly resulted in a record contract with Columbia Records, who were eager to sign another band that had the multi-platinum, crossover appeal of Oasis. A debut single, &quot;Tattva (Lucky 13 Mix)&quot; (later re-recorded for their debut album) was released on CD and limited 7&quot; vinyl in January 1996, but it entered just outside the UK Top 75, at number 86. &quot;Tattva&quot; was followed quickly in April by the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Grateful When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, a slice of Jimi Hendrix-esque rock which was to become their debut UK Top 40 single (entering at No. 35). Music press and public alike finally began to take notice of the band, and this sudden exposure propelled the re-released (and re-recorded) &quot;Tattva&quot; to No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The band&#x27;s upward climb continued with their third single &quot;Hey Dude&quot;, a more traditional rock song which was only kept off the top spot by the Spice Girls when it was released in August.

September saw the release of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;K&quot;, which became the fastest selling debut album in Britain since Elastica&#x27;s debut the previous year. It was eventually certified 2× Platinum by the BPI in January 1997. The album went on to sell over 850,000 copies in the UK (double platinum), and a further 250,000 copies in the United States.

The fourth and final single from &quot;K&quot; was &quot;Govinda&quot;, which reached No. 7 in the UK charts in December of that year. &quot;Govinda&quot; was sung totally in Sanskrit, and mixed swirling guitars with traditional Indian music. Total sales for all the singles from &quot;K&quot; came to half a million.

At the start of 1997, the band received four nominations for BRIT Awards, and they subsequently won the award for &quot;British Breakthrough Act&quot; at the ceremony in February. In the same month they released what would turn out to be their biggest hit, a cover of &quot;Hush&quot; (originally written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal, and most famously performed by the British hard-rock band Deep Purple), which peaked at number 2. The song also proved successful in the U.S., where it was used on the soundtrack to the blockbuster movie &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and again in the trailer for the 2014 film &quot;&quot;. The song was also placed at No. 224 by Virgin Radio, in a poll for the 20th century&#x27;s greatest songs. In the wake of the single&#x27;s release, some ill-advised remarks on the traditional mystical properties of Swastikas by Crispian Mills was criticised by the British Press.

Despite the negative publicity, the band pressed on regardless with a set of live shows in the summer of that year, including T in the Park, Glastonbury and the V Festival. The focus during the latter part of 1997 moved to the US where both &quot;Tattva&quot; and &quot;Hey Dude&quot; received airplay exposure. &quot;Tattva&quot; became a minor No. 10 hit in the Modern Rock Tracks chart and &quot;Hey Dude&quot; peaked at No. 25. &quot;K&quot; itself peaked at No. 11 in the Heatseekers chart and crept to No. 200 in the Billboard charts. An EP, &quot;Summer Sun&quot;, was released in the U.S. for the band&#x27;s fans there. The six tracks on the EP were all B-sides to earlier UK singles.

After initial disagreements with management, Kula Shaker resurfaced with the UK-only single &quot;Sound of Drums&quot; in April 1998, peaking at number 3. A promised album in the summer of that year failed to materialise, and the momentum generated by the single was lost as a result. Fans would have to wait until February 1999 to hear any more new material from the forthcoming second album.

The second album &quot;Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts&quot; was partly recorded aboard the houseboat-studio Astoria. Brett Findlay joined the band as resident percussionist and remained with the band until their break-up at the end of 1999. The release of &quot;Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts&quot; was preceded by the single &quot;Mystical Machine Gun&quot; which failed to make as strong an impact on the charts as their previous singles, peaking at Number 14 and only remaining two weeks in the top 40. The album itself followed in March 1999 to mixed reviews, and only sold a mere 25,000 copies in its first week as it crawled in at Number 9 on the album chart, spending only 10 weeks in the UK Top 75. The album went Gold in the UK (over 100,000 copies sold). The third and final single from the album, &quot;Shower Your Love&quot; failed to reignite momentum, stalling at No. 14, even with it having more TV exposure on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Comments on the swastika===
Prior to the release of their second album, the band became the subject of controversy surrounding remarks that Mills had made in the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, regarding the swastika, calling it a &quot;brilliant image&quot; albeit in the context of its traditional Indian origins. &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; ran a front page article in April 1997 reprinting Mills&#x27; comments and alleging that the guitarist &quot;had dabbled with Nazism&quot;. The negative publicity surrounding the incident, along with overexposure in the British media, hurt the band&#x27;s sales. The &quot;Independent&quot; article also revealed that the &quot;Objects of Desire&quot; had used the motto &quot;England will rise again&quot;, and had performed at a 1993 conference at Wembley called &quot;Global Deception&quot; at which speakers included renowned conspiracy theorists Eustace Mullins and William Cooper.

Mills responded to the allegations by fax and his responses were incorporated in the article. Mills admitted having played at &quot;Global Deception&quot;, but claimed not to have fully understood the nature of the event. He indicated that he now felt that the swastika, which has origins outside Nazism and different meanings in different parts of the world, was hopelessly connected to Nazism in the West. He indicated that it was the outrage that his comments had sparked that had led him to this conclusion. He also offered an unequivocal condemnation of far-right-wing ideology.

Looking back in 2016, Mills said &quot;We thought we were smarter than we were ... that was the innocence of our youth ploughing into the adult world.&quot;

Mills&#x27; lyrics include themes of unity in diversity (&quot;Tattva&quot;), spiritual devotion (&quot;Govinda&quot;) and global peace (&quot;Great Hosannah&quot;).

===After the split (1999–2004)===
Mills went into the studio in 2000 to work on a solo album. Later that year, he toured with a group of musicians under the name Pi, first supporting Robbie Williams on his UK Arena dates, then for some smaller headline shows. A new album was scheduled for release in spring 2001 according to Mills&#x27; official website and the &quot;NME&quot;. However, his UK record label did not feel the material proposed for release was commercial enough, and so Mills negotiated an exit from his contract with them in 2001, continuing to record for the rest of 2001 without a UK record deal. He played at the Glastonbury Festival in 2001 with Suns of Arqa. At the start of 2002, he began working with Andy Nixon and Dan Mckinna, formerly of Straw, and the trio formed a group, The Jeevas. Mills ditched all his previously recorded material up to that point, though some tracks would later feature as Jeevas B-Sides. They released two albums, toured throughout 2002 and 2003, with some dates in mid-2004. Their records were released on their own Cowboy Musik label in the UK and mainland Europe, and by Sony in Japan. Some tentative work was done for their third album, but when it became apparent during 2005 that the reformation of Kula Shaker would be permanent, the band officially split up.

Bevan joined Johnny Marr and the Healers in 2000. As a side project, he formed the band Shep (which included Winterhart on drums). The band played a handful of gigs in 2001–2002 and released some excerpts of recorded music via the web but nothing further was heard of them after 2003. Winterhart joined the band , who split in 2001. He also drummed on an album by Aqualung as well as being part of Shep. Darlington joined Oasis in 2002 as a touring keyboardist (though not an official band member), and remained in that role until the band&#x27;s split in 2009.

In December 2002, Sony released a best of album, entitled &quot;Kollected – The Best of Kula Shaker&quot;. Mills compiled the track listing for the release and approved the sleevenotes. The compilation included the band&#x27;s final recorded track, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;, which was later featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 movie &quot;Stoned&quot;, starring Leo Gregory.

===Reformation and &quot;Strangefolk&quot; (2004–2008)===

Their first gig back together (as a three-piece) took place at the Wheatsheaf, Leighton Buzzard, England, on 21 December 2005. This was a &#x27;secret&#x27; gig and not promoted beforehand; however, blackboards outside the pub announced &quot;Kula Shaker tonight&quot; on the night of the show. Kula Shaker announced on 11 January 2006 that they had reformed permanently. During preparation for their comeback live dates, Harry Broadbent joined the band, playing keyboards. The band undertook a small UK tour in the Spring. The tour dates were split into two &#x27;legs&#x27;, with a pre-tour warm-up show in Milton Keynes. The band played to sell out audiences in smaller venues, playing a mix of new and old material. They also recorded a session for Scottish radio station Clyde1, and made an appearance on the Billy Sloan show on that station to coincide with this. 

The band released a four-song EP entitled &quot;Revenge of the King&quot; on iTunes in April, which was later released on a limited run of 1,000 ten-inch vinyls. Later still, the EP was released on CD in Japan with a bonus track (the 2006 radio session version of Govinda).

In Japan, the &quot;Freedom Lovin&#x27; People&quot; EP preceded the next album. It was released there on 23 May 2007. The lead track from this release was the album track &quot;Great Dictator (of the Free World)&quot; and a rough animatic-style video was used to promote the song on Japanese music stations. In the UK, the first single from the album was &quot;Second Sight&quot; released on 13 August 2007, reaching No. 101 on the UK Singles Chart.

The third album, &quot;Strangefolk&quot; (which was the working title of second album, &quot;Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts&quot;), was released in Japan on 27 June 2007 through Sony, in Europe on 20 August 2007 through the band&#x27;s own label, and on 19 February 2008 in North America through Cooking Vinyl. The album reached No. 32 in Japan and No. 69 in the UK.

===&quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot; and other albums (2008–)===
In 2008 the band was in the studio, working on &quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot;, but became locked in a legal dispute with their label which resulted in most of the work for the next album being frozen. In May 2009, work on the new album had recommenced. The album was released on 28 June 2010.

On 20 December 2021, the band released &quot;Kula Christmas Wrap Up&quot; digitally, featuring two cover songs: &quot;Snowflake&quot; by Bucky and &quot;Christmas Time (Is Here Again) by the Beatles. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;1st Congregational Church of Eternal Love and Free Hugs&quot;, was released on 10 June 2022 and was preceded by the single &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. Another single, &quot;Cherry Plum Tree (Farewell Beautiful Dreamer)&quot; was released on 29 July 2022, and on 4 November 2022 they released &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot;, a John Lennon cover.

In 2023, the band embarked on a world tour including stops in the UK, Japan, the U.S. and Canada and debuted new material from their upcoming seventh studio album.

On July 28, 2023, Kula Shaker released &quot;Waves&quot; as their new single and announced additional tour dates in Germany, Belgium and France. After initially postponing their tour dates from February and March 2023, Kula Shaker toured North America in September 2023.

Kula Shaker&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Natural Magick&quot;, was released on 2 February 2024 on all formats and major streaming services. The album contains 13 tracks and is the first since &quot;Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts&quot; to feature original keyboardist, Jay Darlington.

== Musical style and media response ==
Although Kula Shaker&#x27;s sound owes a lot to the classic rock bands of 1960s and 1970s, the songs often combine Eastern-influenced sonics (&quot;Govinda&quot;) with lyrical themes of a universal spirituality quest, employing ideas of soul and devotion from diverse traditions such as Hinduism (&quot;Tattva&quot;), to Christianity (&quot;Great Hosannah&quot;) and even Native American Indian (&quot;Infinite Sun&quot;).

Noel Gallagher was an early champion of the band, inviting them to support at Oasis&#x27; historic Knebworth concerts, but from the outset of their career, Kula Shaker polarised UK media opinion. This arguably stemmed from age-old British preconceptions about class and race. Not only were they white youngsters singing about Krishna in Sanskrit, they were seen as coming from privileged middle class backgrounds. Speaking in an interview in 2016, Mills says &quot;When I was in private schools, they called me &#x27;common&#x27;, and when I was in state schools they called me &#x27;posh&#x27;. It made me very cynical about all these labels.&quot; At the height of Britpop and &#x27;lad culture&#x27;, music publications like &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; often focused on the class angle and ridiculed the band&#x27;s fascination with Indian culture. Mills commented in 2016, &quot;The musical styles on &quot;K&quot; are mainstream now. [In 1996] people didn&#x27;t know how to understand it or where to place it, so all that was left to do was deride it.&quot;

<doc id="599983" wikidata="Q45613" url="?curid=599983" title="Paul Scholes">
<text>Paul Scholes (born 16 November 1974) is an English football pundit, coach, former player, and the co-owner of Salford City. He spent his entire professional playing career with Manchester United, for whom he scored over 150 goals in more than 700 appearances between 1993 and 2013. Scholes won 25 trophies, including 11 Premier League titles (more than any other English player), two FA Cups and two UEFA Champions League titles. He is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and one of the greatest midfielders of all time, renowned for his technical skills, accurate passing, intelligent movement, powerful shooting from long range and goal-scoring ability.

Scholes came through the Manchester United academy as one of Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings, a group of players recruited by the club under the management of Alex Ferguson. He made his full debut in the 1994–95 season. He went on to make 718 appearances for the club, the third-highest number of appearances by any player. He announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and was appointed as a coach at Manchester United. He returned to playing in January 2012, and played one more season for the club before retiring again in May 2013.

Scholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, gaining 66 caps and participating in the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships. He announced his retirement from international football in August 2004, citing his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.

Scholes&#x27; first managerial position was at Oldham Athletic, for 31 days in February and March 2019. In 2020, he had a short spell as interim manager of Salford City.

==Early life==
Paul Scholes was born on 16 November 1974 in Salford, Greater Manchester. He is of Irish and Northern Irish descent. On his mother&#x27;s side, his grandmother came from Ireland, while his grandfather was from Northern Ireland. The family moved to Langley, Greater Manchester, when he was 18 months old, where he lived on Bowness Road and Talkin Drive. He attended the St Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School in Langley. The first team he played for was Langley Furrow. Scholes also excelled at cricket. At age 14, he began training with Manchester United. He later joined as a trainee upon leaving the Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School in Middleton during the summer of 1991. In his final term at school, he was selected to represent Great Britain National Schools in football.

==Club career==
===1993–1999===
Scholes was a member of the Manchester United youth team that reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in the 1992–93 season, alongside Phil Neville. Scholes turned professional on 23 July 1993 but did not make his breakthrough into the senior squad until the 1994–95 season, when he made seventeen league appearances and scored five goals.

His debut came on 21 September 1994, where he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over Port Vale in the League Cup. His league debut came three days later against Ipswich Town at Portman Road, a game which United lost 3–2 and Scholes scored a consolation goal. He scored two league goals when he came on 10 December when United beat Queens Park Rangers 3–2 at Loftus Road. On 3 January 1995, he got onto the scoresheet at Old Trafford for the first time with the opener in a 2–0 league win over Coventry City. He scored once more that season, in a 3–2 away win over Coventry City on 1 May. Scholes came on as a substitute in the 1995 FA Cup final against Everton, which United lost 1–0.

In the 1995–96 season, after Mark Hughes moved to Chelsea, Scholes had more first-team opportunities, standing in for the suspended Eric Cantona as Andy Cole&#x27;s strike partner for the first two months of the season. Scholes scored 14 goals in all competitions as United became the first English team to win the double twice. He picked up another Premier League medal in the 1996–97 season.

After Roy Keane suffered a knee injury in late September 1997 and was ruled out for the rest of the season, Scholes was made a central midfielder in the 1997–98 season. United finished the season without a major trophy, only the second time in the 1990s that this happened.

In the 1998–99 season, Scholes was a key player in Manchester United&#x27;s Premier League title, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League treble success. He scored one of Manchester United&#x27;s two goals against Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He also scored an away goal against Inter Milan in the Champions League quarter-final. He came on as a substitute in the second leg of the semi-final against Juventus as Alex Ferguson opted for Nicky Butt in the starting line-up. He picked up a yellow card which ruled him out of the final victory over Bayern Munich through suspension.

===1999–2007===
During the 1999–2000 season, Scholes scored one of the finest goals of his career against Bradford City on 25 March 2000. David Beckham took a corner directly to Scholes, who was standing on the edge of the area, who volleyed it in over Dwight Yorke, who was forced to duck. A week later, Scholes scored the first hat-trick of his United career against West Ham United in a 7–1 victory that put United ten points clear.

During the 2001–02 transfer window, United completed the signing of Argentine international Juan Sebastián Verón. To accommodate Scholes and Verón, Ferguson persisted with the 4–4–1–1 formation, with Scholes playing at the withdrawn striker role behind Ruud van Nistelrooy, as Roy Keane and Verón played in central midfield. In European away fixtures, Scholes was often played in central midfield alongside Verón as Keane anchored.

Scholes netted a career-high 20 goals in all competitions in the 2002–03 season, including a hat-trick in a 6–2 win against Newcastle. a number that dipped to fourteen the next year. This was despite a career-best four FA Cup goals, in comparison to his total of five FA Cup goals scored in his first nine seasons.

Scholes scored the winning goal in the 2003–04 FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, and played in the final which United won 3–0 against Millwall, his last FA Cup medal. He also played in the 2005 FA Cup final, but saw his penalty kick saved by Jens Lehmann as they lost to Arsenal in a penalty shoot-out.

Scholes was ruled out for the second half of the 2005–06 season with blurred vision. The cause of this was initially uncertain, sparking fears that it could end his career. He overcame this problem through the beginning of the year and he appeared in United&#x27;s final game of the season against Charlton Athletic.

On 22 October 2006, in the 2–0 victory over Liverpool, Scholes became the ninth United player to play in 500 matches, joining Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes and Ryan Giggs. Scholes experienced one of his finest seasons in 2006–07, and was included in the PFA Team of the Year, and was shortlisted for the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year. One of his finest performances of the season came in a 4–1 win against Blackburn Rovers, where United were 1–0 down but Scholes &quot;got hold of the game by the scruff of the neck&quot; and scored the equalising goal. On 3 March 2007, in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool at Anfield, Scholes was dismissed for swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso; John O&#x27;Shea scored the winning goal in injury time. It marked his first league sending off since April 2005. A month later, he was sent off in the first leg of United&#x27;s Champions League quarter-final at Roma.

===2007–2011===
Scholes suffered knee ligament damage during a training session the night before United&#x27;s Champions League Group F match with Dynamo Kyiv on 23 October 2007, and was out of action until the end of January 2008. He returned as a substitute in United&#x27;s 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. On 23 April 2008, Scholes made his 100th Champions League appearance in a 0–0 draw away to Barcelona in the semi-final first leg, and scored the only goal from 25 yards in a 1–0 victory in the second leg that sent United into the final. During the final against Chelsea, he suffered an injury and received a yellow card after a clash with Claude Makélélé. He was substituted in the 87th minute and did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, which United won 6–5 after drawing 1–1 after extra time. In the 2008 UEFA Super Cup against Zenit Saint Petersburg, Scholes was sent off after he received a second yellow card for a deliberate handball.

Scholes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in September 2008. On 22 April 2009, he made his 600th appearance for United in a 2–0 win over Portsmouth.

On 16 February 2010, Scholes scored his third Champions League goal of the season against AC Milan in a 3–2 win, which was also United&#x27;s first away goal against Milan. This gave United their first away win over Milan and also made Scholes the first player to score against both Inter Milan and AC Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League. The goal against Milan was Scholes&#x27; 25th Champions League goal in total, and, with 25 goals to his name, Scholes is the highest goal-scoring central midfielder in Champions League history. 

On 6 March 2010, Scholes became the 19th player in Premier League history to score 100 goals, and also the third United player after Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney to do so, in the 2009–10 Premier League season, with the only goal in a 1–0 away win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 16 April 2010, Scholes signed a new one-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2010–11 season.

Scholes began the 2010–11 season strongly, displaying man of the match performances against Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield on 8 August and eight days later in the opening fixture of the new league campaign against Newcastle United as he assisted two goals in a 3–0 home victory. Scholes scored his 150th goal for United in a 2–2 away draw against Fulham on 22 August, and was also awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for August 2010. In April 2011, Scholes was sent off for a high challenge on Pablo Zabaleta in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, which United went on to lose 1–0.

On 28 May 2011, Scholes came on as a substitute during United&#x27;s 3–1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final. Three days later, he announced his retirement with immediate effect, and joined the club&#x27;s coaching staff. On 5 August, United held a testimonial match to honour his 17 years of service to the club. The match was played at Old Trafford against New York Cosmos. United won the match 6–0, with Scholes opening the scoring with a shot from 25 yards, in front of a sell out 74,731 crowd.

===2012–2013===
Having been training with United&#x27;s reserve team, Scholes&#x27; desire to play football returned and he approached Alex Ferguson and assistant manager Mike Phelan with a view to coming out of retirement, possibly for another club if they declined to have him back at United. However, the club had been going through an injury crisis in midfield, and, on 8 January 2012, Scholes made his comeback as a substitute in a 3–2 win over neighbours Manchester City in the 2011–12 FA Cup. 

Scholes made his first start in the next game against Bolton Wanderers, where he scored his first goal since returning in a 3–0 victory at Old Trafford, converting a Wayne Rooney pass. This meant he had scored at least one goal in every season in the Premier League since 1994–95. He scored his second goal since coming back in a 2–1 away win against Norwich City on 26 February, heading home a cross from Nani. On 8 April, he scored in a 2–0 win against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford, helping United to go eight points clear of rivals Manchester City in the Premier League.

On 30 May, Scholes signed a one-year extension with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until summer 2013. He marked his 700th appearance for Manchester United by scoring in a 4–0 win at home to Wigan Athletic on 15 September 2012. This goal meant that he had scored in his 19th consecutive Premier League season, a feat only surpassed by teammate Ryan Giggs, who holds the record of 21 consecutive seasons.

On 11 May 2013, Scholes announced that he would make his second and final retirement from football at the end of the season. Scholes made his 499th and final professional league appearance on 19 May 2013 against West Bromwich Albion as a substitute. During the game, Scholes earned his 97th Premier League yellow card, at the time the third most in the history of the Premier League behind Lee Bowyer (102) and Kevin Davies (101).

===2018===
In August 2018, Scholes briefly came out of retirement from football at the age of 43 and played a match for his son&#x27;s team, Royton Town of the Manchester Football League Premier Division, against Stockport Georgians. Royton lost the fixture 1–0. Scholes made two further appearances for Royton Town, once against Poulton in the Lancashire FA Amateur Shield, and in the reverse league fixture against Stockport Georgians.

==International career==
Scholes made four appearances for the England national under-18 team, scoring one goal, all of which came in 1993. He scored from a penalty kick on his debut for the team on 30 March 1993 in a 4–2 win over Denmark in a friendly at the Victoria Ground. He was part of the England team that won the 1993 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, which was hosted in England. Scholes played in three of England&#x27;s four matches at the tournament, including the final on 25 July in which England beat Turkey 1–0 at the City Ground.

Scholes made his debut for the England senior team on 24 May 1997 as a 63rd-minute substitute against South Africa in a 2–1 win at Old Trafford in a friendly. He scored his first goal for England on his full debut on his second appearance, in a 2–0 win over Italy on 4 June at the Stade de la Beaujoire in the 1997 Tournoi de France. He was included in the England squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. England were grouped with Colombia, Tunisia and Romania. During England&#x27;s first World Cup group match against Tunisia, Scholes sealed a 2–0 victory with a goal late in the game.

His international career continued after England&#x27;s elimination from the World Cup by Argentina after a penalty shoot-out in the first knock-out round. On 27 March 1999, Scholes managed a hat-trick for England in a game against Poland. In addition, Scholes scored both goals in England&#x27;s 2–0 win at Hampden Park over Scotland in the UEFA Euro 2000 play-off first leg, sealing a 2–1 aggregate win and qualification for the finals tournament. In a qualifier against Sweden that June, Scholes became the first and last England player to be sent off in an international match at the old Wembley Stadium.

With the turn of the century, Scholes became a prominent player in England&#x27;s midfield, becoming a first-choice selection for the 2002 World Cup. Immediately prior to Euro 2004, however, Scholes was played out of position on the left midfield to accommodate the pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in central midfield, starting on the left for the last five matches of his international career. Scholes announced his retirement from international football in August 2004, citing his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.

Following the departure of England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson in 2006, there was speculation regarding Scholes making himself available for international duty again under new manager Steve McClaren. In October 2006, McClaren said that he had personally asked Scholes twice to rejoin England, but Scholes declined. In May 2010, McClaren&#x27;s successor Fabio Capello approached Scholes about a return to international football in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, but Scholes again rejected the offer, saying he would prefer to spend time with his family. On 7 June 2010, Scholes stated that if Capello had given him more time and asked earlier, he would have probably taken the opportunity. On 27 July, Scholes expressed his disappointment in not taking the opportunity to play at another World Cup, saying he may have made a mistake.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Scholes was highly regarded for his technical skills, and renowned for his accurate passing, intelligent movement and powerful shooting from long range. Though he played mostly as a striker in his youth and early professional career, Scholes matured into a well-rounded, tenacious, and versatile playmaker capable of playing in any midfield position, often alternating between defensive, offensive, wide and playmaking roles, due to his stamina, vision, work-rate, and positional sense. Scholes was renowned for his late attacking runs and ability to combine with teammates, as well as an excellent capacity to read the game and control the tempo of play, which enabled him to function in a deep-seated creative role as well as in a box-to-box role in the centre of the pitch. He played in the centre for much of the earlier part of his career, while he was instead deployed in a deeper role in the later part of his career. Scholes possessed an extraordinary range of passing and frequently initiated dangerous attacking plays after winning back possession.

In an interview with &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;, Scholes admitted to not being blessed with notable pace or dribbling skills, and attributed his calmness and ability to retain possession under pressure to having a sharp brain, excellent awareness, and good link-up play. He was also used in a more advanced creative role on occasion, as a deep-lying forward behind an out-and-out striker. At international level, he was also occasionally used out of position on the left flank.

Scholes received criticism for his discipline, particularly regarding his tackling, which was questioned as frequently inept by multiple pundits, fans and Scholes himself. In addition, the potential for malicious intent in some of his tackles was raised, and it has been suggested that he escaped greater censure due to the admiration that many have for the rest of his game. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger criticised Scholes&#x27; tackling, stating, &quot;For me he was not a fair player. There&#x27;s a little bit of a darker side in him, sometimes, that I did not like. I respect him highly as a quality player but I did not like some things he did on the football pitch.&quot; Scholes said in an interview that he was not a bad tackler, but that, &quot;If someone got me early in the game, it was always in the back of my mind that I needed to get them back&quot;, and suggested that the bookings he received towards the end of his career were influenced by his reputation.

===Reception===
Many of Scholes&#x27; peers, including Ronaldinho, Andrés Iniesta, Luís Figo, Edgar Davids, Arjen Robben, Patrick Vieira, Juan Sebastián Verón, Deco and Xabi Alonso, have spoken about their admiration for his talent. Some of his former teammates, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Alan Shearer, have rated him as the best player they have played with. While his former managers, Glenn Hoddle and Sven-Göran Eriksson, have named him as the best or most talented player they coached.

In November 2004, when former Brazil midfielder and captain Sócrates was asked for his views on the English game he replied, &quot;...I think of Paul Scholes. He&#x27;s good enough to play for Brazil. I love to watch Scholes, to see him pass...&quot; Former England midfielder and Manchester United captain Sir Bobby Charlton commented, &quot;Paul is always so in control and pin-point accurate with his passing – a beautiful player to watch.&quot;

When former Real Madrid midfielder and France captain Zinedine Zidane was asked who was his toughest opponent, he replied, &quot;Scholes of Manchester. He is the complete midfielder. Scholes is undoubtedly the greatest midfielder of his generation.&quot; In 2009, Barcelona forward and France captain, and former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry said, &quot;Without any doubt the best player in the Premiership has to be Paul Scholes. He knows how to do everything, and he is the one who directs the way his team plays. On top of that, he has indestructible mental strength, and he is a genuine competitor.&quot;

Several former teammates including Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney have revealed his nickname in the Manchester United dressing room was &#x27;SatNav&#x27; (an abbreviation of Satellite Navigation) due to the accuracy of his long-range passing. 

In February 2011, Barcelona and Spain midfielder Xavi rated him as the best player in his position in the past two decades commenting, &quot;A role model. For me – and I really mean this – he&#x27;s the best central midfielder I&#x27;ve seen in the last 15, 20 years... He&#x27;s spectacular, he has it all: the last pass, goals, he&#x27;s strong, he doesn&#x27;t lose the ball, vision. If he&#x27;d been Spanish he might have been rated more highly.&quot; Former Juventus midfielder and Italy captain Andrea Pirlo selected him as the only English player in his dream Champions League XI and commented, &quot;You could see every pass, every decision, was based on his intelligence and understanding.&quot;

In February 2011, Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs hailed him Manchester United&#x27;s greatest ever player and commented, &quot;The way he can control the tempo of games, and his range of passing, are both incredible.&quot; Former Manchester United teammate Carlos Tevez described Scholes as the best passer whom he had ever played alongside, and former England and United striker Michael Owen remarked &quot;Nobody on this planet had a range of passing like Paul Scholes.&quot; Former Denmark goalkeeper and another former United teammate Peter Schmeichel commented, &quot;His reading of the game is unsurpassed.&quot;

In May 2008, Italy and former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi commented, &quot;he combines great talent and technical ability with mobility, determination and a superb shot. He is an all-round midfielder who possesses character and quality in abundance.&quot; In August 2010, BBC football pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen described him as &quot;one of the top three to five players to have ever played in the Premier League&quot;, and commented, &quot;His passing, movement and technique set examples to everyone.&quot; In May 2011, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola described him as &quot;the best midfielder of his generation&quot;. In August 2017, England manager and Scholes&#x27; former England teammate Gareth Southgate said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and [Wayne] Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high‑level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.&quot;

The former head of Manchester United&#x27;s youth team Eric Harrison commented, &quot;his positional sense is second to none and he knows what&#x27;s around him before he receives the ball. Paul has no great pace or power, but he makes up for that with his reading of the game, his awareness and his superb touch.&quot; Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him &quot;one of the greatest football brains Manchester United has ever had&quot;.

Many, including Scholes&#x27; national teammates, have said that he was one of the few English players capable of &quot;pulling the strings&quot; in midfield, controlling the tempo, reading and dictating the flow of the game, and distributing the play where England often have been criticized for being nervous on the ball and giving away possession.

==Football ownership and coaching career==
In 2014, it was announced that Scholes, along with fellow Manchester United legends Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, and Phil Neville, had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014–15 season. with plans to get the club to the Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of &#x27;92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim.

Having previously informally helped out Nicky Butt with the Manchester United under-19 team during the first half of the 2013–14 season, Scholes agreed to join the United first-team coaching staff on a temporary basis after the dismissal of David Moyes until the end of the season as a favour to friend and former teammate Ryan Giggs, following the latter&#x27;s appointment as interim player-manager on 23 April 2014.

In January 2015, Scholes and Phil Neville were caretaker managers of Salford for a 2–1 win over Kendal Town, between the dismissal of Phil Power and appointment of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley.

On 19 November 2017, Scholes and his old teammate, Ryan Giggs, were invited to join in training works for PVF Football Academy in Vietnam. With Ryan Giggs, who was chosen to be a development director, Scholes worked as a technical advisor.

On 11 February 2019, Scholes was appointed as manager of League Two club Oldham Athletic, having been cleared to take the position by the English Football League in light of his ownership of Salford City. On 14 March, Scholes resigned as manager, having won one of his seven games in charge, following interference from club owner Abdallah Lemsagam in first-team affairs.

On 12 October 2020, Scholes was appointed interim head coach of Salford City, following the departure of Graham Alexander. Scholes&#x27; first game in charge was a 1–0 defeat to Port Vale on 17 October, and he quickly ruled out taking the position on a permanent basis, citing the need for a more experienced manager. His first win came three days later with a 3–0 win against struggling Southend United. Scholes left the role on 4 November, following the permanent appointment of Richie Wellens to the post.

==Outside football==
===Media career===
In July 2014, Scholes became a pundit after signing a four-year deal with BT Sport. He would also be featuring on ITV&#x27;s coverage of Champions League and England internationals. Scholes previously made an appearance for Sky Sports as a pundit during the 2013–14 season. In August, he agreed to become a columnist for &quot;The Independent&quot;. Scholes has been praised for his passionate and no nonsense style of punditry.

===Endorsements===
Scholes featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series. He was on the cover for the international edition of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends for &quot;FIFA 17&quot;.

Scholes has endorsed sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

===University Academy 92===
Along with other United players who won the 1992 FA Youth Cup, Scholes has proposed a university in Greater Manchester, named University Academy 92, which would offer &quot;broader courses than traditional degrees&quot; and attract students who &quot;otherwise might not go on to higher education&quot;.

==Personal life==
Scholes is asthmatic, and suffered from Osgood–Schlatter disease (a knee condition that affects young athletes). He married his childhood sweetheart, Claire (née Froggatt), in Wrexham, Wales, in February 1999. They live in the village of Grasscroft in Greater Manchester, and have a daughter and two sons, the younger of whom has autism.

His off-field personality is said by some to be in stark contrast to the attitude of the stereotypical professional footballer. Roy Keane once highlighted that Scholes did not like the &quot;celebrity bullshit&quot; side of professional sports. With regard to his shunning of celebrity, and instead keeping to his intention to solely focus on doing his job (&quot;a professional footballer&quot;), Keane applauded Scholes after his retirement.

Scholes is known to enjoy betting on football. In June 2019, he was fined and warned over his future conduct by The Football Association (FA) after placing bets worth £26,159 on matches during his time as a director of Salford City. At a tribunal, he was found to have placed 140 bets over three and a half years, in contravention of the FA&#x27;s gambling rules. The FA fined Scholes £8,000 and asked him to contribute to the costs of the tribunal.

In an interview given before Euro 2004, Scholes described his ideal day as &quot;train in the morning, pick up my children from school, play with them, have tea, put them to bed and then watch a bit of TV&quot;.

<text>Tab (stylized as TaB) was a diet cola soft drink produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company, introduced in 1963 and discontinued in 2020. The company&#x27;s first diet drink, Tab was popular among some people throughout the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to Coca-Cola. Several variations were made, including a number of fruit-flavored, root beer, and ginger ale versions. Caffeine-free and clear variations were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Following studies in the early 1970s that linked saccharin, Tab&#x27;s main sweetener, with bladder cancer in rats, the United States Congress mandated warning labels on products containing the sweetener. The label requirement was later repealed when no plausibility was found for saccharin causing cancer in humans.

Tab&#x27;s popularity declined after the Coca-Cola company&#x27;s introduction of Diet Coke in 1982, though it remained the best-selling diet soda of that year. Coca-Cola continued to produce Tab in the United States, though in considerably smaller quantities than its more popular mainstay beverages, such as Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. According to the company, three million cases of Tab were made in 2011, and the beverage retained a cult following. In 2006, a Tab-branded energy drink was released, though it used a different formula from the standard cola. Coca-Cola discontinued Tab at the end of 2020.

==History==
Tab was created in 1963 by Coca-Cola after the successful sales and marketing of Diet Rite cola, owned by The Royal Crown Company. Previously, Diet Rite had been the only sugarless soda on the market. Tab was marketed to consumers who wanted to &quot;keep tabs&quot; on their weight.

Coca-Cola&#x27;s marketing research department used its IBM 1401 computer to generate a list of over 185,000 four-letter words with one vowel, adding names suggested by the company&#x27;s own staff; the list was stripped of any words deemed unpronounceable or too similar to existing trademarks. Of a final list of about twenty names, &quot;Tabb&quot; was chosen, influenced by the possible play on words, and shortened to &quot;Tab&quot; during development. Packaging designer Robert Sidney Dickens gave the name the capitalization pattern (&quot;TaB&quot;) used in the logo as well as creating a new bottle design for the soft drink.

For a time in the 1970s, Coca-Cola introduced six variety flavors of Tab (all of which were also sugar-free): Root Beer, Lemon-Lime, Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Strawberry, and Orange. A caffeine-free version of the original Tab flavor was introduced in 1983, alongside caffeine-free versions of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. Tab Clear, a caramel color-free version of Tab, was released in the United States in 1992, and subsequently in the United Kingdom and Japan. Tab Clear was discontinued in 1994.

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced Tab Energy. Though it shares the Tab branding, its formula is entirely different from that of the standard cola: it is sweetened with sucralose and has a sour, tart flavor.

===Saccharin safety debate===

Tab was reformulated several times. It was initially sweetened with a mixture of cyclamate and saccharin. After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ban on cyclamate in 1969, sodium saccharin was used as the beverage&#x27;s primary sweetener.

Studies on laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked high volumes of cyclamate and saccharin with the development of bladder cancer. As a result, the United States Congress mandated that further studies of saccharin be performed and required that all food containing saccharin bear a label warning that the sweetener had been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Despite this, Tab remained commercially successful and was the best-selling diet soda in 1982. In May 1984, Coca-Cola introduced Nutrasweet into the Tab formula, which alienated a significant portion of its market, and resulted in numerous consumer complaints regarding a perceived change in flavor.

In the absence of further evidence that saccharin caused cancer in humans, the substance was delisted in 2000 from the U.S. National Toxicology Program’s &quot;Report on Carcinogens&quot;; this led to the repealing of the warning label requirements for products containing saccharin. In December 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency removed saccharin from its list of hazardous substances.

==Availability==
Tab&#x27;s popularity began to decline in 1982 with the introduction of Diet Coke, although Tab retained something of a cult following in the United States, where customers purchased about 3 million cases in 2008. In 2011, the Coca-Cola Company reported that it produced approximately 3 million cases of Tab that year (in contrast to 885 million cases of Diet Coke). John Sicher, editor of &quot;Beverage Digest&quot;, commented in 2013: 

The product was also available in the United States Virgin Islands, the Southern African Customs Union, Norway (under the name Tab X-Tra), Canada, and Spain. 

Tab was available in Australia in the 1960s to 1980s. It was also sold in the United Kingdom from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s.

As part of their efforts to scale back on under-performing brands during the COVID-19 pandemic, in October 2020, Coca-Cola announced that it was discontinuing Tab, along with Coca-Cola Life, Delaware Punch, Diet Coke Feisty Cherry, Northern Neck Ginger Ale, Diet Northern Neck Ginger Ale, Odwalla, and Zico.

As of June 2021, Tab was still available at Coca-Cola stores in Atlanta, Orlando, Las Vegas and select Georgia locations.

In 2021, a group of Tab soda fans created the Save Tab Soda Committee.

<doc id="599986" wikidata="Q16962356" url="?curid=599986" title="Surprise Surprise (British TV series)">
<text>Surprise Surprise is a British light entertainment television programme for ITV that originally ran from 6 May 1984 to 26 December 2001 and hosted by Cilla Black, before returning from 21 October 2012 to 26 July 2015 with Holly Willoughby as host. On 17 June 2016, ITV announced that the show had been cancelled and would not return for 2017.

==Format==
The show was hosted by Cilla Black, and filmed in front of a studio audience. Its premise involved surprising members of the public with long-held wishes, setting up tricks to fool members of the public, making prank calls to people and reuniting guests with long-lost loved ones. Black was initially assisted by Christopher Biggins, but more famously for eight series by Bob Carolgees, famous for his glove puppetry act &quot;Spit the Dog&quot; (who previously appeared in the first series with a puppet ferrett), with Gordon Burns and Tessa Sanderson as roving reporters. Other featured acts were &quot;Cilla-grams,&quot; where Black would perform a song in a musical sketch relevant to the surprise a person was receiving (Example: a soldier was celebrating his 21st birthday, so the featuring song Black sang was &quot;Celebration&quot; by Kool &amp; The Gang).

The concept of the first series had been to film surprising and often unusual moments similar to those previously seen on &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;. This included a phone game that used viewers numbers and answering questions to try and form a winning line. Others included dancing and sporting events, and there were surprise reunions between family members. The popularity of this element of the show led executive producer Alan Boyd to change the format slightly so that all items in subsequent series involved surprises, rather than just being surprising. Although including many pre-filmed inserts, the first series and some early episodes of the second series were televised live in their entirety, but thereafter all episodes were pre-recorded.

From 1984 to 1988, the show was broadcast on Sunday evenings. From 1989 to 1992, the show moved to Fridays, before returning to the Sunday evening timeslot from 1993 to 1996. The final series of the original run in 1997 was broadcast on Friday evenings. Between 1998 and 2001, a one-off special episode was produced per year which aired on Mother&#x27;s Day from 1998 until 2000, and then at Christmas for 2001.

Over the years, the show had many special guests, some of whom appeared live, including Neil Diamond. Many variety acts were also featured on the show. The Spice Girls made their live debut on an episode in 1996.

===Revival===
In March 2012, it was announced that Holly Willoughby would host a revamped one-off episode of &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; for ITV, although a full series was later announced. The series had six hour-long episodes, with episode 1 airing on 21 October 2012. A second series followed this in 2013, a third in 2014 and a fourth in 2015.

In the show, Willoughby is joined by various locations reporters, these have included Marvin Humes, Mark Wright, Dave Berry, Peter Andre and Matt Johnson.

In one 2013 episode, Cilla Black made a surprise appearance on the show, singing a bit of the original theme as the show went to commercials (after Holly made the comment that the producers just wouldn&#x27;t let her sing the song).

===Final episodes===
The last series hosted by Holly Willoughby aired on ITV1 between 21 June 2015 and 26 July 2015.

ITV never made an official announcement confirming the series had been axed, but another series of the show has not been produced since 2015. Holly Willoughby called for the show to return for another series in 2017.

A previously unbroadcast episode of the show, hosted by Cilla Black that featured appearances from Irish boyband Westlife and singer Gareth Gates, which was originally produced in 2003 to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, was broadcast on ITV3 on 27 December 2015, four months after Black&#x27;s death. It wasn&#x27;t originally broadcast in 2003 due to Black&#x27;s departure from ITV that year.

==Theme songs==
Cilla Black introduced and closed each show by singing a theme song. The theme song from series one to eight was written by Kate Robbins and was often imitated by Black impersonators, beginning &quot;The more the world is changing, the more it stays the same...&quot;. The track was included on Black&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Surprisingly Cilla&quot;, and as a single through Towerbell Records. A new song was written from series nine in 1992, until the show&#x27;s conclusion in 2001, and the 2003 birthday special: &quot;Reaching out, holding hands, reliving memories... Life is full, full of surprises...And the nicest surprise in my life is you!&quot;

Around 2022-23, the song enjoyed a resurgence on the social media app TikTok.

The revived series updated its theme for 2013. This theme uses a remixed instrumental version of the chorus from Black&#x27;s original song &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot;.

<doc id="599988" wikidata="Q1622758" url="?curid=599988" title="Hujjat al-Islam">
<text>Hujjat al-Islam (, ) is an Islamic honorific title which translates in English to &quot;authority on Islam&quot; or &quot;proof of Islam&quot;.

The title &quot;Hujjat al-Islam&quot; is given to scholars with a high level of Islamic expertise and Islamic theology. Essentially, one who acquires this title is considered to be a respectful authority to Islam. The person with this title is also able to provide guidance and clarify topics on issues in the Islamic community. The term &quot;Hujjat al-Islam&quot; has different connotation to Sunnis and Shias.

== Hujjat al-Islam history ==
The title &quot;Hujjat al-Islam&quot; has a significant weight within the Islamic community. It offers historical significance, educational purposes and responsibilities, traditional continuation, and ethical guidance. This term, first established in the beginning of Islamic history, used to refer to figures who served as authorities, but now it is used to refer to the scholars who have Islamic knowledge. Individuals with this title are looked upon due to their deep knowledge of Islam. They could be responsible to teach Islamic classes, provide fatwas on legal and ethical issue, and they can interrupt Islamic teaching to others. Since the term was established, it held a valuable meaning within the Islamic community. It serves as a mark of honor and the term continues to be used to this day.

==Sunni Islam==
Its first recorded use was in a Sunni context, as a title for the 11th-century theologian al-Ghazali, due to his refutations of Hellenistic-influenced philosophers and Isma&#x27;ilis. It was later used as a term of respect for judges. Unlike in Shia Islam, Hujjat al-Islam is not as commonly used in the Sunni branch of Islam. Hujjat al-Islam serve more as teachers and guiders for their community, rather than a scholars. They may also be referred to as sheikhs or imams. They are also in charge of providing legal fatwas on religious information.

In the contemporary era, Egyptian &quot;Muhaddith&quot; &quot;Qadi&quot; Ahmad Shakir would confer the title &quot;Hujjat al-Islam&quot; to his teacher Muhammad Rashid Rida, upon his death. Deobandis granted this title to their leader Hanafi Maturidi theologian Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi for his debates with scholars of other religions and establishing Darul Uloom Deoband.

==Shia Islam==
The title of the &quot;Hujjat al-Islam&quot; is primarily popular in the Shia sect of Islam. In the Twelver Shia the title is awarded to scholars. Its earliest attested use, for a Shia personage, was during the Qajar period for Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 1843). It was originally applied as an honorific to leading scholars, but now the use indicates a status in the hierarchy of the learned below ayatollah.

Shias believe that Imam al-Mahdi was the twelfth Imam after Muhammad. They await his return in order to bring peace, unity, and guidance to their community. In Shia Islam, Hujjaj al-Islam are supposed to be an authority in order to guide them until the return of Imam al-Mahdi while preserving and continuing his teachings.

<doc id="599992" wikidata="Q1934278" url="?curid=599992" title="Robert Stigwood">
<text>Robert Colin Stigwood (16 April 1934 – 4 January 2016) was an Australian-born British-resident music entrepreneur, film producer, and impresario, best known for managing musicians such as Cream, Andy Gibb, and the Bee Gees; theatrical productions such as &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;; and film productions, including &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Robert Colin Stigwood was born on 16 April 1934 in Port Pirie, South Australia, the son of Gwendolyn (Burrows) and Gordon Stigwood.

He was educated at Sacred Heart College in Adelaide.

== Career ==
Stigwood hitchhiked to England in 1955. Among various early jobs, he worked at an institution for &quot;backward teenage boys&quot; in East Anglia. He worked briefly for Hector Ross at the New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth, Hampshire, before Ross left and the theatre closed.

=== 1960s pop management ===
He then met businessman Stephen Komlosy with whom he founded Robert Stigwood Associates Ltd, a small theatrical agency. He signed the actor John Leyton who soon became a teenage heart-throb in 1960 thanks to his appearance in a TV drama based on Biggles. Leyton had ambitions to sing, but was rejected by the major record companies; so Stigwood took him to the producer Joe Meek, who produced the singles &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot; and &quot;Girl on the Floor Above&quot; (October 1960). According to Tony Kent (Meek&#x27;s personal assistant at the time), although Meek was present at the recording for the latter, Stigwood assumed the role of dominant co-producer. Neither record made much impact, but Leyton&#x27;s third single, &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot;, produced by Meek and released in the UK on 28 July 1961, became a UK No.1 hit after Stigwood arranged for Leyton to perform it while playing the role of a fictional pop singer called Johnny St. Cyr, performing the song on the new Associated Television drama &quot;Harpers West One&quot;. Stigwood and Meek licensed the song to EMI Records, who had previously refused the opportunity to sign Leyton for themselves. This action put the men among the first independent record producers in the UK.

Other artists Stigwood signed to a management/recording deal included Mike Sarne, whose Komlosy-produced &quot;Come Outside&quot; charted Number One in 1962, and another Meek protégé, Mike Berry, who had scored a hit with the Geoff Goddard-penned &quot;Tribute To Buddy Holly&quot;.

One of the first musical acts he managed during this period was Junco Partners, a blues band which succeeded the Animals as the house band at Newcastle&#x27;s Club A Go Go. The band recorded for Columbia (the EMI label) and the French Barclay Records, with one of its first releases being co-produced by Stigwood and Vicki Wickham. The band included Charlie Harcourt, later of Lindisfarne and Cat Mother and the All Night News Boys.

Some of the acts he promoted in the mid-60s lost Stigwood money, including UK tours by Chuck Berry and P. J. Proby, and he came close to bankruptcy during this period.

In 1966 he began managing Cream, formed from two other bands that Stigwood had under contract – Eric Clapton from John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers, and Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker from the Graham Bond Organisation. They were stars by 1967, after a U.S. tour with The Who – for whom Stigwood was booking agent at the time. Stigwood moved his recording activities to Polydor Records, negotiating a much more advantageous deal than he had achieved with EMI.

=== Diversification ===
In 1967, at the suggestion of Beatles manager Brian Epstein, Robert Stigwood merged his agency with Epstein’s company NEMS. Within weeks of joining NEMS he started managing the Bee Gees, a vocal group who, after many years in Australia, had just returned to their native UK with hopes of a British career. Within months their first international single, &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot;, had become a major British and US hit reaching the top 20 in both markets, while &quot;Massachusetts&quot; reached number 1 in the UK and number 11 in the US, launching a string of Bee Gees hits that continued throughout the late 1960s and beyond. When Brian Epstein unexpectedly died in August 1967, Stigwood was seen as a potential successor to the NEMS organisation, but The Beatles refused to work with him. As a result he left NEMS, with a &quot;golden handshake&quot;, to form his own Robert Stigwood Organisation, bringing the Bee Gees with him.

Also during 1967, Stigwood purchased a controlling interest in Associated London Scripts, a writers&#x27; agency co-founded by Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes in 1954, in which many of Britain&#x27;s best comedy and television scriptwriters had been involved. Beryl Vertue from ALS was appointed as deputy chairman. Vertue was responsible for selling the formats to US producers of the TV series &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, which were adapted from the popular British TV shows &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;.

Stigwood produced the Broadway shows &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; for the West End stage in 1968 and 1970 respectively. In 1971, he produced the first theatrical production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; - initially in the USA - beginning a successful working relationship with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice which continued later in the decade with &quot;Evita&quot;.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===
Stigwood also moved into film and TV production in the early 1970s. By this time both of his major music acts were in the doldrums. The Bee Gees broke up briefly in 1970, and after reuniting they floundered for several years, reaching a self-acknowledged &quot;rock bottom&quot;. At this time the former chart-toppers were reduced to playing the working men&#x27;s club circuit in northern England.

Although Cream had disbanded in late 1968, lead guitarist Eric Clapton remained in a contract with RSO. His next project, the highly-touted super-band Blind Faith, which united Clapton and Ginger Baker with Steve Winwood (ex-Traffic) and Ric Grech (ex-Family) fizzled out after just one LP. In addition, the album he made as Derek &amp; the Dominos, &quot;Layla &amp; Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; (1970), though now recognised as a masterpiece, was met with a relatively poor critical and commercial reception, and was overshadowed by the tragic deaths of close friends Jimi Hendrix and Duane Allman. These tragedies, combined with the angst of his unrequited love for Patti Boyd, sent Clapton into a downward spiral of depression and drug abuse. Clapton eventually kicked his habit, and Stigwood took him back to Miami, where he recorded his successful comeback album &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; (1974), which included his US #1 hit version of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot The Sheriff&quot;.

Soon afterwards, Clapton suggested the Bee Gees might also benefit from a change of scene, and so they moved with their band into the same house on Ocean Boulevard to record their album &quot;Main Course&quot;. Stigwood urged them to change their sound from the ballads which had made them famous, and they began to move towards the disco sound that would bring them their greatest success, starting with &quot;Jive Talking&quot; - a US &quot;Billboard&quot; #1 hit in 1975. The records were released on Stigwood&#x27;s own label, RSO Records, which he founded in 1973.

Stigwood expanded into film production with success. His first feature film was a hit screen adaptation of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), made in association with its director, Norman Jewison. He followed this with the film version of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975), which became one of the most successful films at the box office during its year of release. In 1975, RSO collaborated with Bob Banner Associates to produce a stunt game show, &quot;Almost Anything Goes&quot;. The program, which aired on the ABC network in the US, featured three teams of players from small towns in a competition where the emphasis was on good will. The show lasted four seasons.

Stigwood signed actor John Travolta to a million dollar three-picture contract in 1976. Many in the film industry were reportedly sceptical, because Travolta was at that time known as a TV actor; but RSO Films&#x27; next production, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, made him a leading movie star. The film had an unlikely source - a supposedly factual magazine article which Stigwood had licensed. The double-LP soundtrack, written by and featuring the Bee Gees, became the biggest selling soundtrack album ever released. Stigwood followed this with a hugely successful film adaptation of the stage rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll musical &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), which co-starred Travolta and Australian singer Olivia Newton-John. Stigwood insisted that additional songs be added to the soundtrack, including the theme tune penned by Barry Gibb and songs by fellow Australian songwriter-producer John Farrar. Gibb and Stigwood&#x27;s production partner Allan Carr convinced Stigwood to bring Frankie Valli on to sing the title track, though Valli distrusted Stigwood for the amount of control he exercised over bands under his tutelage and declined to do any further records for him.

Not all of Stigwood&#x27;s films were popular. The third film of his Travolta deal, &quot;Moment by Moment&quot;, which co-starred Lily Tomlin, was panned by critics and is credited with turning Travolta into &#x27;box office poison&#x27;. Also in 1978, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was another critical flop.

But of the 19 singles to hit the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1978, eight were from RSO. On the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for 25 March 1978, five songs written by the Gibbs were in the US top 10 at the same time: &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;, &quot;Emotion&quot; and &quot;Love Is Thicker Than Water&quot;. The Bee Gees enjoyed a run of six consecutive number one singles which continued into 1979. RSO records also had success with soundtracks for &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; before Stigwood sold the label to Polygram.

It was during this period that writer Steven Gaines , in his &quot;New York Sunday News&quot; column &quot;Top of the Pop&quot;, coined the phrase &quot;velvet mafia&quot; to refer to the Robert Stigwood Organization — the term soon began to be used to describe the influential gay crowd who supposedly ran Hollywood and the fashion industry.

Stigwood set up Associated R&amp;R Films with Rupert Murdoch in 1980, which produced Peter Weir&#x27;s well-received &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981), but no further films.

Other notable films produced by Stigwood include &quot;Times Square&quot; (1980); &quot;The Fan&quot; (1981); &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982); &quot;Staying Alive&quot; (1983); the 1997 Golden Globe Awards&#x27; Best Film winner, &quot;Evita&quot;, starring Madonna.

=== Later years, death and legacy ===
Stigwood remained active during his later years, primarily in musical theatre, taking a role in stage revivals of &quot;Grease&quot; and a theatrical adaptation of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. In 2005, he sold the Barton Manor estate on the Isle of Wight, which had been his home for many years.

Stigwood was gay.

Stigwood died in London on 4 January 2016, aged 81.

On his death, one obituary judged that he had been for a time the most powerful tycoon in the entertainment industry: &quot;Stigwood owned the record label that issued his artists&#x27; albums and film soundtracks, and he also controlled publishing rights – not since Hollywood&#x27;s golden days had so much power and wealth been concentrated in the hands of one mogul.&quot;

The Robert Stigwood Fellowship Program was established in 2014 by the Music Development Office in Adelaide, to provide mentorship and professional development to local musicians and entrepreneurs in the music industry.

<doc id="599996" wikidata="Q3028308" url="?curid=599996" title="Finian's Rainbow">
<text>Finian&#x27;s Rainbow is a musical with a book by E. Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy, lyrics by Harburg, and music by Burton Lane, produced by Lee Sabinson. The original 1947 Broadway production ran for 725 performances, while a film version was released in 1968 and several revivals have followed.

An elderly Irishman, Finian McLonergan, moves to the southern United States with his daughter Sharon, to bury a stolen pot of gold near Fort Knox, in the mistaken belief that it will make him prosperous, as he imagines that the gold which he thinks has been buried at Fort Knox has made America prosperous. Og, a leprechaun, follows them, desperate to recover his treasure before the loss of it turns him permanently human. Complications arise when a bigoted and corrupt U.S. senator gets involved, and when wishes are made inadvertently over the hidden crock. The Irish-tinged music score includes gospel and R&amp;B influences.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
The play opens in Rainbow Valley, Missitucky (a fictitious blend of Mississippi and Kentucky), near Fort Knox, home of a mixture of Black and White tobacco sharecroppers. The local sheriff and Buzz Collins, front man for local senator Billboard Rawkins, demand the locals pay their taxes or else have their land auctioned off. The sharecroppers want to wait for Woody Mahoney, their union leader. Woody&#x27;s mute sister Susan the Silent communicates through dancing that Woody will bring the money, while a boy named Henry translates her dance for Collins and the sheriff. The sheriff begins the auction, but the sharecroppers refuse to listen and drag him and Collins off to meet Woody (&quot;This Time of Year&quot;).
As they leave, an elderly Irishman called Finian McLonergan arrives with his daughter Sharon. They have come looking for Rainbow Valley, but Sharon misses their home in Ireland (&quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra&quot;). Finian explains to Sharon that American millionaires convert their wealth into gold and bury it near Fort Knox. He concludes it is the soil in and around Fort Knox that makes the US rich, and reveals that he has a crock of gold stolen from a leprechaun, which he intends to bury. Woody and the sharecroppers reenter, and when Woody doesn&#x27;t have enough money to pay the interest on the taxes, Finian pays the rest. Finian and Sharon are welcomed by the sharecroppers. Sharon explains her father&#x27;s philosophy of following one&#x27;s dream (&quot;Look to the Rainbow&quot;).

That night, Finian buries the gold and marks the spot, only to be met by Og, the leprechaun he stole from. Without his gold, Og is slowly becoming mortal, and needs it back. Sharon and Woody come looking for Finian, but are soon distracted by the moonlight and each other (&quot;Old Devil Moon&quot;).

Senator Rawkins is buying up land to fight progressive developers. He is not upset with losing Rainbow Valley until two geologists arrive to tell him gold has been detected in it. He vows to drive Finian and the sharecroppers off.

The next morning, Og meets Sharon and shyly confesses his feelings for her (&quot;Something Sort of Grandish&quot;). Sharon is in love with Woody, however, and Finian slyly prevents Woody from leaving for New York by making him suspect that another man is pursuing Sharon. The sharecroppers celebrate the unofficial betrothal of Sharon and Woody (&quot;If This Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;). Og arrives and tells Finian he loves Sharon. He also warns Finian not to make wishes near the gold - after three wishes, the gold will vanish forever. Og enlists the local children to help find his gold, promising to get them anything from a magical catalogue (&quot;Something Sort of Grandish [Reprise]&quot;).

As the sharecroppers sort the tobacco leaves, Maude, one of their leaders, explains the general unfairness of life to them (&quot;Necessity&quot;). Senator Rawkins arrives informing Finian and the sharecroppers that, by living with black people, they are breaking the law and must leave. Outraged at the Senator&#x27;s bigotry, Sharon tells him &#x27;I wish to God you were black!&#x27; while unknowingly standing over the gold. The Senator is transformed into a black man and chased off the property by the Sheriff, who is unaware of the transformation. Woody brings news to Rainbow Valley that there is gold on their land, and the Shears-Robust shipping company has offered them all a free charge account. Insisting that credit is better than wealth, Woody and Finian tell them to use their new free credit rather than dig the gold. The group celebrates &quot;That Great Come-and-get-it Day&quot;.

===Act II===

The sharecroppers begin unpacking extravagant gifts to themselves from their new accounts. Sharon and Finian celebrate the end of class-distinction that comes with wealth (&quot;When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich&quot;). Shears and Robust show up wondering when the gold will be discovered that will pay for the credit. Woody and Finian explain that there is no need to dig the gold up, since the news has led to massive investment in their tobacco label. Buzz and the Sheriff, however, accuse Sharon of using witchcraft to turn the Senator black. Woody orders them off. He and Sharon agree to marry (&quot;Old Devil Moon [Reprise]&quot;). Susan the Silent watches them, and dances by herself, and discovers the hidden gold (&quot;Dance of the Hidden Crock&quot;). She takes the gold for herself and hides it.

Meanwhile, the still-black Senator Rawkins is hiding in the woods. He meets Og and explains what happened to him. Og decides what the Senator needs is a new inside rather than a new outside. He uses his own magic to make the Senator a nicer person (&quot;Fiddle Faddle&quot;). In his new persona, Rawkins falls in with a group of black gospel singers looking for a fourth man (&quot;The Begat&quot;); by chance, they are all going to sing at Woody and Sharon&#x27;s wedding. The wedding is interrupted by Buzz and the Sheriff, who have come to arrest her for witchcraft. The Senator tries to defend Woody and Sharon, but as a black man he lacks any authority over the Sheriff. Finian steps in, promising Sharon can change the Senator back. He dismisses everyone, intending to use the crock to undo her wish, but finds the crock gone.

Og, now almost human, looks for Sharon to tell her his feelings. He finds Susan instead, but realizes he is also attracted to her. He wonders if all human love is so fickle (&quot;When I&#x27;m Not Near the Girl I Love&quot;). Finian finds them and tells them Sharon is in danger. When Og reveals he doesn&#x27;t have the gold, Finian runs off in despair. Susan knows where the gold is, but can&#x27;t speak. Frustrated, Og wishes she could talk, not knowing the gold is under his feet. Susan speaks, and tells him she loves him. Og realizes there is only one wish left, and if he uses it to save Sharon, he cannot be a leprechaun again. He is unsure what to do until Susan kisses him. Deciding being human isn&#x27;t so bad, Og wishes the Senator white again.

The Senator promises to be a better representative to the people, and the sharecroppers welcome Og and the now-verbal Susan (&quot;If This Isn&#x27;t Love [Reprise]&quot;). Finian, however, has lost the crock and his hope of getting rich. Seeing that Sharon and Og have found their dreams, he goes off again in search of his own rainbow, saying &#x27;Maybe there&#x27;s no pot of gold at the end of it, but there&#x27;s a beautiful new world under it.&#x27; The cast tells him goodbye, promising to see him in Glocca Morra (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Production history==
===Original productions in New York and London===
The original Broadway production opened on January 10, 1947, at the 46th Street Theatre, where it ran for 725 performances. It was directed by Bretaigne Windust, choreographed by Michael Kidd, with orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett and Don Walker. The cast included Ella Logan as Sharon, Donald Richards as Woody, Albert Sharpe as Finian, with the Lyn Murray Singers. David Wayne won both the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical (the first one ever given) and the Theatre World Award for his performance as Og. The show also received Tonys for Best Conductor and musical director (Milton Rosenstock) and Best Choreography.

A London production opened at the Palace Theatre on October 21, 1947, running for only 55 performances.

===Revivals from 1955 to 2004===
&quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was revived three times on Broadway by the New York City Center Light Opera Company. The brief 1955 production, directed by William Hammerstein and choreographed by Onna White, starred Helen Gallagher, Merv Griffin, and Will Mahoney, who was nominated for a Tony as Best Featured Actor in a Musical at the 10th Tony Awards. In 1960, Herbert Ross directed and choreographed a cast that included Jeannie Carson, Bobby Howes, Howard Morris, Sorrell Booke, and Robert Guillaume. A third revival was staged by the company in 1967. Major revivals of the musical were rare until the 2009 Broadway revival, as the musical&#x27;s criticisms of bigotry against Black people in the American South had become dated, having been written before the modern Civil Rights movement and referring to forgotten political figures. However, in 2004 the Irish Repertory Theatre staged a well-received off-Broadway production starring Melissa Errico, Jonathan Freeman, and Malcolm Gets.

===Film adaptations===
In 1954, an animated film adaptation began production, directed by John Hubley. The crew included Art Babbit, Bill Tytla and Paul Julian. Among the cast were Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Louis Armstrong, Barry Fitzgerald, Jim Backus and David Burns plus David Wayne and Ella Logan from the original Broadway production. The era&#x27;s McCarthyism caused financing to be withdrawn due to Hubley and Harburg&#x27;s refusal to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Pre-production artwork, sketches from the storyboard, character designs, the script and some of the soundtrack recording have been recovered. Examples of the art and designs were published in the March/April 1993 issue of &quot;Print&quot; to illustrate an article by animation historian John Canemaker about the backstory of the project.

A 1968 film version with Fred Astaire, Tommy Steele, Petula Clark and Don Francks was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

===2009 Encores! Concert and Broadway revival===
New York&#x27;s City Center Encores! series performed a concert version of the musical from March 26, 2009, through March 29. Directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, it starred Jim Norton and Kate Baldwin as Finian and Sharon, with Cheyenne Jackson as Woody, Grammy nominated Blues artist Guy Davis as the blind harmonica-playing share cropper, and Jeremy Bobb as Og, the leprechaun.

A fully staged Broadway revival opened at the St. James Theatre on October 29, 2009, with most of the Encores! cast and director-choreographer Carlyle returning. Notable replacements to the cast were Christopher Fitzgerald as Og the leprechaun, David Schramm as Senator Rawkins and Chuck Cooper as Rawkins transformed into a black man. Ernest Harburg, Yip Harburg&#x27;s son and president of the Harburg Foundation, said &quot;The satire of our economic system is particularly relevant right now [2009], given the nation’s deep financial woes.&quot;

The producers closed the show on January 17, 2010, stating that the &quot;economic realities of Broadway today&quot; did not allow them to play for as long as they had hoped. The production sold approximately two-thirds of its seats for the 15-week run. Garth Drabinsky offered to try to rescue the revival and secure Canadian tour commitments, but the producers rejected his proposal.

The show was nominated for 2010 Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Musical, Best Actress in a Musical (Baldwin) and Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Fitzgerald) at the 64th Tony Awards.

===2014 London Fringe and Off-West End Revival===
A fully staged London revival opened at the Union Theatre on February 12 – March 15, 2014. This production was directed by Phil Willmott and musically directed by Richard Baker, with choreography by Thomas Michael Voss, and starred James Horne as Finian, Christina Bennington as Sharon, Joseph Peters as Woody, Raymond Walsh as Og and Anne Odeke as Sister Anne and Rawkin&#x27;s maid. The production later moved to the Charing Cross Theatre between April 2 and May 10 with the majority of the same cast and crew.

===2016 Off-Broadway Revival===
A fully staged revival, adapted and directed by Charlotte Moore, ran at the Irish Repertory Theatre in New York City from October 26, 2016, until January 29, 2017. The cast included Ken Jennings as Finian, Melissa Errico as Sharon, Ryan Silverman as Woody, Mark Evans as Og, Lyrica Woodruff as Susan and Dewey Caddell as Senator Rawkins.

==Recording==
An original cast recording released as a six-disc 78 rpm set by Columbia Records was the label&#x27;s first recording of a Broadway musical. The label used the album to introduce its new LP format in June 1948. In 1988, the album was released on CD, and in 2000, a second CD version appeared that was remastered from the original acetates and restored some material originally recorded but cut from the show, including three bonus tracks in which Harburg discusses the writing of and sings &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m Not Near the Girl I Love,&quot; as well as singing &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By,&quot; a song cut from the show.

A recording of the original cast of the 1960 Broadway production, starring Jeannie Carson, Howard Morris, Biff McGuire, Carol Brice, Sorrell Booke and Bobby Howes was released on RCA Victor LSO-1057.

The 1963 Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre, a project of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise Records, included a recording of the musical&#x27;s songs by a variety of performers, though not in cast recording style.

In 1968 bandleader Stan Kenton released &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; featuring big band interpretations of tunes from the show.

A cast recording of the 2009 revival was recorded on December 7 by PS Classics and released on February 2, 2010.

<text>Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is a form of epilepsy in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli that form patterns in time or space, such as flashing lights, bold, regular patterns, or regular moving patterns.
PSE affects approximately one in 4,000 people (5% of those with epilepsy).

== Signs and symptoms ==
People with PSE experience epileptiform seizures upon exposure to certain visual stimuli. The exact nature of the stimulus or stimuli that triggers the seizures varies from one patient to another, as does the nature and severity of the resulting seizures (ranging from brief absence seizures to full tonic–clonic seizures). Many PSE patients experience an &quot;aura&quot; or feel odd sensations before the seizure occurs, and this can serve as a warning to a patient to move away from the trigger stimulus.

The visual trigger for a seizure is generally cyclic, forming a regular pattern in time or space. Flashing lights (such as strobe lights) or rapidly changing or alternating images (as in clubs, around emergency vehicles, near overhead fans, in action movies or television programs, etc.) are examples of patterns in time that can trigger seizures, and these are the most common triggers. Static spatial patterns such as stripes and squares may trigger seizures as well, even if they do not move. In some cases, the trigger must be both spatially and temporally cyclic, such as a certain moving pattern of bars.

Several characteristics are common in the trigger stimuli of many people with PSE. The patterns are usually high in luminance contrast (bright flashes of light alternating with darkness, or white bars against a black background). Contrasts in colour alone (without changes in luminance) are rarely triggers for PSE. Some patients are more affected by patterns of certain colours than by patterns of other colours. The exact spacing of a pattern in time or space is important and varies from one individual to another: a patient may readily experience seizures when exposed to lights that flash seven times per second, but may be unaffected by lights that flash twice per second or twenty times per second. Stimuli that fill the entire visual field are more likely to cause seizures than those that appear in only a portion of the visual field. Stimuli perceived with both eyes are usually much more likely to cause seizures than stimuli seen with one eye only (which is why covering one eye may allow patients to avoid seizures when presented with visual challenges). Some patients are more sensitive with their eyes closed; others are more sensitive with their eyes open.

Sensitivity is increased by alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, illness, and other forms of stress.

=== Television ===
Television has traditionally been the most common source of seizures in PSE. For people with PSE, it is especially hazardous to view television in a dark room, at close range, or when the television is out of adjustment and is showing a rapidly flickering image (as when the horizontal hold is incorrectly adjusted on analog television sets). Modern digital television sets that cannot be maladjusted in this way and which refresh the image on the screen at very high speed present less of a risk than older, analogue television sets.

Some people with PSE, especially children, may exhibit an uncontrollable fascination with television images that trigger seizures, to such an extent that it may be necessary to physically keep them away from television sets. Some people (particularly those with cognitive impairments, although most people with PSE have no such impairments) self-induce seizures by waving their fingers in front of their eyes in front of bright light or by other means.

UK television broadcasters require all screen content to pass an Automated PSE and QC test. Previously, the Harding FPA Test was used to assess content, however this has been replaced by software such as BATON or Vidchecker. Ofcom regularly updates their definition of a flashing sequence. This is an objective standard of assessment of potential to trigger seizures in the susceptible population. This test is not currently required internationally. An automated file-QC system like BATON implements algorithms to detect PSE levels based on the restrictions described in ITU-R BT.1702, Ofcom, and NAB-J guidelines. The recent versions of BATON support Ofcom, NAB-J, ITU-T BT. 1702 (2005 and ITU-R BT. 1702 (2018), there are plans to support ITU BT.1702-2 (10/2019) as well in the upcoming release.

=== Fluorescent lighting ===
When functioning correctly, mains-powered fluorescent lighting has a flicker rate sufficiently high (twice the mains frequency, typically 100 Hz or 120 Hz) to reduce the occurrence of problems. However, a faulty fluorescent lamp can flicker at a much lower rate and trigger seizures. Newer high-efficiency compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) with electronic ballast circuits operate at much higher frequencies (10–20 kHz) not normally perceivable by the human eye, though defective lights can still cause problems.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis may be made by noting the correlation between exposure to specific visual stimuli and seizure activity. More precise investigation can be carried out by combining an EEG with a device producing intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). The IPS device produces specific types of stimuli that can be controlled and adjusted with precision. The testing physician adjusts the IPS device and looks for characteristic anomalies in the EEG, such as photoparoxysmal response (PPR), that are consistent with PSE and/or may herald the onset of seizure activity. The testing is halted before a seizure actually occurs.

Sometimes diagnostic indicators consistent with PSE can be found through provocative testing with IPS, and yet no seizures may ever occur in real-life situations. Many people will show PSE-like abnormalities in brain activity with sufficiently aggressive stimulation, but they never experience seizures and are not considered to have PSE.

== Treatment and prognosis ==
No cure is available for PSE, although the sensitivity of some people may diminish over time. Medical treatment is available to reduce sensitivity, with sodium valproate being commonly prescribed. Patients can also learn to avoid situations in which they might be exposed to stimuli that trigger seizures and/or take steps to diminish their sensitivity (as by covering one eye) if they are unavoidably exposed. These actions together can reduce the risk of seizures to almost zero for many PSE patients.

== Epidemiology ==
PSE affects approximately one in 4,000 people, or 5% of individuals with epilepsy. It is more common in women and people who are younger.

== Society and culture ==

=== Law ===
A law requiring PSE warnings be displayed on packages and stores was proposed by the State of New York.

The Online Safety Act 2023 makes it a criminal offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliberately send or show flashing images to people with the goal of causing harming to those with photosensitive epilepsy.

=== Video games ===
The first case of epileptiform seizures related to a video game was reported in 1981. Since then, &quot;many cases of seizures triggered by video games were reported, not only in photosensitive, but also in nonphotosensitive children and adolescents with epilepsy... Specific preventive measures concerning the physical characteristics of images included in commercially available video games (flash rate, choice of colours, patterns, and contrast) can lead in the future to a clear decrease of this problem.&quot; Risks can be reduced through measures such as keeping a safe distance away from the screen (at least 2 meters).

While computer displays in general present very little risk of producing seizures in PSE patients (much less risk than that presented by television sets), video games with rapidly changing images or highly regular patterns can produce seizures, and video games have increased in importance as triggers as they have become more common. Some people with no prior history of PSE may first experience a seizure while playing a video game. Often the sensitivity is very specific, &quot;e.g.,&quot; it may be a specific scene in a specific game that causes seizures, and not any other scenes. Despite this, there are questions on the dangers of this, and calls for testing all video games for causing PSE.

=== Web design ===
As with video games, rapidly changing images or highly regular patterns such as flashing banner ads or irregular fonts can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Two sets of guidelines exist to help web designers produce content that is safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy:

* The World Wide Web Consortium - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.0, produced in 2008, specifies that content should not flash more than three times in any one-second period. However, it does allow flashing above this rate if it is below the &quot;general and red flashing thresholds&quot;, which means if the effect is small or low-contrast enough it is acceptable.
* In the United States, websites provided by federal agencies are governed by section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Act says that pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and less than 55 Hz.

== Public incidents ==
Photosensitive epilepsy was again brought to public attention in December 1997 when the &quot;Pokémon&quot; episode &quot;Dennō Senshi Porygon&quot; (&quot;Cyber Soldier Porygon&quot;) was broadcast in Japan, showing a sequence of flickering images that triggered seizures simultaneously in hundreds of susceptible viewers (although 12,000 children reported symptoms which may be attributable to mass hysteria).

In March 1997, the 25th episode of an anime series called &quot;YAT Anshin! Uchū Ryokō&quot; caused a similar incident, when a reported four children were taken to hospitals by ambulances after viewing a scene with red and white flashing colours.

In March 2008, the Anonymous group of hackers was claimed to be behind an attack on a forum for people with epilepsy. The Anonymous hackers in turn blamed the Church of Scientology for the attacks, saying they were falsified to hurt Anonymous&#x27; image. The attacks first consisted of GIF images flashing at high speeds that were hidden in discussion threads with innocuous-sounding titles. Later attacks redirected web browsers to a page with &quot;a more complex image designed to trigger seizures in both photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics.&quot; The technology website &quot;Wired News&quot; considered it to be &quot;possibly the first computer attack to inflict physical harm on the victims&quot;.

An animated segment of a film promoting the 2012 Summer Olympics was blamed for triggering seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. The charity Epilepsy Action received telephone calls from people who had seizures after watching the film on television and online. In response, the London 2012 Olympic Committee removed the offending segment from its website.

In December 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist Kurt Eichenwald, who has epilepsy, reportedly had a seizure after an internet troll intentionally sent him a flashing GIF via Twitter. Three months later, the user behind the GIF was arrested and charged with cyberstalking.

The 2018 Pixar film &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; contains scenes with flashing lights starting about an hour into the film, in which a villain called the Screenslaver hypnotizes other characters. After concerns over possible triggering of seizures due to this scene, theatres posted warnings for audiences with this condition.

&quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, a video game released in December 2020, contains a &quot;braindance&quot; sequence with red and white flashing lights which reportedly resembles the patterns produced by medical devices used to intentionally trigger seizures. Liana Ruppert, a journalist for &quot;Game Informer&quot; who has photosensitive epilepsy, experienced a grand mal seizure while reviewing the game days before its release. After criticism from epilepsy advocacy groups that the game&#x27;s disclaimers were insufficient, CD Projekt Red announced work on a fix and later patched the effect to be less likely seizure-inducing.

<doc id="599998" wikidata="Q305198" url="?curid=599998" title="Sayyid">
<text>Sayyid is an honorific title of Hasanid and Husaynid lineage, recognized as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and Ali&#x27;s sons Hasan and Husayn. The title may also refer to the descendants of the family of the Bani Hashim through the Prophet’s great-grandfather Hashim, and others including Hamza, Abbas, Abu Talib and Asad ibn Hashim.

== Etymology ==
A few Arabic language experts state that it has its roots in the word &quot;al-asad&quot; , meaning &quot;lion&quot;, probably because of the qualities of valor and leadership. The word is derived from the verb sāda, meaning to rule. The title seyyid/sayyid existed before Islam, however not in light of a specific descent, but as a meritocratic sign of respect.

Hans Wehr&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot; defines seyyid as a translation for master, chief, sovereign, or lord. It also denotes someone respected and of high status.

In the Arab world, &quot;sayyid&quot; is the equivalent of the English word &quot;liege lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;.

== Origin of the title ==
The foundation of the title Sayyid is unclear. In fact the title Sayyid as a unified reference for descendants of Muhammad did not exist, according to Morimoto Kazuo, until the Mongol conquests. This can be substantiated by historic records about Abdul Qadir Gilani and Bahauddin Naqshband, who did not refer to themselves with any title, despite their lineages to Muhammad. Sometimes the ruling community of a nation took this title to portray themselves as respected and honored, though they are not actually the descendants of Muhammad. This gives reasons to think that this title is founded later on. Morimoto refers to Mominov, who describes that the emergence of a community leader during the Mongol era (Ilkhanate) gave rise to the prominence of the title Sayyid. This leader is most probably the Sunni Shafiite scholar Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, who lived in this time, being known as a saint credited with the honorific titles &quot;Amir-e-Kabir&quot;(English: &quot;Grand Prince&quot;) and &quot;Ali-e-Saani&quot; (English: &quot;Second Ali&quot;). Hamadani&#x27;s religious legacy in Kashmir as well as his headquarter (Persian: &quot;Khanqah&quot;) the &quot;Khanqa-e-Mola&quot; became under the control of the Grand Sayyid Hazrat Ishaan. Hazrat Ishaan&#x27;s descendants are buried in Hamadani&#x27;s headquarters, on which occasion it is known as the &quot;Ziyarat Naqshband Sahab&quot; today.

However, in Sunni Islam as practiced in the Ottoman and Mughal Empire, a person descending from Muhammad (either maternally or paternally) can only claim the title of &quot;Sayyid&quot; meritocratically by passing audits, whereupon exclusive rights, like paying lesser taxes, will be granted. These are mostly based on the claimant&#x27;s demonstrated knowledge of the Quran and piousness (Arabic: &quot;Taqwa&quot;) under the assessment of a Naqib al-Ashraf, also known as a Mir in Persian-speaking countries. Notable examples of such a Naqib (plural: &quot;Nuqaba&quot;) or Mirs (plural: &quot;Miran&quot;), were Hazrat Ishaan in the Mughal Empire and his descendant Sayyid Mir Fazlullah Agha in Royal Afghanistan.
== Middle East ==
Men belonging to the &quot;Sayyid&quot; families or tribes in the Arab world used to wear white or ivory coloured daggers like jambiyas, khanjars or shibriyas to demarcate their nobility amongst other Arab men, although this custom has been restricted due to the local laws of the variously divided Arab countries.

=== Iraq ===
The &quot;Sayyid&quot; families in Iraq are so numerous that there are books written especially to list the families and connect their trees. Some of these families are: the Al-Talqani, Alyassiri, Al Aqeeqi, Al-Nasrullah, Al-Wahab, Al-Hashimi, Al-Barznji, Al-Quraishi, Al-Marashi, Al-Witry, Al-Obaidi, Al-Samarai, Al-Zaidi, Al-A&#x27;araji, Al-Baka, Al-Hasani, Al-Hussaini, Al-Shahristani, Al-Qazwini Al-Qadri, Tabatabaei, Al- Alawi, Al-Ghawalib (Al-Ghalibi), Al-Musawi, Al-Awadi (not to be confused with the Al-Awadhi Huwala family), Al-Gharawi, Al-Sabzewari, Al-Shubber, Al-Hayali, Al-Kamaludeen, Al-Asadi and many others.

=== Iran ===
&quot;Sayyids&quot; (in &quot;Seyyed&quot;) are found in vast numbers in Iran. The Chief of &quot;National Organization for Civil Registration&quot; of Iran declared that more than 6 millions of Iranians are &quot;Sayyid&quot;. The majority of &quot;Sayyids&quot; migrated to Iran from Arab lands predominantly in the 15th to 17th centuries during the Safavid era. The Safavids transformed the religious landscape of Iran by imposing Twelver Shiism on the populace. Since most of the population embraced Sunni Islam, and an educated version of Shiism was scarce in Iran at the time, Ismail imported a new group of Shia &quot;Ulama&quot; who predominantly were Sayyids from traditional Shiite centers of the Arabic-speaking lands, such as Jabal Amel (of southern Lebanon), Syria, Bahrain, and southern Iraq in order to create a state clergy. The Safavids offered them land and money in return for loyalty. These scholars taught Twelver Shiism, made it accessible to the population, and energetically encouraged conversion to Shiism.

During the reign of Shah Abbas the Great, the Safavids also imported to Iran more Arab Shias, predominantly &quot;Sayyids&quot;, built religious institutions for them, including many &quot;Madrasas&quot; (religious schools), and successfully persuaded them to participate in the government, which they had shunned in the past (following the Hidden imam doctrine).

Common &quot;Sayyid&quot; family surnames in Iran are Husseini, Mousavi, Kazemi, Razavi, Eshtehardian, Tabatabaei, Hashemi, Hassani, Jafari, Emami, Ahmadi, Zaidi, Imamzadeh, Sherazi, Kermani (kirmani), Shahidi, and Mahdavi.

=== Oman ===
In Oman, Sayyid is used solely as a royal title and not as a means of indicating descent from Muhammad. It is used by members of the ruling Al Said family who are not descended from Muhammad but instead from the Azd, a Qahtanite tribe. All male line descendants of Sultan Ahmad bin Said, the first ruler of Oman from the Al Said dynasty, are able to use the title of Sayyid or Sayyida. Male line descendants of Sultan Turki bin Said are also able to use the style of His/Her Highness. The Sayyid title in Oman is some times translated as Prince.

=== Yemen ===
In Yemen the &quot;Sayyids&quot; are more generally known as &quot;sadah&quot;; they are also referred to as &quot;Hashemites&quot;. In terms of religious practice they are Sunni, Shia, and Sufi. &quot;Sayyid&quot; families in Yemen include the Rassids, the Qasimids, the Mutawakkilites, the Hamideddins, some Al-Zaidi of Ma&#x27;rib, Sana&#x27;a, and Sa&#x27;dah, the Ba &#x27;Alawi sadah families in Hadhramaut, Mufadhal of Sana&#x27;a, Al-Shammam of Sa&#x27;dah, the Sufyan of Juban, and the Al-Jaylani of Juban.
== South Asia ==

In South Asia, Sayyids are mostly credited for preaching and consolidating the religion of Islam. They are predominantly descendants of leading saints of Sunni faith that migrated from Persia to preach Islam of which the Persian Sayyid Moinuddin Chishti has set the cornerstone. Thus Moinuddin Chishti is regarded as &quot;Sultan-i-Hindustan&quot; in Islamic Theology.

=== Afghanistan ===
In the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the &quot;Sayyid&quot; have been recognized as an ethnic group. On March 15, 2019, President Ashraf Ghani decreed the inclusion of the &quot;Sadat tribe&quot; in the electronically registered national identity documents (Tazkira). The majority of Sayyids live in Balkh and Kunduz in the north, as well as in Nangarhar in the east. They are predominantly Sunni Muslims[], although there are some, including in Bamiyan Province, who belong to Shia Islam. These individuals are often referred to as &quot;Sadat&quot; (from , the plural of &quot;Sayyid&quot;), a term traditionally used to denote the descendants of Hasan and Hussein, the first Shia martyrs and sons of Ali, who are grandsons of Muhammad, particularly in the northern Hejaz region and British India.

=== North India ===
The earliest migration of &quot;Sayyids&quot; from Afghanistan to North India took place in 1032 when Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu (general and brother-in-law of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni) and his son Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud established their military headquarters at Satrikh ( from Zaidpur) in the Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh. They are considered to be the first Muslim settlers in North India. In 1033 Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud was killed at the battle of Bahraich, the location of his &quot;mazar&quot;. Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud had no children. His parental uncle Syed Maroofuddin Ghazi and his family lived in Tijara until 1857 before they migrated to Bhopal. Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri and Khan Bahadur Aga Syed Hussain were both Rizvi &quot;Sayyids&quot; through Aaqa Meer Sayyid Hussain Qomi Rizvi, whose sacred shrine is in the Zainageer Village of Sopore, Kashmir. Iraqi &quot;Sayyids&quot; or Iraqi biradri in Eastern Uttar Pradesh are descendants of &quot;Sayyid&quot; Masud Al Hussaini who was the direct descendant of Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Hussain ibn Ali and came to India from Iraq during the reign of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1330 A.D. He settled with his seven sons and forty champions in Ghazipur (U.P.) as some of them (i.e., Syed Abu Bakr in Nonahra, Ghazipur) converted to Sunni Islam in the reign of Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi around 1517. His Shia descendants are now known as &quot;Sayyids&quot; of Ghazipur.
&quot;Sayyids&quot; of Syed nagli, or Said Nagli, or the Baquari Syeds had migrated from Termez (Present day Uzbekistan) during the Sultanate era. Sikandar Lodi was the ruler of Delhi when Mir Syed Mohammad al Hussain al Hussaini al Termezi Haji al Haramain came to India and settled at Syed Nagli. He was a Baquari Syed who drew his lineage from Muhammad al Baqir.
Perhaps the most important figure in the history of the Sayyid in Uttar Pradesh was Sayyid Basrullah Shustari, who moved from Mashad in Iran in 1549 and joined the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Akbar appointed Shustari as his chief justice, who used his position to strengthen the status of the various &quot;Sayyid&quot; families. They were preferred in administrative posts and formed a privileged elite. When the Mughal Empire disintegrated, the &quot;Sayyid&quot; played an important role in the turbulent politics of the time. The new British colonial authorities that replaced the Mughals after the Battle of Buxar made a pragmatic decision to work with the various &quot;Sayyid&quot; jagirdars. Several &quot;Sayyid&quot; taluqdars in Awadh were substantial landowners under the British colonial regime, and many other &quot;Sayyid&quot; contributed to state administration. After the abolition of the zamindari system, many &quot;Sayyid&quot; zamindars (e.g. that of Ghazipur) had to leave their homes.

==== Uttar Pradesh ====
The ancestor of the Bārha &quot;Sayyids&quot;, Sayyid Abu&#x27;l Farah Al Hussaini Al Wasti, left his original home in Wasit, Iraq, with his twelve sons at the end of the 13th century and migrated to India, where he obtained four villages in Sirhind-Fategarh. By the 16th century Abu&#x27;l Farah&#x27;s descendants had taken over Bārha villages in Muzaffarnagar.
The Sayyeds of Abdullapur Meerut are descendants of great saint Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari. They had a large Jagirdara consisting of 52 villages.Abdullapur named after Syed Mir Abdulla Naqvi Al Bukhari, he built Kot Fort of this place in the 16th century, it was his main residence. Bukhari of Abdullapur are fractionate into Kannauji Bukhari and Jalal Bukhari. Kannauji&#x27;s are descendants of Jalaludin Haider through Syed Mehboob Alam Naqvi-ul Bukhari Al-Maroof Shah Jewna or Shah Jewna son of warrior and chief advisor of Sikandar Lodi. Famous writer Syed Qudrat Naqvi Al Bukhari was born here later migrated to Pakistan after partition, his famous books are Ghalib kaun hai, Asaas-i-Urdu, Ghalib-i-sad rang, Seerat-un-Nabi, Hindi-Urdu lughat, Mutal&#x27;a-i-Abdul Haq, Lisani maqalaat.

The &quot;Sayyids&quot; of Bilgram are Hussaini Sayyids, who first migrated from Wasit, Iraq, in the 13th century. Their ancestor, Syed Mohammad Sughra, a Zaidi &quot;Sayyid&quot; of Iraq, arrived in India during the rule of Sultan Iltutmish. In 1217–18 the family conquered and settled in Bilgram.

A notable Sufi that belonged to a &quot;Sayyid&quot; family was Syed Salar Masud, from whom many of the Sayyid families of Awadh claim their lineage. &quot;Sayyids&quot; of Salon (Raebareli), Jarwal (Bahraich), Kintoor (Barabanki), and Zaidpur (Barabanki) were well-known &quot;Taluqadars&quot; (feudal lords) of Awadh province.

Sadaat also found in Kannauj trace their lineage from Husayn through Ali al-Hadi, a branch of Naqvi Bukhari. Famous Pir Syed Mehboob Alam Naqvi-ul Bukhari Al-Maroof Shah Jewna son of great warrior Syed Sadaruddin Shah Kabeer Naqvi (saint and also chief advisor) of Sikandar Lodi was also born in Kannauj and spent 66yrs of his life in kannauj later moved to Shah Jeewna. Makhdoom Jahaniya Mosque is still present in Shikana, Kannauj. Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan was also from Kannauj, he is a Bukhari Naqvi Sayyed converted from Shi&#x27;a Islam to Sunni Islam in the early 1800s.

==== Bihar ====
There are different families of syeds in Bihar who belong to direct descendants of Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain. Mostly there are Hussaini (Rizvi, Zaidi, Baqri) along with Hasani (Malik, Quadri or Geelani). Sadaat are settle in different part of bihar including shia and sunni sects. They are mostly migrated to bihar from Iraq and Iran.

Syed Yaqub Halabi also known as Syed Yaqub Baghdadi, a Hanafi Qazi from MadrassaAl Nizamiyya, originally from Halab (Aleppo) who travelled to India with Muhammad of Ghor after the Second Battle of Tarain. He was an eleventh generational descendant of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin through his son Abd Allah Al Bahr Al Ilm.

Sharafuddin Maneri belongs to Banu Hashim family of Imam Taj Faqih. In Bihar, Sayyids were landlords, judges, barristers, intellectuals, civil servant, clerics, teachers, businessmen and farmers. Sufi Saint and a warrior Malik Ibrahim Bayu who conquered Bihar during the time of tughlaq is one the most famous personality in bihar. Bihar&#x27;s first prime minister Mohammad Yunus Nobel prize nominee and Padma shri winner Syed Hassan, Political Scientist Abu Bakr Ahmad Haleem was the Pro-Vice Chancellor of Aligarh University and Karachi University, The great Abdul Bari, Zaid Hamid Syed Zaid Zaman Hamid is a Pakistani far-right, Islamist political commentator and was included in 500 most influential Muslims in world and Brigadier Malik Mokhtar Karim are few names from Malik Sadaat of Bihar.

Zaidi Sadaat of Bihar are the descendants of Sufi saint Syed Ahmad Jajneri and Syed Mohammed Jajneri. Syed Ahmad Jajneri migrated to India from Baghdad during the reign of Muhammad of Ghor and later migrated to Bihar. He was the direct descendant of Zayd ibn Ali who was the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali and therefore his descendants are called Husseini(Zaidi)Sadaat. His descendants are mostly settled in Bihar Sharif, Munger, Sheikhpura and Jamui region of Bihar.

Most prominent personalities of Sadaat of Bihar were from Desna, Bihar. For Example Syed Mohammed Saeed Raza, Abdul Qavi Desnavi and Sulaiman Nadvi. Desna&#x27;s library, established in 1892, had thousands of old Persian and Urdu manuscripts. After the partition of India, during uncertain times of mass emigration to Pakistan, the books were donated to Khuda Bakhsh Khan Library in Patna, where a Desna section was established to house these treasures. Other famous personalities of Bihari Syed were Syed Sultan Ahmed, Syed Hasan Imam and Sir Ali Imam.

==== Kerala ====
In Kerala, a number of Sayyid families (Qabila) are found. Most of them migrated from Arabian peninsula (Yemen&#x27;s Hadharamout) and Central Asian region in the Middle Ages and settled under the patronage of Zamorins. Famous among are Jifris, Bukharis and Ba-Alawis.

Sayyids occupy various positions as jurists (qazi), scholars (ulama&#x27;) and leaders (umara&#x27;). The state leaders of Indian Union Muslim League and Samastha are mostly chosen from Panakkad Thangal Family. A religious educational institute named &#x27;Sadath Academy&#x27; was established in Kerala exclusively for Sayyid students.

=== Genetic studies and controversy of self-proclaimed Indian Sayyids ===
The authors of the study, the Y chromosomes of self-identified Syeds from the Indian sub-continent are no less diverse than those non-Syeds from the same regions&quot;,&quot; suggested that Syed status showed evidence of elevated Arab ancestry but not of a recent common patrilineal origin.

In Northern India, Uttar Pradesh &amp; Bihar 0.2 per cent of the Sunni Muslim belong to haplogroup J1, which, given its absence in Indian non-Muslims is likely of exogenous Middle Eastern origin. There are 18 per cent belonging mainly to haplogroup J2 and another 11 per cent belong to haplogroup J1, which both represent Middle Eastern lineages, but may not hint exact descent from Muhammad. J1 is exclusively Near Eastern. The results for Sayyids showed minor but still detectable levels of gene flow primarily from Iran, rather than directly from the Arabian peninsula.

The paper, &quot;Y chromosomes of self-identified Syeds from the Indian subcontinent&quot;&quot;,&quot; by Elise M. S. Belle, Saima Shah, Tudor Parfitt, and Mark G. Thomas showed that &quot;self-identified Syeds had no less genetic diversity than those non-Syeds from the same regions, suggesting that there is no biological basis to the belief that self-identified Syeds in this part of the world share a recent common ancestry. However, self-identified men belonging to the IHL (Syeds, Hashemites, Quraysh and Ansari) show greater genetic affinity to Arab populations—despite the geographic distance, than other Indian populations.
== Southeast Asia ==
Most of the Alawi &quot;Sayyids&quot; who moved to Southeast Asia were descendants of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, especially of Ba &#x27;Alawi sada, many of which were descendants of migrants from Hadhramaut. Even though they are only &quot;alleged&quot; descendants of Husayn, it is uncommon for the female Sayyids to be called &quot;Sayyidah&quot;; they are more commonly called &quot;Sharifah&quot;. Most of them live in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Moro Province in Philippines, Pattani and Cambodia. Many of the royal families of this region such as the previous royal families of the Philippines (Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Maguindanao, Confederation of Sultanates of Ranao), Country of Singapore (Sultanate of Singapore House of Bendahara), Country of Malaysia (Sultanates of Johor House of Temenggong, Sultanates of Pahang and Sultanates of Terengganu House of Bendahara, Kingdom of Perlis House of Jamalullail), Country of Indonesia (Sultanates of Siak, Sultanates of Pontianak, Sultanates of Gowa, some Javanese Sultanates), Country of Brunei (Sultanates of Brunei House of Bolkiah) are also Sayyids, especially of Ba&#x27;Alawi.

Some common surnames of these &quot;Sayyids&quot; are Al-Saqqaf (or As-Saqqaf, Assegaf, Assegaff, Al-Sagoff), Shihab (or Shahab), Al-idaroos (or Al-Aydrus, Al Aidrus, Alaydrus, House of Bendahara, House of Temenggong), Al-Habsyi (or Al-Habshi), Al-Kaff, Al-Aththos (or Al-Attas, Alattas, Alattos), Al-Haddad Alhaddad), Al-Jufri (or Al-Jifri), Al-Muhdhar, Al-Shaikh Abubakar, Al-Qadri, Al-Munawwar, Al-Akbar Al-Hasani (or Al Akbar Al Hasani, Al-Bolkiah, House of Bolkiah), Al-Jamalullail (or Al Jamalullail, Djamalullail, House of Jamalullail).

== Tesayyud ==
In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for &quot;the People of the House&quot; encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of &quot;teseyyüd&quot; – falsely claiming noble ancestry – spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors. In 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad.

== Royal descendants of Muhammad ==
Descendants of Muhammad are present in many royal families today and are predominantly of Sunni faith.

=== Libyan royal family ===
The &quot;Sayyids&quot; in Libya are Sunni, including the former royal family, which is originally Zaidi-Moroccan (also known as the Senussi family). The El-Barassa Family are &quot;Ashraf&quot; as claimed by the sons of Abdulsalam ben Meshish, a descendant of Hassan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib.

=== Sharifs of Mecca ===

==== Jordan ====
The Hashemite royal family of Jordan also claims descent from Muhammad in the line of the Sharifs of Mecca, vassals that were set by the Fatimids and recognized by the Ottomans, tracing their lineage back to Imam Hasan ibn Ali. The Hashemite Royal Family under Sharif Hussein ibn Ali was crucial in ending Ottoman rule in the Arabian Peninsula, on the occasion of the spread of Pan-Turkism in the Arabian Peninsula.

==== Brunei ====
The House of Bolkiah claims descent from Imam Hasan ibn Ali through Sharif Ali, the 3rd Sultan of Brunei, who succeeded his father in law as Sultan in virtue of his descent from Muhammad. Sharif Ali formerly served as Emir of Makkah and belonged to the Sherifians, migrating to Brunei for missionary purposes.

=== Moroccan royal family ===
The Alaouite Royal family of Morocco also claims descent from Muhammad in the line of Imam Hasan ibn Ali. Their patriarch was Sharif ibn Ali, who founded the dynasty.

=== Sulu, Lanao, and Maguindanao royal family ===
The Sultanates of Sulu, Lanao, and Maguindanao hold a significant place in Philippine history, rooted deeply in both cultural heritage and religious identity. It is claimed that these Sultanates trace their lineage to the Prophet Muhammad, upholding the tenets of Sunni Ash&#x27;ari in Aqeeda (theological creed) and adhering to the Shafi&#x27;i school of thought in Fiqh (jurisprudence). Central to their spiritual and intellectual tradition are the teachings of Sufi missionaries from the Ba &#x27;Alawi sada, whose influence has played a pivotal role in shaping the religious landscape of the region.

The majority of Muslims in the Philippines adhere to the Sunni Ash&#x27;ari creed and follow the Shafi&#x27;i school of jurisprudence, reflecting the enduring influence of these traditions within the Sultanates and beyond. Furthermore, there exists a profound respect for, and in many cases, the practice of Sufism among Filipino Muslims. Sufism, with its emphasis on spiritual purification and the pursuit of inner knowledge, resonates deeply with the cultural and religious fabric of the Filipino Muslim community.

==Other indication of descent==
In addition to the sayyid title, descendants of Muhammad through the Twelve Imams in Arabic, Persian and Urdu may obtain the following surnames:

<text>Steel Magnolias is a 1989 American comedy drama film directed by Herbert Ross and starring Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, and Julia Roberts. The screenplay by Robert Harling is based on his 1987 play of the same name about the bond a group of women share in a small-town Southern community, and how they cope with the death of one of their own. The supporting cast features Tom Skerritt, Dylan McDermott, Kevin J. O&#x27;Connor, and Sam Shepard.

Harling based the story in part on his sister, Susan Harling Robinson, who died in 1985 of complications from type 1 diabetes. In the film, Roberts plays Shelby, the character based on Susan.

==Plot==
Annelle Dupuy, a shy beauty school graduate, moves to Chinquapin Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where Truvy Jones hires her to work in her home-based beauty salon.

Meanwhile, M&#x27;Lynn Eatenton and her daughter, Shelby, busily prepare for Shelby&#x27;s wedding that is being held later that day. M&#x27;Lynn&#x27;s insufferable husband, Drum Eatenton, uses a gun to drive birds out of the trees so they do not interfere with Shelby&#x27;s reception. Along with Clairee Belcher, the former mayor&#x27;s cheerful widow, they arrive at Truvy&#x27;s to have their hair done. While there, Shelby, who has type 1 diabetes, suffers a hypoglycemic attack, but recovers quickly with the women&#x27;s help. M&#x27;Lynn reveals that due to Shelby&#x27;s medical condition, her doctor advises against her having children. Shelby considered ending her engagement to her fiancé, Jackson, so he would not be deprived of children.

Grouchy and sarcastic Louisa &quot;Ouiser&quot; Boudreaux arrives at the salon and immediately begins interrogating Annelle about her background. Annelle tearfully reveals that her husband, who is evading the police, has disappeared after stealing her money, belongings, and car. Annelle further admits she is unsure her marriage is legal. Shelby, sympathetic, invites Annelle to the wedding reception, where she meets bartender Sammy DeSoto. At the Christmas festival later that year, Annelle, following a short-lived wild streak, has become a devout Christian, much to Sammy&#x27;s annoyance, while Clairee has bought local radio station KPPD.

During the Christmas holidays, Shelby announces she is pregnant. Everyone is thrilled except M&#x27;Lynn, who knows the risks. Truvy encourages M&#x27;Lynn to instead focus on the joy a new baby brings.

Shelby has a baby boy and names him Jackson Latcherie Jr., but soon develops kidney failure requiring regular dialysis. Around Jackson Jr.&#x27;s first birthday, Shelby undergoes a successful transplant with M&#x27;Lynn&#x27;s donated kidney. Shelby recovers, but four months later, Jackson arrives home to find her unconscious. Shelby is comatose, having contracted an infection in her central nervous system due to the suppressive therapy that keeps her body from rejecting the kidney. After doctors determine Shelby&#x27;s condition is irreversible, the family jointly decide to remove her from life support, with Jackson signing the papers to consent. Shortly after Shelby&#x27;s death, M&#x27;Lynn leaves the hospital and goes to Jackson&#x27;s aunt Fern&#x27;s house to pick up her grandson.

After the funeral, M&#x27;Lynn breaks down in tears, and the other women comfort her. M&#x27;Lynn gradually accepts her daughter&#x27;s decision to have risked her life in return for a few special years of motherhood and decides to focus her energy on helping Jackson with raising her grandson. Annelle, who married Sammy and is now pregnant, tells M&#x27;Lynn she wants to name her own baby after Shelby, even if the baby turns out to be a boy, as she was the reason Annelle and Sammy met. M&#x27;Lynn approves, stating, &quot;Life goes on.&quot;

At the town&#x27;s Easter egg hunt, Annelle goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital by Truvy and her husband Spud in their truck, followed by Sammy in an Easter Bunny costume and Truvy and Spud&#x27;s son Louie on Louie&#x27;s motorcycle.

==Cast==
==Background==
The original play dramatized experiences of the family and friends of the playwright&#x27;s following the 1985 death of his sister from diabetic complications after the birth of his namesake nephew and the failure of a family member&#x27;s donated kidney. A writer friend continuously encouraged him to write it down in order to come to terms with the experience. He did but originally as a short story for his nephew then later to get an understanding of the deceased mother. It evolved in ten days into the play.

==Production==
Harling&#x27;s first produced screenplay, he adapted the original film script which was then heavily rewritten beyond the on-stage one-set scenario (which had taken place entirely in Truvy&#x27;s beauty salon) of the stage production: the scenes increased and the sequence was more tightly linked with major holidays than the play; the increased characters beyond the original, all-female play cast caused dialogue changes between on-screen characters (among them, Harling plays the preacher and Truvy has one son instead of two).

Filming took place from July 12, 1988, to early September 1988 in Natchitoches, Louisiana, with historian Robert DeBlieux, a former Natchitoches mayor, as the local advisor. The house where much of the film was shot became a six-suite bed and breakfast, available for rent. The church used for a wedding scene is St. Augustine Catholic Church in Natchez on the historic Isle Brevelle.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; grossed $84.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $96.8 million.

In the United States and Canada, the film debuted at number four in its opening weekend, grossing $5.4 million from 480 theaters. The following weekend, it expanded to 720 theaters and grossed $7 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release, although Roberts&#x27; performance was praised. 

In a less enthusiastic review, Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the film felt &quot;more Hollywood than the South.&quot; More enthusiastic was Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who said that the film was &quot;willing to sacrifice its over-all impact for individual moments of humor, and while that leaves us without much to take home, you&#x27;ve got to hand it to them: The moments work&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on June 19, 1990, and on DVD July 25, 2000, allowing the film to gross a further $40 million. The film&#x27;s overall gross was $135,904,091. The film was released on Blu-ray through the boutique label Twilight Time, on September 11, 2012. A 30th anniversary Blu-ray was released on May 28, 2019. On April 23, 2024, the film was released on 4K Ultra-HD in honor of the 35th Anniversary.

==Other versions==
===Lifetime remake===

A remake of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; premiered on Lifetime on October 7, 2012, directed by Kenny Leon and featuring an all-black cast that includes Queen Latifah (M&#x27;Lynn), Jill Scott (Truvy), Alfre Woodard (Ouiser), Phylicia Rashād (Clairee), Adepero Oduye (Annelle), and Condola Rashād (Shelby).

===Television pilot===
CBS aired a half-hour television pilot sitcom on August 17, 1990. The pilot, set after the events of the film, featured the same characters, except for Shelby. The cast included Cindy Williams as M&#x27;Lynn, Sally Kirkland as Truvy, Elaine Stritch as Ouiser, Polly Bergen as Clairee and Sheila McCarthy as Annelle. The show was not picked up to series.

In mathematics, ideas are supposedly not accepted as fact until they have been rigorously proved. However, there have been some ideas that were fairly accepted in the past but which were subsequently shown to be false. The following list is meant to serve as a repository for compiling a list of such ideas.

*The idea of the Pythagoreans that all numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. This was disproved by one of Pythagoras&#x27; own disciples, Hippasus, who showed that the square root of two is what we today call an irrational number. One story claims that he was thrown off the ship in which he and some other Pythagoreans were sailing because his discovery was too heretical.
*Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate stated that if two lines cross a third in a plane in such a way that the sum of the &quot;interior angles&quot; is not 180° then the two lines meet. Furthermore, he implicitly assumed that two separate intersecting lines meet at only one point. These assumptions were believed to be true for more than 2000 years, but in light of General Relativity at least the second can no longer be considered true. In fact the very notion of a straight line in four-dimensional curved space-time has to be redefined, which one can do as a geodesic. (But the notion of a plane does not carry over.) It is now recognized that Euclidean geometry can be studied as a mathematical abstraction, but that the universe is non-Euclidean.
*Fermat conjectured that all numbers of the form formula_1 (known as Fermat numbers) were prime. However, this conjecture was disproved by Euler, who found that formula_2
*The idea that transcendental numbers were unusual. Disproved by Georg Cantor who showed that there are so many transcendental numbers that it is impossible to make a one-to-one mapping between them and the algebraic numbers. In other words, the cardinality of the set of transcendentals (denoted formula_3) is greater than that of the set of algebraic numbers (formula_4).
*Bernhard Riemann, at the end of his famous 1859 paper &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;, stated (based on his results) that the logarithmic integral gives a somewhat too high estimate of the prime-counting function. The evidence also seemed to indicate this. However, in 1914 J. E. Littlewood proved that this was not always the case, and in fact it is now known that the first &quot;x&quot; for which formula_5 occurs somewhere before 10317. See Skewes&#x27; number for more detail.
*Naïvely it might be expected that a continuous function must have a derivative or else that the set of points where it is not differentiable should be &quot;small&quot; in some sense. This was disproved in 1872 by Karl Weierstrass, and in fact examples had been found earlier of functions that were nowhere differentiable (see Weierstrass function). According to Weierstrass in his paper, earlier mathematicians including Gauss had often assumed that such functions did not exist.
*It was conjectured in 1919 by George Pólya, based on the evidence, that most numbers less than any particular limit have an odd number of prime factors. However, this Pólya conjecture was disproved in 1958. It turns out that for some values of the limit (such as values a bit more than 906 million), most numbers less than the limit have an even number of prime factors.
*Erik Christopher Zeeman tried for 7 years to prove that one cannot untie a knot on a 4-sphere. Then one day he decided to try to prove the opposite, and he succeeded in a few hours.
*A &quot;theorem&quot; of Jan-Erik Roos in 1961 stated that in an [AB4*] abelian category, lim1 vanishes on Mittag-Leffler sequences. This &quot;theorem&quot; was used by many people since then, but it was disproved by counterexample in 2002 by Amnon Neeman.

<text>The Raytheon Sentinel is a retired airborne battlefield and ground surveillance aircraft formerly operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). While based on the Bombardier Global Express ultra long-range business jet, the prime contractor for the Sentinel was the American defence firm Raytheon, which supplied most of the mission systems and performed the integration work.

Originally known as the ASTOR (Airborne STand-Off Radar) programme, procurement of the type started during 1999. Following its delivery in 2007, the Sentinel fleet was operated by an RAF squadron manned by both air force and army personnel. The Sentinel was interoperable with other allied systems such as JSTARS and the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system. Sentinels were deployed overseas on multiple occasions, such as in support of the British Army in Afghanistan, coalition forces in Libya, and to assist French forces deployed in Mali. The type also saw smaller-scale deployments in Ghana and even domestically to assist disaster relief operations.

In 2010, the British government&#x27;s Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) announced its intention to &quot;withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground surveillance aircraft once it is no longer required to support operations in Afghanistan.&quot; The 2010 decision was reversed in 2014 by Prime Minister David Cameron and in the 2015 SDSR, the British government announced that the type&#x27;s retirement would be delayed and that it would remain in service &quot;into the next decade&quot;. Due to the repeated equivocations over its future, the Sentinel did not receive upgrades during its service life. The type was retired in March 2021.

==Development==
ASTOR can be traced back to the British Army&#x27;s &quot;Corps Airborne Stand-Off Radar&quot; (CASTOR) programme, a Cold War-era initiative which sought to bring about an improved surveillance capabilities for monitoring hostile ground forces, with a particular focus on Warsaw Pact forces in East Germany. In 1984, a single Britten-Norman Islander (G-DLRA/ZG989) was modified with a large nose radome for battlefield surveillance to explore this concept. Experiences gained during the 1991 Gulf War confirmed the requirement for such an aircraft, but the end of the Cold War had somewhat undermined the traditional justification to process, along with a series of rapid defense budget cuts that made funding of any new acquisitions particularly challenging during that time.

Despite this, during December 1999, a production contract was signed with the American defence firm Raytheon to supply what would become the Sentinel. The programme involved five aircraft and eight mobile ground stations (six on wheeled all-terrain vehicles and two in air-transportable containers), along with a training facility at RAF Waddington. Four of the five Sentinels were integrated at Raytheon&#x27;s facility in Broughton, Flintshire; various support series provided by the company during the type&#x27;s service life, including deep maintenance and upgrade work, were also undertaken at Broughton.

The Sentinel programme cost £850 million. The support contract for the Sentinel covered 3,200 flying hours per year, and between 2015 and 2018, the five-strong fleet of aircraft had an estimated average running cost of £54.4m/year. This figure does not include standard mid-life updates, which did not take place, that would have increased costs considerably.

==Design==

The &quot;Sentinel R1&quot; was a modified Bombardier Global Express powered by two Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan engines. The cockpit featured a centrally positioned pull-down screen capable of displaying a moving map, along with Link 16 datalink information and defensive aids subsystem (DASS) data. The DASS comprised a towed radar decoy, missile approach warning system, and chaff and flare dispensers which could be operated in automatic, semi-automatic or manual mode. In typical operations, the Sentinel would be flown at altitudes in excess of to ensure a high resolution view of a large battlefield area. It was crewed by a pilot, a co-pilot, an Airborne Mission Commander (AMC) and two image analysts. Mission endurance was approximately nine hours. The main cabin housed 3 workstations at which analysts could analyse the images on board; however, unlike the JSTARS, most of the actual battle management occurred on the ground.

The Sentinel&#x27;s main radar was a Raytheon dual-mode synthetic-aperture radar / moving target indication (SAR/MTI) radar known as Sentinel Dual Mode Radar Sensor (DMRS). It used active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, and was related to the ASARS-2 radar used by the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Raytheon claimed that the radar could be modified to match the maritime surveillance capability of the cancelled Nimrod MRA4, and the ground stations could be adapted to receive data from different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including the Watchkeeper, MQ-9 Reaper and the future Scavenger programme. The imagery produced by the radar&#x27;s synthetic aperture mode was incompatible with the UK&#x27;s rules of engagement necessitating a visual positive identification capability; while the addition of an electro-optical/infrared sensor to the Sentinel&#x27;s canoe fairing to provide complimentary imagery was proposed, this option was never exercised.

==Operational history==
On 3 August 2001, the first flight of the aerodynamically modified Global Express prototype occurred, which validated the modifications required for the ASTOR system. On 26 May 2004, the first production Sentinel R1 performed its maiden flight, lasting for 4.4 hours. During 2007, service trials of the Sentinel were conducted. The first operational sortie over Afghanistan in support of the British Army commenced on 15 November 2008. By January 2009, the type had entered regular service with 5 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF), based at RAF Waddington.

In addition to its presence in the Afghan theatre, the Sentinel routinely performed surveillance flights over the Baltic Sea, monitoring military forces stationed in the Kaliningrad Oblast and Belarus; during such missions the type was frequently intercepted by Russian Sukhoi Su-27s.

In 2010, the UK government&#x27;s Strategic Defence and Security Review announced its intention to &quot;withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground surveillance aircraft once it is no longer required to support operations in Afghanistan.&quot; In February 2012, it was announced that Sentinel would be offered as the UK contribution to NATO&#x27;s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) collaboration, complementing NATO RQ-4 Global Hawks and French Heron TPs.

The Sentinel&#x27;s role above Libya in 2011 was described as &quot;pivotal&quot; by the head of the RAF. On 30 March 2011, the longest Sentinel flight, of 12 hours and 30 minutes was flown during Operation Ellamy over Libya. While operating along the Libyan coast, it was observed that the Sentinel&#x27;s dual-mode radar was capable of tracking vessel movements around Libyan harbours, providing viable battlefield intelligence.

On 25 January 2013, the British Government announced that the RAF would deploy one Sentinel aircraft from RAF Waddington, in support of Operation Newcombe in Mali. In February 2014, it was reported that the Sentinel had been used to map the scale of flooding in Southern England. On 18 May 2014, the MoD announced that a Sentinel had departed to Ghana as part of Operation Turus to assist in the search for the 223 schoolgirls abducted by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria on 14 April 2014.

In 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron announced the retention of the aircraft, even after operations end in Afghanistan in Autumn 2018. This reprieve fuelled speculation that not only would the Sentinel be retained but that upgrades of the fleet, particularly for use in a maritime surveillance capacity, might occur. In the absence of UK government backing, Raytheon self-financed development work for over five years on a mid-life upgrade of the Sentinel&#x27;s mission systems, referred to as &quot;Overseer&quot;, but this was not applied.

Upgrades for the Sentinel were planned to take place; during 2014, the UK government announced that a contract for the type to receive a maritime-capable software upgrade was to be placed in the spring of 2015; However, due to a combination of its operational commitments and constrained budgets, neither the Sentinel or its missions systems received any upgrades for an extended period, which led to some of its onboard systems becoming increasingly obsolescent by the end of the decade.
On 26 March 2015, the MOD announced the deployment of two Sentinel aircraft in support of Operation Shader to provide surveillance to coalition forces fighting as part of the Military intervention against ISIL. In addition to the Sentinel, the RAF also deployed other surveillance assets, including the Boeing Rivet Joint, General Atomics Reaper, Beechcraft Shadow and Boeing Sentry, for surveillance missions over Iraq and Syria around this time.

Despite the RAF reportedly hoping to retain the entire five-strong fleet, it was announced, while the type&#x27;s service date would be extended into 2021, that the number of operational Sentinels would be cut to four aircraft with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, in July 2017, one of the five aircraft was permanently withdrawn.

The long-term retention of the platform would have necessitated significant expenditure to modernise aging systems, which strengthened the decision to withdraw the entire Sentinel fleet during March 2021. Planners determined that new aircraft, such as the Poseidon MRA1 maritime patrol aircraft and the forthcoming Protector UAV, would carry out the surveillance duties formerly performed by the type. Thus, on 25 February 2021, Sentinel ZJ694 completed the type&#x27;s final operational flight when it returned to RAF Waddington from a mission flown near Kaliningrad Oblast and Belarus. During the following month, the type was formally withdrawn from RAF service. During their service life of 12.5 (stated in a RAF tweet as 14) years, the five aircraft flew approximately 32,300 hours roughly distributed across 4,870 sorties. Following their withdrawal from RAF service, the aircraft were sold to a US consortium of Springfield Air, Raytheon US, and Bombardier in an unairworthy condition.

On 16 November 2021, according to UK Defence Journal, the MoD accepted a proposal from Raytheon/Bombardier to purchase and refurbish the airframes for ultimate use by the United States Army.&quot;

<text>Graham John Capill (born 1959) is a former New Zealand Christian leader, politician and convicted rapist.

He served as the first leader of the now-defunct Christian Heritage Party, stepping down in 2003. In 2005 he was convicted of multiple sexual offences against girls under 12 years of age and sentenced to nine years imprisonment. He was released on parole in August 2011, having served six years of that sentence.

==Early life==
Capill was born in western Africa, his parents being Christian missionaries. Most of his youth was spent in New Zealand, mainly in the city of Christchurch. He was educated at Middleton Grange School, a large evangelical Protestant school in that city, where his father, Donald Capill, was vice-principal for most of the 1970s, and which his brothers, David, Murray and Timothy, also attended.

Capill went to work in the aviation industry, and qualified as a pilot and an avionics engineer. Later, Capill decided to become a minister, and studied towards a Bachelor of Divinity degree at the Reformed Theological College in Geelong, Australia. He gained his degree in 1986. He returned to New Zealand to complete an internship at Wellington, and became a minister of the Reformed Church of Dunedin in 1988. By June 1998 he was attending an Anglican church in Christchurch, but described himself as Presbyterian by conviction. Capill gained a law degree from the University of Canterbury in 1997.

Capill and his wife Judith have ten children.

==Christian Heritage Party==

The Christian Heritage Party, founded in 1989, held its first convention in 1990. Capill was appointed the new party&#x27;s leader in June of that year. He remained leader of the party through five elections, but the party failed to win any seats. Capill announced his retirement shortly after the 2002 general election, and stepped down in 2003. He was succeeded as party leader by Ewen McQueen. In November 2004 Capill resigned from the Christian Heritage citing differences of opinion over the party&#x27;s new direction since his retirement.

==Police work==
After leaving politics, he was employed as a dispatcher in the Southern Communications Centre of the New Zealand Police. Within a year he had been moved to be a police prosecutor at the Christchurch District Court, but was stood down in early 2005 pending criminal charges.

==Trial and imprisonment ==
On 23 March 2005 Capill appeared in the Christchurch District Court charged with indecently assaulting a girl aged under 12. On leaving the court he was assaulted (&quot;punched and left whimpering on the ground&quot;) by local sickness beneficiary Daniel McNally, a former boxer. The media referred to Capill, who was then under a name-suppression order, as &quot;a prominent New Zealander&quot;.
McNally, who had no previous connection to the case, received a two-year prison sentence for the assault.
On 1 April 2005 name suppression was lifted and Capill pleaded guilty to a charge of indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl on four occasions. These events took place between the years of 2001 and 2002, while Capill was leader of Christian Heritage. His activities were brought to an end by the Rev Wally Behan, vicar of St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Latimer Square, Christchurch, the church which the Capill family attended. Behan was acting on information received from some of the victims. Further charges of rape and indecent assault against girls aged under 12 (committed during the 1990s) followed. As Capill had strongly condemned &quot;sexual perversion&quot; throughout his political career, the revelations had particular impact. Capill&#x27;s conduct was swiftly condemned by Christian Heritage.

On 28 June 2005 Capill entered guilty pleas on a further three charges of indecent assault, one of rape, and one of unlawful sexual connection, all committed against girls under the age of 12. Newspaper reports now describe him as &quot;a sexual predator&quot;, and he was remanded in custody while awaiting sentencing. On 14 July 2005 Capill was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years. Prior to his sentencing, he sent an e-mail to supporters, asking for forgiveness and that they pray for a light sentence, also claiming that the sex with one of the young girls was &quot;consensual&quot;. His lawyer said that the e-mail, intended to gain sympathy and support, backfired and was ill-advised. Judge Kerr said the email sent by Capill to supporters demonstrated he had yet to fully appreciate the enormity of his offending.

On 16 August he appealed the sentence to the dismay of his critics. The appeal was abandoned on 31 January 2006.

Capill had earned a law degree before the revelation of his offending. On 9 August 2006, he was forbidden to practise law and fined $3123 at a disciplinary hearing (although Capill had never practised law privately, and described his legal studies as a &quot;hobby&quot;). Concerns were raised that Capill&#x27;s wife and children might be unfairly burdened by this latest development, due to his inability to earn income as a prisoner.

Later that year, Capill complained that Rolleston Prison guards were interfering with photocopying and access to a university tutor for his Massey University papers, and not letting him swap children&#x27;s diaries with his wife. However, another Rolleston Prison inmate who was also studying Massey University papers at the same time as Capill argued that prison guards behaved similarly toward other inmates.

On 3 October 2006, his successor, Ewen McQueen, announced the dissolution of Christian Heritage New Zealand, blaming Capill&#x27;s conviction and disgrace for its demise.

In April 2008, there was public opposition when it was revealed that Capill was due to appear at a Parole Board hearing in June 2008. On 27 June 2008, it was reported that Capill&#x27;s parole application had been unsuccessful due to opposition from his victims who felt there had been insufficient preventative counselling, and that the Department of Corrections and Rolleston Prison would not enroll him on Kia Marama, a child sexual abuse prevention education and counselling course, until he had served two-thirds of his sentence (circa 2011).

He was granted parole in August 2011 after having completed the nine-month Kia Marama child-sex offenders programme and having been &quot;assessed as posing a low/medium long term risk of sexual reoffending&quot;.

However, as with other paroled and released sexual offenders, there were a number of conditional aspects to Capill&#x27;s release. He was required to report to a parole officer when dealing with accommodation and employment concerns and experienced restricted mobility and autonomy in those contexts. He was forbidden from communicating with his former victims and associating with anyone under sixteen unless there were approved adult caregivers in the vicinity.

== After release ==
Capill now lives in Christchurch; his sentence ended in June 2014.

<text>Terry Southern (May 1, 1924 – October 29, 1995) was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and university lecturer, noted for his distinctive satirical style. Part of the Paris postwar literary movement in the 1950s and a companion to Beat writers in Greenwich Village, Southern was also at the center of Swinging London in the 1960s and helped to change the style and substance of American films in the 1970s. He briefly wrote for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the 1980s.

Southern&#x27;s dark and often absurdist style of satire helped to define the sensibilities of several generations of writers, readers, directors, and filmgoers. He is credited by journalist Tom Wolfe as having invented New Journalism with the publication of &quot;Twirling at Ole Miss&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot; in February 1963. Southern&#x27;s reputation was established with the publication of his comic novels &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; and through his gift for writing memorable film dialogue as evident in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;The Loved One&quot;, &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;. His work on &quot;Easy Rider&quot; helped create the independent film movement of the 1970s.

==Biography==
Southern was born in Alvarado, Texas. He graduated from Sunset High School in Dallas, Texas in 1941. He attended North Texas Agricultural College for a year as a pre-med major before transferring to Southern Methodist University, where he continued to cultivate his interest in literature. From 1943 to 1945, he served in the U.S. Army as a demolitions technician during World War II. Stationed in Reading, England with the 435th Quartermaster Platoon (allowing for frequent forays to London), he earned a Bronze Star and a Good Conduct Medal. In the autumn of 1946, he resumed his studies at the University of Chicago before transferring to Northwestern University, where he received his undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1948.

===Paris, 1948–1952===
Southern left the United States in September 1948, using a G.I. Bill grant to travel to France, where he studied at the Faculté Des Lettres of the Sorbonne. His four-year stint in Paris was a crucial formative influence, both on his development as a writer and on the evolution of his &quot;hip&quot; persona. During this period he made many important friendships and social contacts as he became a central figure in the expatriate American café society of the 1950s. He became close friends with Mason Hoffenberg (with whom he subsequently co-wrote the novel &quot;Candy&quot;), Alexander Trocchi, John Marquand, Mordecai Richler, Aram Avakian (filmmaker, photographer and brother of Columbia Records jazz producer George Avakian), and jazz musician and motorsport enthusiast Allen Eager. He also met expatriate American writer James Baldwin and leading French intellectuals Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus.

Southern frequented the Cinémathèque Française in Paris and saw jazz performances by leading bebop musicians including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis, evoked in his classic &quot;You&#x27;re Too Hip, Baby&quot;. During the early 1950s he wrote some of his best short stories, including &quot;The Butcher&quot; and &quot;The Automatic Gate&quot;, both published in David Burnett&#x27;s &quot;New-Story&quot; magazine. His story &quot;The Accident&quot; was the first short story published in the &quot;Paris Review&quot; in its founding issue (1953); it was followed by &quot;The Sun and the Still-born Stars&quot; in issue #4. Southern became closely identified with the &quot;Paris Review&quot; and its founders, Peter Matthiessen, Harold L. &quot;Doc&quot; Humes, and George Plimpton, and he formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton. He met French model Pud Gadiot in 1952; a romance soon blossomed and the couple married just before they moved to New York City.

===Greenwich Village, 1953–1956===
In 1953, Southern and Gadiot returned to the US and settled in Greenwich Village in New York City. As he had in Paris, Southern quickly became a prominent figure on the artistic scene that flourished in the Village in the late 1950s. He met visual artists such as Robert Frank and Larry Rivers. Through Mason Hoffenberg, who made occasional visits from Paris, he was introduced to leading beat writers including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso.

He frequented renowned New York jazz venues such as the Five Spot, the San Remo, and the Village Vanguard. It was in this period that Southern read and became obsessed with the work of British writer Henry Green. Green&#x27;s writing exerted a strong influence on Southern&#x27;s early work, and Green became one of Southern&#x27;s most ardent early supporters.

Southern struggled to gain recognition during this period, writing short stories as he worked on &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot;, his first solo novel. Most of these stories were rejected by leading magazines and journals. Here, as in Paris, Southern was almost entirely supported by his wife Pud, but their relationship fell apart within a year of their arrival in New York and they were divorced in mid-1954.

During 1954 and 1955. Southern met two of his literary heroes, William Faulkner and Nelson Algren. Southern interviewed Algren for the &quot;Paris Review&quot; in the autumn of 1955. They kept in touch after the interview, and Algren became another of Southern&#x27;s early friends and champions.

Southern&#x27;s fortunes began to change after he was taken on by the Curtis-Brown Agency in mid-1954; through them he had three of his short stories accepted by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It published &quot;The Sun and the Still-born Stars&quot; and &quot;The Panthers&quot; in the same edition in late 1955, and &quot;The Night Bird Blew for Doctor Warner&quot; was featured in the January 1956 edition.

In October 1955, Southern met model, aspiring actress, and editor Carol Kauffman. They were married on July 14, 1956.

===Geneva, 1956–1959===
Southern returned to Europe with Kauffman in October 1956, stopping off in Paris and then settling in Geneva, Switzerland, where they lived until 1959. Kauffman took a job with UNESCO, which supported them as Southern continued to write. The years in Geneva were a prolific period during which he prepared &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot; for publication, and worked on &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; as well as TV scripts and short stories. The couple made trips to Paris, where they visited Mason Hoffenberg, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs, and to London, where Southern met Henry Green and Kenneth Tynan.

During his time in New York, Southern had written a short story &quot;about a girl in Greenwich Village who got involved with a hunchback because she was such a good Samaritan&quot; and this became the core of &quot;Candy&quot;, co-written with Mason Hoffenberg. On his return to Paris in late 1956, Southern showed the story to several people, including Hoffenberg, who thought the character should have more adventures. Southern encouraged Hoffenberg to write one; this became the sequence where Candy goes to the hospital to see Dr. Krankheit. The pair began alternately creating chapters, working together regularly on visits to Tourrettes-sur-Loup over the spring and summer of 1957. The book was introduced to publisher Maurice Girodias, probably by Marilyn Meeske (later Marilyn Meeske Sorel) who, according to Southern, thought Girodias would be interested in it as a &quot;dirty book&quot;.

André Deutsch accepted &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot;, Southern&#x27;s first novel, early in 1957, and the short story &quot;A South Summer Idyll&quot; was published in &quot;Paris Review&quot; No. 15. The Southerns spent some time in Spain with Henry Green during the summer, and Southern interviewed him for the &quot;Paris Review&quot;. Several more short stories were published later that year, by which time he was finishing work on &quot;Candy&quot;. Southern and Gregory Corso helped convince Girodias to publish the controversial novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; by then-little-known author Burroughs.

In early 1958, Southern made his first foray into screenwriting, working with Canadian director Ted Kotcheff, who had come to Britain to work for the newly established ABC Weekend TV company. Kotcheff directed Southern&#x27;s TV adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, which was broadcast in the UK in March. This coincided with the publication of &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot;, which was well-reviewed in the UK but coolly received in the U.S.

The first major magazine interview with Southern, conducted by Elaine Dundy, was published in UK &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in August 1958. In October, Olympia published &quot;Candy&quot; under the pseudonym Maxwell Kenton, and it immediately was banned by the Paris vice squad.

&quot;The Magic Christian&quot;, Southern&#x27;s first solo novel, satirically explores the corrupting effects of money. He finished the book in Geneva over the fall and winter of 1958–1959. and it was published by André Deutsch in Spring 1959 to mixed reviews; however, it soon gained an avid cult following. By the time it had been published, the Southerns had decided to return to the U.S.; they left Geneva for New York in April 1959.

===East Canaan, 1959–1962===
After moving back to the U.S., the Southerns stayed with friends for several months until they were able to buy their own home. They were looking for a rural retreat close enough to New York to allow Terry to commute there. Southern met and became friendly with jazz musician and bandleader Artie Shaw, and they began looking for properties together. Shaw put down a deposit on a farm in East Canaan, Connecticut, but at the urging of a friend Southern convinced Shaw to let him buy the farm, which he purchased for $23,000.

During 1959 and 1960, he continued working on a never-completed novel titled &quot;The Hipsters&quot;, which he had begun in Geneva. He became part of the New York artists and writers &#x27;salon&#x27; of his old friend Plimpton—who had also moved back to New York— frequenting the Cedar Tavern, rubbing shoulders with writers James Jones, William Styron, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Harold &quot;Doc&quot; Humes, Jack Gelber, Jules Feiffer, Blair Fuller, Gore Vidal, Kenneth Tynan, the Aga Khan, the cast of the British comedy stage revue &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot;, Jackie Kennedy, British actress Jean Marsh, and Tynan&#x27;s first wife, Elaine Dundy, through whom Southern met satirist Lenny Bruce.

&quot;Flash and Filigree&quot; had been published in the U.S. by Coward McCann in the fall of 1958. Several fragments from &quot;The Hipsters&quot; were published as short stories during this period, including &quot;Red-Dirt Marijuana&quot; published, in the January–February 1960 edition of &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;; and &quot;Razor Fight&quot;, published in &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine. He had an essay on Lotte Lenya published in &quot;Esquire&quot;. In early 1960, he began writing book reviews for &quot;The Nation&quot;, which were published over the next two years. During the year, he collaborated with his old Paris friends Trocchi and Richard Seaver, compiling &quot;Writers in Revolt,&quot; an anthology of modern fiction for the Frederick Fall company. The editing process took much longer than expected: A drug bust led Trocchi to flee to the UK via Canada, leaving Southern and Seaver to finish the book, and editor Stephen Levine was recruited to assist. 

Terry and Carol&#x27;s son and only child Nile Southern was born on December 29, 1960. Around this time, Southern began writing for Maurice Girodias&#x27; new periodical &quot;Olympia Review&quot;. He began negotiations with the Putnam company to reissue &quot;Candy&quot; under his and Hoffenberg&#x27;s real names, and he hired Sterling Lord as his literary agent, .

In the summer of 1962, Southern worked for two months as a relief editor at &quot;Esquire&quot;, and during this period, he had several stories published in the magazine, including &quot;The Road to Axotle&quot;. Through &quot;Esquire&quot;, he interviewed rising filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who had completed his controversial screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita&quot;. Although Southern knew little about Kubrick, the director was well aware of Southern&#x27;s work, having been given a copy of &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; by Peter Sellers during the making of &quot;Lolita&quot;.

===&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;===
Southern&#x27;s life and career changed irrevocably on November 2, 1962, when he received a telegram inviting him to come to London to work on the screenplay of Kubrick&#x27;s new film, which was then in pre-production.

Partly on the recommendation of Peter Sellers, Stanley Kubrick asked Southern to help revise the screenplay of &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964). The film was based on the Cold War thriller &quot;Red Alert&quot; (1958) by Peter George, the rights to which Kubrick had secured for $3,000. Kubrick and George&#x27;s original screenplay (which was to be called &quot;Edge of Doom&quot;) was a straight political thriller. They then reworked it into a satirical format (provisionally titled &quot;The Delicate Balance of Terror&quot;) in which the plot of &quot;Red Alert&quot; was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence.

Southern&#x27;s work on the project was brief but intense; he officially worked on the script from November 16 to December 28, 1962. Southern began to rely on the amphetamine-barbiturate &quot;diet pill&quot; Dexamyl to keep him going through the frantic rewriting process; in later years, he developed a long-term amphetamine dependency. His amphetamine abuse, combined with his heavy intake of alcohol and other drugs, contributed significantly to health problems in later life.

The major change Southern and Kubrick made was to recast the script as a black comedy, jettisoning the &quot;film within a film&quot; structure. Kubrick, George, and Southern shared the screenplay credits, but competing claims about who contributed what led to confusion and some conflict among the three men after the film&#x27;s release. The credit question was confused by Sellers&#x27; numerous ad libbed contributions—he often improvised wildly on set, so Kubrick made sure that Sellers had as much camera &#x27;coverage&#x27; as possible during his scenes in order to capture these spontaneous inspirations.

According to Art Miller, an independent producer who hired Southern to write the screenplay for a never-completed comic film about the bumbling Watergate burglars, Southern told him that the best example of his writing in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was the scene in which B-52 pilot T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, played by Slim Pickens, reads off a list of the contents of a survival kit to his crew, concluding that a man could have &quot;a pretty nice weekend in Vegas&quot; with some of the items. When the scene was shot, Pickens spoke the scripted line (&quot;Dallas&quot;), but the word &quot; Vegas&quot; was overdubbed during post-production because the film was released not long after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963.

According to Miller, Peter Sellers quietly paid Southern tens of thousands of dollars to create some of the best-known comedy bits for Sellers&#x27; character Inspector Clouseau in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film series.

Southern also helped Sellers with dialogue coaching. Originally slated to play four roles, including that of the Texan B-52 bomber pilot Major Kong, the actor had difficulty mastering the accent. Southern, a native Texan, taped himself speaking Kong&#x27;s lines for Sellers to study. Sellers, who had never been comfortable in the role of Kong, was able to extricate himself from the part after allegedly fracturing his ankle, forcing Kubrick to re-cast. The part eventually went to actor Slim Pickens, who Kubrick met during his brief stint working on Marlon Brando&#x27;s &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;.

After the film went into wider release in January 1964, Southern was the subject of considerable media coverage, and erroneously was given primary credit for the screenplay, a misperception he did little to correct. This reportedly angered both Kubrick—who was notorious for his unwillingness to share writing credits—and Peter George, who penned a complaint to &quot;Life&quot; magazine in response to a lavish photo essay on Southern published in the May 8, 1964 edition. Stung by the article&#x27;s assertion that Southern was responsible for turning the formerly &quot;serious script&quot; into an &quot;original irreverent satirical film&quot;, George pointed out that he and Kubrick had been working together on the script for 10 months, whereas Southern was only &quot;briefly employed (November 16–December 28, 1962) to do some additional writing.&quot;

Toward the end of his work on &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Southern began canvassing for more film work. Jobs he considered included a proposed John Schlesinger screen adaptation of the Iris Murdoch novel &quot;A Severed Head&quot;, and a project called &quot;The Marriage Game&quot;, to be directed by Peter Yates and produced by the James Bond team of Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli. He also wrote an essay on John Fowles&#x27; novel &quot;The Collector&quot;, which led to his work as a &quot;script doctor&quot; on the subsequent screen version.

Southern&#x27;s writing career took off in 1963. His essay &quot;Twirlin&#x27; at Ole Miss&quot; was published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in February 1963, and this work of satirical reportage is now acknowledged as one of the cornerstone works of New Journalism. This was quickly followed by the publication of several other essays, including the Bay of Pigs-themed &quot;Recruiting for the Big Parade&quot;, and one of his best Paris stories, &quot;You&#x27;re Too Hip, Baby&quot;. The fiction anthology &quot;Writers In Revolt&quot; was published in the spring, soon followed by the U.S. publication of &quot;Candy&quot;, which became the #2 American fiction best-seller of 1963.

===&quot;The Big Time&quot;, 1964–1970===
The success of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and the re-published version of &quot;Candy&quot; was the turning point in Southern&#x27;s career, making him one of the most celebrated writers of his day. In the words of biographer Lee Hill, Southern spent the next six years in &quot;an Olympian realm of glamour, money, constant motion and excitement&quot;, mixing and working with international literary, film, music, and TV stars. His work on &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; opened the doors to lucrative work as a screenwriter and script doctor, and allowed him to greatly increase his fee, from the reported $2,000 he received for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; to as much as $100,000 thereafter.

During the latter half of the 1960s, Southern worked on the screenplays of a string of &quot;cult&quot; films. His credits in this period include &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969), and &quot;End of the Road&quot; (1970).

====&quot;The Loved One&quot;, &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;====
In early 1964, Southern was hired to collaborate with British author Christopher Isherwood on a screen adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;The Loved One&quot;, directed by British filmmaker Tony Richardson. When filming was postponed in the spring of 1964, Southern returned to East Canaan and continued work on a rewrite of the script for the film version of John Fowles&#x27; &quot;The Collector&quot; but he eventually withdrew from the project because he disagreed with the change to the story&#x27;s ending.

In August 1964, the Southerns moved to Los Angeles, where Terry began work on the screenplay of &quot;The Loved One&quot;, for which MGM/Filmways paid him $3,000 per month. Southern&#x27;s work and his networking and socializing brought him into contact with many Hollywood stars, including Ben Gazzara, Jennifer Jones, Janice Rule, George Segal, Richard Benjamin, James Coburn, Peter Fonda, and Dennis Hopper and his wife Brooke Hayward. Hopper, a fan and collector of modern art, later introduced Southern to British gallery owner and art dealer Robert Fraser.

Not long after arriving in Los Angeles, Southern met Gail Gerber, a young Canadian-born actress and dancer, on the MGM backlot. Gerber, who used the stage name Gail Gilmore, was working as a dancer on an Elvis Presley movie, and she had a non-speaking role in &quot;The Loved One&quot;. Southern and Gerber soon began an affair. The relationship intensified during July/August 1964, and after Southern&#x27;s wife and son went back to East Canaan, Southern and Gerber moved in together in a suite at the Chateau Marmont hotel.

He and Kauffman were divorced in 1965.

Working with Richardson and Isherwood, Southern turned Waugh&#x27;s novel into &quot;an all-out attack on Hollywood, consumerism, and the hypocrisies surrounding man&#x27;s fear of death&quot;. Southern also wrote the text for a souvenir book, which featured photos by William Claxton.

Work on the film continued through most of 1965, with Southern and Gerber spending much of their leisure time with their newfound film star friends in Malibu, California. &quot;Loved One&quot; co-producer John Calley was a frequent visitor to Southern&#x27;s Chateau Marmont suite, and he hired Southern to work on several subsequent Filmways projects, including &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot;.

Soon after the principal shooting on &quot;The Loved One&quot; was concluded, Southern began work on the script of &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, which starred Steve McQueen. He was one of several writers who had worked on versions of the screenplay, including Paddy Chayefsky, George Good, and Ring Lardner Jr. Original director Sam Peckinpah was fired one week into shooting, allegedly because he shot unauthorized nude scenes. (He did not make another film until 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.) He was replaced by Norman Jewison, and during his work on this production, Southern formed a close and enduring friendship with cast member Rip Torn.

====&quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Barbarella&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;====
By 1966, the film adaptations of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, had become a successful and popular film franchise. However, the rights to Fleming&#x27;s first Bond novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot; had been secured by rival producer Charles K. Feldman. He had attempted to get &quot;Casino Royale&quot; made as an Eon Productions James Bond film, but Broccoli and Saltzman turned him down. Believing he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman then decided to shoot the film as a parody, not only of James Bond but of the entire spy fiction genre. The casino segment featuring Peter Sellers and Orson Welles is the only portion based upon the novel.

Southern and Gail Gerber moved to London in early 1966, when Southern was hired to work on the screenplay of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The episodic &quot;quasi-psychedelic burlesque&quot; proved to be a chaotic production, stitched together from segments variously directed or co-directed by a team that included Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish, Val Guest, John Huston, Richard Talmadge, and Ken Hughes. Many planned scenes could not be filmed due to the feud between Orson Welles and star Peter Sellers, which climaxed with Sellers walking out during the filming of the casino scenes and refusing to return. Many writers contributed to the screenplay, including Southern (who wrote most of the dialogue for Sellers), Woody Allen, Wolf Mankowitz, Michael Sayers, Frank Buxton, Joseph Heller, Ben Hecht, Mickey Rose, and Billy Wilder.

Southern had been introduced to Robert Fraser by Dennis Hopper, and when he went to London to work on &quot;Casino Royale&quot; he and Gail became part of Fraser&#x27;s &quot;jet-set&quot; salon that included the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, photographer Michael Cooper, interior designer Christopher Gibbs, model-actress Anita Pallenberg, filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, painter Francis Bacon, producer Sandy Lieberson, Guinness heir Tara Browne, and model Donyale Luna. Southern became close friends with photographer Michael Cooper, who was part of the Rolling Stones&#x27; inner circle and who shot the cover photos for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; LP.

Southern attended the Cannes Film Festival in the spring of 1966, where he met Andy Warhol and Gerard Malanga, and he remained in touch with Malanga for many years. On his return to London, he continued work on the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; screenplay and a screen adaptation of &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; for Peter Sellers, who was planning his film version. Sandy Lieberson optioned Southern&#x27;s first novel &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot; and United Artists optioned &quot;Candy&quot;. Michael Cooper also introduced Southern to the Anthony Burgess novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, and Southern later encouraged Stanley Kubrick to make his film version of the book after MGM refused to back Kubrick&#x27;s planned film on Napoleon. Southern and Cooper then began to plan their own film adaptation of the novel, to star Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones as Alex and his gang of droogs.

Through Si Litvinoff, Southern optioned the book for the bargain price of $1,000 (against a final price of $10,000), and Lieberson and David Puttnam set up a development deal with Paramount, who underwrote a draft by Southern and Cooper. Actor David Hemmings was briefly considered for the role of Alex—much to the chagrin of Cooper and the Stones—and the director&#x27;s chair was initially offered to Richard Lester, who turned it down. Southern&#x27;s old friend Ted Kotcheff was then approached, but at this point, the project stalled – under the British censorship regulations of the time, the treatment had to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain, who returned it, unread, with a note attached that said: &quot;I know this book and there is no way you can make a movie of it. It deals with youthful incitement, which is illegal.&quot; As a result, Paramount put it into &#x27;turnaround&#x27; and it was eventually picked up by Kubrick three years later.

During the frequent downtime during the filming of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Filmways hired Southern to do a &quot;tightening and brightening&quot; job on the screenplay of the occult thriller &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, which starred David Niven and featured Sharon Tate in her first film role. Through the winter of 1966–67 he also began work on the screenplay for Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Barbarella&quot;, and he contributed to a TV version of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; directed by Ted Kotcheff and starring George Segal and Yvette Mimieux.

The June 1, 1967, release of &quot;Sgt Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; gave Southern pop-culture immortality, thanks to his photograph being included (on the recommendation of Ringo Starr) on the album&#x27;s front-cover collage, which was photographed by Cooper. Soon after, a collection of his short writing &quot;Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes&quot;, was published in the US. It received favorable reviews from critics, and the cover blurb featured a highly complimentary quote from Gore Vidal, who described Southern as &quot;the most profoundly witty writer of our generation&quot;.

Work on &quot;Barbarella&quot; continued through to late 1967, and Southern convinced Vadim to cast his friend Anita Pallenberg in the role of the Black Queen. In December 1967 the film version of &quot;Candy&quot; began shooting in Rome with director Christian Marquand. It starred newcomer Ewa Aulin in the title role and like &quot;Casino Royale&quot; it featured a host of stars in cameo roles, including Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, John Astin, Ringo Starr, Walter Matthau, and Anita Pallenberg.

The original screenplay by Southern was rewritten by Buck Henry (who also has an uncredited cameo in the film). Like &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, it proved to be a chaotic production and failed to live up to expectations; it was generally panned by critics on its release in December 1968 and its impact was further weakened by the financial collapse of its major backer.

====&quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;The End Of The Road&quot;====
As production on &quot;Barbarella&quot; wound down in October 1967, director Roger Vadim began shooting his episode of the omnibus film &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot;, which co-starred Peter Fonda and Vadim&#x27;s wife Jane Fonda. It was during the making of this film that Peter Fonda told Southern of his desire to make a &#x27;modern Western&#x27; in which motorbike riders substituted for cowboys, a concept that had been largely inspired by the success of Roger Corman&#x27;s influential low-budget &quot;exploitation&quot; biker films &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966) and its follow-ups, in which Fonda and his close friend Dennis Hopper had featured. Fonda pitched his idea to Hopper on his return to America, and Southern added his weight to the project, agreeing to work on the script for scale ($350 per week).

Southern, Fonda, and Hopper met in New York City in November 1967 to develop their ideas. These brainstorming sessions formed the basis of the screenplay that Southern then wrote from December 1967 to April 1968. On the basis of Southern&#x27;s treatment, Raybert Productions, which had produced the TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot; and the Monkees movie &quot;Head&quot;, agreed to finance the film with a budget of US$350,000 (in return for one-third of the profits), with Columbia Pictures agreeing to distribute the film.

Southern eventually shared the writing credit with Hopper and Fonda, but there has been some dispute over their various contributions to the screenplay. Hopper and Fonda later tried to downplay Southern&#x27;s input, claiming that many sections of the film (such as the graveyard scene and the Mardi Gras sequence) had been improvised, whereas others involved in the production (including Southern himself) have asserted that most of these scenes were fully scripted and primarily written by him.

Although the basic concept for the film was Fonda&#x27;s, the title &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was provided by Southern (it is a slang term from the American South for a prostitute&#x27;s lover who lives off her) and Southern wrote several early drafts of the screenplay. During the production, Southern became concerned at Hopper and Fonda&#x27;s replacement of his writing by what he described as &quot;dumb-bell dialogue&quot;, and more of the material Southern wrote for the main characters was cut out during the editing process. Also, Fonda and Hopper mostly improvised a great deal as they filmed.

Southern had originally written the character of the small-town lawyer (played by Jack Nicholson) with his friend Rip Torn in mind, but Torn dropped out of the project after an altercation with Hopper in a New York restaurant, in which the two actors almost came to blows.

Southern continued to work on other projects while &quot;Easy Rider&quot; began shooting—he completed his next novel &quot;Blue Movie&quot;; began working with the painter Larry Rivers on a book project &quot;The Donkey and The Darling&quot;; he worked on the final drafts of the screenplay for &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;, and he began discussions with Aram Avakian about a movie project called &quot;The End of the Road&quot;.

In the summer 1968, he was approached by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine to cover the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Southern attended the event with Burroughs, Jean Genet (a last-minute substitute for Samuel Beckett), and John Sack, and his friend Michael Cooper took photographs; Southern and friends were present when peaceful demonstrations erupted into savage violence after protesters were attacked by police. Southern&#x27;s essay on the event was his last work published by &quot;Esquire&quot;.

The editing of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; continued for many months, as Hopper and Fonda argued over the final form. Hopper ditched a planned score by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and returned to the group of songs he had used for the rough cut, which included music by The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Steppenwolf. &quot;Easy Rider&quot; caused a sensation when it was screened in Cannes and it went on to become the fourth highest-grossing American film of 1969, taking $19 million, and receiving two Academy Award nominations. Although it brought Hopper and Fonda great financial and artistic rewards and helped to open up the Hollywood &#x27;system&#x27; for young independent producers, little of the profit was shared with Southern, and the true extent of his contributions was repeatedly downplayed by the other principals.

Southern&#x27;s next major screenplay was &quot;The End of the Road&quot;, adapted from the novel by John Barth and starring Stacy Keach, Dorothy Tristan and James Earl Jones. It was directed by his friend Aram Avakian. The director and the film were the subject of a major spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in November 1969, which reportedly led to a critical backlash, and the film was savaged on its release and was especially criticized because of a graphic scene in which the main female character undergoes an abortion, which led to the film being classified with an &quot;X&quot; rating.

====&quot;The Magic Christian&quot;====

&quot;The Magic Christian&quot; was one of Peter Sellers&#x27; favorite books—his gift of a copy to Stanley Kubrick led to Southern being hired for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;—and a film version of the book had long been a dream project for the actor, who intended to play the lead role of Guy Grand. In 1968 Southern was hired for the production and he worked on a dozen drafts of the screenplay. Sellers also tinkered with it while Southern was working on &quot;The End of the Road&quot;. At Sellers&#x27; request, a draft by Southern and director Joseph McGrath was re-written by Graham Chapman and John Cleese, two young British TV comedy writers who soon became famous as members of the Monty Python team. Cleese later described McGrath as having &quot;no idea of comedy structure&quot; and complained that the film ended up as &quot;a series of celebrity walk-ons.&quot;

The film was shot in London between February and May 1969. The cast was headed by Sellers (as Guy Grand) and Ringo Starr as his son Youngman Grand (a new character created for the movie), with cameo appearances by Spike Milligan, Christopher Lee, Laurence Harvey, Raquel Welch, Roman Polanski and Yul Brynner. As with &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Sellers habitually improvised on the script during filming. During production McGrath and Southern discussed a future project based on the life of gangster Dutch Schultz, to be made in collaboration with Burroughs and Trocchi, but nothing came of it.

&quot;The Magic Christian&quot; ends with a scene in which Grand fills a huge vat with offal and excrement and then throws money into the fetid mixture to demonstrate how far people will go to get money for nothing. The original plan was to film the climactic scene at the Statue of Liberty in New York, and the US National Park Service agreed to the request. Sellers, McGrath and Southern then traveled to New York on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (at a reported cost of $10,000 per person) but the studio then refused to pay for the shoot and it had to be relocated to London. The scene was eventually shot on the South Bank, near the site of the new National Theatre building. The film premiered on February 12, 1970, to lukewarm reviews.

===Later career===
Southern&#x27;s pre-eminence waned rapidly in the 1970s—his screen credits decreased, his book and story output dwindled, and he acquired a reputation as an out-of-control substance abuser. He continued to drink heavily and take various drugs; in particular, his dependence on Dexamyl badly affected his health as he aged. Biographer Lee Hill suggests that Southern was a functioning alcoholic and that his image was largely based on his occasional public appearances in New York, partying and socializing; in private, he remained a tireless worker.

His later career was complicated by ongoing financial woes. In the late 1960s, Southern&#x27;s spendthrift ways and lack of financial acumen led him into trouble and he was audited by the IRS on several occasions beginning in 1972, resulting in heavy tax bills and penalties. Tax problems dogged him for the rest of his life. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

As revealed by documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, Southern and his wife Carol had been put under surveillance by the FBI starting in 1965. In a 2000 article, Burroughs intimate Victor Bockris (who profiled Southern for &quot;Interview&quot;) speculated that this surveillance and Southern&#x27;s &quot;IRS harassment&quot; (a strategy concurrently employed by the Nixon administration against the more fiscally sound Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg) left him effectively blacklisted by Hollywood, although perceived betrayals from such putatively close friends as Hoffenberg and Hopper vis-à-vis his longstanding history of substance abuse and tangible opportunities in other media may have played the catalytic role in eroding Southern&#x27;s efficacy as a writer.

==== 1970s====
In December 1970, Southern found himself in the position of having to beg Dennis Hopper for a profit point on &quot;Easy Rider&quot;—a request Hopper refused. Southern&#x27;s tenuous financial position was in contrast to that of his creative partners, who became wealthy thanks to the film&#x27;s commercial success. For the rest of his life, Southern was repeatedly forced to take on work in order to pay tax bills and penalties, and on many occasions he struggled to keep up the mortgage payments on the East Canaan farm.

&quot;Blue Movie&quot; was published in the fall of 1970, with a dedication to Stanley Kubrick. It received only moderate reviews, and sales were hampered by the refusal of the &quot;New York Times&quot; to run ads for the book.

Southern worked on a variety of screenplays in the immediate aftermath of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, including &quot;God Is Love&quot;, &quot;DJ&quot; (based on a book by Norman Mailer), &quot;Hand-Painted Hearts&quot; (based on a story by Thomas Baum), and &quot;Drift&quot; with Tony Goodstone. While Fonda and Hopper continued to assert that much of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; had been improvised, Southern remained largely silent about his role, although he was prompted to write a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot; to counter a claim that Jack Nicholson had improvised his speech during the film&#x27;s campfire scene.

Terry and Carol Southern remained on good terms and Southern continued to support and help raise their son Nile. The IRS investigations had also affected Carol, who had an inheritance from her late father seized as part of Terry&#x27;s tax settlement. She later became an editor with Crown Publishing, and married critic Alexander Keneas.

Southern&#x27;s other unrealized projects during this period included an adaptation of Nathanael West&#x27;s &quot;A Cool Million&quot;, and a screenplay called &quot;Merlin&quot;, based on Arthurian legend, which was written with Mick Jagger in mind for the lead role.

Southern covered the Rolling Stones 1972 American Tour, where he met and began a collaboration with Peter Beard, and they worked sporadically on the never-filmed screenplay &quot;The End of the Game&quot; until Southern&#x27;s death. Southern immersed himself in the bacchanalian atmosphere of the tour, and his essay on the Stones tour, &quot;Riding The Lapping Tongue&quot;, was published in the August 12, 1972, edition of &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. He also wrote a bawdy anti-Nixon sketch which was performed at a George McGovern fundraiser, and &quot;Twirlin&#x27; at Ole Miss&quot; was included in &quot;The New Journalism&quot;.

Because of his acute money problems (exacerbated by the IRS affair), Southern took an adjunct lectureship in screenwriting at New York University, where he taught from the fall of 1972 to the spring of 1974; although popular among students, he was ultimately dismissed for holding his classes in a local bar. His students included Amy Heckerling (who directed &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; and &quot;Clueless&quot;), literary agent Nancy Nigrosh, and Hollywood biographer Lee Server. Southern began writing for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; in November 1972 and served on the jury at the 1972 New York Erotic Film Festival with Burroughs, Gore Vidal, and Sylvia Miles.

In a 1973 &quot;Playboy&quot; profile, Mason Hoffenberg (who had conquered his heroin addiction with methadone maintenance and was living in alcoholic codependency with Richard Manuel of The Band near Woodstock, New York) claimed that &quot;everything went right for Southern... he was ejaculated to fame and screenplays&quot; and &quot;Terry Southern is a good rewriter and he writes some funny shit himself, but he always grabs top billing&quot;; in an ensuing defamation suit between the erstwhile collaborators, Southern alleged that Hoffenberg&#x27;s representation had cost him several screenwriting jobs.

In 1973, Southern wrote a new screenplay called &quot;Double Date&quot;, which in some respects anticipated the later David Cronenberg film &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, but he eventually abandoned it. In early 1974, influential Warner Bros. producer John Calley hired Southern to adapt &quot;Blue Movie&quot; for the screen; although Mike Nichols was slated to direct, the deal eventually fell apart due to a protracted dispute between Warners and Ringo Starr, who then owned the screen rights.

A new short story, &quot;Fixing Up Ert&quot;, was published in the September 1974 edition of &quot;Oui&quot; magazine, and around this time Norwegian director Ingmar Ejve hired Southern to write a screenplay based on the Carl-Henning Wijkmark novel &quot;The Hunters of Karin Hall&quot;. His friend Ted Kotcheff hired Southern to write the screenplay for the Watergate-themed project &quot;A Piece of Bloody Cake&quot;, but he was unable to get the script approved.

Southern&#x27;s only on-screen credit during the 1970s was the teleplay &quot;Stop Thief!&quot;, written for the TV miniseries &quot;The American Parade&quot; (based on the life of 19th Century American political cartoonist Thomas Nast). Southern once again accompanied the Rolling Stones on their Tour of the Americas &#x27;75 and contributed text to a commemorative 1978 coffee table book (&quot;The Rolling Stones On Tour&quot;) featuring photographs by Annie Leibovitz and Christopher Sykes.

In the summer of 1976, Southern visited Rip Torn in New Mexico during the making of Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in the crowd in the scene where Newton is arrested just before he boards his spacecraft. Roeg used an excerpt from &quot;The End of the Road&quot; on one of the TV screens, in the scene in which Newton watches multiple TV sets at the same time.

In 1977 and 1978 Southern was embroiled in a lengthy and chaotic attempt to make a film version of Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;Junkie&quot;, but the project collapsed due to the erratic behavior of its principal backer, Jules Stein. In August 1978 Southern wrote a skit called &quot;Haven Can Wait&quot; that was performed by Jon Voight, Allen Ginsberg, Bobby Seale, and Rip Torn at a benefit for Abbie Hoffman.

Another unsuccessful project from this period was his work for Si Litvinoff on the screenplay for the opera drama &quot;Aria&quot;. Southern&#x27;s script was considered &#x27;below par&#x27; and was rejected by Fox. At the decade&#x27;s end, a new story was published in the 20th-anniversary issue of the &quot;Paris Review&quot; and &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was optioned once again by Andrew Braunsberg.

Southern read from a work in progress (&quot;Vignette of Idealistic Life in South Texas&quot;) at the Nova Convention (a symposium in Burroughs&#x27; honor organized by academic Sylvere Lotringer at the East Village&#x27;s Entermedia Theater in November 1978), opening the second night on a bill that included Philip Glass, Brion Gysin, John Giorno, Patti Smith, and Burroughs himself.

Although he continued to reside in northern Connecticut &quot;beyond the commuter belt&quot;, Southern maintained his social life in New York with diligence; longtime girlfriend Gail Gerber often drove him to Studio 54 (where he cultivated a convivial acquaintance with co-owner Steve Rubell), parties hosted by George Plimpton, and other engagements.

Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Being There&quot; (1979), Peter Sellers had a chance meeting with an arms dealer during an air flight that inspired him to contact Southern and ask him to write a script on the subject of the shady world of the international arms trade. The resulting screenplay, &quot;Grossing Out&quot;, was reputed to have been of high quality, and Hal Ashby was provisionally attached as director, but the project went into limbo after Sellers&#x27; sudden death from a heart attack on 24 July 1980.

==== 1980s====
Under the pseudonym of Norwood Pratt, Southern co-wrote the 1980 sci fi-themed hardcore pornographic film &quot;Randy: The Electric Lady&quot;; director Philip Schuman had previously adapted &quot;Red Dirt&quot; into an award-winning short.

A year later, he was hired by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; head writer Michael O&#x27;Donoghue (who had solicited contributions from Southern as editor of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; a decade earlier) to write for the 1981–82 series of the NBC show in his efforts to revitalize the then-foundering sketch comedy program. This controversial period, which followed the departure of the last members of the original cast and founding producer Lorne Michaels, is widely regarded as the lowest point of the series&#x27; history. According to Carol Southern, it was &quot;the only job he ever held&quot;. Despite his longstanding acquaintance with O&#x27;Donoghue and his penchant for the alcohol, cocaine and cannabis that flowed liberally backstage, Southern had trouble fitting in stylistically with the younger writers; many of his ideas and sketches were rejected by the staff and new producer Dick Ebersol for being too subtle, sexually gratuitous, or overly political.

Nevertheless, Southern facilitated the booking of Miles Davis as musical guest for the October 17 show in support of &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot; (a significant public appearance following the trumpeter&#x27;s 1975–1980 retirement) and arranged for Burroughs—who read selections from his oeuvre at a desk—to appear as a guest performer during the November 7th episode; it was the writer&#x27;s first appearance on American national television. Southern was retained as a writer for the remainder of the season after O&#x27;Donoghue — who frequently clashed with the network and Ebersol — was fired from the series.

Southern&#x27;s involvement with the show led to a bona fide collaboration with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alum Nelson Lyon, who had previously added the unproductive Southern&#x27;s name to his sketches in a gesture of magnanimity. They developed a project set in and around The Cotton Club in the 1930s, but it was eventually abandoned after Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans&#x27;s similarly themed film went into production.

During 1982–83 Southern worked with Kubrick&#x27;s former production partner James B. Harris on a naval drama called &quot;The Gold Crew&quot; (later retitled &quot;Floaters&quot;), but Southern was diverted from this when he began working with his close friend Larry Rivers on an independent film project called &quot;At Z Beach&quot;.

In April 1983, he was approached to work on a planned sequel to &quot;Easy Rider&quot; called &quot;Biker Heaven&quot;. He had little to do with the script, but he was paid about $20,000, which was several times more than he had earned from the original. Around this time Stanley Kubrick requested some sample dialogue for a planned film adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s book &quot;Traumnovelle&quot; which was to star Steve Martin, but Southern&#x27;s ribald submissions reportedly sabotaged any prospect of further involvement; Kubrick eventually made the film (as &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) shortly before his death in 1999.

A new story by Southern was published in &quot;High Times&quot; in May 1983. Shortly thereafter, Hopper invited Southern to work on a planned biographical film of Jim Morrison which was to be backed by publisher Larry Flynt. Because Flynt did not own the screen rights to Morrison&#x27;s story, the project collapsed; however, Flynt continued to retain Southern as head speechwriter for his ersatz 1984 presidential campaign.

Southern turned 60 in 1984, and his career continued to alternate between promise and disappointment. &quot;Flash and Filigree&quot; was reissued by Arbor House with a new introduction by Burroughs, and Sandy Lieberson (now at Fox) hired him to work on a script called &quot;Intensive Heat&quot;, based on the life of jewel thief Albie Baker. During this period, Southern ran into problems with his long-overdue new book (a &quot;bildungsroman&quot; inspired by his Texas childhood alternatively known as &quot;Youngblood&quot;, &quot;Southern Idyll&quot; and &quot;Behind the Grassy Knoll&quot;) when Putnam demanded the return of the $20,000 advance, precipitating his abandonment of the work. In 1985, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; were reprinted by Penguin and Southern featured prominently in the Howard Brookner documentary &quot;Burroughs&quot;.

====Hawkeye====
In October 1985 Southern was appointed as one of the directors of Hawkeye, a production company set up by his friend Harry Nilsson to oversee the various film and multimedia projects in which he was involved. Southern and Nilsson collaborated on several screenplays, including &quot;Obits&quot;, a &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;-style story about a journalist investigating the subject of a newspaper obituary, but the script was scathingly reviewed by a studio reader and was never given approval.

The only major Hawkeye project to see the light of day was &quot;The Telephone&quot;. Essentially a one-handed comedy-drama, it depicted the gradual mental disintegration of an out-of-work actor. It was written with Robin Williams in mind but Williams turned it down. Nilsson and Southern then learned that comedian Whoopi Goldberg was keen to take the part and she asked Nilsson and Southern to rewrite it for her. New World Films agreed to produce it and Rip Torn signed on as director.

Production began in January 1987, but New World allowed Goldberg to improvise freely on the screenplay. She also replaced Torn&#x27;s chosen DOP John Alonzo with then-husband David Claessen. Torn battled with Goldberg and reportedly had to beg her to perform takes that stuck to the script. A year-long struggle then ensued between Hawkeye and New World/Goldberg over the rights to the final cut. Southern and Torn put together their own version, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1988; New World&#x27;s version premiered in cinemas later that month to generally poor reviews.

The steady salary from Hawkeye was a considerable help to the perennially cash-strapped Southern, but this changed abruptly in late 1989 when Hawkeye folded after Nilsson discovered that secretary-treasurer Cindy Sims had embezzled all the company funds and most of the money Nilsson had earned from his music, leaving him virtually penniless. At this point, Southern still owed the IRS some $30,000 in back taxes and $40,000 in penalties.

Apart from &quot;The Telephone&quot;, Southern&#x27;s only published new output in the period 1985–90 was the liner notes for the Marianne Faithfull album &quot;Strange Weather&quot; and a commentary on the Iran-Contra scandal in &quot;The Nation&quot;.

===Last years===
In February 1989 Southern was admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, where he underwent surgery for stomach cancer. Soon after the surgery, he was interviewed by Mike Golden, and excerpts were published in &quot;Reflex&quot;, &quot;Creative Writer&quot;, and &quot;Paris Review&quot;. After he recovered from his surgery, Southern collaborated with cartoonist R. O. Blechman on a project called &quot;Billionaire&#x27;s Ball&quot;, based on the life of Howard Hughes.

Southern landed a job teaching at the Sundance Screenwriters Lab in the summer of 1989. He also assisted with the preparation and publication of &quot;Blinds and Shutters&quot;, a book on the photography of his late friend Michael Cooper, edited by Perry Richardson and published in a limited edition of 2000, with copies signed by Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, and Allen Ginsberg.

Southern met briefly with Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg to discuss his forthcoming adaptation of Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, but the meeting was unsuccessful and he had no further involvement in the project, which was ultimately scripted by Cronenberg himself. In November 1989, a conversation with Victor Bockris was published in &quot;Interview&quot;. His profile was given another small boost by the re-publication of &quot;Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes&quot; in 1990.

With encouragement from his son Nile, Southern returned to his long-shelved Texas novel. Retitled &quot;Texas Summer&quot;, it was published in 1992 by Richard Seaver. Southern&#x27;s last two major articles were published during 1991; a piece on the Texas band ZZ Top appeared in the February edition of &quot;Spin&quot;, and an article on the Gulf War appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot; on July 8. During the year Southern was also invited to teach screenwriting at Columbia University&#x27;s School of the Arts and School of General Studies as an adjunct professor, where he worked until his death.

In 1992, he collaborated with Joseph McGrath on a screenplay &quot;Starlets&quot; (later retitled &quot;Festival&quot;), which satirized the Cannes Film Festival. Peter Fonda reportedly tried to prevail on Southern to give up any claim on &quot;Easy Rider&quot; in exchange for a payment of $30,000, but Southern refused. Southern also assisted Perry Richardson with another book based around Michael Cooper&#x27;s photography, &quot;The Early Stones&quot;, which was published late in the year.

Southern&#x27;s health deteriorated in the last two years of his life, and he suffered a mild stroke in November 1992. In February 1993, he made his last visit home to Texas, where he attended a commemorative screening of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; at the Dallas Museum of Art. During 1994, he made a series of recordings of readings from his works for a projected tribute project coordinated by producer Hal Willner and Nelson Lyon, but the recording process was complicated by Southern&#x27;s fragile health and the project remained unreleased until recently.

Southern&#x27;s close friend Harry Nilsson died of a heart attack in January 1994. Later that year, he was commissioned by Little, Brown to write a memoir, but only two chapters were ever completed.

In September 1995, Southern received the Gotham Award for lifetime achievement by the Independent Film Producers Association at the age of 71. The &quot;Easy Rider&quot; controversy reared its head again shortly before Southern&#x27;s death when Dennis Hopper alleged during an interview on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that Rip Torn had been replaced because he had pulled a knife on Hopper during their argument in New York in 1968. Torn sued Hopper over the remark, and Southern agreed to testify on Torn&#x27;s behalf. The case brought to light several of Southern&#x27;s drafts of the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; screenplay, which effectively ended the dispute over his contributions.

In 1995, shortly before his death, Southern hired a new agent and began making arrangements for the republication of &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; by Grove. His final project was the text for a 1996 coffee table book about Virgin Records. He appeared at the Yale Summer Writing Program mid-year. Franz Douskey, a creative writer at Yale, told a reporter from the Yale Daily that Southern was giving a non-lecture, trying to gasp through calcified lungs. In October, he made his last media appearance when he was interviewed for a documentary on cult Scottish novelist Trocchi.

On October 25, 1995, Southern collapsed on the steps of Columbia&#x27;s Dodge Hall while en route to his class. He was taken to the adjacent St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, where he died four days later of respiratory failure. According to Bruce Jay Friedman, Southern&#x27;s final words were &quot;What&#x27;s the delay?&quot;

In early 2003, Southern&#x27;s archives of manuscripts, correspondence, and photographs were acquired by the New York Public Library. The archives include correspondence and other items from George Plimpton, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Frank O&#x27;Hara, Larry Rivers, William Styron, V.S. Pritchett, Gore Vidal, Abbie Hoffman, and Edmund Wilson, as well as John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and the Rolling Stones.

A film adaptation of Southern&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was (at some point) &quot;currently&quot; in production from director Michael Dowse and producer Marc Toberoff, to be released by Vertigo Films.

<text>In mathematics, the Poincaré lemma gives a sufficient condition for a closed differential form to be exact (while an exact form is necessarily closed). Precisely, it states that every closed &quot;p&quot;-form on an open ball in R&quot;n&quot; is exact for &quot;p&quot; with . The lemma was introduced by Henri Poincaré in 1886.

Especially in calculus, the Poincaré lemma also says that every closed 1-form on a simply connected open subset in formula_1 is exact.

In the language of cohomology, the Poincaré lemma says that the &quot;k&quot;-th de Rham cohomology group of a contractible open subset of a manifold &quot;M&quot; (e.g., formula_2) vanishes for formula_3. In particular, it implies that the de Rham complex yields a resolution of the constant sheaf formula_4 on &quot;M&quot;. The singular cohomology of a contractible space vanishes in positive degree, but the Poincaré lemma &quot;does not follow&quot; from this, since the fact that the singular cohomology of a manifold can be computed as the de Rham cohomology of it, that is, the de Rham theorem, relies on the Poincaré lemma. It does, however, mean that it is enough to prove the Poincaré lemma for open balls; the version for contractible manifolds then follows from the topological consideration.

The Poincaré lemma is also a special case of the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology; in fact, it is common to establish the lemma by showing the homotopy invariance or at least a version of it.

== Proofs ==
A standard proof of the Poincaré lemma uses the homotopy invariance formula (cf. see the proofs below as well as Integration along fibers#Example). The local form of the homotopy operator is described in and the connection of the lemma with the Maurer-Cartan form is explained in .

===Direct proof ===
The Poincaré lemma can be proved by means of integration along fibers. (This approach is a straightforward generalization of constructing a primitive function by means of integration in calculus.)

We shall prove the lemma for an open subset formula_5 that is star-shaped or a cone over formula_6; i.e., if formula_7 is in formula_8, then formula_9 is in formula_8 for formula_11. This case in particular covers the open ball case, since an open ball can be assumed to centered at the origin without loss of generality.

The trick is to consider differential forms on formula_12 (we use formula_13 for the coordinate on formula_6). First define the operator formula_15 (called the fiber integration) for &quot;k&quot;-forms on formula_16 by
:formula_17
where formula_18, formula_19 and similarly for formula_20 and formula_21. Now, for formula_22, since formula_23, using the differentiation under the integral sign, we have:
:formula_24
where formula_25 denote the restrictions of formula_26 to the hyperplanes formula_27 and they are zero since formula_28 is zero there. If formula_29, then a similar computation gives
:formula_30.
Thus, the above formula holds for any formula_31-form formula_26 on formula_16. (The formula is a special case of a formula sometimes called the relative Stokes formula.)

Finally, let formula_34 and then set formula_35. Then, with the notation formula_36, we get: for any formula_31-form formula_38 on formula_8,
:formula_40
the formula known as the homotopy formula. The operator formula_41 is called the homotopy operator (also called a chain homotopy). Now, if formula_38 is closed, formula_43. On the other hand, formula_44 and formula_45, the latter because there is no nonzero higher form at a point. Hence,
:formula_46
which proves the Poincaré lemma.

The same proof in fact shows the Poincaré lemma for any contractible open subset &quot;U&quot; of a manifold. Indeed, given such a &quot;U&quot;, we have the homotopy formula_47 with formula_48 the identity and formula_49 a point. Approximating such formula_47, we can assume formula_47 is in fact smooth. The fiber integration formula_15 is also defined for formula_53. Hence, the same argument goes through.

=== Proof using Lie derivatives ===
Cartan&#x27;s magic formula for Lie derivatives can be used to give a short proof of the Poincaré lemma. The formula states that the Lie derivative along a vector field formula_54 is given as:

:formula_55
where formula_56 denotes the interior product; i.e., formula_57.

Let formula_58 be a smooth family of smooth maps for some open subset &quot;U&quot; of formula_1 such that formula_60 is defined for &quot;t&quot; in some closed interval &quot;I&quot; and formula_60 is a diffeomorphism for &quot;t&quot; in the interior of &quot;I&quot;. Let formula_62 denote the tangent vectors to the curve formula_63; i.e., formula_64. For a fixed &quot;t&quot; in the interior of &quot;I&quot;, let formula_65. Then formula_66. Thus, by the definition of a Lie derivative,
:formula_67.
That is,
:formula_68
Assume formula_69. Then, integrating both sides of the above and then using Cartan&#x27;s formula and the differentiation under the integral sign, we get: for formula_70,
:formula_71
where the integration means the integration of each coefficient in a differential form. Letting formula_72, we then have:
:formula_73
with the notation formula_74

Now, assume formula_8 is an open ball with center formula_76; then we can take formula_77. Then the above formula becomes:
:formula_78,
which proves the Poincaré lemma when formula_38 is closed.

=== Proof in the two-dimensional case===
In two dimensions the Poincaré lemma can be proved directly for closed 1-forms and 2-forms as follows.

If is a closed 1-form on , then . If then and . Set

:formula_80

so that . Then must satisfy and . The right hand side here is independent of &quot;x&quot; since its partial derivative with respect to &quot;x&quot; is 0. So

:formula_81

and hence

:formula_82

Similarly, if then with . Thus a solution is given by and

:formula_83

=== Inductive proof ===
It is also possible to give an inductive proof of Poincaré&#x27;s lemma which does not use homotopical arguments. Let formula_84, where formula_69, be the m dimensional coordinate cube. For a differential &quot;k&quot;-form formula_86, let its &quot;codegree&quot; be the integer &quot;m-k&quot;. The induction is performed over the codegree of the form. Since we are working over a coordinate domain, partial derivatives and also integrals with respect to the coordinates can be applied to a form itself, by applying them to the coefficients of the form with respect to the canonical coordinates.

First let formula_87, i.e. the codegree is 0. It can be written as formula_88so if we define formula_89 by formula_90, we haveformula_91hence, formula_92 is a primitive of formula_38.

Let now formula_86, where formula_95, i.e. formula_38 has codegree &quot;m-k&quot;, and let us suppose that whenever a closed form has codegree less than &quot;m-k&quot;, the form is exact. The form formula_38 can be decomposed asformula_98where neither formula_99 nor formula_100 contain any factor of formula_101. Define formula_102, then formula_103, where formula_104 does not contain any factor of formula_101, hence, defining formula_106, this form is also closed, but does not involve any factor of formula_101. Since this form is closed, we haveformula_108where the last term does not contain a factor of formula_101. Due to linear independence of the coordinate differentials, this equation implies thatformula_110i.e. the form formula_111 is a differential form in the variables formula_112 only, hence can be interpreted as an element of formula_113, and its codegree is thus &quot;m-k-1&quot;. The induction hypothesis applies, thus formula_114 for some formula_115, thereforeformula_116concluding the proof for a coordinate cube. In any manifold, every point has a neighborhood which is diffeomorphic to a coordinate cube, the proof also implies that on a manifold any closed &quot;k&quot;-form (for formula_117) is locally exact.

== Implication for de Rham cohomology ==
By definition, the &quot;k&quot;-th de Rham cohomology group formula_118 of an open subset &quot;U&quot; of a manifold &quot;M&quot; is defined as the quotient vector space
:formula_119
Hence, the conclusion of the Poincaré lemma is precisely that if formula_8 is an open ball, then formula_121 for formula_3. Now, differential forms determine a cochain complex called the de Rham complex:
:formula_123
where &quot;n&quot; = the dimension of &quot;M&quot; and formula_124 denotes the sheaf of differential &quot;k&quot;-forms; i.e., formula_125 consists of &quot;k&quot;-forms on &quot;U&quot; for each open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. It then gives rise to the complex (the augmented complex)
:formula_126
where formula_4 is the constant sheaf with values in formula_128; i.e., it is the sheaf of locally constant real-valued functions and formula_129 the inclusion.

The kernel of formula_130 is formula_4, since the smooth functions with zero derivatives are locally constant. Also, a sequence of sheaves is exact if and only if it is so locally. The Poincaré lemma thus says the rest of the sequence is exact too (since a manifold is locally diffeomorphic to an open subset of formula_1 and then each point has an open ball as a neighborhood). In the language of homological algebra, it means that the de Rham complex determines a resolution of the constant sheaf formula_4. This then implies the de Rham theorem; i.e., the de Rham cohomology of a manifold coincides with the singular cohomology of it (in short, because the singular cohomology can be viewed as a sheaf cohomology.)

Once one knows the de Rham theorem, the conclusion of the Poincaré lemma can then be obtained purely topologically. For example, it implies a version of the Poincaré lemma for contractible or simply connected open sets (see §Simply connected case).

== Simply connected case ==
Especially in calculus, the Poincaré lemma is stated for a simply connected open subset formula_5. In that case, the lemma says that each closed 1-form on &quot;U&quot; is exact. This version can be seen using algebraic topology as follows. The rational Hurewicz theorem (or rather the real analog of that) says that formula_135 since &quot;U&quot; is simply connected. Since formula_128 is a field, the &quot;k&quot;-th cohomology formula_137 is the dual vector space of the &quot;k&quot;-th homology formula_138. In particular, formula_139 By the de Rham theorem (which follows from the Poincaré lemma for open balls), formula_140 is the same as the first de Rham cohomology group (see §Implication to de Rham cohomology). Hence, each closed 1-form on &quot;U&quot; is exact.

== Poincaré lemma with compact support ==
There is a version of Poincaré lemma for compactly supported differential forms:

The pull-back along a proper map preserve compact supports; thus, the same proof as the usual one goes through.

==Complex-geometry analog==
On complex manifolds, the use of the Dolbeault operators formula_141 and formula_142 for complex differential forms, which refine the exterior derivative by the formula formula_143, lead to the notion of formula_142-closed and formula_142-exact differential forms. The local exactness result for such closed forms is known as the Dolbeault–Grothendieck lemma (or formula_142-Poincaré lemma); cf. . Importantly, the geometry of the domain on which a formula_142-closed differential form is formula_142-exact is more restricted than for the Poincaré lemma, since the proof of the Dolbeault–Grothendieck lemma holds on a polydisk (a product of disks in the complex plane, on which the multidimensional Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula may be applied) and there exist counterexamples to the lemma even on contractible domains. The formula_142-Poincaré lemma holds in more generality for pseudoconvex domains.

Using both the Poincaré lemma and the formula_142-Poincaré lemma, a refined local formula_151-Poincaré lemma can be proven, which is valid on domains upon which both the aforementioned lemmas are applicable. This lemma states that formula_152-closed complex differential forms are actually locally formula_151-exact (rather than just formula_152 or formula_142-exact, as implied by the above lemmas).

== Relative Poincaré lemma ==
The relative Poincaré lemma generalizes Poincaré lemma from a point to a submanifold (or some more general locally closed subset). It states: let &quot;V&quot; be a submanifold of a manifold &quot;M&quot; and &quot;U&quot; a tubular neighborhood of &quot;V&quot;. If formula_156 is a closed &quot;k&quot;-form on &quot;U&quot;, &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, that vanishes on &quot;V&quot;, then there exists a (&quot;k&quot;-1)-form formula_157 on &quot;U&quot; such that formula_158 and formula_157 vanishes on &quot;V&quot;.

The relative Poincaré lemma can be proved in the same way the original Poincaré lemma is proved. Indeed, since &quot;U&quot; is a tubular neighborhood, there is a smooth strong deformation retract from &quot;U&quot; to &quot;V&quot;; i.e., there is a smooth homotopy formula_160 from the projection formula_161 to the identity such that formula_47 is the identity on &quot;V&quot;. Then we have the homotopy formula on &quot;U&quot;:
:formula_163
where formula_41 is the homotopy operator given by either Lie derivatives or integration along fibers. Now, formula_165 and so formula_166. Since formula_167 and formula_168, we get formula_169; take formula_170. That formula_157 vanishes on &quot;V&quot; follows from the definition of &quot;J&quot; and the fact formula_172. (So the proof actually goes through if &quot;U&quot; is not a tubular neighborhood but if &quot;U&quot; deformation-retracts to &quot;V&quot; with homotopy relative to &quot;V&quot;.) formula_173

== On polynomial differential forms ==
In characteristic zero, the following Poincaré lemma holds for polynomial differential forms.

Let &quot;k&quot; be a field of characteristic zero, formula_174 the polynomial ring and formula_175 the vector space with a basis written as formula_176. Then let formula_177 be the &quot;p&quot;-th exterior power of formula_175 over formula_179. Then the sequence of vector spaces
:formula_180
is exact, where the differential formula_152 is defined by the usual way; i.e., the linearity and
:formula_182

This version of the lemma is seen by a calculus-like argument. First note that formula_183, clearly. Thus, we only need to check the exactness at formula_184. Let formula_38 be a formula_186-form. Then we write
:formula_187
where the formula_188&#x27;s do not involve formula_189. Define the integration in formula_190 by the linearity and 
:formula_191
which is well-defined by the char zero assumption. Then let
:formula_192
where the integration is applied to each coefficient in formula_99. Clearly, the fundamental theorem of calculus holds in our formal setup and thus we get:
:formula_194
where formula_156 does not involve formula_189. Hence, formula_197 &quot;does not involve formula_189.&quot; Replacing formula_38 by formula_197, we can thus assume formula_38 does not involve formula_189. From the assumption formula_203, it easily follows that each coefficient in formula_38 is independent of formula_190; i.e., formula_38 is a polynomial differential form in the variables formula_207. Hence, we are done by induction. formula_173

Remark: With the same proof, the same results hold when formula_209 is the ring of formal power series or the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. A suitably modified proof also shows the formula_142-Poincaré lemma; namely, the use of the fundamental theorem of calculus is replaced by Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula.

== On singular spaces ==
The Poincaré lemma generally fails for singular spaces. For example, if one considers &quot;algebraic&quot; differential forms on a complex algebraic variety (in the Zariski topology), the lemma is not true for those differential forms. One way to resolve this is to use formal forms and the resulting algebraic de Rham cohomology can compute a singular cohomology.

However, the variants of the lemma still likely hold for some singular spaces (precise formulation and proof depend on the definitions of such spaces and non-smooth differential forms on them.) For example, Kontsevich and Soibelman claim the lemma holds for certain variants of different forms (called PA forms) on their piecewise algebraic spaces.

The homotopy invariance fails for intersection cohomology; in particular, the Poincaré lemma fails for such cohomology.

<doc id="600039" wikidata="Q333489" url="?curid=600039" title="Xavier Bichat">
<text>Marie François Xavier Bichat (; ; 14 November 1771 – 22 July 1802) was a French anatomist and pathologist, known as the father of modern histology. Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed. He was also &quot;the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves&quot;.

Although Bichat was &quot;hardly known outside the French medical world&quot; at the time of his early death, forty years later &quot;his system of histology and pathological anatomy had taken both the French and English medical worlds by storm.&quot; The Bichatian tissue theory was &quot;largely instrumental in the rise to prominence of hospital doctors&quot; as opposed to empiric therapy, as &quot;diseases were now defined in terms of specific lesions in various tissues, and this lent itself to a classification and a list of diagnoses&quot;.

==Early life and training==

Bichat was born in Thoirette, Franche-Comté. His father was Jean-Baptiste Bichat, a physician who had trained in Montpellier and was Bichat&#x27;s first instructor. His mother was Jeanne-Rose Bichat, his father&#x27;s wife and cousin. He was the eldest of four children. He entered the college of Nantua, and later studied at Lyon. He made rapid progress in mathematics and the physical sciences, but ultimately devoted himself to the study of anatomy and surgery under the guidance of Marc-Antoine Petit (1766–1811), chief surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu of Lyon.

At the beginning of September 1793, Bichat was designated to serve as a surgeon with the Army of the Alps in the service of the surgeon Buget at the hospital of Bourg. He went home in March 1794, then moved to Paris, where he became a pupil of Pierre-Joseph Desault at the Hôtel-Dieu, &quot;who was so strongly impressed with his genius that he took him into his house and treated him as his adopted son.&quot; He took active part in Desault&#x27;s work, at the same time pursuing his own research in anatomy and physiology.
The sudden death of Desault in 1795 was a severe blow to Bichat. His first task was to discharge the obligations he owed his benefactor by contributing to the support of his widow and her son and by completing the fourth volume of Desault&#x27;s &quot;Journal de Chirurgie&quot;, which was published the following year. In 1796, he and several other colleagues also formally founded the Société Médicale d&#x27;Émulation, which provided an intellectual platform for debating problems in medicine.

==Lecturing and research==
In 1797, Bichat began a course of anatomical demonstrations, and his success encouraged him to extend the plan of his lectures, and boldly to announce a course of operative surgery. At the same time, he was working to reunite and digest in one body the surgical doctrines which Desault had published in various periodical works; of these he composed &quot;Œuvres chirurgicales de Desault, ou tableau de sa doctrine, et de sa pratique dans le traitement des maladies externes&quot; (1798–1799), a work in which, although he professes only to set forth the ideas of another, he develops them &quot;with the clearness of one who is a master of the subject.&quot;
In 1798, he gave in addition a separate course of physiology. A dangerous attack of haemoptysis interrupted his labors for a time; but the danger was no sooner past than he plunged into new engagements with the same ardour as before. Bichat&#x27;s next book, &quot;Traité des membranes&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Membranes&quot;), included his doctrine of tissue pathology with a distinction of 21 different tissues. As worded by A. S. Weber,
His next publication was the &quot;Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et la mort&quot; (&quot;Physiological Researches upon Life and Death&quot;, 1800), and it was quickly followed by his &quot;Anatomie générale&quot; (1801) in four volumes, the work which contains the fruits of his most profound and original researches. He began another work, under the title &quot;Anatomie descriptive&quot; (1801–1803), in which the organs were arranged according to his peculiar classification of their functions but lived to publish only the first two volumes.

==Final years and death==

In 1800, Bichat was appointed physician to the Hôtel-Dieu. &quot;He engaged in a series of examinations, with a view to ascertain the changes induced in the various organs by disease, and in less than six months he had opened above six hundred bodies. He was anxious also to determine with more precision than had been attempted before, the effects of remedial agents, and instituted with this view a series of direct experiments which yielded a vast store of valuable material. Towards the end of his life he was also engaged on a new classification of diseases.&quot;
On 8 July 1802, Bichat fell in a faint while descending a set of stairs at the Hôtel-Dieu. He had been spending considerable time examining some macerated skin, &quot;and from which, of course, putrid emanations were being sent forth&quot;, during which he probably contracted typhoid fever; &quot;the next day he complained of a violent headache; that night, leeches were applied behind his ears; on the 10th, he took an emetic; on the 15th, he passed into a coma and became convulsive.&quot; Bichat died on 22 July, aged 30.

Jean-Nicolas Corvisart wrote to the first consul Napoleon Bonaparte:
Ten days after this, the French government caused his name, together with that of Desault, to be inscribed on a memorial plaque at the Hôtel-Dieu.
Bichat was first buried at Sainte-Catherine Cemetery. With the closing of the latter, his remains were transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery on 16 November 1845, followed by &quot;a cortège of upwards of two thousand persons&quot; after a funeral service at Notre-Dame.

==Vitalist theory==
Bichat is considered to have been a vitalist, though in no way an anti-experimentalist:

According to Russell C. Maulitz, &quot;of the Montpellier vitalists, the clearest influence on Bichat was probably Théophile de Bordeu (1722–1776), whose widely disseminated writings on the vitalistic interpretation of life fell early into Bichat&#x27;s hands.&quot;

 In his &quot;Physiological Researches upon Life and Death&quot; (1800), Bichat defined &quot;life&quot; as &quot;the totality of those set of functions which resist death&quot;, adding:
Bichat thought that animals exhibited vital properties which could not be explained through physics or chemistry. In his &quot;Physiological Researches&quot;, he considered life to be separable into two parts: the organic life (&quot;&quot;; also sometimes called the vegetative system) and the animal life (&quot;&quot;, or animal system). The organic life was &quot;the life of the heart, intestines, and the other inner organs.&quot; As worded by Stanley Finger, &quot;Bichat theorized that this life was regulated through the &quot;système des ganglions&quot; (the ganglionic nervous system), a collection of small independent &#x27;brains&#x27; in the chest cavity.&quot; In contrast, animal life &quot;involved symmetrical, harmonious organs, such as the eyes, ears, and limbs. It included habit and memory, and was ruled by the wit and the intellect. This was the function of the brain itself, but it could not exist without the heart, the center of the organic life.&quot;

According to A. S. Weber,
==Legacy==

Bichat&#x27;s main contribution to medicine and physiology was his perception that the diverse body of organs contain particular tissues or &quot;membranes&quot;, and he described 21 such membranes, including connective, muscle, and nerve tissue. As he explained in &quot;Anatomie générale&quot;,
Bichat did not use a microscope because he distrusted it; therefore his analyses did not include any acknowledgement of cellular structure. Nonetheless, he formed an important bridge between the &quot;organ pathology&quot; of Giovanni Battista Morgagni and the &quot;cell pathology&quot; of Rudolf Virchow. Bichat &quot;recognized disease as a localized condition that began in specific tissues.&quot;

Michel Foucault regarded Bichat as the chief architect in developing the understanding of the human body as the origin of illness, redefining both conceptions of the body and disease. Bichat&#x27;s figure was of great importance to Arthur Schopenhauer, who wrote of the &quot;Recherches physiologiques&quot; as &quot;one of the most profoundly conceived works in the whole of French literature.&quot;

A large bronze statue of Bichat by David d&#x27;Angers was erected in 1857 in the &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; of the École de Chirurgie in Paris, with the support of members of the Medical Congress of France which was held in 1845. Bichat is also represented on the Panthéon&#x27;s pediment, of which the bas-relief is D&#x27;Angers&#x27; work as well. The name of Bichat is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. His name was given to the Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital.

George Eliot enthusiastically recounted Bichat&#x27;s career in her 1872 novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. In &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1856), Gustave Flaubert, himself the son of a prominent surgeon, wrote of a physician character who &quot;belonged to the great school of surgery that sprang up around Bichat, to that generation, now extinct, of philosopher-practitioners who, cherishing their art with fanatical passion, exercised it with exaltation and sagacity.&quot;

<doc id="600045" wikidata="Q2251578" url="?curid=600045" title="Hyperventilation syndrome">
<text>Hyperventilation syndrome (HVS), also known as chronic hyperventilation syndrome (CHVS), dysfunctional breathing hyperventilation syndrome, cryptotetany, spasmophilia, latent tetany, and central neuronal hyper excitability syndrome (NHS), is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply or too rapidly (hyperventilation). HVS may present with chest pain and a tingling sensation in the fingertips and around the mouth (paresthesia), in some cases resulting in the hands &#x27;locking up&#x27; or cramping (carpopedal spasm, also known as Trousseau sign). HVS may accompany a panic attack.

People with HVS may feel that they cannot get enough air. In reality, they have about the same oxygenation in the arterial blood (normal values are about 98% for hemoglobin saturation) and too little carbon dioxide (hypocapnia) in their blood and other tissues. While oxygen is abundant in the bloodstream, HVS reduces effective delivery of that oxygen to vital organs due to low--induced vasoconstriction and the suppressed Bohr effect.

The hyperventilation is self-promulgating as rapid or deep breathing causes carbon dioxide levels to fall below healthy levels, and respiratory alkalosis (high blood pH) develops. This makes the symptoms worse, which causes the person to breathe even faster, which then, further exacerbates the problem.

The respiratory alkalosis leads to changes in the way the nervous system fires and leads to the paresthesia, dizziness, and perceptual changes that often accompany this condition. Other mechanisms may also be at work, and some people are physiologically more susceptible to this phenomenon than others.

The mechanism for hyperventilation causing Paresthesia, lightheadedness, and fainting is: hyperventilation causes increased blood pH (see Respiratory alkalosis for this mechanism), which causes a decrease in free ionized calcium (Hypocalcaemia), which causes paresthesia and symptoms related to hypocalcaemia.

==Causes==
Hyperventilation syndrome is believed to be caused by psychological factors. It is one cause of hyperventilation with others including infection, blood loss, heart attack, hypocapnia or alkalosis due to chemical imbalances, decreased cerebral blood flow, and increased nerve sensitivity.

In one study, one third of patients with HVS had &quot;subtle but definite lung disease&quot; that prompted them to breathe too frequently or too deeply.

A study, found that 77% of patients with empty nose syndrome have hyperventilation syndrome. Empty nose syndrome can appear in people having done nose surgery like cauterization, turbinectomy, turbinoplasty, etc.

Many people with panic disorder or agoraphobia will experience HVS. However, most people with HVS do not have these disorders.

==Diagnosis==
Hyperventilation syndrome is a remarkably common cause of dizziness complaints. About 25% of patients who complain about dizziness are diagnosed with HVS.

A 1985 study, &quot;Efficacy of Nijmegen Questionnaire in recognition of the hyperventilation syndrome&quot;, stated: &quot;It is concluded that the questionnaire is suitable as a screening instrument for early detection of HVS, and also as an aid in diagnosis and therapy planning.&quot;

==Treatment==
One review of research, published in 2013, concluded &quot;The results of this systematic review are unable to inform clinical practice, based on the inclusion of only 1 small poorly reported RCT [randomised controlled trial] ... Therefore, no recommendations for clinical practice can be made.&quot;

While traditional intervention for an acute episode has been to have the patient breathe into a paper bag, causing rebreathing and restoration of CO₂ levels, this is not advised. The same benefits can be obtained more safely from deliberately slowing down the breathing rate by counting or looking at the second hand on a watch. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;7-11 breathing&quot;, because a gentle inhalation is stretched out to take 7 seconds (or counts), and the exhalation is slowed to take 11 seconds. This in-/exhalation ratio can be safely decreased to 4-12 or even 4-20 and more, as the O₂ content of the blood will easily sustain normal cell function for several minutes at rest when normal blood acidity has been restored.

It has also been suggested that breathing therapies such as the Buteyko Breathing method may be effective in reducing the symptoms and recurrence of the syndrome.

Benzodiazepines can be prescribed to reduce stress that provokes hyperventilation syndrome. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can reduce the severity and frequency of hyperventilation episodes.

==History==
The original traditional treatment of breathing into a paper bag to control psychologically based hyperventilation syndrome (which is now almost universally known and often shown in movies and TV dramas) was invented by New York City physician (later radiologist), Alexander Winter, M.D. [1908-1978], based on his experiences in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1951. Because other medical conditions can be confused with hyperventilation, namely asthma and heart attacks, most medical studies advise against using a paper bag since these conditions worsen when CO2 levels increase.

<doc id="600052" wikidata="Q243692" url="?curid=600052" title="Sahure">
<text>Sahure (also Sahura, meaning &quot;He who is close to Re&quot;; died 2477 BC) was a king of ancient Egypt and the second ruler of the Fifth Dynasty ( – BC). He reigned for around 13 years in the early 25th century BC during the Old Kingdom Period. Sahure&#x27;s reign marks the political and cultural high point of the Fifth Dynasty. He was probably the son of his predecessor Userkaf with Queen NeferhetepesII, and was in turn succeeded by his son Neferirkare Kakai.

During Sahure&#x27;s rule, Egypt had important trade relations with the Levantine coast. Sahure launched several naval expeditions to modern-day Lebanon to procure cedar trees, slaves, and exotic items. His reign may have witnessed the flourishing of the Egyptian navy, which included a high-seas fleet as well as specialized racing boats. Relying on this, Sahure ordered the earliest attested expedition to the land of Punt, which brought back large quantities of myrrh, malachite, and electrum. Sahure is shown celebrating the success of this venture in a relief from his mortuary temple which shows him tending a myrrh tree in the garden of his palace whose name means &quot;Sahure&#x27;s splendor soars up to heaven&quot;. This relief is the only one in Egyptian art depicting a king gardening. Sahure sent further expeditions to the turquoise and copper mines in Sinai. He also ordered military campaigns against Libyan chieftains in the Western Desert, bringing back livestock to Egypt.

Sahure had a pyramid built for himself in Abusir, thereby abandoning the royal necropolises of Saqqara and Giza, where his predecessors had built their monuments. This decision was possibly motivated by the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf in Abusir, the first such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. The Pyramid of Sahure is much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty but the decoration and architecture of his mortuary temple is more elaborate. The valley temple, causeway and mortuary temple of his pyramid complex were once adorned by over of exquisite polychrome reliefs, representing the highest form reached by this art during the Old Kingdom period. The Ancient Egyptians recognized this particular artistic achievement and tried to emulate the reliefs in the tombs of subsequent kings and queens. The architects of Sahure&#x27;s pyramid complex introduced the use of palmiform columns (columns whose capital has the form of palm leaves), which would soon become a hallmark of ancient Egyptian architecture. The layout of his mortuary temple was also innovative and became the architectural standard for the remainder of the Old Kingdom period. Sahure is also known to have constructed a sun temple called &quot;The Field of Ra&quot;, and although it has not yet been located, it is presumably also in Abusir.

Sahure was the object of a funerary cult, the food offerings for which were initially provided by agricultural estates set up during his reign. This official, state-sponsored cult endured until the end of the Old Kingdom. Subsequently, during the Middle Kingdom period, Sahure was venerated as a royal ancestor figure but his cult no longer had dedicated priests. For unknown reasons, during the New Kingdom Sahure was equated with a form of the goddess Sekhmet. The cult of &quot;Sekhmet of Sahure&quot; had priests and attracted visitors from all over Egypt to Sahure&#x27;s temple. This unusual cult was celebrated far beyond Abusir, and persisted up until the end of the Ptolemaic period nearly 2,500 years after Sahure&#x27;s death.

== Family ==
=== Parentage ===

Excavations at the pyramid of Sahure in Abusir under the direction of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early Fifth Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure&#x27;s mother was queen NeferhetepesII. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, and bore the title of &quot;king&#x27;s mother&quot;. This makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further reinforced by the discovery of Sahure&#x27;s cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.

This contradicts older, alternative theories according to which Sahure was the son of queen Khentkaus I, believed to be the wife of the last pharaoh of the preceding Fourth Dynasty, Shepseskaf and a brother to either Userkaf or Neferirkare.
=== Children ===

Sahure is known to have been succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai, who until 2005 was believed to be his brother. That year, a relief originally adorning the causeway of Sahure&#x27;s pyramid and showing Sahure seated in front of two of his sons, Ranefer and Netjerirenre, was discovered by Verner and another Egyptologist, Tarek El-Awady. Next to Ranefer&#x27;s name the text &quot;Neferirkare Kakai king of Upper and Lower Egypt&quot; had been added, indicating that Ranefer was Sahure&#x27;s son and had assumed the throne under the name &quot;Neferirkare Kakai&quot; at the death of his father. Since both Ranefer and Netjerirenre are given the titles of &quot;king&#x27;s eldest son&quot;, Verner and El-Awady speculate that they may have been twins with Ranefer born first. They propose that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name &quot;Shepseskare&quot;, although this remains conjectural. The same relief further depicts queen Meretnebty, who was thus most likely Sahure&#x27;s consort and the mother of Ranefer and Netjerirenre. Three more sons, Khakare, Horemsaf, and Nebankhre are shown on reliefs from Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple, but the identity of their mother(s) is unknown.

Netjerirenre bore several religious titles corresponding to high-ranking positions in the court and which suggest that he may have acted as a vizier for his father. This is debated, as Michel Baud points out that at the time of Sahure, the eviction of royal princes from the vizierate was ongoing if not already complete.

== Reign ==
=== Chronology ===

==== Relative chronology ====

The relative chronology of Sahure&#x27;s reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidence, which agree that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai. An historical source supporting this order of succession is the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (Αἰγυπτιακά), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Africanus wrote that the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; mentioned the succession &quot;Usercherês → Sephrês → Nefercherês&quot; at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Usercherês, Sephrês (in Greek, ΣϵΦρής), and Nefercherês are believed to be the Hellenized forms for Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare, respectively. Manetho&#x27;s reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on two more historical sources, the Abydos king list where Sahure&#x27;s cartouche is on the 27th entry, and the Saqqara Tablet where Sahure&#x27;s name is given on the 33rd entry. These lists of kings were written during the reigns of Seti I and RamsesII, respectively.

==== Reign length ====

The Turin canon, a king list written during the Nineteenth Dynasty in the early Ramesside era (1292–1189 BC), credits him with a reign of twelve years five months and twelve days. In contrast, the near contemporary royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone records his second, third, fifth and sixth years on the throne as well as his final 13th or 14th year of reign and even records the day of his death as the 28th of Shemu I, which corresponds to the end of the ninth month. Taken together these pieces of information indicate that the royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty recorded a reign of 13 years 5months and 12 days for Sahure, only one year more than given by the Turin Canon and close to the 13 years figure given in Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;.

Sahure appears in two further historical records: on the third entry of the Karnak king list, which was made during the reign of Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC) and on the 26th entry of the Saqqara Tablet dating to the reign of Ramses II (1279–1213 BC). Neither of these sources give his reign length. The absolute dates of Sahure&#x27;s reign are uncertain but most scholars date it to the first half of the 25th century BC, see note 1 for details.

=== Foreign activities ===
==== Trade and tribute ====

Historical records and surviving artifacts suggest that contacts with foreign lands were numerous during Sahure&#x27;s reign. Furthermore, these contacts seem to have been mostly economic rather than military in nature. Reliefs from his pyramid complex show the return of a naval expedition to Lebanon, the boats laden with the trunks of precious cedar trees. Other ships are represented loaded with &quot;Asiatics&quot;, both adults and children who were either slaves, or merchants, greeting Sahure:

The same relief strongly suggests that interpreters were on board the ships, tasked with translations to facilitate trade with foreign lands.
A relief, unique to Egyptian art, depicts several Syrian brown bears, presumably brought back from the Levantine coast by seagoing ships as well. These bears appear in association with 12 red-painted one-handled jars from Syria. The Egyptologists Karin Sowada and William Stevenson Smith have proposed that, taken together, the bears and jars are likely to constitute a tribute.

Trade contacts with Byblos took place during Sahure&#x27;s reign. Excavations of the temple of Baalat-Gebal yielded an alabaster bowl inscribed with Sahure&#x27;s name. The layout of the fourth phase of this temple might even have been influenced by the architecture of Sahure&#x27;s valley temple, although this remains debated.
There is further corroborating evidence for trade with the wider Levant during the Fifth Dynasty, several stone vessels being inscribed with cartouches of pharaohs of this dynasty discovered in Lebanon. So much so that the archeologist Gregory Mumford points to the fact that &quot;Sahure is [the] best attested [king] for international relations&quot; and has the highest number of texts inscribed in Sinai proportionally to his reign length.

In his last year, Sahure sent the first documented expedition to the fabled land of Punt, probably along the Somalian coast. The expedition, which is conjectured to have departed Egypt from the harbor of Mersa Gawasis, is reported on the Palermo Stone where it is said to have come back with 80,000 of an unspecified measure of myrrh, along with malachite, 6,000 measures of electrum and 2,600 or 23,020 staves, possibly made of ebony.
In his last year Sahure sent another expedition abroad, this time to the copper and turquoise mines of Wadi Maghareh and Wadi Kharit in Sinai, which had been active since at least the beginning of the Third Dynasty. This expedition, also mentioned by the Palermo stone, brought back over 6000 units of turquoise to Egypt and produced two reliefs in Sinai, one of which shows Sahure in the traditional act of smiting Asiatics and boasting &quot;The Great God smites the Asiatics of all countries&quot;. In parallel with these activities, diorite quarries near Abu Simbel were exploited throughout Sahure&#x27;s reign.
==== Military campaigns ====

Sahure&#x27;s military career is known primarily from reliefs in his mortuary complex. It apparently consisted of campaigns against Libyans from &quot;Tjemehu&quot;, a land possibly located in the northern Western desert. These campaigns are said to have yielded livestock in huge numbers and Sahure is shown smiting local chieftains. The historical veracity of these depictions remains in doubt as such representations are part of the standard iconography meant to exalt the king. The same scene of the Libyan attack was used two hundred years later in the mortuary temple of PepiII (2284–2184 BC) and in the temple of Taharqa at Kawa, built some 1800 years after Sahure&#x27;s lifetime. In particular, the same names are quoted for the local chieftains. Therefore, it is possible that Sahure too was copying an even earlier representation of this scene. Nonetheless, several overseers of the Western Nile Delta region were nominated by Sahure, a significant decision as these officials occupied an administrative position that existed only irregularly during the Old Kingdom period and which likely served to provide &quot;traffic regulation across the Egypto-Libyan border&quot;. At the same time, Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple presents the earliest known mention of pirates raiding the Nile Delta, possibly from the coast of Epirus.

Sahure&#x27;s pretensions regarding the lands and riches surrounding Egypt are encapsulated in several reliefs from his mortuary temple which show the god Ash telling the king &quot;I will give you all that is in this [Libya] land&quot;, &quot;I give you all hostile peoples with all the provisions that there are in foreign lands&quot; and &quot;I grant thee all western and eastern foreign lands with all the Iunti and the Montiu bowmen who are in every land&quot;.

=== Activities in Egypt ===
==== Religious activities ====

The majority of Sahure&#x27;s activities in Egypt recorded on the Palermo stone are religious in nature. This royal annal records that in the &quot;year of the first time of traveling around&quot;, Sahure journeyed to the Elephantine fortress, where he may have received the submission of the Nubian chiefs in a ceremonial act connected with the commencement of his reign. The fashioning of six statues of the king as well as the subsequent opening of the mouth ceremonies are also reported.
During Sahure&#x27;s fifth year on the throne, the Palermo stone mentions the making of a divine barge, possibly in Heliopolis, the appointment of 200 priests and the exact quantity of daily offerings of bread and beer to Ra (138, 40 and 74 measures in three temples), Hathor (4 measures), Nekhbet (800 measures) and Wadjet (4,800 measures) fixed by the king. Also reported are gifts of lands to temples of between 1and 204 arouras (0.7 to nearly 140 acres). Concerning Lower Egypt, the stone register corresponding to this reign gives the earliest known mention of the city of Athribis in the Delta region.

Further indication of religious activities lies in that Sahure is the earliest known king to have used the Egyptian title of &quot;Nb írt-ḫt&quot;. This title, possibly meaning &quot;Lord of doing effective things&quot;, indicates that he personally performed physical cultic activities to ensure the existence and persistence of the Maat, the Egyptian concept of order and justice. This title remained in use until the time of Herihor, some 1500 years later. Sahure&#x27;s reign is also the earliest during which the ceremony of the &quot;driving of the calves&quot; is known to have taken place. This is significant in the context of the progressive emergence of the cult of Osiris throughout the Fifth Dynasty, as this ceremony subsequently became an integral part of the Osiris myth. In subsequent times, the ceremony corresponded to Seth&#x27;s threshing of Osiris by driving calves trampling fields of barley.

Sahure reorganized the cult of his mother, NepherhetepesII, whose mortuary complex had been built by Userkaf in Saqqara. He added an entrance portico with four columns to her temple, so that the entrance was not facing Userkaf&#x27;s pyramid any more.

==== Building and mining activities ====

Archeological evidence suggests that Sahure&#x27;s building activities were mostly concentrated in Abusir and its immediate vicinity, where he constructed his pyramid and where his sun temple is probably located. Also nearby was the palace of Sahure, called &quot;Uetjes Neferu Sahure&quot;, &quot;Sahure&#x27;s splendor soars up to heaven&quot;. The palace is known from an inscription on beef tallow containers discovered in February 2011 in Neferefre&#x27;s mortuary temple. A second palace, &quot;The Crown of Sahure appears&quot;, is known from an inscription in the tomb of his chief physician.
Both palaces, if they were different buildings, were likely on the shores of the Abusir lake.

The stones for Sahure&#x27;s buildings and statues were quarried throughout Egypt. For example, the limestone cladding of the pyramid comes from Tura, while the black basalt used for the flooring of Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple comes from Gebel Qatrani, near the Faiyum in Middle Egypt. South of Egypt, a stele bearing Sahure&#x27;s name was discovered in the diorite quarries located in the desert north-west of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia.

Further mining and quarrying expeditions may be inferred from indirect evidence. An inscription of Sahure in the Wadi Abu Geridah in the Eastern desert as well as other Old Kingdom inscriptions there suggest that iron ore was mined in the vicinity since the times of the Fourth Dynasty. The lower half of a statue with the name of the king was discovered in 2015 in Elkab, a location possibly connected with expeditions to the Eastern desert and south of Egypt to Nubia. Sahure&#x27;s cartouche has been found in graffiti in Tumas and on seal impressions from Buhen at the second cataract of the Nile in Lower Nubia.

==== Development of the Egyptian Navy ====

Sahure&#x27;s reign may have been a time of development for the Egyptian navy. His expeditions to Punt and Byblos demonstrate the existence of a high seas navy and reliefs from his mortuary complex are described by Shelley Wachsmann as the &quot;first definite depictions of seagoing ships in Egypt&quot;, some of which must have been 100-cubits long (c. 50m, 170ft).
Because of this, Sahure has been credited by past scholars with establishing the Egyptian navy. It is recognized today that this is an overstatement: fragmentary reliefs from Userkaf&#x27;s temple depict numerous boats, while a high seas navy must have existed as early as the Third Dynasty. The oldest known sea harbor, Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea was operating under Khufu. Finally, there is the distinct possibility that some of the reliefs are copied from earlier examples. Nonetheless, Sahure remains the earliest known ruler to have depicted, and thus possibly made use of, sea power for transporting troops over the Mediterranean sea, to Syria.

The extensive nautical scenes from Sahure&#x27;s mortuary complex are sufficiently detailed to show that specialized racing boats for the military and perhaps for ceremonial training were built at the time. They also give the earliest depiction of specific rope uses aboard ships, such as that of a hogging-truss. They permit precise estimates regarding shipbuilding, for example indicating that the mid-ship freeboard for seagoing vessels was of ,
and that the masts employed at the time were bipodal, resembling an inverted Y.
Further rare depictions include the king standing in the stern of a sailing boat with a highly decorated sail, and one of only two reliefs from ancient Egypt showing men aboard a ship paddling in a wave pattern, possibly during a race.

=== Court life ===

==== Officials ====

Several high officials serving Sahure during his lifetime are known from their tombs as well as from the decoration of the mortuary temple of the king. Niankhsekhmet, chief physician of Sahure and first known rhinologist in history, reports that he asked the king that a false door be made for his [Niankhsekhmet&#x27;s] tomb, to which the king agreed. Sahure had the false door made of fine Tura limestone, carved and painted blue in his audience-hall, and made personal daily inspections of the work. The king wished a long life to his physician, telling him:

A similar though much less detailed anecdote is reported by Khufuankh, who was overseer of the palace and singer of the king.
Other officials include Hetepka, who was keeper of the diadem and overseer of the hairdressers of the king,
Pehenewkai, priest of the cult of Userkaf during the reigns of Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai, then vizier for the latter; Persen, a mortuary priest in the funerary cult of Sahure&#x27;s mother Nepherhetepes; and Washptah, a priest of Sahure, then vizier of Neferirkare Kakai. The high-official Ptahshepses, probably born during the reign of Menkaure, was high priest of Ptah and royal manicure under Sahure, later promoted to vizier by Nyuserre Ini.

Two viziers of Sahure are known: Sekhemkare, royal prince, son of Khafre and vizier under Userkaf and Sahure; and Werbauba, vizier during Sahure&#x27;s reign, attested in the mortuary temple of the king.

==== Evolution of the high offices ====

Sahure pursued Userkaf&#x27;s policy of appointing non-royal people to high offices. This is best exemplified by the office of vizier, which was exclusively held by princes of royal blood with the title of &quot;King&#x27;s son&quot; since the mid-Fourth Dynasty and up until the early Fifth Dynasty. Toward the end of this period princes were progressively excluded from the highest office, an evolution undoubtedly correlated with changes in the nature of kingship. This process, possibly initiated by Menkaure because of dynastic disputes, seems to have been completed by Sahure&#x27;s time as from then onwards no royal prince was promoted to vizier. Those already in post were allowed to keep their status and so in the early part of Sahure&#x27;s reign vizier Sekhemkare was a &quot;King&#x27;s son&quot; while his successor, Werbauba, seems to have been non-royal. In response to this change, the state administration began its expansion as it included more and more non-royal people.

Concurrently with these developments, architectural and artistic innovations relating to tombs of private individuals can be dated to Sahure&#x27;s reign. These including torus molding and cornices for false doors, first found in Persen&#x27;s tomb. This feature would subsequently become common and here demonstrates the particularly high esteem in which Persen must have been held by the king. Another innovation is the depiction of small unusual offerings such as that of seven sacred oils on false doors, first found in Niankhsekhmet&#x27;s tomb. The canonical list of offerings was also developed during or shortly before Sahure&#x27;s time in the tombs of the royal family, and spread to those of non-royal high-officialsthe earliest of whom was Seshemnefer Iunder Sahure.

== Sun temples ==
=== Sekhetre ===

Sahure built or started to build a temple dedicated to the sun god Ra, the second such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. Yet to be located, it is known to have existed thanks to an inscription on the Palermo stone where it is called &quot;Sekhetre&quot; (also spelt &quot;Sekhet Re&quot;), meaning &quot;The Field of Ra&quot; as well as mentions of it in 24 tombs of administration officials. A few limestone blocks bearing reliefs which once adorned the temple have been found embedded in the walls of the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, Sahure&#x27;s fourth successor. This suggests either that these blocks were leftovers from the construction of the temple, or as Wener Kaiser has posited, that Nyuserre dismantled Sahure&#x27;s temple, using it as a quarry for construction materials because it was largely unfinished. Indeed, the rather meager evidence for the &quot;Sekhetre&quot; leads Miroslav Verner to propose that it never fully functioned as a sun temple.

New analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone performed in 2018 by the Czech Institute of Archeology enabled the reading of further inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received, establishing firmly that it was a distinct entity from the earlier sun temple of Userkaf, the &quot;Nekhenre&quot; but leaving its ultimate fate uncertain. Further precision as to the architecture of the temple may be inferred from the absence of the obelisk determinative in some hieroglyphic variants of the name &quot;Sekhetre&quot; and its presence in others. For Anthony Spalinger this possibly indicates that Sahure&#x27;s sun temple was effectively built and acquired such an obelisk at some point after its construction, perhaps after Sahure&#x27;s reign.

=== Nekhenre ===

Userkaf was the first king to build a sun temple in Abusir. Known to the ancient Egyptians as the &quot;Nekhenre&quot;, or &quot;Fortress of Re&quot;, it was unfinished at his death. Construction works continued in at least four building phases, the first of which may have taken place under Sahure, and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.

== Pyramid complex ==


Sahure built a pyramid complex for his tomb and funerary cult, named &quot;Khaba Sahura&quot;, which is variously translated as &quot;The Rising of the Ba Spirit of Sahure&quot;, &quot;The Ba of Sahure appears&quot;, &quot;Sahure&#x27;s pyramid where the royal soul rises in splendor&quot;, or &quot;In glory comes forth the soul of Sahure&quot;. The builders and artisans who worked on Sahure&#x27;s mortuary complex lived in an enclosed pyramid town located next to the causeway leading up to Sahure&#x27;s pyramid and mortuary temple. The town later flourished under Nyuserre and seems to have still been in the existence during the First Intermediate Period.

In terms of the size, volume, and the cheap construction techniques employed, Sahure&#x27;s pyramid exemplifies the decline of pyramid building. At the same time, the quality and variety of the stones employed in other parts of the complex increased, and the mortuary temple is considered to be the most sophisticated one built up to that time.
With its many architectural innovations, such as the use of palmiform columns, the overall layout of Sahure&#x27;s complex would serve as the template for all mortuary complexes constructed from Sahure&#x27;s reign until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, some 300 years later. The highly varied colored reliefs decorating the walls of the entire funerary complex display a quality of workmanship and a richness of conception that reach their highest level of the entire Old Kingdom period.

=== Location ===

Sahure chose to construct his pyramid complex in Abusir, thereby abandoning both Saqqara and Giza, which had been the royal necropolises up to that time. A possible motivation for Sahure&#x27;s decision was the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf, something which supports the hypothesis that Sahure was Userkaf&#x27;s son.
Following Sahure&#x27;s choice, Abusir became the main necropolis of the early Fifth Dynasty, as pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre, Nyuserre Ini and possibly Shepseskare built their pyramids there. In their wake, many smaller tombs belonging to members of the royal family were built in Abusir, with the notable exceptions of those of the highest-ranking members, many of whom chose to be buried in Giza or Saqqarah.

=== Mortuary temple ===

Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple was extensively decorated with an estimated of fine reliefs. This extensive decoration seems to have been completed within Sahure&#x27;s lifetime.
The walls of the entire -long causeway were also covered with polychrome bas-reliefs. Miroslav Bárta describes the reliefs as &quot;the largest collection known from the third millennium BCE&quot;.

Many surviving fragments of the reliefs which decorated the walls of the mortuary complex are of very high quality and much more elaborate than those from preceding mortuary temples.
Several of the depictions are unique in Egyptian art. These include a relief showing Sahure tending a myrrh tree (&quot;Commiphora myrrha&quot;) in his palace in front of his family; a relief depicting Syrian brown bears and another showing the bringing of the pyramidion to the main pyramid and the ceremonies following the completion of the complex. The high craftmanship of the reliefs is here manifested by the finely rounded edges of all figures, so that they simultaneously blend in with the background and stand out clearly.
Reliefs are sufficiently detailed to permit the identification of the animals shown, such as hedgehogs and jerboas, and even show personified plants such as corn represented as a man with corn-ears instead of hair.

The many reliefs of the mortuary, causeway and valley temples also depict, among other things, Sahure hunting wild bulls and hippopotamuses, Sahure being suckled by Nekhbet,
the earliest depictions of a king fishing and fowling, a counting of foreigners by or in front of the goddess Seshat, which Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes was &quot;meant to ward off any evil or disorder&quot;, the god Sopdu &quot;Lord of the Foreign Countries&quot; leading bound Asiatic captives, and the return of an Egyptian fleet from Asia, perhaps Byblos. Some of the low relief-cuttings in red granite are still in place at the site. Among the seminal innovations of Sahure&#x27;s temple are the earliest relief depictions of figures in adoration, either standing or squatting with both arms raised, their hands open and their palms facing down.

The mortuary temple featured the first palmiform columns of any Egyptian temple, massive granite architraves inscribed with Sahure&#x27;s titulary overlaid with copper, lion-headed waterspouts, black basalt flooring and granite dados.

=== Pyramid ===

The pyramid of Sahure reached at the time of its construction, much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty. Its inner core is made of roughly hewn stones organized in steps and held together in many sections with a thick mortar of mud. This construction technique, much cheaper and faster to execute than the stone-based techniques hitherto employed, fared much worse over time. Owing to this, Sahure&#x27;s pyramid is now largely ruined and amounts to little more than a pile of rubble showing the crude filling of debris and mortar constituting the core, which became exposed after the casing stones were stolen in antiquity.

While the core was under construction, a corridor was left open leading into the shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the Third Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the Fourth Dynasty.

The entrance at the north side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its gabled roof comprising large limestone beams of several tons each. Today all of these beams are fractured, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of a basalt sarcophagus, likely Sahure&#x27;s, were found here in the burial chamber when it was first entered by John Shae Perring in the mid 19th century.

The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also includes a second smaller cult pyramid which must have stood nearly high, originally built for the Ka of the king.

== Legacy ==

=== Artistic and architectural legacy ===

The painted reliefs covering the walls of Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple were recognized as an artistic achievement of the highest degree by the Ancient Egyptians. A New Kingdom inscription found in Abusir for example poetically compares the temple to the heaven lit by full moon.

Subsequent generations of artists and craftsmen tried to emulate Sahure&#x27;s reliefs, using them as templates for the tombs of later kings and queens of the Old Kingdom period. The layout of Sahure&#x27;s high temple was also novel and it became the standard template for all subsequent pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom. Some of its architectural elements, such as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.

This trend continued to hold in later times. For example, in the Middle Kingdom, Senusret I had reliefs for his temple directly copied from those of Sahure. He also chose to follow the innovative layout of Sahure&#x27;s complex once again. At the time, Senusret I&#x27;s decision was in stark contrast with the burial customs of the 11th Dynasty pharaohs, who were buried in saff tombs. These consisted of an open courtyard fronting a row of entrances into subterranean corridors and chambers dug in the hillsides of El-Tarif and Deir el-Bahari, near Thebes.

=== Cults ===
==== Old Kingdom ====

Sahure was the object of a funerary cult from the time of his death and which continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, some 300 years later. At least 22 agricultural estates were established to produce the goods necessary for providing the offerings to be made for this cult. Decorated reliefs from the upper part of the causeway represent the procession of over 150 personified funerary domains created by and for Sahure, demonstrating the existence of a sophisticated economic system associated with the king&#x27;s funerary cult. The enormous quantities of offerings pouring into the mortuary and sun temples of Sahure benefitted other cults as well, such as that of Hathor, which had priests officiating on the temple premises.

Several priests serving the mortuary cult or in Sahure&#x27;s sun temple during the later Fifth and Sixth Dynasties are known thanks to inscriptions and artifacts from their tombs in Saqqara and Abusir.
These include Tjy, overseer of the sun temples of Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre; Neferkai priest of Sahure&#x27;s funerary cult; Khabauptah priest of Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre, and Niuserre,
Atjema, priest of the sun temple of Sahure during the Sixth Dynasty; Khuyemsnewy, who served as priest of the mortuary cult of Sahure during the reigns of Neferirkare and Nyuserre; Nikare, priest of the cult of Sahure and overseer of the scribes of the granary during the Fifth Dynasty. Further priests are known, such as Senewankh, serving in the cults of Userkaf and Sahure and buried in a mastaba in Saqqara;
Sedaug, a priest of the cult of Sahure, priest of Ra in the sun-temple of Userkaf and holder of the title of royal acquaintance; Tepemankh, priest of the cults of kings of the Fourth to early Fifth Dynasty including Userkaf and Sahure, buried in a mastaba at Abusir.

==== Middle Kingdom ====

No priest serving in the funerary cult of Sahure is known from the Middle Kingdom period. Evidence from this period rather come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by 12th Dynasty pharaoh Senusret I (fl. 20th century BC), who dedicated statues of Old Kingdom kings including one of Sahure. The statue and the accompanying group of portraits of deceased kings indicates the existence of a generic cult of royal ancestor figures, a &quot;limited version of the cult of the divine&quot; as Jaromir Málek writes.
The statue of Sahure, now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (catalog number CG 42004), is made of black granite and is tall. Sahure is shown enthroned, wearing a pleated skirt and a round curly wig. Both sides of the throne bear inscriptions identifying the work as a portrait of Sahure made on the orders of Senusret I.

Sahure&#x27;s legacy had endured sufficiently by the Middle Kingdom period that he is mentioned in a story of the Westcar Papyrus, probably written during the 12th Dynasty although the earliest extent copy dates to the Seventeenth Dynasty. The papyrus tells the mythical story of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty, presenting kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers, sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet destined to supplant Khufu&#x27;s line.

==== New Kingdom: emergence of Sekhmet of Sahure ====

As a deceased king, Sahure continued to receive religious offerings during the New Kingdom as part of the standard cult of the royal ancestors. For example, Sahure is present on the Karnak king list, a list of kings inscribed on the walls of the &quot;Akhmenu&quot;, the Karnak temple of ThutmoseIII. Unlike other ancient Egyptian king lists, the kings there are not listed in chronological order. Rather, the purpose of the list was purely religious, its aim being to name the deceased kings to be honored in the Karnak temple.

In the second part of the Eighteenth Dynasty and during the Nineteenth Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple.
These activities were related to a cult then taking place in the mortuary temple of Sahure since the time of ThutmoseIII. This cult was devoted to the deified king in a form associated with the goddess Sekhmet named &quot;Sekhmet of Sahure&quot;.
For example, the scribe Ptahemuia and fellow scribes visited Sahure&#x27;s temple in the 30th year of RamsesII&#x27;s reign (c. 1249 BC) to ask Sekhmet to grant them a long life of 110 years. The reason for the appearance of this cult during the New Kingdom is unknown. In any case, the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure was not a purely local phenomenon as traces of it were found in the Upper Egyptian village of Deir el-Medina, where it was celebrated during two festivals taking place every year, on the 16th day of the first month of Peret and on the 11th day of the fourth month of that season.

During the same period, prince Khaemwaset, a son of RamsesII, undertook works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples which had fallen into ruin, possibly to appropriate stones for his father&#x27;s construction projects while ensuring a minimal restoration for cultic purposes. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was the object of such works at this time. This renewed attention had negative consequences as the first wave of dismantlement of the Abusir monuments, particularly for the acquisition of valuable Tura limestone, arrived with it. Sahure&#x27;s mortuary temple may have been spared at this time due to the presence of the cult of Sekhmet. The cult&#x27;s influence likely waned after the end of RamsesII&#x27;s reign, becoming a site of local worship only.

==== Third intermediate, late and Ptolemaic periods ====

During the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (744–656 BC) at the end of the Third Intermediate Period, some of Sahure&#x27;s temple reliefs were copied by Taharqa, including images of the king crushing his enemies as a sphinx.
Shortly after, under the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664–525 BC) of the Late Period, a statue of Sahure was among a group of statues of Old Kingdom kings hidden in a cachette of the Karnak temple, testifying to some form of cultic interest up to that time.
In parallel, a new period of dismantlement of the pyramids of Abusir took place, yet Sahure&#x27;s was once again spared. This might be because of the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure the temple hosted well into the Ptolemaic period (332–30 BC), albeit with a very reduced influence. Several graffiti dating from the reigns of Amasis II (570–526 BC), Darius II (423–404 BC) and up until the Ptolemaic period attest to continued cultic activities on the site. For example, a certain Horib was &quot;Priest of Sekhmet of the temple of Sekhmet of Sahure&quot; under the Ptolemaic dynasty.

The dismantlement of Sahure&#x27;s pyramid started in earnest in the Roman period, as shown by the abundant production of mill-stones, presence of lime production facilities and worker shelters in the vicinity.

=== In Contemporary Culture ===

Sahure&#x27;s name and that of his father were used in the 1983 Sesame Street special Don%27t Eat the Pictures. A cursed child from ancient Egypt introduces himself as &quot;Prince Sahure of Egypt, son of the god Userkof, king of kings, lord of the two lands, conquered of the east and west, and fabulous fisherman.&quot;

<text>The Sprawl trilogy (also known as the Neuromancer trilogy) is William Gibson&#x27;s first set of novels, and is composed of &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (1984), &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1986), and &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; (1988).

The novels are all set in the same fictional future. The Sprawl trilogy shares this setting with Gibson&#x27;s short stories &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (1981), &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; (1982), and &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (1984).

==Setting and story arc==
The novels are set in a near-future world dominated by corporations and ubiquitous computing. The events of the novels are spaced over 16 years, and although there are familiar characters that appear, each novel tells a self-contained story. Gibson focuses on the effects of technology: the unintended consequences as it filters out of research labs and onto the street where it finds new purposes. He explores a world of direct mind-machine links (&quot;jacking in&quot;), emerging machine intelligence, and a global information space, which he calls &quot;cyberspace&quot;. Some of the novels&#x27; action takes place in The Sprawl, officially the &quot;Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis&quot; - an urban environment extending along most of the East Coast of the United States (as a fictional extrapolation of the real-life Northeast megalopolis).

The story arc which frames the trilogy follows a wide cast of characters in a persistent, ongoing narrative - the major commonality between the three being The Sprawl itself. It focuses on the self-contained stories of each character, and highlights their narrative links through suggestion, references, and imagery.

&quot;Neuromancer&quot; tells the story of Case, a cyberspace &quot;cowboy&quot; (hacker) that gets picked up for a job with an unknown benefactor. The book is the only one in the trilogy that follows a single cohesive plot, with the sequels both featuring multi-strand narrative structures that culminate in the end.

&quot;Count Zero&quot; consists of three major protagonists, and chapters alternate from one character&#x27;s story to the next. The first of these is Turner, an ex-military mercenary. After becoming the victim of a bombing attack, Turner is hired by an old colleague to assist the dangerous extraction of a tech developer. The second is of Bobby Newmark, a teenager living in the slums with his mother. After an attempt at an illegal cyberspace run, Bobby is forced into hiding when it becomes apparent his experiment has put a target on his back. The third is of Marly Krushkova, a disgraced art museum curator who, after being caught in a major fraud scam, is hired by the immensely wealthy Josef Virek to find the artist behind a series of enigmatic artworks.

Finally&quot;, Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; follows four narrative plot threads in a pattern similar to that of Count Zero. The first is of Kumiko, teenage daughter to a Yakuza boss, whose father sends her to London to keep her safe during an anticipated gang war. The second is of artist Slick Henry, who spends his time making robots from scrap metal. Slick is suddenly thrust into the intrigue of the novel when someone calls in a debt by asking him to watch over a cyberspace cowboy locked in a run. The third thread follows prostitute Mona and her relationship with her abusive boyfriend/pimp. The final plot thread follows Angie Mitchell, a &quot;simstim&quot; (virtual sensory movies) actress in rehabilitation who can access cyberspace mentally.

==Reception==

The trilogy was commercially and critically successful. Steven Poole, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described &quot;&quot;Neuromancer&quot; and the two novels which followed, &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1986) and the gorgeously titled &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; (1988)&quot; as making up &quot;a fertile holy trinity, a sort of Chrome Koran (the name of one of Gibson&#x27;s future rock bands) of ideas inviting endless reworkings&quot;.

All three books were nominated for major science fiction awards, including:

* &quot;Neuromancer&quot; – Nebula &amp; Philip K. Dick Awards winner, British Science Fiction Award nominee, 1984; Hugo Award winner, 1985
* &quot;Count Zero&quot; – Nebula and British Science Fiction awards nominee, 1986; Hugo and Locus Awards nominee, 1987
* &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; – Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards nominee, 1989

<text>Cahit Arf (; 24 October 1910 – 26 December 1997) was a Turkish mathematician. He is known for the Arf invariant of a quadratic form in characteristic 2 (applied in knot theory and surgery theory) in topology, the Hasse–Arf theorem in ramification theory, Arf semigroups and Arf rings.

==Biography==
Cahit Arf was born on 11 October 1910 in Thessaloniki, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire. His family migrated to Istanbul with the outbreak of the Balkan War in 1912. The family finally settled in İzmir where Cahit Arf received his primary education. Upon receiving a scholarship from the Turkish Ministry of Education he continued his education in Paris and graduated from École Normale Supérieure.

Returning to Turkey, he taught mathematics at Galatasaray High School. In 1933 he joined the Mathematics Department of Istanbul University. In 1937 he went to Göttingen, where he received his PhD from the University of Göttingen and worked with Helmut Hasse and Josue Cruz de Munoz. He returned to Istanbul University and worked there until his involvement with the foundation work of the Scientific and Technological Research Council (TÜBİTAK) upon President Cemal Gürsel&#x27;s appointment in 1962. After serving as the founding director of the council in 1963, he joined the Mathematics Department of Robert College in Istanbul. Arf spent the period of 1964–1966 working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He later visited University of California, Berkeley for one year.

Upon his final return to Turkey, he joined the Mathematics Department of the Middle East Technical University and continued his studies there until his retirement in 1980. Arf received numerous awards for his contributions to mathematics, among them are: İnönü Award in 1948, Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) Science Award in 1974, and Commandeur des Palmes Academiques (France) in 1994. Arf was a member of the Mainz Academy and the Turkish Academy of Sciences. He was the president of the Turkish Mathematical Society from 1985 until 1989. Arf died on December 26, 1997, in Bebek, Istanbul, at the age of 87. His collected works were published, in 1988, by the Turkish Mathematical Society.

==Influence==
Arf&#x27;s influence on science in general and mathematics in particular was profound. Although he had very few formal students, many of the mathematicians of Turkey, at some time of their careers, had fruitful discussions on their field of interest with him and had received support and encouragement.

He facilitated the now-celebrated visit of Robert Langlands to Turkey (now famous for the Langlands program, among many other things); during which Langlands worked out some arduous calculations on the epsilon factors of Artin L-functions.

Arf&#x27;s portrait is depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 10 lira banknote issued in 2009.

Middle East Technical University Department of Mathematics organizes a special lecture session called the Cahit Arf lecture each year in memory of Arf.

==Legacy==
Since 2001, the Arf lectures in honor of Cahit Arf have been held annually at the Cahit Arf Auditorium in the Department of Mathematics of Middle East Technical University. Each lecture is presented by a distinguished mathematician selected by the advisory board. Since 2006, the Arf Lecturers are invited to deliver their talks at Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences (IMBM), too.

<doc id="600063" wikidata="Q2415014" url="?curid=600063" title="The Waifs">
<text>The Waifs (originally styled as The WAiFS) are an Australian folk rock band formed in 1992 by sisters Vikki Thorn (harmonica, guitar, vocals) and Donna Simpson (guitar, vocals) as well as Josh Cunningham (guitar, vocals). Their tour and recording band includes Ben Franz (bass), David Ross Macdonald (drums) and Tony Bourke (keyboard / piano).

The band&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Up All Night&quot; reached the top five of the Australian Albums Chart, achieving double platinum status and winning four ARIA Awards in October. Two further top five albums were issued, &quot;Sun Dirt Water&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Temptation&quot; in 2011. The Waifs have three top 50 singles, &quot;London Still&quot; (2002), &quot;Bridal Train&quot; (2004) and &quot;Sun Dirt Water&quot;. The band supported Bob Dylan on his 2003 Australian tour and then his 2003 North American tour, including a gig at the Newport Folk Festival.

The Waifs founded the independent label Jarrah Records in July 2002, co-owned with fellow musician John Butler and their common manager Phil Stevens, which handles their Australian releases.

==History==
===1992–1996: Fisherman&#x27;s daughters and a farmer&#x27;s son===
The Waifs formed in August 1992 in Albany, Western Australia, as a folk rock band. The Simpson sisters, Donna and Vikki (now Vikki Thorn), had formed a duo, Colours, in Albany to perform cover versions of Bob Dylan and the Everly Brothers at local pubs. Their father, Jimmy Simpson, was a seasonal salmon fisherman at Cosy Corner beach and had bought Donna her first guitar when she was 15. In February 1992, 20-year-old Donna and her 16-year-old sister Vikki headed off in a Kombi van to tour the state as Colours. Josh Cunningham, a Moruya farmer&#x27;s son, had started playing guitar in 1987, he was touring Australia playing bass guitar for a band. The Simpsons met 18-year-old Cunningham while Colours were playing twelve-bar blues in Broome. After a ten-minute jam session, Donna invited Cunningham to join Colours, Cunningham later recalled, &quot;there was a connection that Donna felt that I felt as well ... it&#x27;s always felt very much like a family to me and I felt instantly welcomed into that right from the very start&quot;. Upon return to Albany, Colours changed its name to &quot;The Waifs&quot; (initially styled as &quot;The WAiFS&quot;) with Cunningham on guitars, ukulele, mandolin, dobro and vocals, Donna on vocals, guitar and tambourine and Vikki on vocals, harmonica and guitar. The Waifs used the Kombi van from 1992 to 1996 to travel to gigs across Australia.

===1996–2000: First three albums===
In February 1996, the Waifs relocated to Melbourne, recorded their debut, eponymous album, &quot;The Waifs&quot;, which was released in May by independent label Outside Music. The band co-produced it with Jen Anderson and Mick Thomas of folk rock band Weddings Parties Anything. Aside from producing, Anderson was a session musician for the album. Jason MacNeill of Allmusic described &quot;The Waifs&quot; as &quot;a more than adequate stab at troubadour folk and acoustic pop ... In some instances, the band is guilty of what can be termed funk folk, a style all too often used with little to no benefit&quot;. The group commenced a year-long tour of Australia to support the album.

Their second album, &quot;Shelter Me&quot;, was recorded in Adelaide at Mixmasters Studios and, produced by the Waifs, it was released in March 1998. MacNeill felt it was &quot;[s]tructured in a cozy, country-like frame of harmonies and acoustic guitars, most of the album works all too well. A few songs, including the soulful &quot;Time to Part&quot;, seem a bit askew from the others, but aren&#x27;t annoying to the senses&quot;. Once again, the album was supported by a national tour.

The band released its third album, &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;, in June 2000. MacNeill states, &quot;Abstaining from traditional folk for a more rural, quasi-country sound, the band rarely misses the mark, although &quot;Love Serenade&quot; is just satisfactory&#x27;. They had used David Ross Macdonald on drums and percussion – he became part of their touring band.

===2001–2007: Chart success and &quot;Up All Night&quot;===
In 2001, the Waifs hired Phil Stevens as band manager – he also manages fellow West Australian musician John Butler and the John Butler Trio. The band started to play folk festivals in Canada and the United States. In August, the group made its first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival. The &quot;Newport Daily News&quot; acclaimed them as &quot;the darlings of [that] year&#x27;s festival&quot;.

In June 2002, the Waifs, Butler and Stevens founded the independent label Jarrah Records. The label was initially set up to issue both artists&#x27; material in North America, later it handled all their Australian releases. The growing international reputation of the Waifs led to the release of &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; in the US in 2002 by Jarrah Records. The Waifs first new work for Jarrah was a five-track single &quot;London Still&quot;, which reached the top 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In October, &quot;London Still&quot; received two nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 for &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27; and &#x27;Breakthrough Artist – Single&#x27;.

The Waifs fourth album, &quot;Up All Night&quot;, was released in January 2003 and debuted at No. 3. It was produced by The Waifs, Chris Thompson, Steven Schram. For the album and subsequent touring, Ben Franz played bass guitar and double bass, and dobro on the title track. The album was certified gold four weeks after release, went platinum in October 2003 and double platinum in February 2004. &quot;Lighthouse&quot; was released in April 2003, which was their second Top 100 single.

Vikki Simpson told &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in October that the album&#x27;s success had taken the band by surprise, &quot;We were nonchalant about releasing albums. We&#x27;d released three already and had learned not to put too much hope behind an album because you&#x27;re usually disappointed. So it was a surprise, but we took it in our stride. It was all very exciting but it didn&#x27;t seem real to us because it was such a new experience.&quot;

The band supported Bob Dylan on his Australian tour in March. Dylan offered the group a support slot on his subsequent tour of North America, including a gig at the Newport Folk Festival. During the tour Donna met Ben Weaver, a United States singer-songwriter. They later married and have a son. In 2003, the band also participated in Big Day Out, an Australian travelling music festival.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2003, the Waifs won in four categories, Best Roots and Blues Album, Best Independent Album, Producer of the Year and Engineer of the Year from eight nominations. &quot;Lighthouse&quot; also reached No.12 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003.

&quot;Bridal Train&quot; was released in March 2004 and made the Australian Top 50 singles charts in April. The track tells the story of the Simpsons&#x27; grandmother, a war-bride of a United States Navy sailor, Bob Cain. She boarded the &quot;Bridal Train&quot; from Perth to Sydney and then travelled to San Francisco to be with her husband. Thorn won the USA Songwriting Competition for &quot;Bridal Train&quot;. The Waifs released a double live album, &quot;A Brief History...&quot;, in November which debuted in the top thirty of the Australian album charts.

A month after the Asian 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, the Waifs joined a cast of Australian artists to perform at the WaveAid concert in January 2005 in Sydney to raise funds for the relief effort. Later in 2005, they indicated that they had no immediate plans for another album, &quot;We won&#x27;t be going into the studio any time soon. Our collective focus is too outside of music and career right now to put out an album.&quot;

===2007–2011: &quot;Sun, Dirt, Water&quot; to &quot;Temptation&quot;===

The Waif&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Sun Dirt Water&quot;, was released in September 2007. It debuted and peaked at No. 2. Vikki had written the title song, &quot;Sun Dirt Water&quot;, after meeting her husband. By 2007, Vikki had married Matt Thorn, lived on a farm in Utah and had two children.

The Waifs performed across Australia in September and October on the SunDirtWater Tour. It started in Broome, and ended at Legs 11, a concert for breast cancer research. In November, the group announced a collaboration with label mates, John Butler Trio, for the Union of Soul Tour in January – February 2008. The tour had five concerts, with shows in various Western Australian cities, Denmark, Margaret River, Swan Valley, and two gigs at the Fremantle Arts Centre. A second live album, &quot;Live from the Union of Soul&quot; was issued in January 2009, which peaked into the top 50. During 2009, Simpson and Weaver were divorced.

The group released their sixth studio album, &quot;Temptation&quot;, in March 2011, which peaked at No. 3. It was recorded late in 2010 in a basement studio in Minneapolis over ten days. Once again, they used the rhythm section of Franz and Macdonald. Simpson had attended rehab at Hazelden Treatment Center in Minnesota in 2008 for her alcohol addiction and wrote the album track, &quot;Just Like Me&quot;, about her experience. As from March 2011, Thorn lives in Utah with her husband Matt and two sons, Simpson in Minneapolis with her son, Cunningham in California with his wife Jackie, Macdonald in Canada and Franz in Australia. While in Australia, Cunningham recorded his debut solo album, &quot;Into Tomorrow&quot;.
