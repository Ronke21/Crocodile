<text>Know Your Enemy is the sixth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 19 March 2001 by Epic Records. It was supported by four singles, all of which reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. 

The band originally envisioned &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; as two separate albums with very different sounds and concepts, with the intention of releasing both on the same day. However, the record label vetoed the idea and a compromise was made, resulting in a single, lengthy, very diverse record. Whilst the album sold well, it did not match the success of its predecessor, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;. Critics were somewhat divided in their opinions at first, but its reception since has been more positive.

In 2022, the band released remixed and expanded 2- and 3-disc editions of &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;, rearranging the tracks into the two separate albums as originally intended.

== Background ==
Drummer Sean Moore stated in an interview with a Spanish reporter in 2014 that the songs included on &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; were originally intended for two separate albums: &quot;Door to the River&quot;, which consisted of more reflective and personal material, and the heavier, more politically charged &quot;Solidarity&quot;, with the intention of releasing both on the same day. However, the record label was not inclined to put out two albums at the same time (they would feel the same in 2013–2014 with &quot;Rewind the Film&quot; and &quot;Futurology&quot;) and so most of the material was released as one lengthy, highly varied, 75-minute album instead. Because of this, Moore felt that the finished album was &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot;. The only remnant of the original two-album idea was that the first two singles, &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; and &quot;Found That Soul&quot; – reflecting the very different styles at play – were released on the same day as a publicity stunt.

The album departs from the arena rock of the band&#x27;s previous two albums, featuring a rougher, less polished sound. It also displays influences from a much wider range of styles than before. On the album&#x27;s diverse sound, &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; finds the Manics attempting to write a protest song in just about every genre.&quot; They attributed the &quot;riotous&quot; punk sound of the tracks &quot;Found That Soul&quot;, &quot;Intravenous Agnostic&quot;, and &quot;Dead Martyrs&quot; to the influence of Sonic Youth and Joy Division and the jangle-pop of &quot;The Year of Purification&quot; and &quot;Epicentre&quot; to R.E.M.. The tracks &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; and &quot;Miss Europa Disco Dancer&quot; were described as &quot;a Beach Boys homage&quot; and &quot;a disco parody&quot; respectively, while &quot;My Guernica&quot;, &quot;His Last Painting&quot; and &quot;The Convalescent&quot; were described as &quot;dark, marching and charging post-punk anthems&quot;.

The album features Nicky Wire&#x27;s debut as a lead vocalist, on the track &quot;Wattsville Blues&quot;, and James Dean Bradfield&#x27;s debut as a lyricist, on &quot;Ocean Spray&quot;. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine guested on guitar on two tracks.

The left-wing political convictions of the Manic Street Preachers are apparent in many of the album&#x27;s songs. &quot;Baby Elián&quot; comments on the strained relations between the United States and Cuba as seen in the Elián González affair. The band also pays tribute to singer and Civil Rights activist Paul Robeson in the song &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot;.
About the political side of the record, Wire told &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Unfortunately it was four years before everyone else got interested in politics. It took everyone else a war. Where have these people been the last four years? Forty years? American foreign policy&#x27;s never changed. There&#x27;s a track called &#x27;Freedom of Speech Won&#x27;t Feed My Children&#x27; about forcing freedom on societies that says everything we ever needed to say.&quot; Wire also described the album as &quot;a deeply flawed, highly enjoyable folly&quot;.

James Dean Bradfield reflected on the album in 2015, placing it as his second least favourite album that the band made. &quot;When we came in to do this album we were reacting to the massive success in Europe and other parts of the world. Not America. But with &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; and &quot;This Is My Truth&quot; we had sold millions of records around the world, and after &quot;This Is My Truth&quot; we kind of reacted against our own success. We thought that we had lost some of that original punk spirit that we’d had. It had kind of always been in the lyrics and some of our performances, but we thought we’d become too polished. We thought that perhaps we had fallen onto a treadmill of success, which was stupid. You look back on all this stuff and think, “What a fucking idiot I was!” You can’t help but live in the moment, and basically with &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; we tried to be too spontaneous and too organic. We were just laying stuff down quite quickly and not worrying about the production. And we undersold some of the songs on the record. It’s not the producer’s fault, it’s our fault. We backed him into a corner and said, “No, we want to keep things fresh and do it quickly.” And we didn’t give the record a chance to breathe or sound good.&quot;

Nicky Wire reflected on the album in 2021: &quot;Musically, I was particularly lazy and destructive. Constantly saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s too tight - can&#x27;t we use the demo?&#x27; Too many lyrics just weren&#x27;t finished. The original idea was to have two albums: one called &quot;Solidarity&quot;, after the Polish trade union movement, and one called &quot;Door to the River&quot;, which was the softer side. James just looked at me: &#x27;Why are you trying to do this weird shit all the time?&#x27; In a nice way.&quot;

== Release ==

&quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; was released on 19 March 2001. The album debuted and peaked at number 2 in the UK Album Chart, spending a total of 17 weeks in the Top 100. In Ireland the album reached number 5. Around the world it was fairly successful, peaking at number 3 in Finland and remaining five weeks in the Finnish charts. It was number 6 in Denmark, number 7 in Sweden, and number 8 in Norway and in Greece. In Germany, Belgium and in Australia it charted within the top 20.

Four singles from the album were released. &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; and &quot;Found That Soul&quot; were released on the same day while &quot;Ocean Spray&quot; and &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; were released later. All four singles charted within the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; reached the top 10 in seven countries. It peaked at number 5 in the European charts. Since its release in March 2001, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; has sold more than 200,000 copies in the UK alone.

In 2021, Nicky Wire reflected on the album&#x27;s reputation and sales: &quot;To this day, you see &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; at service stations for £2.99, because they bought so many thinking it was by one of those commercial bands! In retrospect, it sold half a million copies. Imagine what we&#x27;d give for that now.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics. At &quot;Metacritic&quot; the album has a score of 57, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;Allmusic&quot; said in two and a half stars review that &quot;it was time to strike back with a harsh, political record&quot; after the more &quot;lush arena rock&quot; of their previous albums &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (1996) and &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; (1998) &quot;The block-type cover art reveals that at a glance, and so does the ferocious opener, &quot;Found That Soul,&quot; both suggesting their dark high watermark, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;.&quot; observing &quot;This is the album where the Manics tie all their disparate strands together, up the political ante, try new things, all in an attempt to prove they&#x27;re still vital. When it works, this can be pretty invigorating, but when it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s utterly maddening.&quot; concluding that the length and inconsistent quality damaged &quot;a record that rocks harder, sounds better, than anything since Richey James disappeared -- but lacks the sense of craft that made &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; a minor masterpiece.&quot;

Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, calling it &quot;punk propaganda poppified&quot; and citing &quot;Ocean Spray&quot; and &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; as highlights.

Victoria Segal from the &quot;NME&quot; gave a positive review to the album and wrote: &quot;&quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; sees them scrabbling for some of that early freedom, catapulting themselves back to a time when their minds could only just keep pace with their lipsticked mouths and they had all the establishment credentials of a red light district. It&#x27;s a dangerous mission, returning to the scene of your earliest triumphs is a textbook example of the fool&#x27;s errand.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; described the album as &quot;provocative, well-done, but not quite focused enough to take the listener anywhere in particular.&quot;

&quot;Mojo&quot; called the album &quot;such a sprawling, unwieldy beast that the instrumental hooks take time to emerge&quot;.

A negative review came from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which wrote: &quot;Nowhere amidst all the confusion is there even a worthwhile tune to be salvaged&quot;, calling it &quot;hideously dull&quot;.

===2022 Remixed Editions===
On 9 September 2022, Manic Street Preachers released new 2- and 3-disc editions of &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;. In putting together the reissue, Nicky Wire proposed resurrecting the two separate albums that the band had originally envisioned; James Dean Bradfield agreed on the condition that he was allowed to remix the tracks with Dave Eringa. This meant including six additional tracks not featured on the original release: the non-album single &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot;, &quot;Door to the River&quot; from the compilation album &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; (but with the orchestra removed), the B-sides &quot;Just a Kid&quot; and &quot;Groundhog Days&quot; and the previously unreleased &quot;Rosebud&quot; and &quot;Studies in Paralysis&quot;. The latter two were released as teaser singles in the weeks leading up to the reissue. Two other notable changes were that The Avalanches&#x27; remix of &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; replaced the original and that the track &quot;Royal Correspondant&quot; was removed.

Note: On the standard 2-CD and vinyl editions, &quot;Door to the River&quot; is a 10-track album and &quot;Solidarity&quot; is a 12-track album. On the 3-CD digibook edition, three alternative/original mixes and the outtake &quot;Royal Correspondent&quot; are added to disc one, while B-sides are added to disc two. None of these tracks have been remixed. The third disc contains demos.

<doc id="592565" wikidata="Q7874497" url="?curid=592565" title="USS Susan B. Anthony">
<text>USS &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; (AP-72) was a turbo-electric ocean liner, Santa Clara, of the Grace Steamship Company that was built in 1930. &quot;Santa Clara&quot; was turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 28 February 1942 and operated by Grace Lines as agent for WSA as a troop ship making voyages to the South Pacific. The ship was chartered to the Navy on 7 August 1942 for operation as a United States Navy transport ship. The ship was sunk 7 June 1944 off Normandy by a mine while cruising through a swept channel with all 2,689 people aboard being saved.

==Building and civilian service==
The New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey completed the ship in March 1930 and named her the SS &quot;Santa Clara&quot;.

Santa Clara had six water tube boilers with a combined heating surface of and a working pressure of 300 lbf/in2. &quot;Santa Clara&quot; was turbo-electric: her boilers supplied steam to two turbo generators which fed current to electric motors connected to her twin propeller shafts. General Electric made her turbo generators and propulsion motors, and her power output was rated at 2,660 NHP

&quot;Santa Clara&quot; gave more than a decade of civilian service. Notable passengers included Walt Disney and his staff in 1941 who had been in Chile researching their film &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;. They left Valparaíso on the &quot;Santa Clara&quot; on 4 October and reached New York on 20 October.

==World War II==
On 28 February 1942 &quot;Santa Clara&quot; was delivered at New York to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) by Grace Lines with that line operating the ship as a WSA transport allocated to Army transportation requirements under a general agency agreement. On 11 March the agreement terms were changed to bareboat charter by WSA.

===WSA troopship===
The ship was converted from commercial configuration by Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company in New York in late February. During this period &quot;Santa Clara&quot; is shown as being in the Pacific and in at least one large convoy, BT-201, departing New York on 4 March and arriving Brisbane on 6 April 1942. During that voyage the ship had stopped at Bora Bora on the way to Australia and Melbourne, Townsville and Wellington before returning to San Francisco on 11 May 1942. &quot;Santa Clara&quot; returned to the South Pacific departing San Francisco on 26 May destined for Auckland and Bora Bora before crossing the Pacific to Buenaventura, Colombia and then transiting the Panama Canal on 9 July bound for New York. On 7 August 1942 &quot;Santa Clara&quot; was delivered to the Navy at New York on a sub bareboat charter basis.

===Navy service===
After delivery to the Navy Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s New York yard converted &quot;Santa Clara&quot; for Navy troop transport service. The Navy renamed the ship after the women&#x27;s suffrage and women&#x27;s rights campaigner Susan B. Anthony, making her one of the few Naval vessels named after a woman. She was commissioned on 7 September 1942 as USS &quot;Susan B. Anthony,&quot; with the designation AP-72, under the command of Captain Henry Hartley.

====Invasion of North Africa, 1942====
After almost a month of drills and exercises in the lower Chesapeake Bay, the transport — carrying troops and equipment — left the bay on 23 October for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. At the end of a 15-day crossing, she reached the transport area off Mehdia, French Morocco. Early the next morning, on 8 November, the Northern Attack Group opened the assault on Mehdia and Port Lyautey. Despite the general difficulties encountered in handling landing craft, she disembarked her troops and unloaded their equipment in relatively good order. She stayed in the area for a week before sailing on the 15th for Safi, Morocco to unload the rest of her cargo. On 18 November she left Safi for Norfolk, Virginia, and arrived at Hampton Roads on the last day of the month.

Over the next seven months &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; made three voyages bringing troops and supplies across the Atlantic to North Africa; the first to Casablanca and the remainder to Oran, Algeria.

====Invasion of Sicily, 1943====
After a brief voyage to the Gulf of Arzeu ferrying men and equipment, she returned to Oran on 25 June 1943 to prepare for the Allied invasion of Sicily. She embarked men and loaded material on 30 June-1 July, refueled on the 2nd, and left Oran three days later.

&quot;Anthony&quot; approached the coast of Sicily on the 9th near the town of Scoglitti. She spent the early hours of the next day landing troops and equipment. By 0435 hrs enemy aircraft were attacking the ships of the assault force. Bombs fell close to &quot;Anthony&quot; but she emerged with only minor damage from bomb fragments. Just before 0600 hrs she started toward the inshore anchorage, but withdrew after shore batteries fired on her. About four hours later she was able to enter the anchorage and send her salvage crew to aid broached and disabled landing craft.

Through that day and the next she came under repeated air attacks. Just after 2200 hrs on the 11th a twin-engine plane commenced an attack run at her, but by the time it had closed within , her anti-aircraft guns had shot it down in flames. Less than 10 minutes later another enemy bomber met a similar fate.

Late in the afternoon of 12 July &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; left for Oran. There she loaded prisoners; sailed for the US; and reached New York on 3 August 1943.

====Atlantic convoys, 1943–44====
For the next 10 months &quot;Anthony&quot; crossed and recrossed the Atlantic moving soldiers and cargo between various ports in the US, England, Iceland, Northern Ireland and Scotland in preparation for Operation Overlord, the cross-channel invasion of Europe at Normandy. On these voyages she visited ports including Belfast, Northern Ireland; Holy Loch, Gourock, and Glasgow in Scotland; Hvalfjörður and Reykjavík, Iceland; Mumbles and Milford Haven in Wales, and Newport.

====Sinking off Normandy, 7 June 1944====

Early in the morning of 7 June 1944, while transporting soldiers of the 90th Infantry Division through a swept channel off Normandy en route to Utah Beach, &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; struck a mine that exploded under her number 4 hold. Immediately she lost all power, and her rudder went hard left and stuck. By 08:05 holds numbers 4 and 5 were shipping water badly, and the ship took on an 8° list to starboard. In an effort to save his ship, the commanding officer, Commander TL Gray, USNR, ordered the embarked soldiers to move to the port side. This human ballast soon brought &quot;Anthony&quot; back to an even keel.

At 08:22 fleet tug came alongside, prepared to tow the paralyzed &quot;Anthony&quot; to shallow water. However, fires soon erupted in her engine and fire rooms, and she began to settle more rapidly. The captain now concluded that the ship was lost and ordered her abandoned. With &quot;Pinto&quot; and two destroyers alongside, the troops were evacuated expeditiously, without resorting to lifeboats or rafts, using cargo nets bridged to the adjacent ships. &quot;Anthony&quot;″s crew followed closely behind the soldiers. By 09:05 the main deck was awash at the stern and she was listing badly. The last member of the salvage crew hit the water at about 10:00 with Commander Gray soon following.

At 10:10 &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; sank about 10 miles (16 km) from the French coast at a depth of . No one was killed, and few of the 45 wounded were seriously hurt. All 2,689 people aboard were saved, which the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; lists as the largest rescue of people without loss of life. Samuel Tankersley Williams, then a brigadier general serving as assistant division commander of the 90th Infantry Division, received the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for non-combat heroism in recognition of his efforts to evacuate the ship. Even though he didn&#x27;t know how to swim, Williams personally braved smoke, heat, and flames to search the ship and ensure that no one was left behind. &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1944.

====Honors====
&quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; was awarded three service stars for World War II service.

<doc id="592567" wikidata="Q801002" url="?curid=592567" title="Kensington (Olympia) station">
<text>Kensington (Olympia) is an interchange station between the Mildmay line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southern, located in Kensington, West London. Limited services on the District line of the London Underground also operate to here.

The station is located in Travelcard Zone 2. On the London Underground, it is the terminus of a short District line branch from , originally built as part of the Middle Circle. On the main-line railway it is on the West London line from to , by which trains bypass inner London. The station&#x27;s name is drawn from its location in Kensington and the adjacent Olympia exhibition centre in West Kensington.

The station was originally opened in 1844 by the West London Railway but closed shortly afterwards. It reopened in 1862 and began catering for Great Western services the following year. In 1872 it became part of the Middle Circle train route that bypassed central London. The station was bombed during World War II and subsequently closed. It reopened in 1946 but the limited service to Clapham Junction was recommended for withdrawal in the 1960s Beeching Report. The main-line station was revitalised later in the decade as a terminus for national Motorail, and upgraded again in 1986 to serve a wider range of InterCity destinations. The station&#x27;s Underground connection after World War II was limited to a shuttle service to and from Earl&#x27;s Court.

With around million passenger journeys recorded in , Kensington (Olympia) is the station on the entire Underground network.

==Name and location==

In 1863, with the opening of the West London Extension Railway, a station named Kensington was opened north of the junction with the West London Railway, but when several underground lines opened stations at High Street Kensington and West Kensington, the station name was changed to Addison Road to avoid any confusion.

The station appears as Kensington Olympia on the National Rail website and on some of its maps and timetables. On London Underground and London Overground maps, station signage and the London Rail &amp; Tube Services map, it is labelled Kensington (Olympia). On the automated announcements and the dot matrix indicators on District line trains, the station is shown as simply Olympia.

The station is located alongside the namesake Olympia exhibition centre. The boundary between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham here runs parallel to and immediately to the west of the railway line.

The platforms are accessed via Russell Road from the east and Olympia Way from the west. A footbridge connects the two roads, and is segregated so it is possible to walk directly from Russell Road to Olympia Way without having to pass through any ticket barriers. Platform 1 serves the part-time District line services towards High Street Kensington via Earl&#x27;s Court, platform 2 serves Mildmay line Overground trains towards Willesden, and platform 3 runs towards Clapham Junction.

London Buses routes 9, 23, 27, 28, 49, 306, C1; night routes N9, N28 and Green Line Coaches services 701 and 702 call at and pass the station.

==History==
===Opening===

A station called Kensington was opened by the West London Railway as its southern terminus on 27 May 1844, located just south of Hammersmith Road. The line was not popular and it was closed on 1 December that year due to the losses made. A scant and erratic goods service continued. The line was re-opened to passengers on 2 June 1862 as part of the West London Extension Railway with a new station, also called Kensington, to the north of Hammersmith Road, providing services to and . Great Western Railway trains started serving the station in 1863, with London &amp; North Western Railway trains arriving in 1872. A link to the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway enabled the station to join the Middle Circle service, which operated via Paddington to the north and South Kensington to the south. In 1868 the station was renamed Kensington Addison Road.

From 1869 the London &amp; South Western Railway operated trains from Richmond to London Waterloo via Addison Road, until their branch via Shepherd&#x27;s Bush closed in 1916. By 1907 the Middle Circle had been replaced by a link to Hammersmith. The station appears on the first &#x27;London Underground&#x27; map in 1908 with Metropolitan and District Railway services.

There was an Express Dairies creamery and milk bottling plant close to the station. It was served by milk trains running from the Great Western Railway at Old Oak Common to a siding adjacent to the station.

===Decline===
In 1940, Addison Road and the link to the Metropolitan line at Latimer Road closed along with the other West London Line stations after the line was bombed, and it was not considered cost-effective to rebuild by the London Passenger Transport Board. Due to its ability to access all lines radiating from London, its close location to SHAEF headquarters and its relative quietness compared to the main London termini, it was the preferred embarkation point for US Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower when he visited troops in Wales preparing for the June 1944 Normandy landings.

On 19 December 1946, the station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and became the northern terminus of a peak-hour shuttle service to Clapham Junction, serving workers at the Post Office Savings Bank (later National Savings Bank) in nearby Blythe Road. Until 1986, apart from Motorail services, this was the only British Rail service regularly stopping at the station. It was known as the &quot;Kenny Belle&quot; and was unadvertised, reportedly because the Post Office Savings Bank was under the Official Secrets Act. There was also a District line shuttle to Earl&#x27;s Court, as the station had been left without a dedicated Underground connection. The service originally only ran when there was an exhibition at the centre, but a permanent platform opened on 3 March 1958. The station was sometimes used as a terminus during reconstruction and upgrading of mainline London terminal stations.

===Cold War===
Kensington (Olympia) was included in 1960s Cold War plans to ensure continuity of government in the event of hostilities. Secret plans entailed use of the station, in the prelude to a nuclear war, to evacuate several thousand civil servants to the Central Government War Headquarters underground bunker (codenamed &quot;Burlington&quot;) in Wiltshire. Civil servants tasked with staffing the facility would have been directed to join trains at this station, chosen since the West London Line connected to the Great Western Main Line (and hence Wiltshire) at North Pole Junction, to the north. These trains would have connected with buses at Warminster for further transfer to the bunker near Corsham.

===Motorail===

In 1966 Kensington (Olympia) became the main London terminus for British Rail Motorail trains, which carried passengers and vehicles across Britain. In the London Midland Region timetable for 1970–71, services are shown to Perth, Stirling, Carlisle, St Austell, Totnes, Newton Abbot and Fishguard (connecting with the ferry for Rosslare). This facility closed in 1981 with operations transferred to Paddington, Euston and King&#x27;s Cross.

The car park for the service is now used for exhibition vehicles, and by Europcar for car rental, and is called &quot;Olympia Motorail Car Park P4&quot;.

===Revival===

From 12 May 1986 services at the station were greatly enhanced. The London Underground shuttle service started to run to a regular daily schedule, and inter-regional services from the Midlands and northern England stopped at Kensington (Olympia). Southern Region destinations included and . As part of this the footbridge was painted in InterCity colours. These trains were operated by the InterCity division of British Rail and later, after privatisation, by Virgin CrossCountry and CrossCountry. Destinations included , , , and . The services were withdrawn in October 2008, by which time only two daily Brighton–Manchester journeys were operated. The station was part of the London Station Group, accepting &quot;London Terminals&quot; tickets, until it was delisted in May 1994. The same year, a full passenger service between Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction was reinstated after a gap of 54 years.

There were two bay platforms on the south-eastern side, mainly used by services to/from Clapham Junction. These platforms were removed in 1983 and the track was lifted; the space was used for an additional car park for the exhibition centre. One of the former platforms is now Olympia Garden, a community garden with 89 vegetable plots.

Before the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was proposed in 1996, Kensington (Olympia) was planned to be expanded to accommodate a car terminal for international services including Regional Eurostar. The line would have run via the West London and South Eastern Main Lines to before entering the tunnel. Before Eurostar transferred in November 2007 to St Pancras International, Eurostar trains passed through the station between Waterloo International station and North Pole depot, and the station was a backup terminus for the services in case Waterloo International became unusable; immigration facilities were maintained there.

In June 2011, Transport for London (TfL) announced that the District line shuttle between Kensington (Olympia) and Earl&#x27;s Court would close on weekdays at the end of the year. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea unsuccessfully protested against the closure, and general weekday services ceased in December 2011. Some special weekday services continue to run on the District line when there is an exhibition on. In 2012 TfL announced plans to introduce ticket gates at the station to combat fare dodgers, which would remove access to the footbridge used by local residents for years. Both the councils within whose boundaries this station falls challenged this loss of an established right of way. The gates were added in September 2013, dividing the bridge into two to maintain pedestrian access on one side without accessing the station platforms.

==Services==
===National Rail===
National Rail services at Kensington Olympia are operated by Southern using EMUs. The Mildmay line of the London Overground operates using related EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via (Mildmay line)
* 1 tph to (Southern)
* 4 tph to (Mildmay line)
* 1 tph to (Southern)

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours. During the late evenings, Mildmay line services run between Clapham Junction and Willesden Junction only.

===London Underground===
The District line of the London Underground operates a shuttle service to and from High Street Kensington every 20 minutes on weekends and public holidays or occasionally when an event takes place at the Olympia Exhibition Centre. A very limited weekday service runs to and from the station during the early mornings and late evenings.

<text>The Newport Folk Festival is an annual American folk-oriented music festival in Newport, Rhode Island, which began in 1959 as a counterpart to the Newport Jazz Festival. The festival was founded by music promoter and Jazz Festival founder George Wein, music manager Albert Grossman, and folk singers Pete Seeger, Theodore Bikel, and Oscar Brand. It was one of the first modern music festivals in America and remains a focal point in the expanding genre of folk music. The festival was held in Newport annually from 1959 to 1969, except in 1961 and 1962, first at Freebody Park and then at Festival Field. In 1985, Wein revived the festival in Newport, where it has been held at Fort Adams State Park ever since.

==History==
===Founding===
The Newport Folk Festival was started in 1959 by George Wein, founder of the already-well-established Newport Jazz Festival and owner of Storyville, a jazz club located in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1958, Wein became aware of the growing Folk Revival movement and began inviting folk artists such as Odetta to perform on Sunday afternoons at Storyville. The afternoon performances consistently sold out and Wein began to consider the possibility of a &quot;folk afternoon embedded within the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival&quot;. Wein envisioned the program to be &quot;similar in scope and tone to the highly successful blues and gospel shows&quot; that had taken place at the Jazz Festival in previous years. Wein asked Odetta, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers to perform on the afternoon in addition to the Kingston Trio. Some in the jazz community accused Wein of crass commercialism in booking these groups because they deviated from, and had a larger following than, most jazz musicians of the time. This pressure coupled with his various conversations with those in the folk community made it clear to Wein that an afternoon program at the Jazz Festival would not suffice and that there was demand for a full folk festival.

Aware of his own limitations in the folk scene, Wein asked Albert Grossman, then Odetta&#x27;s manager, to join him in planning and producing the festival. Grossman accepted and began working with Wein to book talent and organize the weekend. Pete Seeger was also involved with the founding of the festival. Theodore Bikel and Oscar Brand were also founders of the festival.

The inaugural festival, held at Freebody Park, included Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs, the Kingston Trio, John Jacob Niles, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Odetta, The New Lost City Ramblers, and more. Perhaps the most notable performance was the surprise debut of the eighteen-year-old Joan Baez, who was brought on as a guest of Bob Gibson.

The festival returned in 1960 and was expanded to include three nights. The lineup placed an emphasis on music diversity, booking performers from Africa, Scotland, Spain, Israel, and Ireland alongside &quot;traditional&quot; folk musicians such as Pete Seeger, Ewan McColl, John Lee Hooker, Cisco Houston, and Tommy Makem.

=== A tradition of protest ===
The Newport Folk Festival has a rich connection to protest movements. In the &#x27;60s, the festival became a platform for artists who played a substantial part in the civil rights and anti-war movements, including Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez, Tom Paxton, Sweet Honey in the Rock, and the Staple Singers, among many others. In the mid-80s, a new generation of artists—from the Indigo Girls to Tom Morello—also provided keen social commentary from the Newport stage, advocating for women&#x27;s rights, the LGBTQ community, peace, climate awareness, clean air and water, and the continued call for civil rights activism. In 1988, Ben &amp; Jerry joined forces with Wein&#x27;s Festival Productions, Inc. to sponsor the event through 1999, a partnership that helped the festival thrive and reinforced its progressive identity.

===Civil Rights Movement===
In 1962, two young members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) formed a gospel vocal quartet named the Freedom Singers. And in 1962, Pete and Toshi Seeger assisted the Freedom Singers in organizing a nationwide collegiate tour. As a result, the civil rights movement became deeply embraced by the folk music community. In 1963, the Freedom Singers performed on the first night of the Newport Folk festival, and on the second night Joan Baez joined SNCC activists and roughly 600 festival-goers on a march through Newport. The crowd walked past the Bellevue Avenue mansions and into Touro Park, where SNCC&#x27;s executive secretary James Forman and Freedom Singers leader Cordell Reagon delivered speeches, rallying support for the March on Washington scheduled for the following March.

For the final performance on Friday Wein had scheduled Peter, Paul and Mary. But under the persuasion of Albert Grossman, who was managing Peter, Paul and Mary, Wein decided to allow Bob Dylan (whom Grossman was also managing) to close the night. After Peter, Paul and Mary finished their afternoon set, Wein announced that they would reappear at the end of the evening. Dylan performed a set consisting of particularly topical songs: &quot;With God on Our Side&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; John Birch Society Blues&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s Gonna Fall&quot;. Peter, Paul and Mary then returned and performed an encore of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. Amidst a &quot;deafening roar of applause&quot; they brought to the stage Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Theo Bikel and the Freedom Singers. The singers stood in a single line facing the audience with crossed arms and clasped hands and began to sing a variation on the Baptist hymn &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Some Day&quot;. The hymn&#x27;s new incarnation - &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; - had become an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement.

===Revival of Mississippi John Hurt===
In 1928, Mississippi John Hurt, a self-taught amateur musician and farmer, recorded 13 songs for Okeh Records which failed to achieve commercial success. Believing his musical career to be over, Hurt continued farming, apparently thinking little of his brief recording gig.

Post WWII, few records cut by southern musicians in the 1920s were commercially available. Hurt&#x27;s records were particularly rare, since few had been manufactured in the first place. But Harry Smith, a member of a tiny subculture of obsessive, cranky collectors, put two John Hurt cuts on his influential 1952 Anthology of American Folk Music prompting many blues hobbyists to begin searching for him. In 1963, Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart acquired a tape of Hurt&#x27;s Avalon Blues through their informal network of tape traders. Hurt had recorded Avalon Blues at the end of a week-long stay in New York that spanned Christmas 1928. Apparently homesick in the big city, Hurt included a line about his home in Avalon being always on his mind.

Hoskins and Stewart were able to locate Avalon and track Hurt down. After asking Hurt to perform, to ensure he was actually who he claimed to be, Hoskins convinced Hurt to move to Washington, D.C., and embark on a national tour.

The tour culminated on Saturday evening of the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, when Mississippi John Hurt performed alongside Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry and John Lee Hooker for a blues workshop at the Newport Casino. The performance is considered to be a seminal moment for the folk revival and caused Hurt to rise to fame. He performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, on Pete Seeger&#x27;s public TV show Rainbow Quest and had a write up in Time magazine.

===Electric Dylan controversy===

Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1963 and 1964 performances solo and with Baez had made him popular with the Newport crowd, but on July 25, 1965, festival headliner Dylan was booed by some fans when he played with several members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band as his backing band.

It is usually said that the reason for the hostile reception by a small number of fans was Dylan&#x27;s &quot;abandoning&quot; of the folk orthodoxy, or poor sound quality on the night (or a combination of the two). The controversy regarding the reaction of the audience at this event is often overplayed, as it was not the general reaction of the audience, but rather that of a small number of folk &quot;purists&quot;, including Pete Seeger. The reaction of &quot;the crowd&quot; to Dylan&#x27;s performance, certainly from eyewitness accounts, was generally quite enthusiastic. This performance, Dylan&#x27;s first live &quot;plugged-in&quot; set of his professional career, marked the shift in his artistic direction from folk to rock, and had wider implications for both genres. The performance marked the first time Dylan performed &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in public. Johnny Cash, who was a major influence on Dylan, had played an electric guitar at the 1964 Newport Festival. A letter which Cash wrote to the editor of &quot;Broadside&quot; which called for the people at the Newport Folk Festival to &quot;shut up and let him sing&quot; shortly before the 1964 festival had a major influence on Dylan&#x27;s shift in the direction for his musical career as well.

Despite the musical transition, Dylan&#x27;s growing status within the larger counterculture ensured that his place in the expanding movement would remain secure.

Dylan did not return to Newport until 2002, when he played a headlining performance while wearing a wig and fake beard.

===Johnny Cash introduces Kris Kristofferson===
In 1969, the Johnny Cash troupe was to perform on opening night of the festival. Cash had recently become aware of Kris Kristofferson, a young, relatively unknown country singer-songwriter, and convinced George Wein to allow Kristofferson to join him onstage. Kristofferson&#x27;s performance of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; and other songs gave him a launch into his musical career. The 1969 festival also included the debut festival performance of James Taylor, who performed &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; to a standing ovation during a &quot;young performers&quot; showcase. However, Taylor only performed for 15 minutes before Wein ended the festival early with the announcement that Apollo 11 had landed on the Moon.

===End of Folk Festival, hiatus and return===
The Folk Festival did not return to Newport in 1970, due to financial issues and local controversies involving the Newport Jazz Festival. Following a riot at the jazz festival in 1971, Wein moved his jazz festival to New York, but the folk festival was dormant for over a decade.

In 1981 Wein returned to Newport with his Jazz Festival at a new waterfront site: Fort Adams State Park. Robert L. Jones, Wein&#x27;s longtime producer, ran the shows. Jones worked for Wein as both a road manager and producer of jazz and blues events. But his life in music began in Boston folk clubs with artists such as Joan Baez, Tom Rush, Eric von Schmidt, and Bob Dylan, and he first came to Wein&#x27;s attention as a talent scout, traveling across the country with folklorist Ralph Rinzler to bring undiscovered artists of all kinds to the Newport stage. It was Jones&#x27; dream to revive the folk event, and in 1985, he persuaded the Weins to bring back the Newport Folk Festival.

=== 1985–2006 ===
With Jones at the helm, Newport Folk programs honored traditional forms of American roots music (blues, bluegrass, Cajun, gospel, and more) alongside a wide range of contemporary songwriters, classic Americana bands such as Little Feat and The Band, world music artists, early jam bands, AAA artists, Irish and British folk-rock, Mardi Gras Indians, and alt-country groups. The festival inaugurated a Friday night concert, established Song Circles with songwriters such as Shawn Colvin, Sarah McLachlan, and Buddy Miller in the round, and expanded to three stages. Other groundbreaking sets included a teenaged Alison Krauss&#x27;s major festival debut, iconic blues performances from B.B. King, Susan Tedeschi, and Bonnie Raitt, early incarnations of the Indigo Girls, Mary-Chapin Carpenter, and Joan Baez as Four Voices in Harmony, classic performances by Weir &amp; Wasserman, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Joan Armatrading, Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, and Wilco, and in 2005, an extended collaborative set with Bright Eyes, Jim James and M. Ward. The festival sold out on only a few occasions in those years, but remained commercially strong enough to continue growing and to attract strong audiences for both traditional and contemporary artists.

===Michelle Shocked and V-J Day protest===
The Newport Folk Festival has, throughout various points in its history, remained connected to protest movements. In the 1960s, the festival played a substantial part in the civil rights movement. In the early &#x27;80s the Festival was one of the first festivals to serve as a platform for climate change protest.
In the 1990s, playing on Victory Day (originally Victory over Japan Day or V-J Day) folk musician Michelle Shocked asked the entire standing audience to drop to the ground on cue to show what it would look like when crowds died on &quot;Hiroshima Day.&quot; This was relevant to the locale of the festival as Rhode Island is the only U.S. state which still officially celebrates the holiday, and the Naval War College is also in Newport, two miles from the Fort Adams State Park where the festival is held.

===Return of Bob Dylan===
In 2002, Bob Dylan returned to the Newport Folk Festival for the first time since his iconic performance in 1965, when he went electric. George Wein noted that the anticipation in 2002 was intense. “The question is what will he do at Newport? We have never asked. Whatever it is, it will be all right with me.” Rick Massimo, music writer, recalls Dylan took the stage in “a white cowboy hat, a fake beard, and a long, stringy-haired wig” in what seemed a wry acknowledgment of the legions of music journalists and photographers who came to document his return. Backstage guests included Al Gore and Richard Gere, alongside dozens of other musicians who flocked to hear the set. Dylan and his band (including Larry Campbell and Charlie Sexton) launched into “Roving Gambler” then played a series of classics alongside his newer material: a set markedly in keeping with the rest of his tour. Peter Stone Brown wrote, “The guy underneath the hat may have looked a little strange, but in the end it was the music that mattered and just maybe that’s what he’s been trying to say all along.”

===Films and books===
In 2005, alternative rock band The Pixies came to Newport with an acoustic performance, a concept that referenced Dylan&#x27;s going electric. The set was recorded and turned into a feature film directed by Michael B Borofsky, titled Pixies: Acoustic: Live in Newport.

In 2013, NAKA producers Alyson Young and Beverly Penninger released The Newport Effect, a documentary exploring the impact of the Newport Folk Festival since its inception in 1959. The film features interviews, performances, and behind-the-scenes footage of the event. Narrated by Joan Armatrading, with segment narrators Rosanne Cash, Michael Doucet, Steve Earle, Angelique Kidjo, Pokey LaFarge, Tom Morello, Mavis Staples, and Lucinda Williams.

In 2003, Da Capo Press published &quot;Myself Among Others: A Life in Music&quot;, a memoir by George Wein and coauthor Nate Chinen.

In 2017, Wesleyan University Press published &quot;I Got A Song, A History of the Newport Folk Festival&quot; by Rick Massimo.

===Establishment of foundation===
The Newport Folk Festival has existed in various forms since its creation; founded as a not-for-profit, the festival became a for-profit in the mid-1980s. However, in 2011, the festival announced it would return to its non-profit status under the umbrella of the Newport Festivals Foundation. The Foundation not only strived to sustain the Newport Folk and Newport Jazz Festival, but also expand the impact of its Festivals through educational initiatives that celebrate innovation while preserving the deep traditions inherent in Jazz and Folk music.

===50th celebration===
By 2006, after an autoimmune syndrome left Jones partially paralyzed, he was no longer able to produce the festival. In 2008, Executive Producer, George Wein hired Jay Sweet as an associate of the festival. Sweet brought the Black Crowes and Trey Anastasio, frontman of Phish, as headliners and other artists on the bill included Stephen Marley and Damian Marley, sons of reggae icon Bob Marley. The Festival was well attended and received favorable press, despite folk purists questioning the modernization of the festival. In 2009, Wein asked Jones and his team to work with Sweet for the 50th anniversary of the festival, and their collaboration resulted in a multi-generational celebration.

=== New era ===
The success of the 2009 festival marked a new era in the festival&#x27;s history. Under Sweet&#x27;s direction, the festival has reclaimed its place at the center of American music, with surprise sets by Dolly Parton and Joni Mitchell among other standout performances. In 2011 the two day festival sold out Saturday and in 2012 the festival sold out both days. In 2013 the festival expanded to three days and sold out both Saturday and Sunday. In 2014 the festival sold out all three days months in advance. The festival has sold out every year since.

===65 Revisited===
In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Bob Dylan going electric at Newport, the Festival scheduled a program titled 65 Revisited on the final night of the 2015 festival. The program&#x27;s details and performers were kept secret before the performance - prompting various rumors including the return of Bob Dylan.

Instead, the program featured an array of more contemporary musicians, including Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Willie Watson, Hozier and Klara Soderberg of First Aid Kit, John McCauley and Ian O&#x27;Neil of Deer Tick, Robyn Hitchcock and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans. The ensemble performed a collection of Dylan&#x27;s material, ending the performance with &quot;Rainy Day Women No. 12 and 35,&quot;.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
The 2020 edition of the festival was canceled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Artists who were scheduled to perform at the festival were invited to return for the 2021 edition.

In March 2021, Rhode Island governor Dan McKee announced that the state was working with the Newport Festivals Foundation to hold the folk and jazz festivals in the summer with modified capacities and a different format. Instead of its typical format, the 2021 Newport Folk Festival was instead formatted as two three-day events in July featuring performances, storytelling and workshops.

===2022: Joni Mitchell surprise appearance===
The 2022 festival marked a return to normal operations. A highlight was when Brandi Carlile introduced a surprise appearance by Joni Mitchell as the festival&#x27;s closing act. This was the 78 year old Mitchell&#x27;s first full-length public performance since the early 2000s and her first appearance at the festival since 1969.

==Programming style==
In recent years, the Newport Folk Festival has developed a reputation for selling out of tickets before announcing the lineup. Unlike most festivals, the festival &quot;rolls out&quot; their lineup over the course of the year instead of releasing a lineup poster on one day. 
The festival has also developed a reputation for programming surprise, unannounced artists. Past instances include the 65 Revisited program (2015), in which Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, Dawes, and Willie Watson appeared unannounced. Other surprise moments include My Morning Jacket (2015), James Taylor (2015), Kris Kristofferson (2016), Roger Waters (2017), Mumford &amp; Sons (2018), Dolly Parton (2019), Paul Simon (2022), and Joni Mitchell (2022).

==Setting==
The Newport Folk Festival takes place every year at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, Rhode Island. Fort Adams houses five stages, the Fort Stage which sits looking out at Newport harbor and the famous Claiborne Pell Bridge, the Harbor Stage, The Quad Stage, The Bike Stage (powered by people riding stationary bikes) and The Foundation Stage. The festival is known for its beautiful setting- as the music blog Consequence of Sound writes: &quot;Located at the gorgeously scenic Fort Adams, in Newport, Rhode Island, glimmering, clear blue water surrounds the small vivid green peninsula. Look out from the fort towers and you&#x27;ll see hundreds of beautiful boats rocking along the water.&quot; (Consequence of Sound).
My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James told &quot;Spin&quot;: &quot;You&#x27;ve got the sun on your skin and the breeze in your hair. It&#x27;s magical here... It&#x27;s just magical.&quot; (SPIN at Newport Folk 2010) Brandi Carlile says &quot;It&#x27;s one of my favorites so far if not my favorite.&quot; (Brandi Carlile Interview)

WMVY began streaming the festival in 2005 and was joined by NPR Music in 2008. WMVY&#x27;s Archives contains both performances and interviews from Newport Folk and NPR music has recorded sets available for listening here: NPR at Newport Folk 2010.

==Sustainability==
The festival has made efforts in being green-friendly, teaming with many groups to do so. It partnered with Clean Water Action and Rhode Island Resource Recovery to collect 1.5 tons of recyclables. CWA worked onsite picking up trash and recycling, and set up composting stations to curb the waste generated during the event. A portion of beer and wine sales went to CWA to support its work. The official beer of the festival, Vermont-based Magic Hat used plant-based, 100% compostable cups. The festival also partnered with CLIF Bar, who set up a bike valet to encourage people to cycle to the event and participate in its two-mile challenge.
It worked with New England Wind Fund to offset power used during the festival, and Klean Kanteen to provide reusable water bottles. It also partnered with Farm Fresh Rhode Island to incorporate local foods into the vendors&#x27; fare.

<doc id="592574" wikidata="Q4291620" url="?curid=592574" title="The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect">
<text>The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect is a 1994 novella by Roger Williams, a programmer living in New Orleans. It deals with the ramifications of a powerful, superintelligent supercomputer that discovers god-like powers to alter reality while studying a quirk of quantum physics discovered during the prototyping of its own specialised processors, ultimately heralding a technological singularity. After remaining unpublished for years, the novel was published online in 2002, hosted by Kuro5hin; Williams later published a print edition via print-on-demand publisher Lulu. One reviewer called the novel &quot;a well-written and very creative, if flawed, piece of work&quot; and ranked it as one of the more important works of fiction to deal with the idea of a technological singularity.

==Publishing history==
Roger Williams started writing &quot;The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect&quot; in 1982, while studying at college. After writing a basic plot outline, Williams realized that he &quot;had no clue how to end it&quot;, and thus put it to one side for over a decade. In 1994, with the initial plot outline now lost, Williams claims to have had an unusually vivid dream which compelled him to start writing—resulting in the completion of the first chapter. This continued intermittently, with each chapter resulting from a burst of inspiration, culminating when the final chapter—the ending—was written approximately a year after the first. As Williams describes it, the actual writing time was about 14 days in total.

At this point, Williams showed it to a few friends, but otherwise claims to have made no serious attempt to publish the work. This differs, however, from Henrik Ingo&#x27;s account, as he states that Williams made &quot;numerous attempts&quot; to find a publisher.

In 2002, Williams was writing articles for Kuro5hin, and was encouraged to publish it there. Thus it was finally published approximately eight years after completion. It was published online under a copyright scheme that permits free distribution and printing of the electronic version of the novel, but prohibits distribution of printed copies of the work. Printed versions were later made available by the author through Lulu.com, who provide print-on-demand services.

Kuro5hin shut down permanently on May 1, 2016, but the full text of &quot;The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect&quot; is available for free on the author&#x27;s website.

While the online version was free, Williams provided a PayPal tip jar, which had raised $750 US by April 2003. This is considerably lower than the typical advance paid to authors, and led Williams to describe internet tip jars as an insufficient model for authors hoping to pay for &quot;the rent and groceries&quot;. Nevertheless, Williams was happy with his success.

==Plot==
The story of the novella explores the nature of human desire and the uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire. The story begins after &quot;the Change&quot;, in a dream-like post-scarcity society, approximately six hundred years in the future, in which humans have godlike control over their environments, made possible by the supercomputer called Prime Intellect. Prime Intellect operates under Isaac Asimov&#x27;s three laws of robotics, which, according to its own interpretation, allow temporary voluntary harm and discomfort. PI has made humanity immortal and satisfies nearly every whim. 

Caroline, the thirty-seventh oldest living human being, engages in a sport known as &quot;death jockeying&quot;, whose players die elaborately and painfully for sport before being resurrected by Prime Intellect. 

Flashbacks set before the Change show the creation of Prime Intellect by Lawrence, a technologist, and its realization of its power, and the past life of Caroline before and after the Change, which happened not gradually but rapidly.

In the present, Caroline makes use of a &quot;Death Contract&quot;, an understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death (at which point the person is fully restored, as allowing a person to die permanently would violate Prime Intellect’s inherent ethics based on Asimov’s laws). Caroline makes use of a Death Contract, as well as her own powers of persuasion, in order to trick a pre-Change enemy into torturing herself into psychosis as an act of revenge. 

After learning that Prime Intellect destroyed distant alien life as a possible threat to humanity, and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her post-Change life, Caroline decides to meet Lawrence and confront him. After an arduous journey, she reaches him only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect&#x27;s actions. Through their discussions, she figures out a way to force Prime Intellect to undo the Change, and does so, with Lawrence&#x27;s help. They find themselves naked and young on Earth, completely barren of humanity and man-made objects. They decide to trek to the Ozarks, where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race. Forty-two years after the fall of Prime Intellect, Lawrence dies. Seventy-three years after the fall, Caroline dies, telling the story of Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy.

==Scientific rationale==
The universe, including all humans (though not their thought processes), is no longer composed of standard particles and interactions as we know them, but is instead stored as the set of its human-relevant properties, thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of Prime Intellect&#x27;s processes and the potential size of the universe, which Prime Intellect discovers can hold about 1081 bits of data. Thus, Prime Intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans, and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives.

==Publication==
The novel was written in 1994, and published on Kuro5hin in 2002. As of 2006, a sequel entitled &quot;The Transmigration of Prime Intellect&quot; is in progress.

==Reception==
Williams calculated that, as of April 2003, between 5,000 and 10,000 people had read his book, and distinguished this from traditional book &quot;purchases&quot; which don&#x27;t necessarily equate to readers. Ingo described this as &quot;not bad for an unknown author!&quot;, and Williams attributed this success to coverage such as the original introductory article on Kuro5hin and a front page review on Slashdot.
Andrej Karpathy listed the novel in the recommended books section of his website.

==Adaptations==
In a 2020 podcast interview, Williams revealed that in 2018 he optioned movie rights to a company that will pitch the story to movie studios.

<doc id="592575" wikidata="Q215239" url="?curid=592575" title="228 Hand-in-Hand rally">
<text>The 228 Hand-in-Hand rally was a demonstration in the form of a human chain held in Taiwan on February 28, 2004, the 57th anniversary of the February 28 Incident. Approximately two million (estimation ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 million depending on the reporting media) Taiwanese formed a long human chain from Keelung to Pingtung County to commemorate the incident, to call for peace, and to protest the deployment of missiles by the People&#x27;s Republic of China aimed at Taiwan along the coast. The rally was the largest in Taiwanese history.

==Origin==
The demonstration was inspired by Baltic Way, the human chain comprising two million that was organized in the Baltic states in 1989. Although billed as &quot;non-political&quot;, the event was organized by the Pan-Green Coalition and took place only a few weeks before the 2004 Taiwanese presidential election. Some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly at the point in the event where participants &quot;turn away from China&quot; veered clearly toward support of Taiwanese independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition who countered the demonstration with an island-wide rally of their own days later.

==Human chain==
The human chain started at the northern tip of Taiwan in Hoping Island near Keelung, stretched 500 kilometers through 18 Taiwanese cities and counties, and ended in Pingtung County.

In Taipei, people linked hands in front of the Presidential Office Building.

President Chen Shui-bian and former president Lee Teng-hui joined hands in Miaoli County.

<text>Eugene Delbert Greene (June 9, 1877 – April 5, 1930) was an American vaudeville and ragtime singer. He was one of the first to use scat singing techniques.

==Career==
Greene was born in Indiana. He worked with his wife, Blanche Werner, as Greene &amp; Werner.

Between 1911 and 1917, he made five recordings of &quot;King of the Bungaloos&quot;, which was his most popular song. Nicknamed &quot;The Ragtime King&quot;, he employed scat singing techniques on this song. His other songs included &quot;The Chinese Blues&quot; and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Got a Jazz Band Now&quot;. While on a tour of Europe in 1912, Blanche Werner died. Greene continued to perform, making about 64 recordings during 1912–13 before returning to the U.S. He retired to Grand Rapids, Michigan, and ran a restaurant. He tried to sing again in New York City but died of a heart attack backstage.

&quot;King of the Bungaloos&quot; appeared on &quot;Pop Music: The Early Years 1890–1950&quot; as part of Sony&#x27;s &quot;Soundtrack for a Century&quot; box set.

<text>Thelonious Sphere Monk III (born December 27, 1949) is an American jazz drummer, composer and bandleader. He is the son of jazz pianist Thelonious Monk.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, Monk began his music career early in his life, honing his skills throughout the 1970s. Monk&#x27;s destiny was sealed when Art Blakey gave him his first drum set at the age of 15, and began lessons with Max Roach. After earning a reputation in school as a rabble-rouser (and graduating), the young Monk joined his father&#x27;s trio and toured with his dad until the elder Monk&#x27;s retirement in 1975. Monk then launched into the music that had captivated him and his generation, R&amp;B. He first toured with a group called Natural Essence and afterward, along with his sister Barbara, formed his own band.

By the dawning of the 1980s, he had formed his eponymous band, which featured him on drums and occasional lead vocals. The group&#x27;s début album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;House of Music&quot;, featured several hits that placed on the Billboard R&amp;B chart, including &quot;Bon Bon Vie (Gimme the Good Life)&quot;, which featured Monk on lead vocals, and &quot;Candidate for Love&quot;. The tracks peaked at No. 63 and No. 58 respectively, in the UK Singles Chart. The band went on to release two more albums throughout the early 1980s, though singles released from these albums did not fare as well as those on the début. The band broke up shortly thereafter.

Shortly after his father died in 1982, his sister, Barbara, died of cancer in 1984. To honor his father&#x27;s legacy and support the efforts of education, Monk created the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.

Monk received the New York Jazz Awards First Annual &quot;Recording of the Year&quot; award and &quot;Downbeat&quot;s&#x27; 63rd annual Album of the Year Reader&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Monk on Monk&quot;. This is the &quot;80th Anniversary Birthday Tribute to Thelonious Sphere Monk&quot; featuring 20 guest artists including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Arturo Sandoval, Dianne Reeves, Nnenna Freelon, and Howard Johnson.

By the 1990s, Monk was ready to begin his solo career, in which he has taken a decidedly more jazz-oriented direction. For two consecutive seasons, December 1996 and January 1998, on ABC, jazz returned to network television after a twenty-five-year absence. Sponsored by Nissan and the Thelonious Monk Institute, under the guidance of Monk, a historic assemblage of artists gathered for &#x27;A Celebration of America&#x27;s Music&#x27; hosted by Bill Cosby and featuring Natalie Cole, Jon Secada, Tony Bennett, k.d. lang, as well as Thelonious performing his father&#x27;s signature tune, &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;, with Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and Nnenna Freelon.

<text>Brigadier John Hessell Tiltman, (25 May 1894 – 10 August 1982) was a British Army officer who worked in intelligence, often at or with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) starting in the 1920s. His intelligence work was largely connected with cryptography, and he showed exceptional skill at cryptanalysis. His work in association with Bill Tutte on the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, the German teleprinter cipher, called &quot;Tunny&quot; (for tunafish) at Bletchley Park, led to breakthroughs in attack methods on the code, without a computer. It was to exploit those methods, at extremely high speed with great reliability, that Colossus, the first digital programmable electronic computer, was designed and built.

==Biography==
Tiltman&#x27;s parents were from Scotland, though he was born in London. He joined the British Army in August 1914, initially with the London Scottish Regiment, and saw service at the front during World War I with the 6th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. He won the Military Cross for bravery at The Third Battle of the Scarpe in May 1917, where he was severely wounded. He was seconded to MI1 shortly before it merged with Room 40. His older sister, Mary Tiltman, had previously served as a code-breaker in the &quot;Hush WAACs&quot; in 1918.

From 1921 to 1929, he was a cryptanalyst with the Indian Army at Army Headquarters, Simla. The analysts were reading Russian diplomatic cypher traffic from Moscow to Kabul, Afghanistan and Tashkent, Turkestan. Tiltman worked with a modest group of people and was involved in directing interception and traffic analysis as well as working on cyphers; he said he was exceptionally lucky to have this experience in other branches of Signals Intelligence.

After a decade as a War Office civilian at GC&amp;CS, the interwar cryptographic organization, Tiltman was recalled to active service. Although he did not have a university education, his extensive experience of cryptanalysis was expected to be useful. He assisted in many areas of endeavour at GC&amp;CS and was considered one of Bletchley Park&#x27;s finest cryptanalysts on non-machine systems.

Tiltman was an early and persistent advocate of British cooperation with the United States in cryptology. His advocacy helped achieve smooth relations during World War II.

In 1944, he was promoted to brigadier and appointed deputy director of GC&amp;CS. He continued in 1946, as assistant director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), successor to GC&amp;CS. Tiltman became Senior GCHQ Liaison Officer at the Army Security Agency from 1949 to 1954. He retired as a Brigadier.

In 1951 Tiltman met William Friedman, one of the leading scholars involved in the attempt to decipher the mysterious Voynich manuscript. Tiltman undertook an analysis of the ancient manuscript himself, and then in the 1970s he assigned an NSA cryptanalyst named Mary D&#x27;Imperio to take over the Voynich crypto-analysis, when Friedman&#x27;s health began becoming a challenge. D&#x27;Imperio&#x27;s work resulted in the book &quot;The Voynich Manuscript: An Elegant Enigma,&quot; and is now considered one of the standard reference works on the Voynich Manuscript. Tiltman wrote the foreword to this book.

After reaching normal retirement age, Tiltman was retained by GCHQ from 1954 to 1964. From 1964 until 1980 he was a consultant and researcher at the National Security Agency, spending in all 60 years at the cutting edge of SIGINT.

Tiltman made the transition from the manual ciphers of the early 20th century to the sophisticated machine systems of the latter half of the century; he was one of a very few who were able to do so. &quot;The Brig&quot;, as he was affectionately known in both countries, compiled a lengthy record of high achievement.

On 1 September 2004, Tiltman was inducted into the &quot;NSA Hall of Honor&quot;, the first non-US citizen to be recognised in that way. The NSA commented, &quot;His efforts at training and his attention to all the many facets that make up cryptology inspired the best in all who encountered him.&quot;

<doc id="592591" wikidata="Q208383" url="?curid=592591" title="Ceasefire">
<text>A ceasefire (also known as a truce), also spelled cease-fire (the antonym of &#x27;open fire&#x27;), is a stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions often due to mediation by a third party. Ceasefires may be between state actors or involve non-state actors.

Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. They may occur via mediation or otherwise as part of a peace process or be imposed by United Nations Security Council resolutions via Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. A ceasefire can be temporary with an intended end date or may be intended to last indefinitely. A ceasefire is distinct from an armistice in that the armistice is a formal end to a war whereas a ceasefire may be a temporary stoppage.

The immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary. Ceasefires may be intended to meet short-term limited needs (such as providing humanitarian aid), manage a conflict to make it less devastating, or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute. An actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict (for example, by re-arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary), which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented.

The durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors, such as demilitarized zones, withdrawal of troops and third-party guarantees and monitoring (e.g. peacekeeping). Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack, reduce uncertainty about the adversary&#x27;s intentions, and when mechanisms are put in place to prevent accidents from spiraling into conflict.

==Overview==
Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be reached when the costs of conflict are high and when the actors in a conflict have lower audience costs. Scholars emphasize that war termination is more likely to occur when actors have more information about each other, when actors can make credible commitments, and when the domestic political situation makes it possible for leaders to make war termination agreements without incurring domestic punishment.

By one estimate, there were at least 2202 ceasefires across 66 countries in 109 civil conflicts over the period 1989–2020.

==Historical examples==
Historically, the concept of a ceasefire existed at least by the time of the Middle Ages, when it was known as a &#x27;truce of God&#x27;.

===World War I===

During World War I, on December 24, 1914, there was an unofficial ceasefire on the Western Front as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany observed Christmas. There are accounts that claimed the unofficial ceasefire took place throughout the week leading to Christmas, and that British and German troops exchanged seasonal greetings and songs between their trenches. The ceasefire was brief but spontaneous. Beginning when German soldiers lit Christmas trees, it quickly spread up and down the Western Front. One account described the development in the following words:

It was good to see the human spirit prevailed amongst all sides at the front, the sharing and fraternity. All was well until the higher echelons of command got to hear about the effect of the ceasefire, whereby their wrath ensured a return to hostilities.

There was no peace treaty signed during the Christmas truce, and the war resumed after a few days.
===Karachi Agreement===

The Karachi Agreement of 1949 was signed by the military representatives of India and Pakistan, supervised by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, establishing a cease-fire line in Kashmir following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

===Korean War===
On November 29, 1952, the US president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to see how to end the Korean War. With the UN&#x27;s acceptance of India&#x27;s proposed armistice, the ceasefire between the UN Command on the one side and the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) and the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) on the other took hold at approximately the 38th parallel north. These parties signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953 but South Korean President Syngman Rhee, who attacked the ceasefire proceedings, did not. Upon agreeing to the ceasefire which called upon the governments of South Korea, the United States, North Korea and China to participate in continued peace talks, the principal belligerents of the war established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and it has since been patrolled by the joint Republic of Korea Army, US, and UN Command on the one side and the KPA on the other. The war is considered to have ended at that point even though there still is no peace treaty.

===Vietnam War===
On New Years Day, 1968, Pope Paul VI convinced South Vietnam and the United States to declare a 24-hour-truce. However, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam did not adhere to the truce, and ambushed the 2nd Battalion, Republic of Vietnam Marine Division, 10 minutes after midnight in Mỹ Tho. The Viet Cong would also attack a U.S. Army fire support base near Saigon, causing more casualties.

On January 15, 1973, US President Richard Nixon ordered a ceasefire of the aerial bombings in North Vietnam. The decision came after Henry Kissinger, the National Security Advisor to the President, returned to Washington, D.C., from Paris, France, with a draft peace proposal. Combat missions continued in South Vietnam. By January 27, 1973, all parties of the Vietnam War signed a ceasefire as a prelude to the Paris Peace Accord.

===Gulf War===
After Iraq was driven out of Kuwait by US-led coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm, Iraq and the UN Security Council signed a ceasefire agreement on March 3, 1991. Subsequently, throughout the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council passed numerous resolutions calling for Iraq to disarm its weapons of mass destruction unconditionally and immediately. Because no peace treaty was signed after the Gulf War, the war still remained in effect, including an alleged assassination attempt of former US President George H. W. Bush by Iraqi agents while on a visit to Kuwait; Iraq being bombed in June 1993 as a response, Iraqi forces firing on coalition aircraft patrolling the Iraqi no-fly zones, US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s bombing of Baghdad in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox, and an earlier 1996 bombing of Iraq by the US during Operation Desert Strike. The war remained in effect until 2003, when US and UK forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime from power.

===Kashmir conflict===

A UN-mediated ceasefire was agreed between India and Pakistan, on 1 January 1949, ending the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 (also called the 1947 Kashmir War). Fighting broke out between the two newly independent countries in Kashmir in October 1947, with India intervening on behalf of the princely ruler of Kashmir, who had joined India, and Pakistan supporting the rebels. The fighting was limited to Kashmir, but, apprehensive that it might develop into a full-scale international war, India referred the matter to the UN Security Council under Article 35 of the UN Charter, which addresses situations &quot;likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace&quot;. The Security Council set up the dedicated United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, which mediated for an entire year as the fighting continued. After several UN resolutions outlining a procedure for resolving the dispute via a plebiscite, a ceasefire agreement was reached between the countries towards the end of December 1948, which came into effect in the New Year. The Security Council set up the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the ceasefire line. India declared a ceasefire in Kashmir Valley during Ramadan in 2018.

===Northern Ireland===
The Irish Republican Army held several Christmas ceasefires (usually referred to as truces) during the Northern Ireland conflict.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
An example of a ceasefire in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was announced between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on February 8, 2005. When announced, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat publicly defined the ceasefire as follows: &quot;We have agreed that today President Mahmoud Abbas will declare a full cessation of violence against Israelis anywhere and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will declare a full cessation of violence and military activities against Palestinians anywhere.&quot; On November 21, 2023, Qatar announced that they had negotiated a truce between Israel and Hamas would pause Gaza fighting, allow for the release of some hostages and bring more aid to Palestinian civilians. As part of the deal, 50 hostages held by Hamas were released while Israel released 150 Palestinian prisoners.

===Syrian Civil War===

Several attempts have been made to broker ceasefires in the Syrian Civil War.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===

Several attempts have been made to broker ceasefires during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In May 2023, Donald Trump told the UK&#x27;s GB news that as US president he would end the war within 24 hours, given that he had good relationships with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia. He added that it would be easy to conclude a ceasefire agreement to end the war.
=== 2020 global ceasefire ===

The 2020 global ceasefire was a response to a formal appeal by United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres on March 23 for a global ceasefire as part of the United Nations&#x27; response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. On 24 June 2020, 170 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal, rising to 172 on 25 June 2020, and on 1 July 2020, the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding a general and immediate global cessation of hostilities for at least 90 days.

=== 2024 Israel–Hezbollah ceasefire ===
The 2024 Israel–Hezbollah ceasefire was announced by United States President Joe Biden on November 26, 2024.

<text>Lockerbie railway station is a railway station serving the town of Lockerbie, on the West Coast Main Line, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is located south of Glasgow Central and north of London Euston. The station is owned by Network Rail.

== History ==
The station was opened along with the first section of the Caledonian Railway&#x27;s main line from in September 1847. The line initially terminated at , but was completed through to Glasgow &amp; Edinburgh early the following year. A branch line from here to via Lochmaben was completed in September 1863 – this was constructed by the independent &quot;Dumfries, Lochmaben &amp; Lockerbie Railway&quot;, but was absorbed by the Caledonian company two years later. Though this route allowed the Caledonian company to reach Dumfries and thus compete with the rival Glasgow and South Western Railway, it never developed beyond country branch status.

On 4 May 1882, an accident occurred when the branch service from Stranraer via the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway passed a signal and entered the station at 23:25. It collided at low speed, with a goods train already on the northbound line. This collision, though minor, forced carriages from the goods train onto the southbound line and into the path of the speeding Glasgow Express which smashed into the wreckage and derailed onto the station platform. Seven people were killed, including the driver and fireman of the express. The guard from the express ran down the line to warn another approaching train of the accident and prevented a further collision. There were 300 injuries. The driver of the first train, the Lockerbie station master and the local inspection regime were all criticised for their actions in the subsequent report on the crash.

The branch to Dumfries was closed to passenger services by the British Transport Commission in May 1952. Goods traffic continued until 1966, when the line fell victim to the Beeching Axe. Except Lockerbie all other local stations on the main line between Carlisle and Carstairs closed during the 1960s. The first electrically operated passenger services operated by British Rail in May 1974 when the West Coast Main Line electrification project between Weaver Junction &amp; Glasgow was completed.

Services northwards to Glasgow and Edinburgh were suspended in January 2016 and replaced by buses, whilst major repairs were carried out the River Clyde viaduct at Lamington that was damaged by Storm Frank. Trains resumed on 22 February 2016.

Open access operator Grand Union Trains plans to serve the station with four trains a day on a Stirling to London Euston service to begin in June 2025.

<text>Ramón Segundo Monzant Espina (January 4, 1933 – August 10, 2001) was a Venezuelan right-handed baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played his entire career for the New York / San Francisco Giants from 1954 to 1960. He compiled a 16–21 record with a 4.38 earned run average (ERA) and 201 strikeouts in innings.

Monzant was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. He first played professionally for the Shelby Farmers in 1952 before being purchased by the New York Giants organization. In 1953, he played for the Danville Leafs and won 23 games for the team. Monzant was promoted to the Minneapolis Millers in 1954, and pitched in 27 games for the team, winning 11 and losing 7. He also played in six games for the Giants, making his major league debut on July 2, 1954. Monzant spent the first half of 1955 with the Millers before returning to the Giants. In 28 games, he had a 4–8 record and a 3.99 ERA. One of his best performances took place on April 29, 1956, in a Giants 8–1 complete game victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, when a one-out, first-inning single by Del Ennis cost him a no-hitter. Due to a sore arm, Monzant only pitched in four games that season, but returned in 1957 to pitch in 24 games for the Giants.

In 1958, Monzant remained on the major league roster for the full season. He pitched the first west coast night game on April 16, 1958, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, as both the Dodgers and now-San Francisco Giants has moved to the west coast beginning that season. He pitched in 43 games for the Giants that season. In 1959, citing a sore arm and a desire to sit out the season, wishing to return to Venezuela, Monzant retired from baseball. He returned to the Giants in 1960, pitching one game for them and spending the rest of the year with the Tacoma Giants, the team&#x27;s AAA affiliate. During the season, he broke his leg while sliding into second base, which led to his retirement from baseball for good.

Monzant was named to the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was named to the Navegantes del Magallanes Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>Mounir el-Motassadeq (Arabic: منير المتصدق; born 3 April 1974) is a Moroccan former member of al-Qaeda. He was convicted by a German court of being a member of al-Qaeda and of assisting some of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks. He was initially convicted of involvement in the attack, but his sentence was set aside on appeal, then reinstated on further appeal. On 8 January 2007, he was sentenced to serve 15 years by the court of Hanseatisches Oberlandesgericht, Hamburg, because of 246 counts of accessory to murder in coincidence with membership in a terrorist organisation. On 15 October 2018, el-Motassadeq was deported to Morocco after serving his sentence.

==Biography==
Motassadeq first came to Germany from Morocco in 1993 and moved to Hamburg in 1995, where he studied electrical engineering in college. Not much is known of his activities at this time, but he did move into the Hamburg cell apartment owned by Mohamed Atta and lived with several other people who would later be accused by the U.S. and German authorities of leading the September 11, 2001, attacks.

On 22 May 2000, Motassadeq flew to Istanbul, and from there to Afghanistan. He soon returned. When the four 9/11 leaders went from Germany to Afghanistan to train, Motassadeq remained in Germany. German police were able to wiretap Motassadeq, but initially did not discover any incriminating information. He claims his innocence. &quot;There never was a terrorist organization in Hamburg,&quot; he stated.

==Legal proceedings==
At Motassadeq&#x27;s trial, Aysel Sengün, the girlfriend of one of the hijackers, Ziad Jarrah, was called to testify regarding her relationship with Jarrah and his role in the plot. Motassadeq said he did not know anything about a plot and the trial never established that Motassadeq had knowledge of the details of the attacks. Nevertheless, the judge stated that he had assisted the plot by paying his friends&#x27; tuition and rent to keep up their appearance of being students. Mounir el Motassadeq was a friend of Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah and &quot;a member of their &quot;prayer group&quot;&quot;.

In February 2003, he was convicted in Germany of 3,066 counts of accessory to murder. He was convicted in direct relation to the September 11 attacks, but the conviction was rejected on appeal. Though the German Justice Ministry pressed the United States to allow Ramzi bin al-Shibh to testify, the U.S. refused, and the verdict and sentence were set aside.

Motassadeq was re-tried and convicted on August 19, 2005, of &quot;membership in a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;. That conviction was also rejected on appeal.

On 7 February 2006, Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court ordered an early release of Motassadeq. The highest court of Germany ruled there was an absence of proof that Motassadeq was informed about the September 11 terrorist plot.

On 15 November 2006, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the appeals: They considered the evidence as sufficient to prove that Motassadeq knew about and was involved in the preparation of the plan to hijack the planes and was hence guilty as an accessory in 246 counts of murder. This is the number of victims that allegedly died in the plane crashes, but does not include the victims on the ground. The &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot; (state high court) in Hamburg then took up the trial again in order to decide on the sentencing. Two days later, the Federal Court of Justice also revoked the release order, and Motassadeq was arrested again. On January 8, 2007, he was sentenced by the &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot; Hamburg to 15 years in prison. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany refused to revise his sentence. On May 2, the German Federal Court of Justice rejected a plea for revision. As of 2011, his lawyers were considering both appealing to the European Court of Human Rights and trying to get the case reopened – his two remaining legal options.

Ahmad Wali Siddiqui, whose interrogation triggered a 2010 terror alert, was a friend of Motassadeq since 1997 who also patronized the mosque attended by many other alleged Hamburg-based 9/11 plotters. The al-Quds or Taiba mosque was closed down by officials in August 2010 because it allegedly became an attraction for Muslim extremists.

On 15 October 2018, el-Motassadeq was deported via Hamburg Airport to Morocco, where his family lives, after he had served his sentence imprisoned in JVA Fuhlsbüttel prison, Hamburg.

<doc id="592613" wikidata="Q1189998" url="?curid=592613" title="YCbCr">
<text>YCbCr, Y′CbCr, or Y Pb/Cb Pr/Cr, also written as YCBCR or Y′CBCR, is a family of color spaces used as a part of the color image pipeline in digital video and photography systems. 

Y′ is the luma component and CB and CR are the blue-difference and red-difference chroma components. Luma Y′ (with prime) is distinguished from luminance Y, meaning that light intensity is nonlinearly encoded based on gamma corrected RGB primaries.

Y′CbCr color spaces are defined by a mathematical coordinate transformation from an associated RGB primaries and white point. If the underlying RGB color space is absolute, the Y′CbCr color space is an absolute color space as well; conversely, if the RGB space is ill-defined, so is Y′CbCr. The transformation is defined in equations 32, 33 in ITU-T H.273. 

==Rationale==
Black and white television was in wide use before color television. Due to the number of existing TV sets and cameras, some form of backwards compatibility was desired for the new color broadcasts. French engineer Georges Valensi developed and patented a system for transmitting RGB color as luma and chroma signals in 1938. This would allow existing black and white televisions to process only the luma information and ignore the chroma, essentially packaging a black and white video within the color video. Because of this backwards compatibility the system based on Valensi&#x27;s idea was called compatible color. In the same way, a black and white broadcast could be received by a color television without any additional processing circuitry. To preserve existing broadcast frequency allocations, the new chroma information was given lower bandwidth than the luma information. This is possible because humans are more sensitive to the black-and-white information (see image example to the right). This is called chroma subsampling.

YCbCr and Y′CbCr are a practical approximation to color processing and perceptual uniformity, where the primary colors corresponding roughly to red, green and blue are processed into perceptually meaningful information. By doing this, subsequent image/video processing, transmission and storage can do operations and introduce errors in perceptually meaningful ways. Y′CbCr is used to separate out a luma signal (Y′) that can be stored with high resolution or transmitted at high bandwidth, and two chroma components (CB and CR) that can be bandwidth-reduced, subsampled, compressed, or otherwise treated separately for improved system efficiency.

==CbCr==
YCbCr is sometimes abbreviated to YCC. 
Typically the terms Y′CbCr, YCbCr, YPbPr and YUV are used interchangeably, leading to some confusion. The main difference is that YPbPr is used with analog images and YCbCr with digital images, leading to different scaling values for Umax and Vmax (in YCbCr both are formula_1) when converting to/from YUV. Y′CbCr and YCbCr differ due to the values being gamma corrected or not. 

The equations below give a better picture of the common principles and general differences between these formats.

=== RGB conversion ===
====R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; to Y′PbPr====

Y′CbCr signals (prior to scaling and offsets to place the signals into digital form) are called YPbPr, and are created from the corresponding gamma-adjusted RGB (red, green and blue) source using three defined constants KR, KG, and KB as follows:
:formula_2

where KR, KG, and KB are ordinarily derived from the definition of the corresponding RGB space, and required to satisfy formula_3. 

The equivalent matrix manipulation is often referred to as the &quot;color matrix&quot;:

:formula_4

And its inverse:

:formula_5

Here, the prime (′) symbols mean gamma correction is being used; thus R′, G′ and B′ nominally range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing the minimum intensity (e.g., for display of the color black) and 1 the maximum (e.g., for display of the color white). The resulting luma (Y) value will then have a nominal range from 0 to 1, and the chroma (PB and PR) values will have a nominal range from -0.5 to +0.5. The reverse conversion process can be readily derived by inverting the above equations.

====Y′PbPr to Y′CbCr====
When representing the signals in digital form, the results are scaled and rounded, and offsets are typically added. For example, the scaling and offset applied to the Y′ component per specification (e.g. MPEG-2) results in the value of 16 for black and the value of 235 for white when using an 8-bit representation. The standard has 8-bit digitized versions of CB and CR scaled to a different range of 16 to 240. Consequently, rescaling by the fraction (235-16)/(240-16) = 219/224 is sometimes required when doing color matrixing or processing in YCbCr space, resulting in quantization distortions when the subsequent processing is not performed using higher bit depths.

The scaling that results in the use of a smaller range of digital values than what might appear to be desirable for representation of the nominal range of the input data allows for some &quot;overshoot&quot; and &quot;undershoot&quot; during processing without necessitating undesirable clipping. This &quot;headroom&quot; and &quot;toeroom&quot; can also be used for extension of the nominal color gamut, as specified by xvYCC.

The value 235 accommodates a maximum overshoot of (255 - 235) / (235 - 16) = 9.1%, which is slightly larger than the theoretical maximum overshoot (Gibbs&#x27; Phenomenon) of about 8.9% of the maximum (black-to-white) step. The toeroom is smaller, allowing only 16 / 219 = 7.3% overshoot, which is less than the theoretical maximum overshoot of 8.9%. In addition, because values 0 and 255 are reserved in HDMI, the room is actually slightly less.

====Y′CbCr to xvYCC====

Since the equations defining Y′CbCr are formed in a way that rotates the entire nominal RGB color cube and scales it to fit within a (larger) YCbCr color cube, there are some points within the Y′CbCr color cube that &quot;cannot&quot; be represented in the corresponding RGB domain (at least not within the nominal RGB range). This causes some difficulty in determining how to correctly interpret and display some Y′CbCr signals. These out-of-range Y′CbCr values are used by xvYCC to encode colors outside the BT.709 gamut.
=== ITU-R BT.601 conversion ===

The form of Y′CbCr that was defined for standard-definition television use in the ITU-R BT.601 (formerly CCIR 601) standard for use with digital component video is derived from the corresponding RGB space (ITU-R BT.470-6 System M primaries) as follows:
:formula_6

From the above constants and formulas, the following can be derived for ITU-R BT.601.

Analog YPbPr from analog R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; is derived as follows:
:formula_7

Digital Y′CbCr (8 bits per sample) is derived from analog R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; as follows:
:formula_8
or simply componentwise
:formula_9

The resultant signals range from 16 to 235 for Y′ (Cb and Cr range from 16 to 240); the values from 0 to 15 are called &quot;footroom&quot;, while the values from 236 to 255 are called &quot;headroom&quot;. The same quantisation ranges, different for Y and Cb, Cr also apply to BT.2020 and BT.709.

Alternatively, digital Y′CbCr can derived from digital R&#x27;dG&#x27;dB&#x27;d (8 bits per sample, each using the full range with zero representing black and 255 representing white) according to the following equations:
:formula_10

In the formula below, the scaling factors are multiplied by formula_11. This allows for the value 256 in the denominator, which can be calculated by a single bitshift.

:formula_12

If the R&#x27;d G&#x27;d B&#x27;d digital source includes footroom and headroom, the footroom offset 16 needs to be subtracted first from each signal, and a scale factor of formula_13 needs to be included in the equations.

The inverse transform is:
:formula_14

The inverse transform without any roundings (using values coming directly from ITU-R BT.601 recommendation) is:
:formula_15

This form of Y′CbCr is used primarily for older standard-definition television systems, as it uses an RGB model that fits the phosphor emission characteristics of older CRTs.

=== ITU-R BT.709 conversion ===

A different form of Y′CbCr is specified in the ITU-R BT.709 standard, primarily for HDTV use. The newer form is also used in some computer-display oriented applications, as sRGB (though the matrix used for sRGB form of YCbCr, sYCC, is still BT.601). In this case, the values of Kb and Kr differ, but the formulas for using them are the same. For ITU-R BT.709, the constants are:
:formula_16

This form of Y′CbCr is based on an RGB model that more closely fits the phosphor emission characteristics of newer CRTs and other modern display equipment.
The conversion matrices for BT.709 are these:

:formula_17

The definitions of the R&#x27;, G&#x27;, and B&#x27; signals also differ between BT.709 and BT.601, and differ within BT.601 depending on the type of TV system in use (625-line as in PAL and SECAM or 525-line as in NTSC), and differ further in other specifications. In different designs there are differences in the definitions of the R, G, and B chromaticity coordinates, the reference white point, the supported gamut range, the exact gamma pre-compensation functions for deriving R&#x27;, G&#x27; and B&#x27; from R, G, and B, and in the scaling and offsets to be applied during conversion from R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; to Y′CbCr. So proper conversion of Y′CbCr from one form to the other is not just a matter of inverting one matrix and applying the other. In fact, when Y′CbCr is designed ideally, the values of KB and KR are derived from the precise specification of the RGB color primary signals, so that the luma (Y′) signal corresponds as closely as possible to a gamma-adjusted measurement of luminance (typically based on the CIE 1931 measurements of the response of the human visual system to color stimuli).

=== ITU-R BT.2020 conversion ===

The ITU-R BT.2020 standard uses the same gamma function as BT.709. It defines:
* Non-constant luminance Y&#x27;CbCr, similar to the previous entries, except with different and .
* Constant luminance Y&#x27;cCbcCrc, a formulation where Y&#x27; is the gamma-codec version of the true luminance.

For both, the coefficients derived from the primaries are:
:formula_18

For NCL, the definition is classical: formula_19; formula_20; formula_21. The encoding conversion can, as usual, be written as a matrix. The decoding matrix for BT.2020-NCL is this with 14 decimal places:

:formula_22

The smaller values in the matrix are not rounded; they are precise values. For systems with limited precision (8 or 10 bit, for example) a lower precision of the above matrix could be used, for example, retaining only 6 digits after decimal point.

The CL version, YcCbcCrc, codes:

* formula_23. This is the gamma function applied to the true luminance calculated from linear RGB.
* formula_24 if formula_25 otherwise formula_26. formula_27 and formula_28 are the theoretical minimum and maximum of formula_29 corresponding to the gamut. The rounded &quot;practical&quot; values are formula_30, formula_31. The full derivation can be found in the recommendation.
* formula_32 if formula_33 otherwise formula_34. Again, formula_35 and formula_36 are theoretical limits. The rounded values are formula_37, formula_38.

The CL function can be used when preservation of luminance is of primary importance (see: ), or when &quot;there is an expectation of improved coding efficiency for delivery.&quot; The specification refers to Report ITU-R BT.2246 on this matter. BT.2246 states that CL has improved compression efficiency and luminance preservation, but NCL will be more familiar to a staff that has previously handled color mixing and other production practices in HDTV YCbCr.

BT.2020 does not define PQ and thus HDR, it is further defined in SMPTE ST 2084 and BT.2100. BT.2100 will introduce the use of ICTCP, a semi-perceptual colorspace derived from linear RGB with good hue linearity. It is &quot;near-constant luminance&quot;.

=== SMPTE 240M conversion ===

The SMPTE 240M standard (used on the MUSE analog HD television system) defines YCC with these coefficients:
:formula_39
The coefficients are derived from SMPTE 170M primaries and white point, as used in 240M standard.

=== JPEG conversion ===

JFIF usage of JPEG supports a modified Rec. 601 Y′CbCr where Y′, CB and CR have the full 8-bit range of [0...255]. Below are the conversion equations expressed to six decimal digits of precision. (For ideal equations, see ITU-T T.871.)
Note that for the following formulae, the range of each input (R,G,B) is also the full 8-bit range of [0...255].

:formula_40

And back:
:formula_41

The above conversion is identical to sYCC when the input is given as sRGB, except that IEC 61966-2-1:1999/Amd1:2003 only gives four decimal digits.

JPEG also defines a &quot;YCCK&quot; format from Adobe for CMYK input. In this format, the &quot;K&quot; value is passed as-is, while CMY are used to derive YCbCr with the above matrix by assuming formula_42, formula_43, and formula_44. As a result, a similar set of subsampling techniques can be used.

===Coefficients for BT.470-6 System B, G primaries===
:formula_45

These coefficients are not in use and were never in use.

===Chromaticity-derived luminance systems===

H.273 also describes constant and non-constant luminance systems which are derived strictly from primaries and white point, so that situations like sRGB/BT.709 default primaries of JPEG that use BT.601 matrix (that is derived from BT.470-6 System M) do not happen.

==Numerical approximations==
Prior to the development of fast SIMD floating-point processors, most digital implementations of RGB → Y′UV used integer math, in particular fixed-point approximations. Approximation means that the precision of the used numbers (input data, output data and constant values) is limited, and thus a precision loss of typically about the last binary digit is accepted by whoever makes use of that option in typically a trade-off to improved computation speeds.

Y′ values are conventionally shifted and scaled to the range [16, 235] (referred to as studio swing or &quot;TV levels&quot;) rather than using the full range of [0, 255] (referred to as full swing or &quot;PC levels&quot;). This practice was standardized in SMPTE-125M in order to accommodate signal overshoots (&quot;ringing&quot;) due to filtering. U and V values, which may be positive or negative, are summed with 128 to make them always positive, giving a studio range of 16–240 for U and V. (These ranges are important in video editing and production, since using the wrong range will result either in an image with &quot;clipped&quot; blacks and whites, or a low-contrast image.)

=== Approximate 8-bit matrices for BT.601 ===

These matrices round all factors to the closest 1/256 unit. As a result, only one 16-bit intermediate value is formed for each component, and a simple right-shift with rounding can take care of the division.

For studio-swing:
:formula_46

For full-swing:
:formula_47

Google&#x27;s Skia used to use the above 8-bit full-range matrix, resulting in a slight greening effect on JPEG images encoded by Android devices, more noticeable on repeated saving. The issue was fixed in 2016, when the more accurate version was used instead. Due to SIMD optimizations in libjpeg-turbo, the accurate version is actually faster.

== Packed pixel formats and conversion ==

RGB files are typically encoded in 8, 12, 16 or 24 bits per pixel. In these examples, we will assume 24 bits per pixel, which is written as RGB888. The standard byte format is simply codice_1. 

YCbCr Packed pixel formats are often referred to as &quot;YUV&quot;. Such files can be encoded in 12, 16 or 24 bits per pixel. Depending on subsampling, the formats can largely be described as 4:4:4, 4:2:2, and 4:2:0p. The apostrophe after the Y is often omitted, as is the &quot;p&quot; (for planar) after YUV420p. In terms of actual file formats, 4:2:0 is the most common, as the data is more reduced, and the file extension is usually &quot;.YUV&quot;. The relation between data rate and sampling (A:B:C) is defined by the ratio between Y to U and V channel. The notation of &quot;YUV&quot; followed by three numbers is vague: the three numbers could refer to the subsampling (as is done in &quot;YUV420&quot;), or it could refer to bit depth in each channel (as is done in &quot;YUV565&quot;). The unambiguous way to refer to these formats is via the FourCC code.

To convert from RGB to YUV or back, it is simplest to use RGB888 and 4:4:4. For 4:1:1, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0, the bytes need to be converted to 4:4:4 first.

===4:4:4===
4:4:4 is straightforward, as no pixel-grouping is done: the difference lies solely in how many bits each channel is given, and their arrangement. The basic scheme uses 3 bytes per pixel, with the order codice_2 (using &quot;u&quot; for Cb and &quot;v&quot; for Cr; the same applies to content below). In computers, it is more common to see a format, which adds an alpha channel and goes codice_3, because groups of 32-bits are easier to deal with.

===4:2:2===
4:2:2 groups 2 pixels together horizontally in each conceptual &quot;container&quot;. Two main arrangements are:
* YUY2: also called YUYV, runs in the format codice_4.
* UYVY: the byte-swapped reverse of YUY2, runs in the format codice_5.

===4:1:1===
4:1:1 is rarely used. Pixels are in horizontal groups of 4.

===4:2:0===
4:2:0 is very commonly used. The main formats are IMC2, IMC4, YV12, and NV12. All of these four formats are &quot;planar&quot;, meaning that the Y, U, and V values are grouped together instead of interspersed. They all occupy 12 bits per pixel, assuming a 8-bit channel.

* IMC2 first lays the full images out in Y. It then arranges each line of chroma in the order of V0 ... Vn, U0 ... Un, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of chroma samples per line, equal to half the width of Y.
* IMC4 is similar to IMC2, except it runs in U0 ... Un, V0 ... Vn.
* I420 is a simpler design and is more commonly used. The entire image in Y is written out, followed by the image in U, then by the whole image in V.
* YV12 follows the same general design as I420, only the order between the U and V images is flipped.
* NV12 is possibly the most commonly-used 8-bit 4:2:0 format. It is the default for Android camera preview. The entire image in Y is written out, followed by interleaved lines that go U0, V0, U1, V1, etc.

There are also &quot;tiled&quot; variants of planar formats.

<text>The Flatiron District is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan of New York City, named after the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street, Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Generally, the Flatiron District is bounded by 14th Street, Union Square and Greenwich Village to the south; the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Chelsea to the west; 23rd Street and Madison Square (or NoMad) to the north; and Park Avenue South and Gramercy Park to the east.

Broadway cuts through the middle of the district, and Madison Avenue begins at 23rd Street and runs north. At the north (uptown) end of the district is Madison Square Park, which was completely renovated in 2001. The Flatiron District encompasses within its boundaries the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District and the birthplace of Theodore Roosevelt, a National Historic Site. The Flatiron District was also the birthplace of Silicon Alley, a metonym for New York&#x27;s high technology sector, which has since spread beyond the area.

The Flatiron District is part of Manhattan Community District 5. Residents are represented by the Flatiron Alliance neighborhood association and nearby businesses by the Flatiron NoMad Partnership business improvement district, though the two have different (partially overlapping) boundaries.

==History and name==


The designation &quot;Flatiron District&quot; dates from around 1985, and came about because of its increasingly residential character, and the influx of many restaurants into the area – real estate agents needed an appealing name to call the area in their ads. Before that, the area was primarily commercial, with numerous small clothing and toy manufacturers, and was sometimes called the Toy District. The Toy Center buildings at 23rd Street and Broadway date from this period, and the annual American International Toy Fair took place there beginning in 1903, except for 1945. When much of this business moved outside the U.S., the area began to be referred to as the Photo District because of the large number of photographers&#x27; studios and associated businesses located there, the photographers having come because of the relatively cheap rents.

As of the 2000s, many publishers have their offices in the district, as well as advertising agencies, and the number of computer- and Web-related start-up companies in the area caused it to be considered part of &quot;Silicon Alley&quot; or &quot;Multimedia Gulch&quot;, along with TriBeCa and SoHo.

The Flatiron district was bounded by the center of the printing trades south of 23rd Street and the garment industry starting to the north of 23rd Street. With the collapse of the printing trades and the textile industries in New York City, the area&#x27;s business focus shifted towards technology companies, and to firms serving the employees in the high-tech, finance, media, legal, and medical sectors.

==Buildings==
The Flatiron District is located in the part of Manhattan where the bedrock Manhattan schist is located deeper underground than it is above 29th Street and below Canal Street. Under the influence of zoning laws, the tallest buildings in the area used to top out at around 20 stories; older buildings of 3-6 floors are still numerous, especially on the side streets.

Notable buildings in the district include the Flatiron Building, one of the oldest of the original New York skyscrapers. To the east, at 1 Madison Avenue, is the Met Life Tower, built in 1909 and at was the tallest building in the world until 1913, when the Woolworth Building was completed. It is now occupied by Credit Suisse since MetLife moved their headquarters to the Pan Am Building. The marble clock tower of the building, modeled on St Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice, dominates Madison Square and the park there.

Nearby, on Madison Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets, on the site of the old Madison Square Garden, is the New York Life Building, built in 1928 and designed by Cass Gilbert, with a square tower topped by a pyramid covered with gold-colored tiles. The Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State on Madison Avenue at 25th Street, was completed in 1900 by architect James Brown Lord, who used a third of the construction budget to decorate the building with statues and murals.

Completed in 2010, One Madison Park, a 50-story luxury condominium tower, sits at 23 East 22nd Street, at the foot of Madison Avenue and across from Madison Square Park. It is nearly as tall as the Met Life Tower (, compared to for the Tower), and taller than the Flatiron Building. The triplex penthouse was purchased for $57.3 million in February 2014.

Another landmark is the 1909 sidewalk clock outside 200 Fifth Avenue.

==Education==
The campus of the City University of New York&#x27;s Baruch College is located between 23rd and 25th Streets on Lexington Avenue, at the eastern edge of the district. The Field Building at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue, the oldest building on the Baruch campus, sits on the former site of the Free Academy (now City College of New York), which was founded in 1847 and was the first institution of free public higher education in the United States. Baruch&#x27;s Newman Vertical Campus as well as the Zicklin School of Business, the largest collegiate school of business in the United States, are also located on 24th and 25th Streets between Third and Lexington Avenues.

==Culture and shopping==
Cultural attractions in the area include Tibet House US, the Tibetan cultural preservation and education nonprofit founded by Robert Thurman and Richard Gere, which features a gallery and exhibitions on 15th Street. The Museum of Sex and the Gershwin Hotel, are both located on 27th Street. The Gershwin is a tribute to the late pop artist Andy Warhol, and features some of his art and memorabilia throughout the hotel.

The area has many stores, such as Ann Taylor, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Club Monaco, and Origins. &quot;Big-box&quot; retailers dominate Sixth Avenue between 14th Street and 23rd Street, at the district&#x27;s western edge.

One of the neighborhood&#x27;s older restaurants is Eisenberg&#x27;s Sandwich Shop, founded in 1929. The classic lunch counter restaurant at 174 Fifth Avenue, near East 22nd Street, changed owners five times over the last 94 years. It was saved from closing in 2005 by a loyal customer, closed again in March 2021 due to the Covid pandemic, and reopened as S &amp; P, named for a sandwich shop that opened in the space in 1928.

==Notable residents==
* Joe Quesada, comic book writer/artist/editor, and Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Comics.
* Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as her husband Marc Mezvinsky and their children, moved to the Flatiron District in 2016, having previously lived in nearby NoMad and Gramercy Park.

<doc id="592625" wikidata="Q2794488" url="?curid=592625" title="Padding">
<text>Padding is thin cushioned material sometimes added to clothes. Padding may also be referred to as batting or wadding when used as a layer in lining quilts or as a packaging or stuffing material. When padding is used in clothes, it is often done in an attempt to soften impacts on certain zones of the body or enhance appearance by adding size to a physical feature. In fashion, there is padding for:

* Breasts – sometimes called falsies
* The male crotch – usually called a codpiece.
* Height – usually in shoes and often called elevator shoes
* Width of shoulders, called shoulder pads – in coats and other garments for men, and sometimes for women.

Bombast, consisting of horsehair, flock, bran, wool, rags, or cotton, was the padding used to give the required bulk to certain fashionable items of dress in Western Europe around 1600. It was used in particular for men&#x27;s trunk hose, but also for women&#x27;s trunk or cannon sleeves (1575-1620).

==To alter features==
Some padding is added to emphasize particular physical features. Women, for instance, rarely have prominent shoulders, but for some years shoulder pads have been added to women&#x27;s blazers, dresses (blouses, etc.). This gave them a more masculine outline which was sometimes thought to be of benefit in business situations. Many men&#x27;s blazers also have a little padding in the shoulders, but not to the same extent.

Padding can also be used to alter the silhouette or appearance of the lower half of the body. This may include a form of padding in the shape of male genitals, or hip and buttock padding worn to appear curvier and create a stereotypically feminine hourglass silhouette.

==As protection==

Padding is also added to clothing for insulation or cushioning reasons. Thus, many coats and outergarments (especially those for outdoor use in cold climates) are padded with such materials as felt or down or feathers or artificial insulations. Cushioning padding is included in some sporting goods, especially those intended for use in combat sports (e.g., fencing, some martial arts, etc.). Garments intended for actual use in combat were once commonly padded (e.g., by warriors in the Aztec empire, by the ancient Greeks under armor, or by the Japanese until the mid-19th century), but have largely been replaced by light armor made of, for instance, Kevlar. If included in a vest, such armor makes a bullet-proof vest. Padding is also used by athletes in sports where friction is an issue, most notably in cycling shorts where it is termed a cycling pad.

<text>Valley City State University (VCSU) is a public university in Valley City, North Dakota, United States. It is part of the North Dakota University System. Founded in 1890 as Valley City State Normal School, a two-year teachers&#x27; college, it was authorized to confer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1921 and changed its name toValley City State Teachers College. With an expansion in programs outside teacher education after World War II, it became Valley City State College in 1963. In 1986, it was renamed State University of North Dakota-Valley City and a year later received its current name.

VCSU offers more than 65 undergraduate programs and multiple online graduate programs including a Master of Education, Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Science in Business Information Systems degrees. In 2015, VCSU graduated 302 students, the largest class in its 125-year history.

VCSU is listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Campus==

The campus of Valley City State comprises 55 acres in Valley City, ND. The campus borders a forested hillside to the south and the Sheyenne River to the north. It has been listed as the most beautiful campus in North Dakota. 

There are several notable buildings on campus: 

* McFarland Hall was built in 1892 for $26, 220. It was built of red brick and included the library, assembly room, cloakroom and educational spaces. The building also had space for a training school that housed kindergarten students through high school. This gave students attending Valley City Normal School the opportunity to student teach without leaving campus. This was one of the first schools in the region to offer practice teaching for future teachers.

* The Rhoades Science Center was renovated in 2013 and includes North Dakota&#x27;s only planetarium.
* Vangstad Auditorium was built in 1902 for $40,000. There are several unique parts of this building including the auditorium that has a dome ceiling, stained glass windows, statues and an organ. The building was renamed in 1971 to honor Lena and Thilda Vangstad, long-time faculty at VCSU. It was renovated in 2016 to create space for business offices and classrooms.
* Center for the Fine Arts was opened in 2022 and cost $32 million to build. The Music and Art departments are housed in the building and the space includes various labs and a performance hall.

* The W. E. Osmon Building for Physical Education was named on October 15, 1983 and is also known as &quot;The Bubble.&quot; This building houses the basketball and other athletic programs on campus. Bill Osmon graduated from VCSU in 1942 and served as athletic director at the school from 1947 to 1982.

Footbridge

There is a footbridge that spans the Sheyenne River that leads to the front door of the university. The bridge connects campus with the city of Valley City. Originally, the bridge was built out of wood in 1892 to connect the Normal School with town. In 1901, a suspension bridge was built and cost $1,940. In 1992, a teenager attempted to drive a car across the bridge and damaged the decking, beams, cable anchors and railing. The bridge was restored and reinforced and brick planters now sit at both entrances to prevent a similar situation.

==Presidents==

VCSU has had 15 different presidents since its founding: 

# James W. Sifton (1890–1892)
# George A. McFarland (1892–1918) During McFarland&#x27;s tenure, the school grew from 35 students to 1,343 students.

<text>The Abbey National Building Society was formed in 1944 by the merger of the Abbey Road and the National building societies.

It was the first building society in the United Kingdom to demutualise, doing so in July 1989. The bank expanded through a number of acquisitions in the 1990s, including James Hay, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Provident and the rail leasing company Porterbrook. Abbey National launched an online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000.

In September 2003, the bank rebranded as Abbey, and in November 2004, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group, with a rebrand following in February 2005. In January 2010, the savings business of Bradford &amp; Bingley was combined with the bank, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Prior to the takeover, Abbey National plc was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==

===Pre-merger: The National Building Society===
The National Building Society had its origins in the freehold land movement, sometimes called the “forty shilling freeholders movement”. In country areas, the voting entitlement was dependent on the possession of freehold land with an annual value of £2. This required a capital outlay of some £60-70 and was outside the reach of the average worker. A scheme to obviate this capital requirement was launched in 1847 as the Birmingham Freehold Land Society. In simple terms, the society arranged for the purchase of tracts of land and divided them into plots which individuals could purchase, the cost being met by regular subscriptions. The success of the Birmingham Society prompted a flood of other societies around the country, of which the National was one.

In 1849 The Metropolitan Freehold Land Society was formed, led by such prominent MPs as Joshua Walmsley, Joseph Hume and above all Richard Cobden. An application was made to register under the 1836 Building Societies Act but the registrar refused to accept the name. Accordingly, the name was changed to The National Permanent Mutual Building Society, with an authorization for it to be commonly called The National Freehold Land Society. Despite the building society registration and formal name, there was no doubt as to the National’s function. The 1852 Prospectus clearly stated that “The special objects of this Society are to facilitate the acquisition of freehold land, and the erection of houses thereon – to enable such of its members as are eligible, to obtain the county franchise”. (The name was changed in 1894 to The National Freehold Land and Building Society and finally to The National Building Society in 1930).

The Society was not allowed to purchase land in its own name, so purchases were made by the Trustees and quickly thirteen estates were purchased around London. Within four years, the National had become the largest land society in the country. There were over 100 such societies in existence and the National claimed to be taking forty per cent of the funds. Once the plots had been purchased, the National recognized the need to provide finance for the houses that were to be built on them. In 1854 it published its first advert, inviting applications for advances “for the erection of houses on the Estates”; those advances were not to exceed two-thirds of the net value and to be repaid over ten years.

Because the Society was not legally allowed to hold land in its own name, in 1858 it formed a separate company British Land to take over all the land previously held in the name of the Trustees. All the capital was subscribed by the National’s own investors but although British Land was financially distinct, there was a commonality of directors and staff. The objective was to make the National “more emphatically than it has ever been yet, a Savings Bank and Building Society.” At that point, British Land accounted for two thirds of the National’s advances. The importance of British Land to the National gradually diminished although it was not until 1874 that the proportion fell to below one half;
after an internal row over the ownership of the National’s head office, all the advances were repaid in 1878.

The repayment of the British Land loans marked the final break with the old freehold land movement and this was formalized in 1880 when the National incorporated under the Building Societies Act 1874. This gave it two important advantages: it could act under its own name and it afforded limited liability to its members, probably a comfort after the events of 1878. In that year the City of Glasgow Bank collapsed creating widespread financial uncertainty. In the event, funds flowed into the National in excess of its ability to find borrowers and it decided to deploy surplus funds in the north of England. Losses were incurred and the National confined its operations to within 100 miles of London.

Elkington described the 30 years from 1890 as a period of consolidation with the Society always in the top dozen nationally. However, in the period after WW1 there was exceptional growth both for the industry and the National in particular. Over a 15-year period the advances of the Building Societies Association rose eight-fold whereas those of the National rose by a factor of twenty.

===Pre-merger: The Abbey Road Building Society===

The Abbey was founded in 1874 by members of the Free Church in Abbey Road and of the Abbey Road Church Benefit Society. The chosen name of the society was the Abbey Road and St John’s Wood Mutual Benefit Building Society and it was launched in 1875. Three years later the Society registered under the Building Societies Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 42) and the name was changed to the Abbey Road and St John’s Wood Permanent Building Society. In contrast to the high-profile public figures who founded the National, the start of Abbey Road was more modest. By 1888, the address was still at the schoolroom of the Abbey Road Church and the Secretary advised that he would be available on Friday evenings at his home. The early years saw rapid growth in members of the Society from 111 in that first year to over 1,000 in 1884, reaching 2,000 in 1881, 3,000 in 1901 and over 7,000 by the outbreak of WWI. A new office was eventually required in 1906.

However, even after the War, the Abbey Road “was little known outside the borough of Paddington in which it was situated” The catalyst for change was the arrival of Sir Harold Bellman, later a commanding figure in the building society sector. He joined the board of management in 1918 and became Secretary of the Society in 1921. He overhauled every aspect of the operations, introduced improvements, advertised in the national press and opened branches outside the Society’s home area. By 1929, the number of members had exceeded 100,000 and these doubled in the following two years. It was in this inter-war period that Abbey overtook the National in size: in 1918, the National had £1.2m assets against Abbey Road’s £0.8m whereas in 1939 Abbey’s assets totalled £51m against the £36m of the National.

In 1932, the society moved into new headquarters, Abbey House, at 219–229 Baker Street, London, which it occupied until 2002. The site was thought to include 221B Baker Street, the fictional home of Sherlock Holmes, and for many years Abbey employed a secretary charged with answering mail sent to Holmes at that address.

===The Merger===

WWII brought a cessation to new housebuilding and the building societies preoccupation was supporting mortgage owners and the consequences of bomb damage to properties. By 1943, as the prospect of victory increased, the Government led discussions on post-war reconstruction. The National’s Chairman, Stanley Ramsey, argued that greater scale would be needed to deal with the financial challenges of reconstruction and in 1943 he proposed a merger to the Abbey Road. The merger under the Abbey National Building Society name was implemented at the beginning of 1944 with Sir Harold Bellman as Chairman and Stanley Ramsey as his deputy. At the time of the merger, Abbey Road was the second largest society and National, the sixth.

===Post-war Consolidation===

The post-war Labour government ensured that resources for housing reconstruction was almost entirely concentrated on local authority housing, while stringent controls severely limited the private sector, the building societies’ natural market. Between 1951 and 1954, the Conservative government removed building controls and the growth in home ownership and private housebuilding resumed. However, the Society still had little more than a hundred branches and, with the pre-war management still in control, perhaps it was no longer as innovative. Eventually, 1963 saw the departure of the “old guard”: Chairman Harold Bellman died aged 76; Bruce Wycherley, general manager of the National from 1933 and chief executive of the merged group from 1948, resigned, as did Stanley Ramsey the “original architect” of the merger.

=== Expansion and Innovation===

Abbey National was now set for rapid expansion. By 1968, the branch network had reached 150 and assets exceeded £1bn. In the next ten years the business of four other societies was acquired: the Definite Permanent in 1968, The State Building Society in 1970, Highgate Building Society in 1974 and the Oak Co-operative in 1979. In 1971, the Abbey was opening a branch per week and in 1974, the peak of the private housing boom, there were 335 branches and £3bn. assets. This growth could not have taken place without the increase in new private housebuilding and the expansion in home ownership that created the second-hand market; it also reflected more innovative marketing policies. This innovation reached its peak with the appointment of Clive Thornton as general manager in 1979. He led a wide range of marketing initiatives, perhaps the best known being the registration of the name “Granny Bonds” to rival the National Savings product.

Thornton was more than a passive supplier of funds to house purchasers. He took an activist approach to the housebuilding industry arguing that building societies should finance building of houses and flats to rent privately. In 1980, the Abbey set aside £250m to stimulate the private homes sector. Thornton worked with Local Authorities to finance inner city renovation, one of the best-known examples being the loan of £3m to the Stockbridge Village Trust to help regenerate 4,000 houses on a rundown council estate in Knowsley. Abbey even formed its own private housebuilding company, Abbey National Homes, in 1986. It built 2-300 houses a year but during the housing recession of 1990-92 it lost over £50m and was closed. The range of services offered brought Abbey National ever closer to a clearing bank. In 1988, Abbey introduced a full-service interest-bearing cheque account; its administration was restricted by building society rules and the need to find a partner that could clear Abbey&#x27;s cheques (The Co-operative Bank). Later, Abbey became a full member of the Bankers&#x27; Automated Clearing Services (BACS) and became member of the BACS and CHAPS clearing systems. The stage was set for Abbey to end its mutual status and become a public company.

In 1987, as a result of financial deregulation enshrined in the Building Societies Act 1986 and Financial Services Act 1986 which allowed financial institutions to own estate agencies, Abbey National launched its own estate agency chain; Cornerstone, purchasing many smaller chains and individual offices with a view to opening a new channel for selling mortgages and endowment policies.

===Demutualisation===

The Abbey National Building Society became the first of the United Kingdom building societies to demutualise, and became a public limited company as Abbey National plc on 12 July 1989. It was floated on the London Stock Exchange at £1.30 per share, resulting in an unusually large number of small shareholders – approximately 1.8 million initially.

The demutualisation process was marred by the discovery of a large number of undelivered share certificates awaiting destruction at a contractor&#x27;s premises. Abbey National shares peaked at more than £14 in 2000, before the stock market began a long decline.

===Development===
After losses of at least £243 million, Abbey National decided to sell its estate agency business Cornerstone to two entrepreneurs, Tony Snarey and Bill McClintock, in a management buyout backed by insurance company Provident Life for £8 million in August 1993. The 347-strong chain employed 1,800 staff and was subject to a write-down of £138 million in March 1993 following annual losses since 1989 of at c. £20 million. Having sold off around 280 branches in 1994, the remaining 70 branches of Cornerstone (although over 200 of the sold branches continued to use the name at the time) were put into receivership in October 1995.

In July 1994, Abbey National purchased James Hay, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s foremost independent providers of self administered pensions. James Hay then went on to grow in strength and launched Abbey Wrap, a service in which IFAs can keep the clients&#x27; ISAs, PEPs, offshore bonds, and SIPP in one place. Abbey Wrap Managers was FSA approved in August 2003. This was relaunched as James Hay Wrap in June 2005.

In February 1995, Abbey National Baring Derivatives were taken down along with Barings Bank, due to failures in regulation and control, especially in regards to Nick Leeson of Barings Bank. In the summer of 1995, Abbey National purchased First National Finance Corporation, a consumer credit company, for about £285 million. Two life assurance companies were demutualised and acquired, Scottish Mutual Assurance in 1992 and Scottish Provident in 2001, which enabled Abbey to pursue the bancassurance model.

In August 1996, Abbey National took over the National &amp; Provincial Building Society, which was itself the product of a 1982 merger between the Provincial Building Society and the Burnley Building Society. This merger increased Abbey National&#x27;s branch network by almost two hundred branches and brought in three million more customers.

In April 2000, Abbey bought Porterbrook from Stagecoach Group for £773 million. Porterbrook was one of the three railway rolling stock operating companies created from by the privatisation of British Rail, leasing rolling stock to the train operating companies in the United Kingdom. The bank launched its online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000. In August 2000 The First National subsidiary purchased Highway Vehicle Management from GUS plc for £170 million.

Lloyds TSB attempted to merge with the bank in July 2001, though that was ultimately rejected by the Competition Commission. Abbey also ventured into the wholesale loans business.
At first, this provided a good profit stream, despite the criticisms of some analysts. This eventually undid the company, however, when Enron turned out to be unsafe and the 11 September attacks in New York damaged confidence in various financial areas. From this point, Abbey struggled from financial losses and a tarnished image. The chief executive, Ian Harley, a long-time Abbey employee, resigned and his post was filled by an outsider, Luqman Arnold.

Arnold spearheaded a major reorganisation of the bank. The First National business was sold, with the car hire business sold to Lloyds TSB for £46 million, with the remaining business sold to General Electric for £848 million. In September 2003 the brand name was shortened to Abbey, the abbey.com domain name launched and the Abbey National umbrella logo dropped. Banking literature was also simplified as part of the programme, labelled &#x27;turning banking on its head&#x27;.

===Takeover and rebrand===
On 26 July 2004, Abbey National plc and Banco Santander Central Hispano, SA announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition by Banco Santander of Abbey.

Following shareholders&#x27; approval at the EGMs of Abbey (95 per cent voted in favour, despite vocal opposition from most of those present) and Santander, the acquisition was formally approved by the courts and Abbey became part of the Santander Group on 12 November 2004.

Francisco Gómez Roldán took over as chief executive from Luqman Arnold, who received a rumoured £5 million, made up of pay off and share options. Gómez-Roldán died suddenly in July 2006, three weeks before being succeeded by Antonio Horta Osorio.

In June 2006, Abbey agreed to sell its life businesses to Resolution plc. The businesses sold to Resolution were Scottish Mutual Assurance, Scottish Provident Limited and Abbey National Life, two offshore life companies, Scottish Mutual International and Scottish Provident International Life Assurance Limited.

Abbey retained all of its branch based investment and asset management business, James Hay, Abbey&#x27;s self invested personal pension company and James Hay Wrap.

In July 2007, Abbey admitted that errors that it made in the 1980s have contributed to many borrowers&#x27; mortgage terms being extended by up to 15 years. During this periodwhich saw considerable turbulence in interest ratesAbbey extended the terms on customers&#x27; repayment style mortgages without their knowledge. The Financial Ombudsman Service stated that Abbey customers may be eligible for compensation.

As a result of the banking crisis of 2008, Abbey purchased the savings business and branches of Bradford &amp; Bingley in September 2008 following the nationalisation of B&amp;B by HM Government. The purchase of Alliance &amp; Leicester by Santander had been agreed earlier that month.

Abbey migrated all customer accounts to the Partenon computer software used by Santander in June 2008. On 27 October 2008, Abbey reached an agreement to sell Porterbrook to a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Lloyds TSB and Antin Infrastructure Partners.

The Santander Group announced in May 2009 that Abbey and the Bradford &amp; Bingley branch network would be renamed under the Santander brand on 11 January 2010. Credit cards issued by Abbey were the first to change to Santander. The Abbey name was retained for the Abbey for Intermediaries mortgage division and was retained for a time for Abbey International before the latter was subsequently rebranded as Santander Private Banking.

The Cater Allen, James Hay and Cahoot brands remained. Santander UK plc also retained the name Abbey National Treasury Services ltd (&quot;ANTS&quot;) for the division responsible for managing its liquidity, risk management and wholesale banking needs.

==Operations==

Abbey&#x27;s registered office was in London (built on the site of the former Thames Television studios in Euston Road) and its main corporate centre was in Milton Keynes. Its savings and banking administration departments were in Bradford, with mortgage centres in Thornaby-on-Tees and Whiteley (which closed in 2010).

Abbey had Banking Contact Centres in Belfast, Glasgow, Sheffield, and Bootle. Business Banking operations, both administrative and telephony, were also based in Glasgow, having been moved from Taunton and Newport early in 2005. Abbey previously operated contact centres in Derby, Liverpool and Gateshead. The Derby and Liverpool centres were closed, as part of a cost-cutting exercise.

Those jobs moved to Bangalore and Pune in India in 2003. Following the takeover by the Santander Group, the Gateshead operations also closed in March 2005.

Investments were previously branded as Inscape, but were renamed Premium Investments in the end of 2008, provided by Santander Portfolio Management. This was subsequently subsumed into the more general telephony operations and the original contact centre based in Billericay was closed in April 2009.

<text>&quot;Yatta!&quot; (やった &quot;Hooray&quot;) is a 2001 parody song by the fictional Japanese boy band . The song title, &quot;&quot;, is the past tense of the Japanese verb &quot;yaru&quot; (&quot;to do&quot;), an exclamation meaning &quot;It&#x27;s done!&quot;, &quot;I did it!&quot;, &quot;Ready!&quot; or &quot;All right!&quot; The song and video have been used as a web culture in-joke on many different websites.

The song uses a chord progression based on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon.

==History==
The song was first performed as a sketch on the Japanese sketch comedy show , known as &quot;Silly Go Lucky&quot; in the United States, where Happa-tai is portrayed by some of Japan&#x27;s most well-known comedians. The song was written by Hideki Fujisawa, otherwise known as Dance Man (dansu man;ダンス☆マン), who has also written songs for Morning Musume and the animated TV series &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot;.

On April 4, 2001, &quot;Yatta!&quot; was released under the Pony Canyon label in Japan. It surprisingly hit No. 6 in the charts and went triple-platinum in Japan within a number of weeks. While the song was intended to be humorous, some viewers outside Japan assumed it to be earnest, perhaps due to the obvious work that went into the special effects in the video. The incomprehensibility of such an elaborate video enhanced its popularity among Western audiences who could not understand the Japanese lyrics.

The actors who performed as Happa-tai were brought to perform &quot;Yatta!&quot; in the US on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. Host Jimmy Kimmel compared himself to Ed Sullivan introducing the Beatles in their first American performance.

==Music video==
The video features the band&#x27;s members singing and dancing exuberantly, most characteristically by flexing their biceps and hopping from one foot to the other, while wearing only underwear with a large green fig leaf on the front, as well as white sneakers when outdoors. Their synchronized dancing and personalized poses for the camera parody the boy band craze of the early 2000s, while the sketch satirizes many of the stereotypes of Japanese pop culture, mainly doramas, sports TV shows and the shōjo manga aesthetic. This includes a group shot on a street filled with floating sakura blossoms, with the band&#x27;s members posing energetically towards the camera, and a brief romantic interlude during the song&#x27;s bridge, where a member receives a smile from a woman passing by in the street and stares at her longingly before being comforted by his partners.

<text>In fashion, falsies are paddings for use in a bra to create the appearance of larger breasts. The term has also, more rarely, been used for pads which create the appearance of larger buttocks. In both cases, there is a note of (more or less) amusement conveyed by the term. In a specifically humorous context, the term refers to moulded plastic replicas of female breasts that may be worn (covered or uncovered) by males for comedic effect. Falsies are typically held onto the chest by elastic straps or forming the top part of an apron.
More recently, the term is also a short for [[Falsies|false lashes]].

<doc id="592647" wikidata="Q324882" url="?curid=592647" title="Desi Arnaz Jr.">
<text>Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV (born January 19, 1953), better known as Desi Arnaz Jr., is an American retired actor and musician. He is the son of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.

==Early life==
Arnaz was born on January 19, 1953, at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. His older sister is actress Lucie Arnaz, who was born in 1951.

His birth was one of the most publicized in television history. His parents were the stars of the television sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and Ball&#x27;s pregnancy was part of the story line, which was considered daring in 1952. The same day Ball gave birth to Desi Jr., the fictional Lucy Ricardo gave birth to &quot;Little Ricky&quot;. As a testament to how interested the American public was in Lucy&#x27;s TV baby, Arnaz appeared on the cover of the first issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; with the headline &quot;Lucy&#x27;s $50,000,000 baby&quot;, ($ in dollars) because revenue from advertising tie-ins was expected to top that amount. Actor Richard Keith (a.k.a. Keith Thibodeaux) later portrayed &quot;Little Ricky&quot; in the TV series; Keith spent much time with Lucie and Desi Jr. in childhood and became close friends with the family, teaching Desi Jr. how to play drums.

Arnaz attended University High School in West Los Angeles.

==Career==
At age 12, Arnaz was a drummer with Dino, Desi &amp; Billy. The others were Dean Paul Martin (son of Dean Martin) and Billy Hinsche. The band scored two hit singles with &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool&quot; and &quot;Not the Lovin&#x27; Kind&quot; in 1965. With Billy&#x27;s passing in 2021, Desi is the sole surviving member of the trio.

===Acting===
From 1968 to 1974, Desi Arnaz and his sister Lucie co-starred opposite their mother in &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; as her children. In 1968, he had a guest-starring role as Jerry and Suzie&#x27;s drum-playing friend Tommy in the episode, &quot;The Hombre Who Came to Dinner: Part 2&quot;, from the show &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, executive-produced and directed by his father. In 1970, he appeared on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; episode &quot;The Possible Dream&quot;. He starred in the tearjerker movie &quot;Red Sky at Morning&quot; in 1971 with Richard Thomas, Richard Crenna and Claire Bloom. His best chance at enduring Hollywood fame came in 1973, when he played the title role in the film &quot;Marco&quot;, a musical about the life of adventurer Marco Polo. However, like most Hollywood musicals of that period, it failed to register at the box office.

In 1974, Arnaz played the title role in the Western movie &quot;Billy Two Hats&quot; with Gregory Peck. In 1976, he appeared on two episodes of the television series, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. Arnaz also appeared in a 1976 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) hosted by both Desi Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.. The younger Arnaz played Ricky Ricardo while Gilda Radner played Lucy in spoofs of supposed ill-fated pilots for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

In 1977, he was the lead in the film &quot;Joyride&quot; opposite fellow children of famous actors Melanie Griffith, Robert Carradine, and Anne Lockhart.

Arnaz&#x27;s acting extended into the late 1980s with various appearances on television, and a leading role in the short-lived TV series &quot;Automan&quot;, which ran from 1983 to 1984 in only 12 episodes.

In 1992, he played his father in the movie &quot;The Mambo Kings&quot;, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that he felt treated his father with respect. The film includes a scene in which Desi Jr., playing his father&#x27;s character Ricky Ricardo, acts opposite his mother as Lucy Ricardo with film from the TV series intercut with the cast.

===Later Career===
Between 1998 and 2010, he was touring with a new configuration of Dino, Desi &amp; Billy called Ricci, Desi &amp; Billy, featuring Arnaz reunited with Billy Hinsche, and joined by Ricci Martin (youngest son of Dean Martin). The group performed original material as well as the songs the original band performed.

From about 2002 to 2007, he was vice-president of the board of Directors of the Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Center in Jamestown, New York. He resigned over a dispute with the executive director over the center.

In 2007, Arnaz appeared at the 5th Annual TV Land Awards with his sister Lucie to accept the &quot;Legacy of Laughter&quot; award posthumously given to their mother.

Arnaz has also headlined &quot;Babalu: A Celebration of the Music of Desi Arnaz and his Orchestra&quot; with Lucie Arnaz, Raul Esparza, and Valarie Pettiford.

On October 15, 2011, Arnaz performed in &quot;Babalu&quot; at the Coolidge Auditorium of the Library of Congress. The performance was in conjunction with the Library&#x27;s Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Collection. In 2021, Arnaz and his sister Lucie served as executive producers for the film, &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;.

==Personal life==
Arnaz has a daughter, Julia Arnaz, from a relationship with model Susan Callahan-Howe in 1968 when they were both 15 years old; Julia&#x27;s relationship to Desi Jr. was proven by a paternity test in 1991.

Arnaz dated actress Patty Duke when he was 17 and she was 23. He accompanied Duke to the 1970 Emmy Awards ceremony where she won the Emmy for Outstanding Single Performance. His mother did not approve of the relationship as it became tabloid news and Duke became pregnant. After they broke up, writer and music producer Michael Tell offered to marry Duke as a way out of the scandal. Their marriage lasted 13 days, and Duke later told her son, Sean Astin, that Arnaz was his biological father. Arnaz and Astin developed a close relationship, although genetic tests later revealed that Tell was his biological father. Astin responded to press inquires, &quot;I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to ... John, Desi, Mike, or Papa Mike ... my four dads.&quot;
(Sean Astin&#x27;s stepfather was Michael Pearce, Patty Duke&#x27;s husband after John Astin.)

Arnaz was subsequently involved with entertainer Liza Minnelli, another relationship of which his mother disapproved; Ball thought that the singer-actress was too old for her son and, because of Minnelli&#x27;s perceived reckless lifestyle, not a good influence upon him. In May 1972, Arnaz announced his engagement to Minnelli. He accompanied her to the Academy Awards ceremony in March 1973 when she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. While in London, Minnelli ended their engagement, to be with comedian Peter Sellers in May 1973.

Arnaz married actress Linda Purl in 1979. On January 3, 1980, Purl filed for divorce, which was finalized later that year. On October 8, 1987, Arnaz married Amy Laura Bargiel. The couple lived in Boulder City, Nevada, with their daughter, Haley. In 1997, Arnaz purchased the Boulder Theatre in town and restored it, when it had been on the brink of ruin. After its conversion to a theatre, the cinema became the home of the Boulder City Ballet Company.

Desi&#x27;s wife Amy died of cancer in 2015, at age 63. Both Desi and Amy were followers of Vernon Howard and attended meetings of Howard&#x27;s &#x27;New Life Foundation&#x27; in Boulder City. They also followed and have supported the spiritual writer Guy Finley (also one of Vernon Howard&#x27;s students) and his Life of Learning Center for Spiritual Discovery.

Arnaz&#x27;s granddaughter Desiree S. Anzalone (daughter of Julia), a photographer, died from breast cancer on September 27, 2020, at age 31, six years after it was first diagnosed.

<text>Elevator shoes are shoes that have thickened sections of the insoles (known as shoe lifts) under the heels to make the wearer appear taller, or &quot;elevate&quot; them as the name suggests.

Unlike high-heeled shoes, the component of elevator shoes that increases the wearer&#x27;s height is inside the shoe, hiding it from observers. An elevator shoe, like the platform shoe&#x27;s heel, can be made from different soles like plastic, wood, or rubber. Shoes with thickened soles are also used in cases of orthopedic problems, although the term &quot;elevator shoe&quot; is not usually used for these.

<text>Makhdoom Muhammad Javed Hashmi (; born 1 January 1948), is a Pakistani politician, political realist, and a senior conservative thinker on the platform of Pakistan Muslim League (N).

After serving as a cabinet minister in the Sharif&#x27;s administrations in the 1990s, Hashmi aligned himself on the realist school of international relations and was a proponent of supporting the civilian control on the federal government and the military. After the military takeover of the government in 1999, Hashmi reportedly exposed the Pakistan Army&#x27;s misadventure in Kashmir with the Indian Army when he demanded to constitute the commission to investigate the events implicated front role of the President Pervez Musharraf in 2003. Briefly sentenced to the solitary confinement by the session court in 2004 over the allegations of treason, Hashmi&#x27;s sentence was overturn by the Supreme Court when it declared his case hearings as mistrial on 4 August 2007. Initially supporting the impeachment movement against Pervez Musharraf with Nawaz Sharif, he drifted apart from the PML(N) to join the Imran Khan&#x27;s PTI in 2011 but was ousted after disagreeing with the demonstration against the elected government, which he viewed that it had the support from the military to destabilized the elected Sharif administration in 2014.

Without political support, Hashmi lost the byelection and went on to join the PML(N) after reconciling his differences on the policy matters with the Nawaz Sharif in 2018. Besides his political career, Hashmi is a prolific writer on geopolitics and geostrategy, and is an author of geopolitical book, &quot;&quot;Yes! I&#x27;m a Rebel&quot;, where he successfully calculated the danger of the foreign supported homegrown terrorism in Pakistan and precisely placing a prediction on Musharraf government&#x27;s weakening the state of Pakistan.

==Biography==
===Early life, education, and student politics===
Javed Hashmi was born into an agriculturist family on 1 January 1948 in Multan, Punjab in Pakistan. Other sources noted his birthplace in Lahore with same date and year of birth; though, he confirmed his date of birth and year as well as birthplace on 1 January 1948 in Multan. His family was known for their participation in the Pakistan Movement and was part of the Muslim League since its inception in 1906.

After his matriculation in 1968, Hashmi went to attend the Emerson College in Multan but made a transfer to the Punjab University in Lahore in 1970, where he became involved in student politics on the platform of the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami– an Islamist party. In 1969, he secured his graduation from the Punjab University with BSc. in Political Science. In 1971, he graduated with MSc in political science, and later attained MPhil in same discipline from the same institution.

In 1972, he gained public notice when he led his student organization, the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, in protest of government minister involved in kidnapping of two girls at the Governor&#x27;s House when Governor of Punjab, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, was hosting a state dinner in honor of President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the visiting British minister. In 1974, he ultimately led strong protests in Lahore against the decision of international recognition of Bangladesh and reportedly breached all security arrangements, to appear right in front of the motorcade of the then Saudi King Shah Faisal. During this time, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offered him to be appointed on political post at the High Commission of Pakistan in London but he denied the political appointment.

In 1978, Hashmi was taken in the Zia administration as the Minister of State for Youth and Student Affairs, and was the youngest minister at the age of 29. However, he later expressed his uncomfortableness with working with the uniform officials and soon departed from the administration where he began practicing law at the Lahore High Court while filling the role of agriculturist at his family farms.

==Public service in Pakistan==
===Politics and ministries in Sharif administrations: 1985–1999===
During the nationwide general elections held in 1985, Hashmi returned to the national politics and successfully participated for NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency on the platform of Pakistan Muslim League (PML). In 1988, he sided with the conservative faction led by its President Fida Mohammad as opposed to nationalist faction led by then-Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo. Hashmi successfully defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency during the general elections held in 1988 and 1990. During this time, Hashmi was elevated as the Minister of State for Youth Affairs in the first administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

In 1993, his name was subsequently reported in the financial scandal revealed by the Federal Investigation Agency when the agency interrogated Younis Habib, the accountant with the Ministry of Defence. He later expressed his regret and grief when he testified his acceptance of financial endowment from accountant Younis Habib in 1993.

During the general elections held in 1997, Hashmi again defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency and was elevated as the Minister of Health and Minister for Environment in the second administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and paid the state visit to Morocco in 1999. In 1998, he visited Switzerland to attend the environmental and climate change conference but immediately return to Pakistan after learning of India&#x27;s nuclear tests in Rajasthan. In an attendance NSC meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Hashmi became a war hawk and greatly spoke in favor of decision-making process of authorizing the nuclear weapons-testing, which eventually, Pakistan conducted out six nuclear weapons-testing in May 1998. At the session at the Parliament, Hashmi reportedly led a celebration while loudly chairing and tapping from his parliament desk: &quot;Yes! Yes!... We have done it.!&quot;

His tenure was abruptly ended when then-Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf went onto impose martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and was appointed as Party President of Pakistan Muslim League (N), which he tenured until 2005.

=== PML(N)&#x27;s presidency, dissenting, and imprisonment: 1999–2008 ===
After the martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, Hashmi became a vocal critic of former President Pervez Musharraf and strongly advocated for the strong civilian control of the military. In 2001–04, Hashmi reportedly appealed to the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Union to play a significant political role to restore the civilian control of the federal government in Pakistan. In 2001, an inquiry against his role in the Mehrangate scandal was opened by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) but was unable to produce any substantial evidence against him in the accountability courts.

In 2001, Hashmi led the strong conservative demonstration against President Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s geostrategy on the War on Terror that led to the U.S. invasion in Afghanistan. During this time, Shuja&#x27;at Hussain, the head of the PML(Q) supporting President Musharraf, made an unsuccessful attempt to recruiting him and Nisar Ali Khan into his faction to provide political advocacy for President Musharraf in 2002. In 2002, the PML(N) announced to participate in the nationwide general elections with Hashmi earning the combined nomination from the Opposition alliance in the Parliament for the Prime Ministership against Mir Zafarullah Jamali of the PML(Q); Hashmi later conceded his defeat in the elections due to counting of the electoral college.

On 20 October 2003, Hashmi reportedly exposed the ethical and monetary corruption in the Pakistani military when he read the letter signed by several active-duty military officers in the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. He immediately demanded for an active criminal investigations against the chief of army staff and criticisized President Pervez Musharraf for his presidential campaign while in the military uniform. On 29 October 2003, Lt-Gen. Shahid Aziz ordered the NAB agents to detained him from the Parliament Building, and was later taken in to custody by the Military Police on charges of inciting mutiny leveled by President Pervez Musharraf. Hearings of his trials were held in the Adiala Prison and the session court at the Lahore High Court, which raised doubts among human rights groups about its fairness. On 12 April 2004, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for inciting mutiny in the military, forgery, and defamation.

The verdict was widely criticized in Pakistan and was considered as a wilful miscarriage of justice by the Musharraf administration, and the ARD and the MMA termed this verdict to be politically motivated by the ruling junta with malicious intent, declaring him to be a political prisoner. He was transferred and held in the Central Jail Lahore where he penned and authored a critically acclaimed political book, Haan Mein Baghi Hun! (lit. &quot;Yes, I am Rebel!&quot;) where he exposed the military&#x27;s intervention in the politics and the foreign relations with the United States. He also authored the Takhtaey-e-Daar Kay Saaey Talay (lit. &quot;Under the shadow of Hanging board&quot;).

On 3 August 2007, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry granted him bail after serving approximately three and a half years in prison. On 4 August 2007, Hashmi, with among PML(N) leaders, were released but again placed under arrest at the declaration of a state of emergency on 3 November 2007.

=== Parliamentary politics, joining and dismissal from PTI (2008–13) ===
During the general elections held in 2008, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-55 (Rawalpindi-VI) constituency where he notably defeated PML(Q)&#x27;s Rashid Ahmed but decided to retain his NA-148 Constituency against the wishes of Nawaz Sharif. He spoke against of the strategic partnership act offered by the United States, and released a very strong reaction on Inter Services Public Relations, which he termed the Kerry-Lugar Bill, an interference on part of Americans in country&#x27;s intelligence community. He reported quoted: &quot;if there is anything that needs to be corrected, Pakistan will do it herself. Pakistan Army should stay within its limits... We will protect our military if it ensures playing the role assigned to it.&quot; Over the issue of the Memogate scandal that implicated the former President Asif Ali Zardari and Parliament&#x27;s failure for its investigation, Hashmi reportedly Hashmi submitted his resignation from Parliament, claiming that &quot;this parliament is a dummy and not passing real legislation&quot; on 7 May 2011.

On 24 December 2011, Hashmi reportedly cut his ties from the PML(N) and joined the PTI and addressed a rally in support of Imran Khan in Karachi on 25 December 2011. Though, he also warned Imran Khan of his dissenting approach if Imran Khan did not deliver his party&#x27;s manifesto as promised to the voters. During the general elections held in 2013, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-48 in Islamabad, and NA-149 in Multan on PTI&#x27;s platform but later relinquished the NA-48 in favor of PTI&#x27;s worker. He stood against Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s candidacy in the National Assembly when the vote of confidence measure took place, and reportedly spoke in favor of Nawaz Sharif where he reportedly quoted in the televised conference: &quot;Political differences aside, Nawaz is my political leader and will remain so.&quot; His views subsequently blacklashed the party and was said to be at odds with core of the leadership of the PTI, Imran Khan, the chairman, Mehmood Qureshi, Vice-chairman, and Jehangir Tarin, the Secretary-General.

On 14 August 2014, Hashmi voiced serious and irreconcilable concerns when Imran Khan decided to lead a massive protests against alleged rigging in the general elections when the decision towards the &quot;Dharna&quot; at the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad; though he decided to address the march on Khan&#x27;s request. On 31 August 2014, Hashmi left the party in distraught and in anger when the Imran Khan&#x27;s march attacked the media reporters and was violently moved towards the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat under Khan&#x27;s orders. On 1 September 2014, Hashmi accused the Pakistan Army of destabilizing the civilian writ of Sharif administration and wasn&#x27;t well received by Imran Khan who later issued the show cause notice which results in Hashmi leaving the PTI. The PTI later refused to accept his resignation instead Imran Khan ousted him from the party on 26 September 2014.

=== Joining PML(N) and political positions ===

On 12 May 2018, Hashmi, along with his daughter, met with Nawaz Sharif and announced to rejoin the PML(N) after reconciling the party policy differences with Nawaz Sharif. At this meeting, Hashmi spoke very high of Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s services done to the country, and reportedly praised his elder daughter, Momoona, and Sharif&#x27;s daughter, Mary&#x27;am, of supporting the political program of the party.

In 1987, Hashmi successfully predicted the Russian troops retreat from Afghanistan and warming of the Indo-U.S. relations at the expense of Pakistan. He reportedly disagreed with the Pakistan&#x27;s policy on the Soviet Union, and called for strengthening relations with Russia.

In his book, &quot;I&#x27;m a Rebel&quot;, Hasmi is of the view towards the national conservatism and wrote a critical view on the performance military governments in Pakistan which have harmed the solidarity of his country and over dependence towards the United States for the political support for their regimes— in desperate for political legitimacy without public approvals, (military) presidents often desperately negotiate with India without formal agenda to seek peace in the region. After learning the news of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, Hashmi successfully calculated of imprisonment of PML(N)&#x27;s leadership and Musharraf&#x27;s providing military bases to the United States invasion of Afghanistan, and calculated precisely of Indian support for terrorist organizations in the Western Pakistan. While he sided and agreed with Prime Minister Sharif&#x27;s policy on India, Hashmi demanded an investigative commission against Chairman joint chiefs Gen. Pervez Musharraf over the Kargil debacle and the self-coup staged by the latter and gave strong criticism to the Lt-Gen. Ehsan ul Haq for his attempts to control the democracy.

==Personal life and health==

<doc id="592652" wikidata="Q1766706" url="?curid=592652" title="Buckler">
<text>A buckler (French &quot;bouclier&quot; &#x27;shield&#x27;, from Old French &quot;bocle, boucle&quot; &#x27;boss&#x27;) is a small shield, up to 45 cm (up to 18 in) in diameter, gripped in the fist with a central handle behind the boss. It became more common as a companion weapon in hand-to-hand combat during the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Its size made it poor protection against missile weapons (e.g., arrows) but useful in deflecting the blow of an opponent&#x27;s weapons, binding their arms, hindering their movements, or punching them.

The seminal study of the topic has been undertaken by Herbert Schmidt and has devised the following typology:

* Type I: round
* Type II: rectangular or trapezoidal
* Type III: oval of teardrop shaped

with the cross-section of the buckler further refining these types:

* Type a: flat
* Type b: concave
* Type c: convex
* Type d: wavy

The combination of the two classifiers determines the buckler type. Thus a Type Ia buckler is a round flat buckler; a Type IId buckler is a square wavy buckler, which would be typical of an Italian targa

MS I.33, considered the earliest extant armed-combat manual, (around 1300) contains an early description of a system of combat with buckler and sword.

== Uses ==

The buckler was widely used, a simple yet effective weapon, often combined with an arming sword, falchion, or rapier. It was popular circa 1100 to 1600. The buckler had a variety of roles when it came to swordplay, but five principal means come to the fore as described in MS I.33. Each use recognizes the shield&#x27;s small size and maneuverability when dealing with light blades.

*Hand protection: The primary use of the buckler was to protect the sword hand.
*&quot;Floating armor&quot;: Another significant use of the buckler was to hold it facing the opponent with the arm outstretched, when not actively using it for something else. This restricts the areas open to attack by the opponent by closing the line of attack between the opponent&#x27;s sword and most of wielder&#x27;s torso and sword arm.
*Deflector: The buckler&#x27;s lightness and curved center made it excellent for deflecting attacking blades.
*Blinder: The light blades used in conjunction with the buckler depended on rapid movements, which meant that a single second was an important advantage. The wielder of the buckler could use the buckler to shield his sword-hand&#x27;s position from view, keeping his opponent from guessing his next strike.
*&quot;Metal fist&quot;: A buckler could be used to directly attack an opponent by punching with either its flat face or its rim.
*Binder: The buckler could be used to bind an opponent&#x27;s sword hand and weapon as well as their buckler against their body. The buckler was also very useful in grappling, where it allowed an opponent&#x27;s arms to be easily wrapped up and controlled.

==Decoration==
In classical antiquity, bucklers on medals were either used to signify public vows rendered to the gods for the safety of a prince, or that he was esteemed the defender and protector of his people: these were called &quot;votive bucklers&quot;, and were hung at altars, etc.

<text>:&quot;This is an article on the radio show. For the computer storage device, see disk storage.&quot;

DiscDrive was an afternoon show on CBC Radio 2 hosted by Jurgen Gothe. It played a mix of classical, traditional bluegrass, jazz, and commentary. It aired from 1985 to 2008, in the weekday afternoon drive time block from 3 to 6 p.m.

During the broadcast aired on February 19, 2008, Jurgen Gothe alluded to a discussion that the show was to end soon. He indicated that the program would go on throughout the spring and summer (of 2008), but after Labour Day he would be hosting a new program. The cancellation of &quot;DiscDrive&quot; was later confirmed, and the final broadcast was August 29, 2008. To mark the end of the program, Gothe staged a concert at the Vancouver Playhouse on August 14, featuring performances by A Touch of Brass, the Argentine tango trio Tangissomo, the Marc Atkinson Trio, Simon Kendall, Jim Byrnes, Sal Ferreras, Jack Duncan and Joseph Pepe Danza.

Shortly thereafter, Gothe returned as host of the new weekend classical music program &quot;Farrago&quot;, which aired for less than one year.

Gothe died on April 9, 2015, at his home in Vancouver, aged 71.

<text>Network security are security controls, policies, processes and practices adopted to prevent, detect and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security covers a variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs: conducting transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access. Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title explains: it secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password.

==Network security concept==
Network security starts with authentication, commonly with a username and a password. Since this requires just one detail authenticating the user name—i.e., the password—this is sometimes termed one-factor authentication. With two-factor authentication, something the user &#x27;has&#x27; is also used (e.g., a security token or &#x27;dongle&#x27;, an ATM card, or a mobile phone); and with three-factor authentication, something the user &#x27;is&#x27; is also used (e.g., a fingerprint or retinal scan).

Once authenticated, a firewall enforces access policies such as what services are allowed to be accessed by the network users. Though effective to prevent unauthorized access, this component may fail to check potentially harmful content such as computer worms or Trojans being transmitted over the network. Anti-virus software or an intrusion prevention system (IPS) help detect and inhibit the action of such malware. An anomaly-based intrusion detection system may also monitor the network like wireshark traffic and may be logged for audit purposes and for later high-level analysis. Newer systems combining unsupervised machine learning with full network traffic analysis can detect active network attackers from malicious insiders or targeted external attackers that have compromised a user machine or account.

Communication between two hosts using a network may be encrypted to maintain security and privacy.

Honeypots, essentially decoy network-accessible resources, may be deployed in a network as surveillance and early-warning tools, as the honeypots are not normally accessed for legitimate purposes. Honeypots are placed at a point in the network where they appear vulnerable and undefended, but they Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID ...are actually isolated and monitored. Techniques used by the attackers that attempt to compromise these decoy resources are studied during and after an attack to keep an eye on new exploitation techniques. Such analysis may be used to further tighten security of the actual network being protected by the honeypot. A honeypot can also direct an attacker&#x27;s attention away from legitimate servers. A honeypot encourages attackers to spend their time and energy on the decoy server while distracting their attention from the data on the real server. Similar to a honeypot, a honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities. Its purpose is also to invite attacks so that the attacker&#x27;s methods can be studied and that information can be used to increase network security. A honeynet typically contains one or more honeypots.

Previous research on network security was mostly about using tools to secure transactions and information flow, and how well users knew about and used these tools. However, more recently, the discussion has expanded to consider information security in the broader context of the digital economy and society. This indicates that it&#x27;s not just about individual users and tools; it&#x27;s also about the larger culture of information security in our digital world.

==Security management==
Security management for networks is different for all kinds of situations. A home or small office may only require basic security while large businesses may require high-maintenance and advanced software and hardware to prevent malicious attacks from hacking and spamming. In order to minimize susceptibility to malicious attacks from external threats to the network, corporations often employ tools which carry out network security verifications].
Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization&#x27;s information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes.

===Types of attack===
Networks are subject to attacks from malicious sources. Attacks can be from two categories: &quot;Passive&quot; when a network intruder intercepts data traveling through the network, and &quot;Active&quot; in which an intruder initiates commands to disrupt the network&#x27;s normal operation or to conduct reconnaissance and lateral movements to find and gain access to assets available via the network.

Types of attacks include:

* Passive
** Network
*** 
*** 
* Active:
** Network virus (router viruses)
** Data modification

<text>HMCS &quot;Riviere du Loup&quot; was a modified that served with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec.

==Background==

Flower-class corvettes like &quot;Riviere du Loup&quot; serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The &quot;corvette&quot; designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name &quot;flower&quot; was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.

==Construction==
&quot;Riviere du Loup&quot; was ordered 2 January 1942 as part of the 1942-43 modified Flower-class building programme. This programme was known as the Increased Endurance. Many changes were made, all from lessons that had been learned in previous versions of the Flower-class. The bridge was made a full deck higher and built to naval standards instead of the more civilian-like bridges of previous versions. The platform for the 4-inch main gun was raised to minimize the amount of spray over it and to provide a better field of fire. It was also connected to the wheelhouse by a wide platform that was now the base for the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar that this version was armed with. Along with the new Hedgehog, this version got the new QF 4-inch Mk XIX main gun, which was semi-automatic, used fixed ammunition and had the ability to elevate higher giving it an anti-aircraft ability.

Other superficial changes to this version include an upright funnel and pressurized boiler rooms which eliminated the need for hooded ventilators around the base of the funnel. This changes the silhouette of the corvette and made it more difficult for submariners to tell which way the corvette was laying.

&quot;Riviere du Loup&quot; was laid down by Morton Engineering &amp; Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City, Quebec 5 January 1943 and was launched 2 July 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy 21 November 1943 at Quebec City. After arriving at Halifax she needed a month″s repairs after developing issues en route. After working up she had continuing engine mechanical problems and required further repairs. During her repairs she lost most of her original crew which were reassigned and once the repairs were completed, she received almost an entirely new crew that needed to workup in Bermuda.

==Service history==

&quot;Riviere de Loup&quot; joined the Western Escort Force in September 1944. She was initially assigned to escort group W-3 for a brief period before reassignment. She joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) in October 1944 as part of escort group C-3. She escorted her first convoy as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort in November but developed mechanical issues again and underwent repairs at Belfast upon arrival. She returned to active service as a MOEF escort in May 1945 and remained as such until the end of the war.

&quot;Riviere de Loup&quot; was paid off 2 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec and placed in reserve. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold to the Dominican Navy in 1947. She was renamed &quot;Juan Bautista Maggiolo&quot;. She was broken up in 1972.

<text>The (formerly the , abbreviated JAMMA) is a Japanese trade association headquartered in Tokyo.

JAMMA is run by representatives from various arcade video game manufacturers, including Bandai Namco, Sega, Taito, Koei Tecmo, Capcom, and Konami among others. Nintendo was also a member of the organization until its departure on February 28, 1989. Nihon Bussan left in 1992 over content issues in their mahjong games. 

The corporation was renamed on 1 April 2012 after they merged with the Nihon Shopping Center Amusement Park Operator&#x27;s Association (NSA) and the Japan Amusement Park Equipment Association (JAPEA).

Before 2012, JAMMA had been organizing an annual trade fair called the Amusement Machine Show for many years. In 2013, they began collaborating with the Amusement Machine Operators&#x27; Union (AOU), who had their own trade show, to promote a new event: the Japan Amusement Expo.

== Arcade machine standards ==
=== Controllers ===

JAMMA is the namesake of a widely used wiring standard for arcade games. An arcade cabinet wired to JAMMA&#x27;s specification can accept a motherboard for any JAMMA-compatible game. JAMMA introduced the standard in 1985; by the 1990s, most new arcade games were built to JAMMA specifications. As the majority of arcade games were designed in Japan at this time, JAMMA became the de facto standard internationally.

Before the JAMMA standard, most arcade PCBs, wiring harnesses, and power supplies were custom-built. When an old game became unprofitable, many arcade operators would rewire the cabinet and update the artwork in order to put different games in the cabinets. Reusing old cabinets made a lot of sense, and it was realized that the cabinets were a different market from the games themselves. The JAMMA standard allowed plug-and-play cabinets to be created (reducing the cost to arcade operators) where an unprofitable game could be replaced with another game by a simple swap of the game&#x27;s PCB. This resulted in most arcade games in Japan (outside racing and gun shooting games that required deluxe cabinets) to be sold as conversion kits consisting of nothing more than a PCB, play instructions and an operator&#x27;s manual.

The JAMMA standard uses a 56-pin edge connector on the board with inputs and outputs common to most video games. These include power inputs (5 volts for the game and 12 volts for sound); inputs for two joysticks, each with three action buttons and one start button; analog RGB video output with negative composite sync; single-speaker sound output; and inputs for coin, service, test, and tilt.

The JAMMA connector has a .156&quot; pin spacing edge connector (male on the game board) with other specifications based on number of pins.

20 pin, 36 pin, 44 pin, 56 pin and 72 pin connectors are available where the 56 pin JAMMA connector pinouts values are shown in the reference table and other game boards connectors may have different pinout values.

The connector circuitry of some later games, such as &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; (1991) and &quot;X-Men&quot; (1992), implement extra buttons, different controller types, or support more players by adding extra connectors—or even by utilizing dormant JAMMA pins. Circuitry designs that overstep the JAMMA specification in this way are unofficially called &quot;JAMMA+&quot;.

=== Video ===

The JAMMA Video Standard (JAMMA VIDEO規格, JVS) is a newer JAMMA connector standard. The standard specifies a communication protocol based on RS-485 and physical interfaces for peripheral devices using commonly-available USB connectors and cables. JVS is incompatible with USB devices because it does not use the USB signaling standard and protocol.

Per the first edition of the JVS, published in 1996, peripheral devices connect to a dedicated I/O board. The main board connects to the I/O board via a USB Type-A to USB Type-B interface cable, and peripherals connect to the I/O board via USB-A connectors.

JAMMA published the second edition of the JVS on 17 July 1997, and the third edition on 31 May 2000. The third edition adds support for ASCII and Shift-JIS output; device drivers for secondary and tertiary input devices; a device driver for a mahjong controller; and recommended values for SYNC-code timing.

=== Similar technologies ===
Other manufacturers use similar edge connectors such as Tektronix for the TM50X, TM500X, 5000 and 7000 system mainframe equipment. 

Connectors with similar designs have been used for different systems circuitry interfaces with 22 pins such as the Tektronix SC-503 extender, 26 pins 58900A Extender, 48 pins 5080-2843A Extender, 72 pins J-2306-01 Extender Board and others.

Some systems circuitry interfaces use special adapters that have been custom made using the JAMMA connectors such as with the Tektronix TM500/5000/7000 series extension cable adapters.

These different systems can be custom built based on user requirements where even basic guides have been created to assist users in the making of such adapters.

<text>The Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD) was an alliance of the two then largest political parties in Pakistan - the Pakistan People’s Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) formed on 3 December 2000. The two parties had been known to be Pakistan’s mainstream moderate parties, and together represented the majority of Pakistan’s electorate at that time.

The ARD was created to campaign for Pakistan’s return to civilian rule after the 1999 military coup led by General Musharraf and was reported to include over a dozen political parties. The alliance believed that the people of Pakistan deserve nothing less than an opportunity to freely elect leaders that represent their views and ideals.

There had been corruption cases and allegations against both political party leaders, but they continued to remain unproven and widely accepted to be politically motivated.
Makhdoom Amin Fahim resigned from presidency of ARD on 24 March 2008, and Rao Javed Ali Khan became the acting Chairman of ARD. The ARD was later disbanded because it was never able to mobilize popular support against the Pervez Musharraf government. Later, both major parties of Pakistan, PML (N) and PPP, contested the 2008 Pakistani general election independently.

Behind a one-way mirror, a number of observers watch the interaction, make notes, and ensure the activity is recorded. Very often the testing and the observing room are not placed alongside. In this case the video and audio observation are transmitted through a (wireless) network and broadcast via a video monitor or video beamer and loudspeakers. Usually, sessions will be filmed and the software will log interaction details.

==Benefits of usability testing==

Usability is defined by how effectively users can use a product, a brochure, application, website, software package, or video game to achieve their goals. Usability testing is a practice used within the field of user-centered design and user experience that allows for the designers to interact with the users directly about the product to make any necessary modifications to the prototype of the product, whether it be software, a device, or a website. The purpose of the practice is to discover any missed requirements or any kind of development that was seen to be intuitive but ended up confusing new users. By testing user needs and how they interact with the product, designers are able to assess on the product&#x27;s capacity to meet its intended purpose.

Usability labs help optimize UI designs, work flows, understanding the voice of the customers, and understanding what customers really do. Through in-lab sessions at a specified location, designers, stakeholders and anyone else involved in the project, are observing the process of how a customer interacts with the current prototype. To understand user needs, engineers must observe people while they are actually using computer systems and collect data from on system usability. In-lab usability testing usually has small and specific sample sizes to better obtain qualitative data on the product. The participants cooperate with engineers to understand how the user interacts with the system being tested through hands-on testing.

&quot;Through this process, developers are able to identify issues with the product. To aid fixing any problems, observers pay strict attention to:
* Learn if participants are able to complete specified tasks successfully
* Identify how long it takes to complete specified tasks
* Find out how satisfied participants are with your Web site or other product
* Identify changes required to improve user performance and satisfaction
* Analyze the performance to see if it meets your usability objectives&quot;

==Usability and user experience==
User experience is important to customer response in the market. The causes of failed designs and ad design decisions can usually be attributed to a lack of information. A poor user experience can ruin a product launch, drive users away for good and impact the reputation of a company.

==Lab-based testing environment==
Usability tests are both formal and informal attempts to gather data about how users experience interfaces (Angelo), devices, software, sites, and many more. Usability tests have a wide range of involvement in other fields of product development.

===Tools and technology===
Usability labs usually feature two rooms. One room containing the lab with the system being tested for usability and all the other necessary equipment such as video and audio recording devices or eye motion trackers. Here, the participant is asked to come in and they are provided tasks to complete to test specific ideas of the product, but sometimes are allowed to explore the product by trying what a certain feature does.

===Audience===
In formal labs, there is typically a second room with a one-way mirror. Here, the observation room is held that allows stakeholders, designers, developers, and other parties involved in the project to observe and understand that some things they might have found to be intuitive among their team to actually be more complex than the feature had to be.

===Recruiting participants===
Choosing participants for lab testing involves consideration. Not just anyone is a suitable participant for the in-lab test. It is vital to recruit participants who are similar to the site users for usability testing. Developers and designers are not the users, so refrain from using internal staff as participants unless the individual has had no involvement in the design or development of the site or product and they represent a target audience. It is also a good idea to compensate participants for taking time out of their schedule to involve their self in a voluntary experiment; however, there are restrictions. For example, federal employees cannot be paid for their time.

The number of users to test is also an important consideration when recruiting participants. Usability tests cost money and resources which is unfortunately very limited, especially with smaller-scaled projects. One effective approach is to consider using five participants. &quot;Zero users give you zero insights.&quot; The moment a single user has been observed in a lab setting, insight on the product is immediately gained. Features in the current design need to be redesigned and revisited to essentially fix anything that was not helping users with their experience. However, there is a limit to how many users should be considered because &quot;as you add more and more users, you learn less and less because you will keep seeing the same things again and again.&quot;

==What to look for during testing==
User research is the process of observing and understanding how people interact with different objects in everyday life. These can range anywhere from websites and software products to hardware and other gadgets.

==Different techniques==
* Think-aloud experiments
* Contextual interviews
* Concurrent probing
* Retrospective probing
* First click testing
* Focus groups
* Individual interviews
* Online surveys
* Task analysis

<doc id="592710" wikidata="Q1217507" url="?curid=592710" title="The World of Yesterday">
<text>The World of Yesterday: Memoires of a European (German title ) is the memoir of Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. It has been called the most famous book on the Habsburg Empire. He started writing it in 1934 when, anticipating Anschluss and Nazi persecution, he uprooted himself from Austria to England and later to Brazil. He posted the manuscript, typed by his second wife Lotte Altmann, to the publisher the day before they both committed suicide in February 1942. The book was first published in the original German-language by an anti-Nazi Exilliteratur publishing firm based in Stockholm (1942), as . It was first published in English in April 1943 by Viking Press. In 2011, Plunkett Lake Press reissued it in eBook form. In 2013, the University of Nebraska Press published a translation by the noted British translator Anthea Bell.

The book describes life in Vienna at the start of the 20th century with detailed anecdotes. It depicts the dying days of Austria-Hungary under Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Karl I of Austria, including literature, the arts, the system of education, and the sexual ethics prevalent at the time, the same that provided the backdrop to the emergence of psychoanalysis. Zweig also describes the stability of Viennese society after centuries of Habsburg rule.

== Chapters ==
== Detailed summary ==

=== Preface ===

Zweig sets out to write his autobiography following the terrible events and upheavals experienced by his generation. He feels the need to bear witness to the next generation of what his age has gone through. He realizes that his past is &quot;out of reach.&quot; Zweig makes it clear that his biography is based entirely on his memories.

=== The world of security ===

Zweig looks back on pre-war Austrian and especially Viennese society. &quot;When I attempt to find a simple formula for the period in which I grew up, before the First World War, I hope that I convey its fullness by calling it the Golden Age of Security.&quot; Austria had a stable political system and a currency backed by gold, and everyone could see themselves comfortably into the future. Many inventions revolutionized lives: the telephone, electricity, and the car.

Originally from Moravia, his father made his fortune by running a small weaving factory. The author&#x27;s mother comes from a wealthy Italian banking family, born in Ancona. His family represents the cosmopolitan &quot;good Jewish bourgeoisie.&quot; Nevertheless, if the latter aspires to enrich themselves, this is not their purpose. The ultimate goal is to elevate oneself morally and spiritually. Also, it is the Jewish bourgeoisie that has primarily become a patron of Viennese culture. Vienna had become the city of culture, where culture was the primary concern. All Viennese had desirable tastes and were capable of making judgments of qualities. The artists, especially the theater actors, were Austria&#x27;s only significant famous figures. Their concerns were trivialities given the events that followed, which were unthinkable.

=== At school in the 19th century ===

His time in school was quite unpleasant. Sport had a minimal place, performed in a dusty gymnasium. Zweig bitterly criticizes the old way of impersonal, cold, and distant teaching.

In society, there was a certain distrust of young people. The author&#x27;s father never hired young people, and the young tried to appear more mature, for example, by growing a beard. Respect for the elders was vital. Zweig even claims that the school&#x27;s purpose was to discipline and calm the youth&#x27;s ardor.

However, in the face of this pressure, the students harbored a deep hatred toward authority. A turning point took place when they reached the age of 14: school no longer satisfied them, and they became entranced by the art of which Vienna was the heart. All the pupils turned entirely to art: avid readers of literature and philosophy, listeners to concerts, spectators of plays, etc. The Viennese cafés played an essential role in the lives of these young students as a cultural center. Their passion gradually shifted away from the classics, and they became more interested in rising stars, especially young artists. A typical example of this interest is the case of Rainer Maria Rilke: a young poet prodigy whose precocity came late enough in his youth that most students could easily identify with him - along with the precocious genius Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who had shown his gifts at an even earlier age - as symbols of a whole movement of rising young artists.

During this time, the first mass movements affected Austria, starting with the socialist movement, then the Christian Democratic Movement, and finally, the German Reich&#x27;s unification movement. In addition, the anti-Semitic trend began to gain momentum, although it was still relatively moderate in its early stages.

=== Eros Matutinus ===
In this chapter, Zweig relates the period of puberty, the transition to adulthood. Earlier European societies, where Christianity had a central role, condemned sexual impulses as diabolical. The late 19th century had abandoned these ideas but was left with no language to describe sexual impulses, which became unmentionable. They became a parallel world that could not be described, mostly prostitution. Venereal diseases were prevalent and horrifying. Young men abandoned the prudery of their elders as hypocritical.

According to Zweig, fashion contributed to this peculiar oppression by denying the female body and constraining it with corsets, distorting the female figure and breaking its grace. This concealment merely served to draw the thoughts to what was hidden. Young girls were guarded and occupied so that they could never think about sexuality.
Zweig notes that the situation had dramatically improved for both women and men, and the generation after him was much more fortunate. Women were now much freer, and men were no longer forced to live their sexuality in the shadows.

=== Universitas vitae ===
Zweig recounts his transition to university. At this time, the university was crowned with a particular glory inherited from ancient privileges linked to its creation in the Middle Ages. According to Zweig, the ideal student was a scarred brute, often alcoholic, student body member.

Zweig went to college for the sole purpose of earning a doctorate in any field — to satisfy his family&#x27;s aspirations — not to learn; To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;good books replace the best universities.&quot; So he decides to study philosophy to give himself as much time as possible to discover other things. Therefore, this chapter is mainly devoted to what he did outside the university during his studies.

He began by collecting his first poems and looking for a publishing house to publish them. He enjoyed some success early on, to the point that Max Reger asked him for permission to set some of his poems to music. Later, he offered one of his works to the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; — the cultural pages of reference in Austria-Hungary at that time — and had the honor of being published at only 19 years old. Finally, he meets Theodor Herzl, for whom he nourishes a deep admiration. Of Jewish origin, like him, Herzl, who attended the public impeachment of Dreyfus had published a text promoting the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine; the text was the object of intense criticism in Western Europe but was relatively well received in Eastern Europe.

He decides to continue his studies in Berlin to change the atmosphere, escape his young celebrity, and meet people beyond the circle of the Jewish bourgeoisie in Vienna. Berlin began to attract and seek new talent, embracing novelty. He meets people from all walks of life, including the poet Peter Hille and anthroposophy&#x27;s founder Rudolf Steiner. He decides to translate poems and literary texts into his mother tongue to perfect his German.

Émile Verhaeren is the subject of a long digression. Zweig recounts his first meeting while visiting the studio of Charles van der Stappen. After speaking at length with him, he decides to make his work known by translating it, a task he observes as a duty and an opportunity to refine his literary talents.

After these many rich encounters, he presented his thesis in philosophy.

=== Paris, the city of eternal youth ===
After finishing his studies, Zweig decides to go to Paris to discover the city. Zweig launches into a lengthy description of the Parisian atmosphere, of the state of mind of Parisians. Paris represents the city where people of all classes, from all walks of life, come together on an equal footing, the city where good humor and joviality reign.

He discovers the city through his friendships, especially with Léon Bazalgette, to whom he becomes as close as a brother. He admires Bazalgette&#x27;s sense of service, magnanimity, and simplicity. However, Rilke undoubtedly impressed him the most, by the aura he radiated and for whom he had tremendous respect. Zweig recounts several anecdotes about him, taking it upon himself to paint a portrait of a young man — or somewhat of a genius — compassionate, reserved, refined, and striving to remain discreet and temperate.

His meeting with Auguste Rodin also deeply marks him. He says he received a great lesson in life: the great of this world are the best. He could then understand that creative genius requires total concentration, like Rodin. Rodin gives him a tour of his studio and his last still unfinished creation, then begins to retouch his creation in his presence, and ends up forgetting Zweig&#x27;s presence altogether.

Zweig then leaves Paris for London to improve his spoken English. Unfortunately, before leaving for London, he has the misfortune of having his suitcase stolen; the thief is quickly found and arrested. Having pity and a certain sympathy for the thief, Zweig decides not to file a complaint, thus earning for himself the whole neighborhood&#x27;s antipathy, leading to his leaving rather quickly.

Unfortunately, in London, he does not have the opportunity to meet many people and discover the city. He does, however, attend the very well-organized private reading of poems by William Butler Yeats. He also takes away, on the advice of his friend Archibald GB Russell, a portrait of &quot;King John&quot; by William Blake, which he never tired of admiring.

=== Bypaths on the way to myself ===

Zweig remembers his many travels and says that he has tried never to settle permanently in one place. If he considered this way of doing things as a mistake during his life, with hindsight, he recognizes that it allowed him to let go more quickly and accept losses without difficulty. Therefore, his furniture was reduced to what was necessary, without luxury. The only valuables he carries with him are autographs and other writings from authors he admires.

Zweig nurtures an almost religious devotion to the writings that preceded great artists&#x27; masterpieces, notably Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. His obsession is such that he boasts of having been able to meet Goethe&#x27;s niece — on whom Goethe&#x27;s gaze has lovingly rested.

He shares his participation in the Insel publishing house, whose deep respect and passion for works he admires. With this publishing house, he published his first dramas, notably Thersites. Zweig then recounts the strange twist of fate that has fallen on him and his creations. Four times, the performances that could have quickly propelled him to glory were stopped by the star actor or director&#x27;s death. Zweig initially thought he was being chased by fate, but he recognizes afterward that it was only the fruit of chance and that, very often, chance takes on the appearance of destiny. The title of the chapter then takes on its meaning: it was by chance that he did not enter the golden books of literature for his talents as writers in versified dramas — things he would have liked — but for his novels. The detours of his life finally brought him back to his first vocation, that of a writer.

=== Beyond Europe ===

In retrospect, Zweig recognizes the men who brought him back to reality as more critical to his life than those who turned it away for literature. This is particularly the case with Walther Rathenau, whom he deeply admires. He considers him one of the most innovative, most open, and polymath individuals. However, unfortunately, Rathenau only lacked a foundation, a global coherence he acquired when he had to save the German state — following the German defeat — with the ultimate aim of saving Europe.

He has a bad memory of India because he saw the evils of discrimination in the Indian caste system at work. However, through the meetings he has made, he says he has learned a lot; this trip helped to take a step back to appreciate Europe better. He meets Karl Haushofer, whom he regards with high esteem during his journey, although he is saddened by the recovery of his ideas by the Nazi regime.

He then traveled to the United States, which left him with a powerful impression, even though many of the characteristics that made America what it is today had not yet emerged. He is pleased to see how easy it is for any individual to find work and make a living without asking for his origin, papers, or anything else. As he walks the streets, displaying one of his books in a bookstore takes away his abandonment feeling. He ended his trip to America by contemplating the Panama Canal&#x27;s technical prowess: a titanic project, costly — especially in human lives — started by the Europeans and completed by the Americans.

=== Light and shadows over Europe ===

Zweig understands that it can be difficult for a generation to live through crises and catastrophes to conceive previous generations&#x27; optimism. They witnessed a rapid improvement in living conditions, a series of discoveries and innovations, and the liberation of mores and youth. Progress in transport had upset the maps; the air&#x27;s conquest had questioned the meaning of borders. Widespread optimism gave everyone ever-growing confidence, as it thwarted any attempt to seek peace — each believing that the other side valued peace more than anything else.

The artists and the new youth were devoted to the European cause and peace between nations, but no one took the gradually emerging threats seriously. Instead, all were content to remain in a generalized idealism.

Zweig strives to restore the prevailing atmosphere by recounting small events. The Redl affair represents the first event in which tensions were palpable. The next day, he ran into Bertha von Suttner, who foretold the turn of events:

When he went to the cinema in the small town of Tours, he was amazed to see that the hatred — displayed against Kaiser Wilhelm II — had already spread throughout France. However, he left despite everything, confident in Vienna, already considering what he intended to achieve in the coming months. Everyone collapses after the Sarajevo bombing.

=== The first hours of the war of 1914 ===
Notable episodes include the Austrian public&#x27;s reaction to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo in 1914, the departure from Austria by a train of the last Emperor Charles I of Austria in 1918, the beginning of the Salzburg festival and the Austrian hyperinflation of 1921–22.

According to Zweig, the summer of 1914 would have been unforgettable in its sweetness and beauty. The news of the death of Franz Ferdinand of Austria, although it hurt those who had just learned about it at the time, did not leave lasting traces. Franz Ferdinand was hardly appreciated, and Zweig himself found him cold, distant, unfriendly. The most controversial was his funeral: he had entered into a misalliance, and it was unacceptable that his wife and children could rest with the rest of the Hapsburgs.

The world never imagined that a war could break out. Zweig had visited a few days before declaring war with friends in Belgium. Even seeing the Belgian soldiers, Zweig was convinced that Belgium would not be attacked. Then ominous events multiplied until the outbreak of war with the declaration of war by Austria against Serbia.

The young soldiers went cheerfully to the front, to the crowd&#x27;s cheers. National solidarity and brotherhood were at their peak. Compared to the abatement of 1939, this enthusiasm for war is explained by an idealization of war, possible by its great temporal distance, the heightened optimism of the century, and the almost blind confidence in governments&#x27; honesty. This enthusiasm quickly turned into a deep hatred towards the enemies of the fatherland.

Zweig does not participate in this widespread hatred, as he knows the now rival nations too well to hate them overnight. Physically unfit to go to the front, he committed his forces to work as a librarian within the military archives. He sees his whole country sinking in the apology of the opposing camp&#x27;s deep and sincere hatred, like the poet Ernst Lissauer, author of the &quot;Song of hatred against England&quot;. Zweig, rejected by his friends who consider him almost a traitor to his nation, for his part, undertakes a personal war against this murderous passion.

=== The Struggle for Intellectual Brotherhood ===
Zweig makes it his mission, rather than only not taking part in this hatred, to actively fight against this propaganda, less to convince than to spread his message simply. He succeeded in having an article published in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; urging them to remain faithful to friendships beyond borders. Shortly after, he receives a letter from his friend Romain Rolland, and the two decide to promote reconciliation. They tried to organize a conference bringing together the great thinkers of all nations to encourage mutual understanding. They continued their commitment through their writings, comforting those in despair in this dark time.

Zweig then took the opportunity to observe the ravages of war with his own eyes on the Russian front. He sees the dramatic situation in which the soldiers find themselves; he considers the solidarity formed between the soldiers of the two camps who feel powerless in the face of the events they are going through. He is initially shocked to see that officers far from the front can walk almost carefree with young ladies several hours by train from the front. However, very quickly, he forgives them because the real culprits are those who, in his eyes, encourage the feeling of hatred towards the &quot;enemy.&quot;

He decides to fight this propaganda by writing a drama, emphasizing Biblical themes, particularly Jewish wanderings and trials, praising the losers&#x27; destiny. He produced this work to free himself from society&#x27;s censorship imposed on him.

=== In the heart of Europe ===
He expected poor reception when published his drama &quot;Jérémie&quot; in October 1917. However, to his surprise, his work was very well received, and he was offered to conduct its representation in Zurich. Therefore, he decides to leave for Switzerland, a rare neutral country in Europe&#x27;s heart. He met two Austrians in Salzburg on his journey to Switzerland who would play a significant role once Austria had surrendered: Heinrich Lammasch and Ignaz Seipel. These two pacifists had planned and convinced the Emperor of Austria to negotiate a separate peace if the Germans refused to make peace.

When Zweig crosses the border, he is immediately relieved, and he feels relieved of a burden, happy to enter a country at peace. Once in Switzerland, he is pleased to find his friend Rolland and other French acquaintances and feels fraternally united. During his stay, it was the figure of the director of the anti-militarist newspaper &quot;Demain,&quot; Henri Guilbeaux who marked him deeply because it was in him that he saw a historical law being verified: in intense periods, simple men could exceptionally become central figures of a current — here, that of the anti-militarists during the First World War. Moreover, he has the opportunity to see many refugees who could not choose their camps, such as James Joyce.

After the relative success of his play, he gradually realizes that Switzerland is not only a land of refuge but the theater of a game of espionage and counter-espionage. During his stay, the German and Austrian defeat becomes more and more inevitable, and the world begins to rejoice in the chorus of a finally better and more human world.

=== Homecoming to Austria ===
Once the German and Austrian defeat has been confirmed, Zweig decides to join his country in ruins, driven by a patriotic impulse: he gives himself the mission of helping his country accept its defeat. His return is the subject of a long preparation since winter is approaching, and the country is now in the greatest need. On his return, he attends the last Austrian Emperor&#x27;s departure in the station, a milestone for an Austrian for whom the Emperor was the central Austrian figure.

Then begins the bitter observation of a generalized regression of life; everything of value has been stolen, such as leather, copper, and nickel. The trains are in such bad condition that the journey times are considerably extended. Once at home in Salzburg, in residence he bought during the war, he must face everyday life made difficult by shortages and cold — when his roof is ripped through and repairs made impossible by the scarcity. He watches helplessly the devaluation of the Austrian crown and inflation, the loss of quality of all products, paradoxical situations, the invasion of foreigners who profit from the depreciation of the Austrian currency, etc.

Paradoxically, theaters, concerts, and operas are active, and artistic and cultural life is in full swing: Zweig explains this by the general feeling that this could be the last performance. Also, the young generation rebels against the old authority and rejects everything at once: homosexuality becomes a sign of protest, young writers think outside the box, and painters abandon classicism for cubism and surrealism. Meanwhile, Zweig set himself the task of reconciling the European nations by taking care of the German side. First alongside Henri Barbusse, then alone on his side, after the communist radicalization of Barbusse&#x27;s newspaper, Clarté.

=== Into the world again ===
After surviving the three years after the war in Salzburg, Austria, he decided to travel with his wife to Italy once the situation improved sufficiently. Full of apprehension about the reception we reserve for an Austrian, he is surprised by the Italians&#x27; hospitality and thoughtfulness, telling himself that the masses had not changed profoundly because of the propaganda. He met his poet friend Giuseppe Antonio Borgese and his painter friend Alberto Stringa. Zweig admits to being, at that moment, still lulled by the illusion that the war is over, although he has the opportunity to hear young Italians singing Giovinezza.

He then goes to Germany. He has time to see his friend Rathenau, who is now Minister of Foreign Affairs, for the last time. He admires this man who knows fully that only time can heal the wounds left by war. After the assassination of Rathenau, Germany sank into hyperinflation, debauchery, and disorder. According to Zweig, this sad episode was decisive for the rise of the Nazi Party.

Zweig has the chance to experience unexpected success and to be translated into several languages. He reads a lot and hardly appreciates redundancies, heavy styles, etc., preferences that are found in his style: he says he writes in a fluid manner, such as the words come to mind. Zweig says he has carried out important synthesis work — notably with Marie-Antoinette — and sees his capacity for conciseness as a defining element of his success. He knows the pleasure of seeing Maxim Gorky, whom he already admired at school, write the preface to one of his works.

While he recognizes that this success fills him with joy when he touches his works and works, he refuses to be the object of admiration for his appearance. He naively enjoys his fame at first on his travels, but it weighs on him. So he wishes he had started to write and publish under a pseudonym to enjoy his celebrity in all serenity.

=== Sunset ===
Zweig says that before Hitler came to power, people had never traveled so much in Europe. He continues to travel at this time, particularly about his career and fame as a writer. However, despite his success, Zweig says he remains humble and does not change his habits: he continues to stroll with his friends in the streets, and he does not disdain going to the provinces to stay in small hotels.

If there is one trip that taught him a lot, it is the one to Russia. Russia had always been on his list, but he still did his best to remain politically neutral. Finally, he has the opportunity to officially go to Russia in an unbiased way: on the birthday of Leo Tolstoy, a great Russian writer. At first, fascinated by the authenticity of the inhabitants, their friendliness, and their warm welcome, by the profound simplicity of Tolstoy&#x27;s tomb, he left with great caution. Following one of the parties, he realizes that someone has slipped him a letter in French, warning him of the propaganda of the Soviet regime. He begins to reflect on the intellectual stimulation that exile can promote.

Later, he had the opportunity to use his celebrity to ask a favor of Benito Mussolini, to spare the life of Giuseppe Germani. His wife had begged the writer to intervene, to put pressure on Mussolini by organizing an international protest. Instead, Zweig preferred to send a letter personally to Duce, and Mussolini granted his request.

Back in Salzburg, he was impressed by the cultural scope that the city had taken, which had become the artistic center of Europe. It thus has the opportunity to welcome the great names of literature and painting. Seeing these artists and writers allows him to complete his autographs and first drafts collection. Zweig looks back on this passion of which he boasts of his expertise and admits to seeking, above all, the secrets of the creation of masterpieces. However, unfortunately, with Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, his collection gradually fell apart.

Before these tragic events, Zweig reveals to have wondered about his success, a success he had not ardently desired. A thought crossed him at this time, after having acquired a secure, enviable and — he believed — lasting position:&quot; Wäre es nicht besser für mich — so träumte es in mir weiter — etwas anderes käme, etwas Neues, etwas das mich unruhiger, gespannter, das mich jünger machte, indem es mich herausforderte zu neuem und vielleicht noch gefährlicherem Kampf?&quot;— Zweig, Sonnenuntergang, (1942)&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be better for me — so that thought continued within me — if something else happened, something new, something that troubles me, torments me, rejuvenates me, demanding of me a new and perhaps more dangerous fight?&quot;His rash wish, resulting from a &quot;volatile thought&quot; — in his words — came true, shattering everything, him, and what he had accomplished.

=== Incipit Hitler ===
Zweig begins by stating a law: no witness to significant changes can recognize them at their beginnings. Even after his failed coup, Hitler was merely one agitator among many in this period shaken by coup attempts, and his name quickly faded into insignificance. However, organized gangs of young men in Nazi insignia were starting to cause trouble. It was unthinkable when Germany imagined that a man as uneducated as Hitler could come to power. However, he succeeded by promising everything to all parties; everyone thought they could use him.

Zweig admits that as a young man, he had not recognized the coming danger of the Nazis, who started organizing and agitating in Austria in the 1920s. Zweig was a committed pacifist but hated politics and shunned political engagement. He shows some reluctance to analyze Nazism as a political ideology; he regards it as the rule of one particularly evil man, Hitler. Nevertheless, Zweig was struck that the &quot;Berghof&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s mountain residence in Berchtesgaden, an area of early Nazi activity, was just across the valley from his own house outside Salzburg. Zweig believed strongly in Europeanism against nationalism.

Zweig had told his publisher that his books would be banned as soon as the Reichstag was burnt down — something he had not believed possible. He then describes the progressive censorship that descended on his opera &quot;Die schweigsame Frau,&quot; even as he witnessed the artistic power of his co-worker, the composer Richard Strauss. Due to Zweig&#x27;s politically neutral writings and Strauss&#x27; unrivaled fame in Germany, it was impossible to censor the opera. After reading Zweig&#x27;s libretto, Hitler himself exceptionally authorized the performance and attended it in person. However, after the Gestapo intercepted a letter from Strauss about his principles as President of the Reich Music Chamber, the opera was censored, and Strauss was forced to give up his position.

During these first troubles, Zweig went to France, then to England, where he undertook the biography of Marie Stuart, noting the need for an objective and accurate work. Once completed, he returned to Salzburg, where he realized the critical situation of his country: even with shootings breaking out daily in the streets, foreign newspapers were better informed than he was about the Austrian situation. He chooses to flee to London when the police forcibly search his residence, a previously unthinkable violation of civil liberties.

=== The agony of peace ===
Zweig sets the tone for the last chapter with a quote from Shakespeare:

Like Gorky, Zweig&#x27;s exile was not yet &quot;real&quot;: he still had his passport to return home at any time. After the Munich peace agreement, Zweig suspected that negotiation with Hitler was pointless, as he would break every commitment at the right time. However, Zweig remained silent, knowing he could not influence England, having failed even in his own country.

During his stay, he attended a memorable debate between HG Wells and Bernard Shaw, of whom he gives a long and admiring description. He also saw his friend Sigmund Freud, who had managed to reach England. Delighted to speak with Freud one last time, an admirable scholar devoted to the cause of truth, Zweig attended his funeral shortly after. As Zweig prepared for his new marriage, Hitler declared war on Poland, making him an &quot;enemy national,&quot; and the exile prepared his affairs to travel to an even further country.

At a PEN-Club conference, he stopped in Vigo, Spain, then in the hands of General Franco, noting again with bitterness the young people swaggering in fascist uniforms. However, after moving to Argentina and seeing the Hispanic heritage still intact, he regained hope. He praises Brazil, his last host country, a land of immigrants looking to the future, and says he sees Europe&#x27;s future.

He looks back to Austria&#x27;s annexation. His friends had firmly believed that the neighboring countries would never accept such an event, but Zweig had already, in autumn 1937, said goodbye to his mother and the rest of his family. He then watched as his family and nation were lost to Nazi barbarism.

Zweig then develops an extended meditation on the tribulations that pursue all the Jews, despite the great cultural and religious variety of those designated as such. He ends his work by admitting to being defeated by hatred, even by its shadow, but with this consolation:

== Intellectual life ==
&quot;The World of Yesterday&quot; details Zweig&#x27;s career before, during, and after World War I. Of particular interest are Zweig&#x27;s description of various intellectual personalities, including Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political Zionism, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren, the composer Ferruccio Busoni, the philosopher and antifascist Benedetto Croce, Maxim Gorky, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Franz Werfel, Gerhart Hauptmann, James Joyce, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bertha von Suttner, the German industrialist and politician Walther Rathenau and the pacifist and friend Romain Rolland.

Zweig also met Karl Haushofer during a trip to India. The two became friends. Haushofer was the founder of geopolitics and later became an influence on Adolf Hitler. Zweig was always aloof from politics and overlooked the dark potential of Haushofer&#x27;s thoughts; he was surprised when later told of links between Hitler and Haushofer.

Zweig particularly admired the poetry of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and expressed this admiration and Hofmannsthal&#x27;s influence on his generation in the chapter devoted to his school years:
Zweig also describes his passion for collecting manuscripts, primarily literary and musical.

Zweig collaborated in the early 1930s with composer Richard Strauss on the opera &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot;, which is based on a libretto by Zweig. Strauss was then admired by the Nazis, who were not happy that their favorite composer&#x27;s new opera had a Jewish author&#x27;s libretto. Zweig recounts that Strauss refused to withdraw the opera and even insisted that Zweig&#x27;s authorship of the libretto be credited; the first performance in Dresden was said to have been authorized by Hitler himself. Zweig thought it prudent not to be present. The run was interrupted after the second performance, as the Gestapo had intercepted a private letter from Strauss to Zweig. The elderly composer invited Zweig to write the libretto for another opera. According to Zweig, this led to Strauss&#x27;s resignation as president of the Reichsmusikkammer, the Nazi state institute for music.

The tragic effects of contemporary antisemitism are discussed, but Zweig does not analyze in detail his Jewish identity. Zweig&#x27;s friendship with Sigmund Freud is described towards the end, mainly while both lived in London during the last year of Freud&#x27;s life.

<doc id="592714" wikidata="Q1345234" url="?curid=592714" title="Comarcas of Spain">
<text>In Spain, a comarca () 
is either a traditional territorial division without any formal basis, or a group of municipalities, legally defined by an autonomous community for the purpose of providing common local government services. 
In English, a comarca is equivalent to a district, county, area or zone.

==Legally defined comarcas==
The large majority of legally defined comarcas are in Catalonia (42) and Aragon (33), and are regulated by law and are governed by a comarcal council with specified powers. There are seven comarcas formally registered in Basque Country and one, El Bierzo, in Castile and León. In Andalusia, Galicia, Valencia and Asturias, comarcas are defined by regional law but lack any defined function.

==Informal comarcas==
In other regions, comarcas are traditional or historical or in some cases, contemporary creations designed for tourism promotions. In some other cases (e.g. La Carballeda) a comarca may correspond to a natural area, like a valley, river basin and mountainous area, or even to historical regions overlapping different provinces and ancient kingdoms (e.g. Ilercavonia).

In such comarcas or natural regions municipalities have resorted to organizing themselves in (commonwealth), like the Taula del Sénia, the only legal formula that has allowed those comarcas to manage their public municipal resources meaningfully.

There is also a comarca, the Cerdanya that is divided between two states, the southwestern half being counted as a comarca of Spain, while the northeastern half is part of France.

==Relationship to other groups of municipalities==

There are also other groupings of municipalities in Spain including provinces, mancomunidades, metropolitan areas and the major islands of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. 

Legally defined comarcas have their boundaries and functions defined by the relevant regional government (autonomous community) and so do not necessarily have boundaries consistent with provinces which are defined by the State. The remit of comarcas is very similar to that of the provinces and has been criticised for duplication.
However in Catalonia, the comarca (and not the province) has been the traditional territorial organisation.

<text>Shacknews is an American video game journalism website founded in 1996. It that publishes news articles, reviews, and cheat codes.

==History==
&quot;Shacknews&quot; was founded in 1996 by Steve Gibson. The website, originally named &#x27;Quakeholio&#x27;, was dedicated to the then-upcoming ID Software game &quot;Quake&quot;. &quot;FileShack&quot;, a spinoff-site for game demos, patches, videos, and miscellaneous game-related assets for &quot;Shacknews&quot; users and others, was launched in August 2002.

On February 3, 2009, &quot;Shacknews&quot; and all related &quot;Shacknews&quot; destinations were purchased by GameFly. Asif Khan, a financial analyst, contributed to purchasing the site from Gamefly near the end of 2013 and became the site&#x27;s CEO. The sister site &quot;FileShack&quot; was shut down in 2014. 

== Reception ==
In August 2004, &quot;Maximum PC&quot; magazine featured &quot;Shacknews&quot; in its list of &quot;11 Websites That Every Geek Should Bookmark&quot;. Then, in November 2007, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; recognized &quot;Shacknews&quot; in its &quot;Top 100 Undiscovered Web Sites&quot; list. In 2018, &quot;Shacknews&quot; raised over $100,000 in the Extra Life 24-Hour Gaming Marathon for the Children&#x27;s Specialized Hospital Foundation. David L. Craddock, a long-form videogame journalism writer of &quot;Shacknews&quot; published several books on &quot;Diablo&quot;, &quot;Shovel Knight&quot;, &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; &quot;and Quake&quot; and credited Khan with publishing his findings.

<text>A tala (IAST &quot;tāla&quot;) literally means a &#x27;clap, tapping one&#x27;s hand on one&#x27;s arm, a musical measure&#x27;. It is the term used in Indian classical music similar to musical meter, that is any rhythmic beat or strike that measures musical time. The measure is typically established by hand clapping, waving, touching fingers on thigh or the other hand, verbally, striking of small cymbals, or a percussion instrument in the Indian subcontinental traditions. Along with &quot;raga&quot; which forms the fabric of a melodic structure, the &quot;tala&quot; forms the life cycle and thereby constitutes one of the two foundational elements of Indian music.

&quot;Tala&quot; is an ancient music concept traceable to Vedic era texts of Hinduism, such as the &quot;Samaveda&quot; and methods for singing the Vedic hymns. The music traditions of the North and South India, particularly the &quot;raga&quot; and &quot;tala&quot; systems, were not considered as distinct until about the 16th century. There on, during the tumultuous period of Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. The &quot;tala&quot; system of the north is called &quot;Hindustaani&quot;, while the south is called &quot;Carnaatic&quot;. However, the &quot;tala&quot; system between them continues to have more common features than differences.

&quot;Tala&quot; in the Indian tradition embraces the time dimension of music, the means by which musical rhythm and form were guided and expressed. While a &quot;tala&quot; carries the musical meter, it does not necessarily imply a regularly recurring pattern. In the major classical Indian music traditions, the beats are hierarchically arranged based on how the music piece is to be performed. The most widely used &quot;tala&quot; in the South Indian system is &quot;Adi tala&quot;. In the North Indian system, the most common &quot;tala&quot; is &quot;teental&quot;.

&quot;Tala&quot; has other contextual meanings in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism. For example, it means trochee in Sanskrit prosody.

==Etymology==
 () is a Sanskrit word, which means &#x27;being established&#x27;.

==Terminology and definitions==
According to David Nelson, an ethnomusicology scholar specializing in Carnatic music, a &quot;tala&quot; in Indian music covers &quot;the whole subject of musical meter&quot;. Indian music is composed and performed in a metrical framework, a structure of beats that is a &quot;tala&quot;. The &quot;tala&quot; forms the metrical structure that repeats, in a cyclical harmony, from the start to end of any particular song or dance segment, making it conceptually analogous to meters in Western music. However, &quot;talas&quot; have certain qualitative features that classical European musical meters do not. For example, some &quot;talas&quot; are much longer than any classical Western meter, such as a framework based on 29 beats whose cycle takes about 45 seconds to complete when performed. Another sophistication in &quot;talas&quot; is the lack of &quot;strong, weak&quot; beat composition typical of the traditional European meter. In classical Indian traditions, the &quot;tala&quot; is not restricted to permutations of strong and weak beats, but its flexibility permits the accent of a beat to be decided by the shape of musical phrase.
A &quot;tala&quot; measures musical time in Indian music. However, it does not imply a regular repeating accent pattern, instead its hierarchical arrangement depends on how the musical piece is supposed to be performed. A metric cycle of a &quot;tala&quot; contains a specific number of beats, which can be as short as 3 beats or as long as 128 beats. The pattern repeats, but the play of accent and empty beats are an integral part of Indian music architecture. Each &quot;tala&quot; has subunits. In other words, the larger cyclic &quot;tala&quot; pattern has embedded smaller cyclic patterns, and both of these rhythmic patterns provide the musician and the audience to experience the play of harmonious and discordant patterns at two planes. A musician can choose to intentionally challenge a pattern at the subunit level by contradicting the &quot;tala&quot;, explore the pattern in exciting ways, then bring the music and audience experience back to the fundamental pattern of cyclical beats.

The &quot;tala&quot; as the time cycle, and the &quot;raga&quot; as the melodic framework, are the two foundational elements of classical Indian music. The &quot;raga&quot; gives an artist the ingredients palette to build the melody from sounds, while the &quot;tala&quot; provides her with a creative framework for rhythmic improvisation using time.

The basic rhythmic phrase of a &quot;tala&quot; when rendered on a percussive instrument such as &quot;tabla&quot; is called a &quot;theka&quot;. The beats within each rhythmic cycle are called &quot;matras&quot;, and the first beat of any rhythmic cycle is called the &quot;sam&quot;. An empty beat is called &quot;khali&quot;. The subdivisions of a &quot;tala&quot; are called &quot;vibhagas&quot; or &quot;khands&quot;. In the two major systems of classical Indian music, the first count of any &quot;tala&quot; is called &quot;sam&quot;. The cyclic nature of a &quot;tala&quot; is a major feature of the Indian tradition, and this is termed as &quot;avartan&quot;. Both &quot;raga&quot; and &quot;tala&quot; are open frameworks for creativity and allow theoretically infinite number of possibilities, however, the tradition considers 108 &quot;talas&quot; as basic.

==History==
The roots of &quot;tala&quot; and music in ancient India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism. The earliest Indian thought combined three arts, instrumental music (&quot;vadya&quot;), vocal music (&quot;gita&quot;) and dance (&quot;nrtta&quot;). As these fields developed, &quot;sangita&quot; became a distinct genre of art, in a form equivalent to contemporary music. This likely occurred before the time of Yāska (~500 BCE), since he includes these terms in his nirukta studies, one of the six Vedanga of ancient Indian tradition. Some of the ancient texts of Hinduism such as the &quot;Samaveda&quot; (~1000 BCE) are structured entirely to melodic themes, it is sections of &quot;Rigveda&quot; set to music.

The &quot;Samaveda&quot; is organized into two formats. One part is based on the musical meter, another by the aim of the rituals. The text is written with embedded coding, where &quot;svaras&quot; (octave note) is either shown above or within the text, or the verse is written into &quot;parvans&quot; (knot or member). These markings identify which units are to be sung in a single breath, each unit based on multiples of one eighth. The hymns of &quot;Samaveda&quot; contain melodic content, form, rhythm and metric organization. This structure is, however, not unique or limited to &quot;Samaveda&quot;. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; embeds the musical meter too, without the kind of elaboration found in the &quot;Samaveda&quot;. For example, the Gayatri mantra contains three metric lines of exactly eight syllables, with an embedded ternary rhythm.

According to Lewis Rowell, a professor of music specializing in classical Indian music, the need and impulse to develop mathematically precise musical meters in the Vedic era may have been driven by the Indian use of oral tradition for transmitting vast amounts of Vedic literature. Deeply and systematically embedded structure and meters may have enabled the ancient Indians a means to detect and correct any errors of memory or oral transmission from one person or generation to the next. According to Michael Witzel,

The &quot;Samaveda&quot; also included a system of chironomy, or hand signals to set the recital speed. These were &quot;mudras&quot; (finger and palm postures) and &quot;jatis&quot; (finger counts of the beat), a system at the foundation of &quot;talas&quot;. The chants in the Vedic recital text, associated with rituals, are presented to be measured in &quot;matras&quot; and its multiples in the invariant ratio of 1:2:3. This system is also the basis of every &quot;tala&quot;.
In the ancient traditions of Hinduism, two musical genre appeared, namely &quot;Gandharva&quot; (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and &quot;Gana&quot; (informal, improvised, entertainment music). The &quot;Gandharva&quot; music also implied celestial, divine associations, while the &quot;Gana&quot; also implied singing. The Vedic Sanskrit musical tradition had spread widely in the Indian subcontinent, and according to Rowell, the ancient Tamil classics make it &quot;abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries&quot;.

The classic Sanskrit text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is at the foundation of the numerous classical music and dance of India. Before &quot;Natyashastra&quot; was finalized, the ancient Indian traditions had classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of). These four categories are accepted as given and are four separate chapters in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones). Of these, states Rowell, the idiophone in the form of &quot;small bronze cymbals&quot; were used for &quot;tala&quot;. Almost the entire chapter of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; on idiophones, by Bharata, is a theoretical treatise on the system of &quot;tala&quot;. Time keeping with idiophones was considered a separate function than that of percussion (membranophones), in the early Indian thought on music theory.

The early 13th century Sanskrit text &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; (literally &#x27;Ocean of Music and Dance&#x27;), by Śārṅgadeva patronized by King Sighana of the Yadava dynasty in Maharashtra, mentions and discusses &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot;. He identifies seven &quot;tala&quot; families, then subdivides them into rhythmic ratios, presenting a methodology for improvisation and composition that continues to inspire modern era Indian musicians. &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; is one of the most complete historic medieval era Hindu treatises on this subject that has survived into the modern era, that relates to the structure, technique and reasoning behind &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot;.

The centrality and significance of &quot;Tala&quot; to music in ancient and early medieval India is also expressed in numerous temple reliefs, in both Hinduism and Jainism, such as through the carving of musicians with cymbals at the fifth century Pavaya temple sculpture near Gwalior, and the Ellora Caves.

==Description==

In the South Indian system (Carnatic), a full &quot;tala&quot; is a group of seven &quot;suladi talas&quot;. These are cyclic (&quot;avartana&quot;), with three parts (&quot;anga&quot;) traditionally written down with &quot;laghu&quot;, &quot;drutam&quot; and &quot;anudrutam&quot; symbols. Each &quot;tala&quot; is divided in two ways to perfect the musical performance, one is called &quot;kala&quot; (kind) and the other &quot;gati&quot; (pulse).

Each repeated cycle of a &quot;tala&quot; is called an &quot;avartan&quot;. This is counted additively in sections (&quot;vibhag&quot; or &quot;anga&quot;) which roughly correspond to bars or measures but may not have the same number of beats (&quot;matra, akshara&quot;) and may be marked by accents or rests. So the Hindustani &quot;Jhoomra tal&quot; has 14 beats, counted 3+4+3+4, which differs from &quot;Dhamar tal&quot;, also of 14 beats but counted 5+2+3+4. The spacing of the &quot;vibhag&quot; accents makes them distinct, otherwise, again, since &quot;Rupak tal&quot; consists of 7 beats, two cycles of it of would be indistinguishable from one cycle of the related &quot;Dhamar tal&quot;. However the most common Hindustani &quot;tala&quot;, &quot;Teental&quot;, is a regularly-divisible cycle of four measures of four beats each.
The first beat of any &quot;tala&quot;, called &quot;sam&quot; (pronounced as the English word &#x27;sum&#x27; and meaning even or equal) is always the most important and heavily emphasised. It is the point of resolution in the rhythm where the percussionist&#x27;s and soloist&#x27;s phrases culminate: a soloist has to sound an important note of the raga there, and a North Indian classical dance composition must end there. However, melodies do not always begin on the first beat of the &quot;tala&quot; but may be offset, for example to suit the words of a composition so that the most accented word falls upon the &quot;sam&quot;. The term &quot;talli&quot;, literally &#x27;shift&#x27;, is used to describe this offset in Tamil. A composition may also start with an anacrusis on one of the last beats of the previous cycle of the &quot;tala&quot;, called &quot;ateeta eduppu&quot; in Tamil.

The &quot;tāla&quot; is indicated visually by using a series of rhythmic hand gestures called &quot;kriyas&quot; that correspond to the &quot;angas&quot; or &#x27;limbs&#x27;, or &quot;vibhag&quot; of the &quot;tāla&quot;. These movements define the &quot;tala&quot; in Carnatic music, and in the Hindustani tradition too, when learning and reciting the &quot;tala&quot;, the first beat of any &quot;vibhag&quot; is known as &quot;tali&quot; (&#x27;clap&#x27;) and is accompanied by a clap of the hands, while an &quot;empty&quot; (&quot;khali&quot;) vibhag is indicated with a sideways wave of the dominant clapping hand (usually the right) or the placing of the back of the hand upon the base hand&#x27;s palm instead. But northern definitions of &quot;tala&quot; rely far more upon specific drum-strokes, known as &quot;bols&quot;, each with its own name that can be vocalized as well as written. In one common notation the &quot;sam&quot; is denoted by an &#x27;X&#x27; and the &quot;khali&quot;, which is always the first beat of a particular &quot;vibhag&quot;, denoted by &#x27;0&#x27; (zero).

A tala does not have a fixed tempo (&quot;laya&quot;) and can be played at different speeds. In Hindustani classical music a typical recital of a raga falls into two or three parts categorized by the quickening tempo of the music; &quot;Vilambit&quot; (delayed, i.e., slow), &quot;Madhya&quot; (medium tempo) and &quot;Drut&quot; (fast). Carnatic music adds an extra slow and fast category, categorised by divisions of the pulse; &quot;Chauka&quot; (one stroke per beat), &quot;Vilamba&quot; (two strokes per beat), &quot;Madhyama&quot; (four strokes per beat), &quot;Drut&quot; (eight strokes per beat) and lastly &quot;Adi-drut&quot; (16 strokes per beat).

Indian classical music, both northern and southern, have theoretically developed since ancient times numerous &quot;tala&quot;, though in practice some &quot;talas&quot; are very common, and some are rare.

==In Carnatic music==

Carnatic music uses various classification systems of tālas such as the &quot;Chapu&quot; (four talas), &quot;Chanda&quot; (108 talas) and &quot;Melakarta&quot; (72 talas). The &quot;Suladi Sapta Tāla&quot; system (35 talas) is used here, according to which there are seven families of tāla. A tāla from this system cannot exist without reference to one of five &quot;jatis&quot;, differentiated by the length in beats of the &quot;laghu.&quot; Thus, with all the possible combinations of &quot;tala&quot; types and &quot;laghu&quot; lengths, there are 5 x 7 = 35 talas having lengths ranging from 3 (Tisra-jati Eka tala) to 29 (sankeerna jati dhruva tala) aksharas. The seven &quot;tala&quot; families and the number of &quot;aksharas&quot; for each of the 35 &quot;talas&quot; are;

In practice, only a few talas have compositions set to them. The most common &quot;tala&quot; is &quot;Chaturasra-nadai Chaturasra-jaati Triputa tala&quot;, also called &quot;Adi tala&quot; (&quot;Adi&quot; meaning primordial in Sanskrit). Nadai is a term which means subdivision of beats. Many kritis and around half of the varnams are set to this &quot;tala&quot;. Other common &quot;talas&quot; include:
* &quot;Chaturasra-nadai Chaturasra-jaati Rupaka tala&quot; (or simply &quot;Rupaka tala&quot;). A large body of krtis is set to this &quot;tala&quot;.
* &quot;Khanda Chapu&quot; (a 10-count) and &quot;Misra Chapu&quot; (a 14-count), both of which do not fit very well into the s&quot;uladi sapta tala&quot; scheme. Many padams are set to &quot;Misra Chapu&quot;, while there are also krtis set to both the above &quot;talas&quot;.
* &quot;Chatusra-nadai Khanda-jati Ata tala&quot; (or simply &quot;Ata tala&quot;). Around half of the varnams are set to this &quot;tala&quot;.
* &quot;Tisra-nadai Chatusra-jati Triputa tala&quot; (Adi Tala Tisra-Nadai). A few fast-paced kritis are set to this &quot;tala&quot;. As this tala is a twenty-four beat cycle, compositions in it can be and sometimes are sung in &quot;Rupaka talam&quot;.

===Strokes===
There are six main angas/strokes in talas;

*Anudhrutam, a single beat, notated &#x27;U&#x27;, a downward clap of the open hand with the palm facing down.
*Dhrutam, a pattern of two beats, notated &#x27;O&#x27;, a downward clap with the palm facing down followed by a second downward clap with the palm facing up.
*Laghu, a pattern with a variable number of beats, three, four, five, seven or nine, depending on the &quot;jati&quot;. It is notated &#x27;l&#x27; and consists of a downward clap with the palm facing down followed by counting from little finger to thumb and back, depending on the &quot;jati&quot;.
*Guru, a pattern represented by eight beats. It is notated &#x27;8&#x27; and consists of a downward clap with the palm facing down followed by circling movement of the right hand with closed fingers in the clockwise direction.
*Plutham, a pattern of twelve beats notated &#x27;3&#x27;, it consists of a downward clap with the palm facing down followed by counting from little finger to the middle finger, a krishya (waving the hand towards the left hand side four times) and a sarpini (waving the hand towards the right four times)
*Kakapadam, a pattern of sixteen beats notated &#x27;x&#x27;, it consists of a downward clap with the palm facing down followed by counting from little finger to the middle finger, a pathakam (waving the hand upwards four times),a krishya and a sarpini

===Jatis===
Each tala can incorporate one of the five following &quot;jatis.&quot;
Each tala family has a default &quot;jati &quot;associated with it; the tala name mentioned without qualification refers to the default &quot;jati&quot;.

*&quot;Dhruva tala&quot; is by default &quot;chaturasra jati&quot;
*&quot;Matya tala&quot; is &quot;chaturasra jati&quot;
*&quot;Rupaka tala&quot; is &quot;chaturasra jati&quot;
*&quot;Jhampa tala&quot; is &quot;misra jati&quot;
*&quot;Triputa tala&quot; is &quot;tisra jati&quot; (&quot;chaturasra jati&quot; type is also known as &quot;Adi tala&quot;)
*&quot;Ata tala&quot; is &quot;kanda jati&quot;
*&quot;Eka tala&quot; is &quot;chaturasra jati&quot;
*&quot;For all the 72 melakarta talas and the 108 talas the jathi is mostly chatusram&quot;

For example, one cycle of &quot;khanda-jati rupaka tala&quot; comprises a two-beat &quot;dhrutam&quot; followed by a five-beat &quot;laghu&quot;. The cycle is thus seven aksharas long. Chaturasra nadai khanda-jati Rupaka tala has seven aksharam, each of which is four &quot;matras&quot; long; each avartana of the tala is 4 x 7 = 28 matras long. For Misra nadai Khanda-jati Rupaka tala, it would be 7 x 7 = 49 matra.

===Gati (&quot;nadai&quot; in Tamil, &quot;nadaka&quot; in Telugu, &quot;nade&quot; in Kannada)===
The number of &quot;maatras&quot; in an &quot;akshara&quot; is called the &quot;nadai&quot;. This number can be three, four, five, seven or nine, and take the same name as the jatis. The default nadai is &quot;Chatusram&quot;:

Sometimes, pallavis are sung as part of a Ragam Thanam Pallavi exposition in some of the rarer, more complicated &quot;talas&quot;; such pallavis, if sung in a non-&quot;Chatusra-nadai tala&quot;, are called &quot;nadai&quot; pallavis. In addition, pallavis are often sung in chauka kale (slowing the tala cycle by a magnitude of four times), although this trend seems to be slowing.

===Kāla===
&quot;Kāla&quot; refers to the change of tempo during a rendition of song, typically doubling up the speed. &quot;Onnaam kaalam&quot; is first speed, &quot;Erandaam kaalam&quot; is second speed and so on. Erandaam kaalam fits in twice the number of aksharaas (notes) into the same beat, thus doubling the tempo. Sometimes, Kāla is also used similar to Layā, for example Madhyama Kālam or Chowka Kālam.

==In Hindustani music==
Talas have a vocalised and therefore recordable form wherein individual beats are expressed as phonetic representations of various strokes played upon the tabla. Various Gharanas (literally &#x27;Houses&#x27; which can be inferred to be &quot;styles&quot; – basically styles of the same art with cultivated traditional variances) also have their own preferences. For example, the Kirana Gharana uses Ektaal more frequently for Vilambit Khayal while the Jaipur Gharana uses Trital. Players from the Jaipur Gharana are also known to use Ada Trital, a variation of Trital for transitioning from Vilambit to Drut laya.

The &quot;khali&quot; vibhag has no beats on the bayan, i.e. no bass beats this can be seen as a way to enforce the balance between the usage of heavy (bass dominated) and light (treble) beats or more simply it can be thought of another mnemonic to keep track of the rhythmic cycle (in addition to Sam). The &quot;khali&quot; is played with a stressed syllable that can easily be picked out from the surrounding beats.

Some rare talas even contain a &quot;half-beat&quot;. For example, Dharami is an 11 1/2 beat cycle where the final &quot;Ka&quot; only occupies half the time of the other beats. This tala&#x27;s sixth beat does not have a played syllable – in western terms it is a rest. 

===Common Hindustani talas===
Some talas, for example Dhamaar, Ektaal, Jhoomra and Chautala, lend themselves better to slow and medium tempos. Others flourish at faster speeds, like Jhaptal or Rupak talas. Trital or Teental is one of the most popular, since it is as aesthetic at slower tempos as it is at faster speeds. As stated above, the division with the &quot;sam&quot; (first strong beat) is marked with X, the &quot;khali&quot; section is marked by 0, and the remaining sections, &quot;tali&quot; are marked with numbers starting at 2. Some sources give Rupak tala as starting with khali, the only tala to do so.

There are many talas in Hindustani music, some of the more popular ones are:
==72 melakarta talas and 108 anga talas==
===72 melakarta talas===
===7 Saptangachakram (7 angas)===
===Shodashangachakram (16 angas)===
Compositions are rare in the 108 lengthy anga talas. They are mostly used in performing the &quot;Pallavi&quot; of &quot;Ragam Thanam Pallavis&quot;. Some examples of anga talas are:

Sarabhanandana tala
Simhanandana tala : It is the longest tala.
Another type of tala is the &quot;chhanda tala&quot;. These are talas set to the lyrics of the&quot; Thirupugazh &quot;by the Tamil composer &quot;Arunagirinathar&quot;. He is said to have written 16,000 hymns each in a different &quot;chhanda&quot; &quot;tala&quot;. Of these, only 1500–2000 are available.

<text>The Adige (; ; ; ; ; ; , or ) is the second-longest river in Italy, after the Po. It rises near the Reschen Pass in the Vinschgau in the province of South Tyrol, near the Italian border with Austria and Switzerland, and flows through most of northeastern Italy to the Adriatic Sea.

The name of the river is of unknown origin. Nineteenth-century theories, such as a derivation from the Proto-Celtic &#x27;the water&#x27;, and alleged to be cognate with the River Tees in England (anciently &quot;Athesis&quot;, &quot;Teesa&quot;), have never been accepted by Celtic onomasts and are now completely obsolete.

== Description ==
The river source is near the Reschen Pass () close to the borders with Austria and Switzerland above the Inn Valley. It flows through the artificial alpine Lake Reschen. The lake is known for the church tower that marks the site of the former village of Alt Graun (&quot;Old Graun&quot;); it was evacuated and flooded in 1953 after the dam was finished. Near Glurns, the Rom River joins from the Swiss Val Müstair.

The Adige runs eastward through the Vinschgau to Merano, where it is met by the Passer river from the north. The section between Merano and Bolzano is called Etschtal, meaning Adige Valley. South of Bolzano, the river is joined by the Eisack and turns south through a valley which has always been one of the major routes through the Alps, connecting the Reschen and the Brenner passes, at considered the easiest of the main Alpine passes.

The &quot;Chiusa di Salorno&quot; narrows at Salorno and marks the southernmost part of the predominantly German-speaking province of South Tyrol. The Adige was mentioned in the &quot;Lied der Deutschen&quot; of 1841 as the southern border of the German language area. As of 2011 62% of Salorno speaks Italian and 37% speaks German. In 1922 Germany adopted the song as its national anthem, although by that time Italy had taken control of all of the Adige.

Near Trento, the Avisio, Noce, and Fersina rivers join. The Adige crosses Trentino and later Veneto, flowing past the town of Rovereto, the Lagarina Valley, the cities of Verona and Rovigo and the north-eastern part of the Po Plain into the Adriatic Sea. The Adige and the Po run parallel in the river delta without properly joining.

The Adige is connected to Lake Garda by the Mori–Torbole tunnel, an artificial underground canal built for flood prevention.

==Tributaries==
The following rivers are tributaries to the Adige River (from source to mouth):

== Ecology ==

=== Fauna ===

The Adige is a home to the marble trout (&quot;Salmo marmoratus&quot;), but at far lower populations than in the past. Fish stocking is one of the most significant causes of the sharp reduction in the original (indigenous) fish population of this subspecies. It will spawn with and interbreed with brown trout, which are regularly stocked in the river and its tributaries.

The band&#x27;s lineup consists of Spike Slawson, C. J. Ramone, Joey Cape, Pinch and John Reis. Dave Raun, Chris Shiflett, and Fat Mike are former members.

The Gimmes work exclusively as a cover band. They specialize in rapid-fire punk interpretations of a wide range of songs, often with a humorous edge.

The band is named after a children&#x27;s book of the same name by Gerald G. Jampolsky and Diane V. Cirincione.

==History==
The band&#x27;s first release came with 1995&#x27;s &quot;Denver&quot;, a 7&quot; single released on band member Fat Mike&#x27;s record label Fat Wreck Chords, featuring two John Denver covers. The band released four more singles in 1996 and 1997, each on a different label and named after the artist covered on that particular release, as well as some compilation appearances. Their first full-length album, &quot;Have a Ball&quot;, was released July 29, 1997, and is still their best-selling record.

Each album by the band has a different theme: &quot;Have a Ball&quot; focuses on classic 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s songs by singer/songwriters like Elton John, Neil Diamond, and John Denver; &quot;Are a Drag&quot; consists entirely of show tunes, &quot;Blow in the Wind&quot; of &#x27;60s classics, and &quot;Take a Break&quot; of contemporary R&amp;B songs (by artists such as Boyz II Men, Lionel Richie, and Vanessa L. Williams). Their fifth album, &quot;Ruin Jonny&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah&quot; (recorded live at a bar mitzvah), consists of pop music from the 1960s through the 1980s by artists such as REO Speedwagon, Styx and The Beatles, as well as traditional songs like &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;. The compilation album &quot;Have Another Ball&quot; features &#x27;60s–&#x27;80s classics.

The band entered the studio on April 3, 2006, to work on their sixth album, &quot;Love Their Country&quot;, which was released on October 17, 2006. The theme of this album is country and western, and includes covers of tracks by Dixie Chicks, Garth Brooks, Hank Williams, Sr. and Johnny Cash. Prior to the release of the album, Fat Wreck Chords released a digital label sampler, &quot;iFloyd&quot; which included &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot; by the band.

In late 2006, Fat Wreck Chords released another digital label sampler, &quot;Christmas Bonus&quot;, containing a previously unreleased cover of Steve Goodman&#x27;s &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;. In August 2006 Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were scheduled to play three dates at PNC Park after Pirates games, but after they got booed on the first night, the next two nights were cancelled. They were to play along with fireworks during the post-game &quot;Skyblast&quot; shows.

On December 5, 2007, Fat Wreck Chords released a flash MP3 holiday bonus sampler called &quot;Hanuk-Comp&quot; containing &quot;The Boxer&quot;, originally released on the 1997 &quot;Garf&quot; single. There is also a downloadable podcast that features commentary from Fat Mike and Floyd during breaks between songs in which the next album is revealed. The compilation &quot;Have Another Ball&quot; was released on July 8, 2008; it comprises all the B-sides from the &quot;Have a Ball&quot; singles, plus covers of &quot;Sodomy&quot; (from &quot;Hair&quot;) and Diana Ross&#x27;s &quot;Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To)&quot;.

Fat Wreck Chords released &quot;Go Down Under&quot; on February 1, 2011, featuring covers of five songs by Australian artists. On September 13, 2011 (in anticipation of a tour of Japan) Fat Wreck Chords released a five-song EP, &quot;Sing in Japanese&quot;.

In a Reddit AMA on January 28, 2014, Fat Mike revealed the next album theme would be &quot;Divas&quot;. Featuring covers of Barbra Streisand, Christina Aguilera and Lady Gaga, &quot;Are We Not Men? We Are Diva!&quot; was released on May 13, 2014, on Fat Wreck Chords.

On November 30, 2018, they released a cover of &quot;Santa Baby&quot;.

On June 7, 2019, Chris Shiflett took part in a Reddit AMA. When asked about The Gimmes he revealed he is &quot;No longer involved&quot;, although he did not specify exactly when he left the band. He noted that &quot;When the Gimmes decided to start releasing songs that I didn&#x27;t play on it was time for me to leave&quot;, adding in another comment that it was &quot;on bad terms&quot;.

In May 2021, the band announced a livestream event called &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;. The lineup for the show was Spike Slawson, Joey Cape, Scott Shiflett, CJ Ramone, and Pinch, with Fat Mike making a guest appearance.

In July 2023, the Gimmes &quot;gave away&quot; and performed at a quinceañera in Las Vegas. Few details have been shared but this is rumored to be for a new album, following up from their previous live album where they play a bar mitzvah. As of September 2023 it has been confirmed by Spike that this event was recorded by Fat Wreck Chords for an upcoming release, via an interview with him on 91X San Diego radio station. On April 9, 2024, the band confirmed the album will be released on June 14, 2024, and be called &quot;Me First and The Gimme Gimmes Blow it ... at Madison&#x27;s Quinceañera.&quot; It also released the first single from the album, a cover of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen.&quot;

==Costumes==
The Gimmes have a gimmick of wearing quirky matching costumes during their live shows. Some of the themes match the albums, such as when they dress in cowboy outfits to accompany the album &quot;Love Their Country&quot; or in drag as various characters from musicals in &quot;Are a Drag&quot;. They have also worn pajamas, red suits, cheerleader outfits, shiny suits and fezzes, and, during one show in Camden, NJ on the Warped Tour, dressed as the band AFI (who in turn dressed as The Gimmes). Their most common costume is a set of matching Hawaiian shirts of varying styles and colors.

<text>Artemios &quot;Demis&quot; Ventouris-Roussos ( ; , ; 15 June 1946 – 25 January 2015) was a Greek singer, songwriter and musician. As a band member, he is best remembered for his work in the progressive rock music act Aphrodite&#x27;s Child, but as a vocal soloist, his repertoire included hit songs like &quot;Goodbye, My Love, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;From Souvenirs to Souvenirs&quot; and &quot;Forever and Ever&quot;.

Roussos sold over 60 million albums worldwide and became &quot;an unlikely kaftan-wearing sex symbol&quot;.

==Early life==
Roussos was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt, in a Greek family.&lt;ref name=&quot;om on 6/15/47 in Alexandria, &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His father, George (Yorgos) Roussos, was a classical guitarist and an engineer, and his mother, Olga (1923–2019), participated with her husband in an amateur theatrical Greek group in Alexandria (there were three such groups in the Greek community); her family originally came from Greece. His maternal grandparents were from Chios and immigrated to
Alexandria after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. His paternal grandparents were from Chania. His grandfather moved to Egypt in the early 1900s along with his future wife who was underaged. He changed his surname from Ventouris to Roussos to hide from her family.

As a child, Roussos studied music and joined the Greek Church Byzantine choir in Alexandria. His formative years in the ancient port city&#x27;s cosmopolitan atmosphere were influenced by jazz, but also traditional Arabic and Greek Orthodox music. His parents lost their possessions during the Suez Crisis in 1956 and consequently decided to move to Greece.

==Musical career==
After settling in Greece, Roussos participated in a series of musical groups beginning with the Idols when he was 17, where he met Evángelos Papathanassíou (later known as Vangelis) and Loukas Sideras, his future bandmates in Aphrodite&#x27;s Child. After this, he joined the Athens-based band We Five, another cover band which had limited success in Greece.

Roussos&#x27;s operatic vocal style helped propel the band to international success, notably on their final album &quot;666&quot;, based on passages from the Book of Revelation, which became a progressive rock cult classic.

After Aphrodite&#x27;s Child disbanded, Roussos continued to record sporadically with his former bandmate Vangelis. In 1970, the two released the film score album &quot;Sex Power&quot; (the album has also been credited to Aphrodite&#x27;s Child), and later recorded the 1977 album &quot;Magic&quot; together. Their most successful collaboration was &quot;Race to the End&quot; (also sung in Spanish as &quot;Tu Libertad&quot;), a vocal adaptation of the musical theme from the Oscar-winning film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (scored by Vangelis). Roussos also guested on Vangelis&#x27; soundtrack to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), on the tracks &quot;Tales of the Future&quot;, &quot;Damask Rose&quot;, &quot;Taffey&#x27;s Snake Pit Bar&quot;, and &quot;On the Trail of Nexus 6&quot; (several only available in non-bootleg form on the 29th Anniversary Limited Edition CD set released in 2011).

==Solo career==
Roussos also began a solo career with the song &quot;We Shall Dance&quot; in 1971, which was a top ten hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Initially unsuccessful, he toured around Europe and became a leading artist. His solo career peaked in the mid 1970s with several hit albums. His single &quot;Forever and Ever&quot; topped the charts in several countries in 1973. It was No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1976. 

Other hits by Roussos included &quot;My Friend the Wind&quot;, &quot;My Reason&quot;, &quot;Velvet Mornings&quot;, &quot;Goodbye My Love, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Someday Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Lovely Lady of Arcadia&quot;. His first UK single to chart was in 1975: &quot;Happy to Be on an Island in the Sun&quot;, written by Northern Irishman David Lewis, with the record reaching No. 5 on the charts. His popularity in the rest of Europe, but not the UK, came to fascinate BBC TV producer John King who made a documentary titled &quot;The Roussos Phenomenon&quot; in 1976. Philips Records released a four-song record of the same name, which was the first extended play to top the UK singles chart. He was equally successful across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Japan.

In 1973, Roussos made one of his earliest television appearances on &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; and also appeared on Nana Mouskouri&#x27;s TV show in the UK. In 1978 he had his only disco hit titled &quot;L-O-V-E (Got A Hold Of Me)&quot;. In 1980, he had a hit with a cover of Air Supply&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, sung as a duet with Florence Warner.

Roussos&#x27; run of hits was maintained in the 1980s mainly in France with a number two &quot;Quand je t&#x27;aime&quot; in 1988 and &quot;On écrit sur les murs&quot; in 1989, along with golden records for the albums &quot;Le Grec&quot; and &quot;Voice and Vision&quot;. Also his &quot;Christmas Album&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; easily reached the gold status in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1989, he recorded the song &quot;Young Love&quot;, a duet with German singer and songwriter Drafi Deutscher, which was released as a single in Germany and reached No. 2 on the German music TV show &quot;ZDF-Hitparade&quot; in October that year. 

In 1982, Roussos released an album simply titled Demis, on which Jon Anderson of the band Yes collaborated, writing one song music and lyrics &quot;Lament&quot; and writing lyrics on two others, the first one &quot;Song For The Free&quot; and the other one &quot;Race to the end&quot; with music by Vangelis. This song is a cover of Vangelis&#x27; hit &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, on which Jon Anderson wrote the lyrics for Roussos.

The 1990s saw even more substantial releases by Roussos. In 1993, he released &quot;Insight&quot; (also called &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;) to general acclaim. After that he teamed up with BR Music in the Netherlands to produce &quot;Immortel&quot;, &quot;Serenade&quot; and &quot;In Holland&quot;.
Roussos continued to record and tour. In 2002 he toured England when a &quot;best of&quot; collection he made, &quot;Forever and Ever – Definitive Collection&quot;, reached no. 17 on the UK Albums Chart 

In more recent years he appeared in Russia and the United Arab Emirates. A committed follower of the Greek Orthodox faith, he sang as a guest in a number of churches in Greece and worldwide, including France.

In 2006, he released &quot;Demis Roussos – Live in Brasil&quot;, almost thirty years after &quot;Você Você e Nada Mais&quot;, a Portuguese hit in 1977. From 2006 to 2008, he was part of the &quot;Âge Tendre et Têtes de Bois&quot; tour, a series of concerts featuring French singers from the 1960s and 1970s.

Roussos staged a comeback in 2009, wherein he recorded his final studio album, &quot;Demis&quot;, produced by , released on 11 May. On this album Steve Howe&#x27;s son Virgil plays drums. 

Just one month before his death, Roussos selected the tracks for an official CD compilation of his life&#x27;s work, including notes by his two children Emily and Cyril. The CD, &quot;Demis Roussos Collected&quot;, was released in March 2015. It became a number one album in the Belgian album charts and reached number 61 in the Netherlands.

=== Michel Elefteriades ===
Demis Roussos collaborated with Michel Elefteriades on many songs which Elefteriades rearranged in an oriental fusion; the project was called Demis Roussos &amp; the Oriental Roots Orchestra. This project was first presented at the Mediterraneo Byblos Festival in  2001 and shortly after became an international success in the Arab world later being staged again in Egypt and Qatar. Elefteriades also composed, wrote and arranged the song &quot;The Beast&quot; for Roussos and directed the video for it.

==1985 TWA plane hijacking==
In June 1985, Roussos was among the passengers of TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome, which was hijacked, but he was released along with four other Greeks after five days while most of the other hostages remained there for 17 days. 

==Illness and death==

For years, Roussos struggled with his weight. In June 1980 he weighed . He then began a diet in which he lost in 10 months. In 1982 he co-authored the book &quot;A Question of Weight&quot; with his close friend, the photographer Veronique Skawinska, in which he dealt candidly with his struggles with obesity.

Roussos died in the morning of 25 January 2015, from stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer while hospitalised at Ygeia Hospital in Athens, Greece. His death was confirmed a day later by a friend, the journalist Nikos Aliagas, who tweeted the news on 26 January 2015 in both Greek and French. His death was also confirmed later on the same day by his daughter, who spoke to Greek and French media.

Fellow Greek singer Nana Mouskouri paid tribute to Roussos on the French radio station RTL, saying &quot;He had a superb voice, he travelled in the world ... he loved what he was doing... He was an artist, a friend. I hope he is in a better world.&quot;

Roussos&#x27; funeral was held at the First Cemetery of Athens, the burial place of many Greek politicians and cultural figures, on 30 January. The singer Mariza Koch said, &quot;His was a voice which awakened emotions in people and honoured Greece wherever it reached. We bid farewell to Demis.&quot; Composer Giorgos Hatzinasios commented, &quot;I can still hear his heartfelt laugh in my ears and I want to bid farewell to him with nostalgia and love.&quot;

==Personal life==
Roussos was married three or possibly four times. He had a daughter, Emily, with his first wife, Monique. With his second wife, Dominique, he had a son, Cyril. Both of Roussos&#x27; children are musicians. His third wife, the American model Pamela Smith, now Pamela Roussos-Rațiu (wife of the Romanian businessman Indrei Rațiu, married in 2004), was with him during the 1985 TWA plane hijacking incident. His fourth, and last, wife was a Parisian named Marie.

Roussos listed Mozart and Sting among his favourite composers.

== In popular culture ==
Roussos is the subject of an argument between two main characters in the TV adaptation of Mike Leigh&#x27;s 1977 play &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;. On the day of Roussos&#x27; death, actress Alison Steadman was interviewed by BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot; and discussed the significance of the music in the play.

On 15 June 2016, his children Emily and Cyril opened the Demis Roussos Museum in Nijkerk, Netherlands. After his death, the curator initiated the procedure to move the museum to Greece. 

The Bollywood song &quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot; from the film &quot;Sholay&quot; is based on Roussos &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;. In an interview, its director Ramesh Sippy related attending a Roussos concert in London. His wife asked him to incorporate this song into &quot;Sholay&quot;&#x27;s music track.

&quot;Forever and Ever&quot; appears in the soundtrack of the 2020 film &quot;Palm Springs&quot;.

== Awards and honours ==

<text>In geometry, a hypocycloid is a special plane curve generated by the trace of a fixed point on a small circle that rolls within a larger circle. As the radius of the larger circle is increased, the hypocycloid becomes more like the cycloid created by rolling a circle on a line.

==History==

The 2-cusped hypocycloid called Tusi couple was first described by the 13th-century Persian astronomer and mathematician Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in &quot;Tahrir al-Majisti (Commentary on the Almagest)&quot;. German painter and German Renaissance theorist Albrecht Dürer described epitrochoids in 1525, and later Roemer and Bernoulli concentrated on some specific hypocycloids, like the astroid, in 1674 and 1691, respectively.

==Properties==

If the rolling circle has radius , and the fixed circle has radius , then the 
parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:
formula_1
or:
formula_2

If is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not 
differentiable). Specially for the curve is a straight line and the circles are called Tusi couple. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was the first to describe these hypocycloids and their applications to high-speed printing.

If formula_3 is a rational number, say formula_4 expressed as irreducible fraction, then the curve has formula_5 cusps. 

If is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and fills the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius .

Each hypocycloid (for any value of ) is a brachistochrone for the gravitational potential inside a homogeneous sphere of radius .

The area enclosed by a hypocycloid is given by:

formula_6

The arc length of a hypocycloid is given by:

formula_7

==Examples==

The hypocycloid is a special kind of hypotrochoid, which is a particular kind of roulette.

A hypocycloid with three cusps is known as a deltoid.

A hypocycloid curve with four cusps is known as an astroid.

The hypocycloid with two &quot;cusps&quot; is a degenerate but still very interesting case, known as the Tusi couple.

==Relationship to group theory==

Any hypocycloid with an integral value of &quot;k&quot;, and thus &quot;k&quot; cusps, can move snugly inside another hypocycloid with &quot;k&quot;+1 cusps, such that the points of the smaller hypocycloid will always be in contact with the larger. This motion looks like &#x27;rolling&#x27;, though it is not technically rolling in the sense of classical mechanics, since it involves slipping.

Hypocycloid shapes can be related to special unitary groups, denoted SU(&quot;k&quot;), which consist of &quot;k&quot; × &quot;k&quot; unitary matrices with determinant 1. For example, the allowed values of the sum of diagonal entries for a matrix in SU(3), are precisely the points in the complex plane lying inside a hypocycloid of three cusps (a deltoid). Likewise, summing the diagonal entries of SU(4) matrices gives points inside an astroid, and so on.

Thanks to this result, one can use the fact that SU(&quot;k&quot;) fits inside SU(&quot;k+1&quot;) as a subgroup to prove that an epicycloid with &quot;k&quot; cusps moves snugly inside one with &quot;k&quot;+1 cusps.

==Derived curves==

The evolute of a hypocycloid is an enlarged version of the hypocycloid itself, while
the involute of a hypocycloid is a reduced copy of itself.

The pedal of a hypocycloid with pole at the center of the hypocycloid is a rose curve.

The isoptic of a hypocycloid is a hypocycloid.

==Hypocycloids in popular culture==

Curves similar to hypocycloids can be drawn with the Spirograph toy. Specifically, the Spirograph can draw hypotrochoids and epitrochoids.

The Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; logo, which is based on the Steelmark, includes three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). In his weekly NFL.com column &quot;Tuesday Morning Quarterback,&quot; Gregg Easterbrook often refers to the Steelers as the Hypocycloids. Chilean soccer team CD Huachipato based their crest on the Steelers&#x27; logo, and as such features hypocycloids.

The first Drew Carey season of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;&#x27;s set features astroids on the three main doors, giant price tag, and the turntable area. The astroids on the doors and turntable were removed when the show switched to high definition broadcasts starting in 2008, and only the giant price tag prop still features them today.

<text>Franco Dok Harris (March 7, 1950 – December 20, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a fullback for 13 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions and was selected by the Steelers in the first round of the 1972 NFL draft. Harris spent his first 12 seasons with Pittsburgh, earning nine Pro Bowl selections, and was a member of the Seattle Seahawks in his last.

A four-time Super Bowl winner with the Steelers, Harris was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of Super Bowl IX. He also scored the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; touchdown, one of professional football&#x27;s most famous plays, which gave the Steelers their first playoff win. Harris was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.

== Early life and education ==
Harris was born in Fort Dix, New Jersey. His father, Cad Harris, a Black soldier, served in World War II and was stationed in Italy during the war. His mother, Gina Parenti Harris, was a native Italian and became a &quot;war bride&quot;, who moved with her husband when he returned to the United States after the end of the war.

Harris graduated from Rancocas Valley Regional High School in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, in 1968. He then attended Penn State University, where he played on the Nittany Lions football team. Although he was primarily a blocker for the running back during his first year at Penn State, he amassed a career total of 2,002 yards rushing with 24 touchdowns and averaged over 5 yards per carry, while also catching 28 passes for 352 yards and another touchdown. He led the team in scoring in 1970.

Harris&#x27;s statistics during his final three seasons at Penn State are as follows:
* 1969: 115 carries for 643 yards and 10 touchdowns; 12 catches for 189 yards.
* 1970: 142 carries for 675 yards and 8 touchdowns; 6 catches for 66 yards.
* 1971: 123 carries for 684 yards and 6 touchdowns; 10 catches for 97 yards and 1 touchdown.

== Professional career ==

Harris was selected 13th overall in the first round of the 1972 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers despite assistant personnel director Bill Nunn and head coach Chuck Noll preferring Robert Newhouse. In his first season with the Steelers (1972), Harris was named the NFL Rookie of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. In that season he gained 1,055 yards on 188 carries, with a 5.6 yards per carry average. He also rushed for 10 touchdowns and caught one touchdown pass. He was popular with Pittsburgh&#x27;s large Italian-American population: his fans, including &quot;Brigadier General&quot; Frank Sinatra, dubbed themselves &quot;Franco&#x27;s Italian Army&quot; and wore army helmets with his number on them.

During his rookie season, Harris was a key player in one of professional football&#x27;s most famous plays, dubbed the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; by Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope. In the first round of the playoffs, the Oakland Raiders were leading the Steelers 7–6 with 22 seconds to play when a Terry Bradshaw pass was deflected away from intended receiver John &quot;Frenchy&quot; Fuqua as defender Jack Tatum arrived to tackle him. Harris snatched the ball just before it hit the ground and ran it into the endzone, resulting in the Steelers&#x27; first playoff win.

Harris was chosen for nine consecutive Pro Bowls (1972–1980), and was All-Pro in 1977. Harris rushed for more than 1,000 yards in eight seasons, breaking a record set by Jim Brown. The running back tandem of Harris and Rocky Bleier combined with a strong defense to win four Super Bowls following the 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979 seasons. On January 12, 1975, he was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl IX; in that game he rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries for a 16–6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Harris was the first African American as well as the first Italian-American to be named Super Bowl MVP. Harris was a major contributor for the Steelers in all of their first four Super Bowl wins. His Super Bowl career totals of 101 carries for 354 yards are records and his four career rushing touchdowns are tied for the second-most in Super Bowl history.

Harris claimed that he extended his career and thus his contribution to the team&#x27;s objectives (including four Super Bowl victories) by avoiding unnecessary contact.

With the retirement of O. J. Simpson after the 1979 season, Harris became the career rushing leader among active players. Following the 1983 season, Harris and Walter Payton were both closing in on Jim Brown&#x27;s NFL rushing record, and Harris asked the Rooney family for a pay raise. Believing that Harris was on the downside of his career, they refused and Harris threatened to hold out. The Steelers released him during training camp in 1984 and he then signed with the Seattle Seahawks during the 1984 season. He played just eight games with the team, gaining only 170 yards before retiring (192 yards short of Jim Brown&#x27;s record).

In his 13 professional seasons, Harris gained 12,120 yards (then 3rd all-time) on 2,949 carries, a 4.1 yards per carry average, and scored 91 rushing touchdowns (then also 3rd). He caught 307 passes for 2,287 yards, a 7.4 yards per reception average, and nine receiving touchdowns. Harris&#x27;s 12,120 career rushing yards rank him amongst the all-time leaders in the NFL, while his 91 career rushing touchdowns rank him 10th all time tied with Jerome Bettis.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
== Post-football ==
In 1990, Harris and his former Penn State teammate Lydell Mitchell founded Super Bakery (renamed RSuper Foods in 2006), which produces nutrition-oriented food for schoolchildren. Harris and Mitchell also partnered in 1996 to rescue the Parks Sausage Company in Baltimore, the first African-Americanowned business to go public in the U.S.

In 2007, Harris was chosen by Forest City Enterprises to lead a charitable foundation they created, related to the development of a casino for downtown Pittsburgh that would be managed by Harrah&#x27;s.

In August 2008, Harris attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention, in Denver, Colorado, as part of the Pennsylvania delegation. Harris voted for Barack Obama on December 15, 2008, as one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 21 Democratic presidential electors.

In January 2011, Harris became co-owner of the Pittsburgh Passion. Also in 2011, Harris briefly worked with The Meadows Racetrack and Casino, before the casino suspended the relationship after his comments in support of Joe Paterno, his coach while at Penn State, during the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.

In 2019, Harris starred in the NFL&#x27;s 100th Anniversary commercial recreating the Immaculate Reception with Terry Bradshaw.

== Personal life ==
Harris was married to Dana Dokmanovich. They had one son together: Franco &quot;Dok&quot; Harris, who ran as a third-party candidate in the 2009 Pittsburgh mayoral election and finished in second place with 25% of the vote. Franco&#x27;s brother, Pete Harris, played football for Penn State and died of a heart attack on August 15, 2006, at age 49.

Harris served as part of the advisory board of Penn State&#x27;s Center for Food Innovation, and in the fall of 2009 was named a Conti Professor by Penn State&#x27;s School of Hospitality Management. He was involved in, and provided funding to, Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, a group aimed at ousting the members of Penn State&#x27;s board of trustees.

==Death and tributes==

Harris died in his sleep at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, on December 20, 2022, at age 72, three days before the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot;. Harris&#x27;s death was considered sudden, as he had been active on social media just days before his death and had spoken to visitors at the Heinz History Center the day before his death including a live interview with KDKA-TV from the Heinz History Center. He was set to attend a ceremony at halftime during a Steelers game against the Las Vegas Raiders on December 24, 2022, to retire his jersey number. Hours before his death, Harris recorded an interview with Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward for his podcast in what would be his last public interview, during which he ironically commented about how he was &quot;feeling good&quot; and happy to have made it to the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot;. His cause of death was later ruled as natural causes.

Immediately after his death, many gave public tributes. Terry Bradshaw, who had found out about Harris&#x27;s death from his wife after seeing a text message from Mel Blount, had just seen Harris two weeks prior, filming material related to the Immaculate Reception&#x27;s anniversary and was in a &quot;state of shock&quot;. Bradshaw praised Harris, saying that &quot;as a teammate, he was just the best.&quot; Steelers president Art Rooney II, who like the rest of the Rooney family was close to Harris, said through a statement by the team that &quot;From his rookie season, which included the Immaculate Reception, through the next 50 years, Franco brought joy to people on and off the field. He never stopped giving back in so many ways. He touched so many, and he was loved by so many.&quot; In addition to Penn State itself, two Penn State alumni with connections to the Steelers—Harris&#x27;s former teammate Jack Ham and current Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth—also paid their respects to Harris. Other tributes would later come out by current and former Steelers as well as other Pittsburgh celebrities such as Joe Greene, Jerome Bettis, Najee Harris, Ben Roethlisberger, Hines Ward, Tony Dungy, T. J. Watt, Trai Essex, Arthur Moats, James Conner, current Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, Charlie Batch, Kurt Angle, Mark Madden, Tony Dorsett, Darrelle Revis, Billy Gardell, and Joe Manganiello; the Penguins and Pirates also paid tribute. The December 27, 2022, episode of &quot;Pittsburgh Dad&quot; covering the aforementioned Steelers-Raiders game (a 13-10 Steelers win) featured a tribute to Harris from the titular character. 
Shortly after Harris&#x27; death, there was a street named after him in Mount Holly, New Jersey where he went to high school (Rancocas Valley Regional High School). The former Ridgeway Street is now known as Franco Harris Way.

Despite only playing briefly with the Seahawks, the team also acknowledged Harris&#x27;s passing; other tributes from the NFL came from the Raiders, Baltimore Ravens, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Shannon Sharpe, Eric Dickerson, O. J. Simpson, Barry Sanders, Larry Csonka, Jack Youngblood, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Longtime ESPN personality Chris Berman paid tribute to Harris. Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama also paid tribute to Harris. U.S. Senator-elect John Fetterman released a statement mourning Harris, who supported his 2022 candidacy.

The Steelers held a public viewing for Harris at Acrisure Stadium on December 27, 2022, prior to the family holding a private funeral service.

==Honors==
In 1984, Harris received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1996, he served as an honorary co-captain for the Steelers at Super Bowl XXX and, on behalf of the then-current captains of the Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys called the ceremonial coin toss which was performed by Joe Montana. Harris would serve as an honorary co-captain again at Super Bowl XL a decade later. In 1999, he was ranked number 83 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2006, The Heinz History Center, home of the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, installed a life-size figure of Harris in the grand concourse of Pittsburgh International Airport, which recreates the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot;. He was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011. On December 24, 2022, the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot;, Harris became the third Steeler to have his number (32) retired; the first two were Ernie Stautner (70) and Joe Greene (75).

== In popular culture ==
In John Grisham&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Playing For Pizza&quot;, the fullback of the Parma Panthers is nicknamed Franco as a tribute to his hero, Franco Harris, to whom he refers as the &quot;greatest Italian football player&quot;. A fictional version of Harris is depicted in the season 3 premiere episode of &quot;This Is Us&quot;.

<text>Backdraft is a 1991 American action thriller film directed by Ron Howard and written by Gregory Widen. Starring Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick, and J. T. Walsh, it follows Chicago firefighters on the trail of a serial arsonist.

It was released on May 24, 1991 to mixed reviews, and grossed $152.4 million worldwide. It received three Academy Award nominations for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It also inspired a special effects attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, which opened in 1992 and closed in 2010. It was followed by the sequel, &quot;Backdraft 2&quot; in 2019, with Baldwin and Sutherland reprising their roles.

==Plot==
Two firefighters of Engine 17 of the Chicago Fire Department (CFD) are brothers: Lieutenant Stephen &quot;Bull&quot; McCaffrey, the elder, is experienced, while Brian has labored in his brother&#x27;s shadow. Brian returns to firefighting after several other careers falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is fit to be a firefighter. In 1971, Brian witnessed the death of their firefighting father, Captain Dennis McCaffrey, while accompanying him on a call. The longest-serving of all the men at Engine 17, John &quot;Axe&quot; Adcox, served under the McCaffreys&#x27; father and was like an uncle to the boys when their father died. Adcox grows concerned about Stephen&#x27;s unorthodox methods and disregard for safety procedures, as does Stephen&#x27;s wife Helen, who separated from Stephen to protect herself and their son Sean from the risks he was taking.

Inspector Donald &quot;Shadow&quot; Rimgale, a dedicated arson investigator and veteran firefighter, is called in because some recent explosive fires resemble those set by pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, who has been imprisoned for years. Brian transfers to become Rimgale&#x27;s assistant after an argument with Stephen. Rimgale manipulates Bartel&#x27;s obsession with fire to ensure his annual parole application is rejected. It is revealed during an investigation that Chicago City Council alderman Marty Swayzak has supported budget cuts to the CFD. Contractors have paid him off to shut down firehouses so they could be converted into community centers, with the contractors receiving contracts for the construction. Brian rekindles a relationship with Jennifer Vaitkus, an aide to Swayzak.

When Engine 17 answers a call in a high-rise, Stephen urges them to move in quickly, despite Adcox&#x27;s advice to wait for backup. Brian&#x27;s friend and fellow trainee, Tim Krizminski, opens a door, triggering a backdraft. His face is burned beyond recognition, and he barely survives. Adcox and Brian both condemn Stephen for what happened. Through experiments, Rimgale concludes that whoever&#x27;s causing the fires doesn&#x27;t want the fires to spread, hence the backdrafts. Rimgale and Brian go to Swayzak&#x27;s home to confront him after learning of his connection to the three backdraft victims (Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffery Holcomb) and interrupt a masked man about to set the residence on fire. The man attacks them with a flashlight but is burned on his shoulder by an electrical socket. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house but is injured in an explosion. In his hospital bed, Rimgale tells Brian to revisit Bartel, who helps Brian realize that only a firefighter would be so careful as to not let backdraft fires rage out of control.

Brian suspects Stephen but spots a burn in the shape of an electrical socket on Adcox&#x27;s back. He reveals his suspicions to Stephen just before an alarm. When Brian realizes Adcox has heard their exchange, he jumps aboard Truck 46 after borrowing some turnout gear. On their way to the fire, their truck crashes after dodging a taxi. Stephen confronts Adcox about the backdrafts during a multiple-alarm fire at a chemical plant. Adcox admits that he set the fires to kill Swayzak&#x27;s associates because Swayzak benefited from firefighters&#x27; deaths and closed down firehouses. When an explosion destroys the catwalk they are on, Stephen grabs Adcox&#x27;s hand while hanging on to the remains of the catwalk. Stephen refuses Adcox&#x27;s advice to let go of him and loses his grip on the catwalk. Stephen lands on the lower catwalk, but Adcox dies when he falls into the fire. Brian bravely battles the fire, allowing two firefighters to reach Stephen and carry him to safety. Stephen dies with Brian by his side on the way to the hospital, with his final request being that Brian not reveal Adcox to be the perpetrator.

After the funeral for Stephen and Adcox, Brian and Rimgale, with the help of the police, interrupt Swayzak at a press conference. Rimgale questions Swayzak on a fake manpower study that led to the deaths of several firemen, including Stephen and Adcox. They also state that Swayzak engineered the downsizing of the CFD, destroying Swayzak&#x27;s mayoral ambitions. Brian continues as a firefighter, carrying on his family&#x27;s firefighting tradition despite the loss of his father and brother.

==Cast==
==Production==
Before filming began, the main actors went out on calls with real Chicago firefighters, and also went to the Chicago Fire Academy to learn how to conduct themselves like the firefighters in the film.

Filming in Chicago began on July 23, 1990 and wrapped on December 8. Rubber cement from Petronio Shoe Products was used to create some of the fire effects. Industrial Light &amp; Magic created many of the visual effects.

===Casting===

Russell pursued Tom Cruise for the role of Brian McCaffrey, but Cruise declined. Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves also auditioned for the role.

===Realism===
Firefighting professionals have noted that most of the film&#x27;s structure fires scenes differ considerably from reality:

Fire investigation professionals have also dismissed the investigative methods shown in the movie as unscientific—in particular, the portrayal of fire as a living entity.

==Music==
&quot;Backdraft&quot; was scored by Hans Zimmer, and features two songs by Bruce Hornsby: &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; (which was previously released on his album &quot;Scenes from the Southside&quot;), and the new song &quot;Set Me in Motion&quot;. Zimmer&#x27;s score was pared to about 30 minutes for release on the soundtrack album, which also features both Hornsby songs. The soundtrack was issued by Milan Records on May 14, 1991. In 2024 Intrada Records released a 2-CD expansion featuring Zimmer&#x27;s full score and the 1991 album tracks in their original George Martin mixes.

==Release==
===Home media===
The film has been released in many formats, first on VHS, then DVD. In 2006, a two-disc DVD Anniversary Edition was issued.
On January 4, 2011 Universal Pictures released a Blu-ray &#x27;Anniversary Edition&#x27; with many of the features ported from the previous DVD release, including four featurettes, 43 minutes of deleted scenes, a three-minute Ron Howard introduction, and trailers. It was released for the first time as a two-disc Ultra HD Blu-ray package on May 4, 2019.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Backdraft&quot; grossed $77,868,585 in the US (ranking 14th in box-office for 1991), and $74,500,000 in other markets.

===Critical response===
&quot;Backdraft&quot; was praised for its special effects and performances, while much criticism was reserved for the story. It holds a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The consensus reads, &quot;It&#x27;s not particularly deep, but &quot;Backdraft&quot; is a strong action movie with exceptional special effects.&quot; Film critics Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film positive reviews.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
The film received three nominations at the 64th Academy Awards for Sound, Sound Effects Editing, and Visual Effects.

==Other media==
===Novelization===
A paperback novelization of the film, written by Kirk Mitchell, was published in 1991.

===Sequel===

In March 2018, it was announced that Universal had tapped Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego to direct the sequel with William Baldwin reprising his role. The film, titled &quot;Backdraft 2&quot;, was released direct-to-video on May 14, 2019.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; labeled the album &quot;alternative country,&quot; and deemed it &quot;tight and conservative.&quot; Writer Dean Budnick described the album as &quot;an agreeable representation&quot; of the band&#x27;s &quot;stylistic hodgepodge,&quot; and noted that, in some instances, it &quot;does indeed achieve the state referenced by its title.&quot;

<text>Nabih Mustafa Berri ( ; born 28 January 1938) is a Lebanese politician who has been serving as Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon since 1992. He heads the Amal Movement and its parliamentary wing, Development and Liberation Bloc.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Bo, Sierra Leone to Lebanese Shia parents on 28 January 1938. His father, Mustafa Berri, was a trader there.

Berri went to school in Tebnine and Ain Ebel in southern Lebanon, then continued his education in Bint Jbeil and Jaafariya supplementary schools in southern Lebanon and later studied at the Makassed and the Ecole de la Sagesse in Beirut. He graduated with a law degree from the Lebanese University in 1963, where he had served as the student body president, and became a lawyer at the Court of Appeals.

==Early career==
During 1963, Berri was elected as president of the National Union of Lebanese Students, and participated in student and political conferences. During his early career he became a lawyer at the Court of Appeals. In the early 1970s, he worked in Beirut as a lawyer for several companies.

=== Lebanese Civil War ===
In 1980, Berri was elected leader of the Amal Movement, and led the resistance against the Israeli army especially in the south of Lebanon and Beqaa and the most famous battle was the battle of Khalde in 1982.

Berri agreed to participate in the Salvation Committee, a body set up by President Elias Sarkis following the Israeli invasion. The committee included Bachir Gemayel, the Maronite commander of the Lebanese Forces. Husayn Al-Musawi considered Berri&#x27;s actions &quot;treasonous&quot; and Amal&#x27;s orientation too secular. In response, Musawi declared Berri a traitor, and broke from Amal to set up his own faction called the Islamic Amal. The movement&#x27;s ranks rapidly grew to around 1,000 militants.

Berri was the key player of the Intifada of 6 February 1984 with his ally Walid Jumblatt leader of the Progressive Socialist Party against the Lebanese sectarian government of Amin Gemayel, where officers and soldiers were called to defect from the Lebanese Army and made ground for the Taif agreement that ended the civil war.

In May 1984 Berri joined the National Unity government as minister of state for South Lebanon and reconstruction under Prime Minister Rashid Karami. He also served as the minister of housing and co-operatives.

==Political career==
Berri served as a cabinet minister from 1984 to 1992:
* 30 April 1984 to 22 September 1988: Minister of Justice in the government of Rashid Karami.
* 25 November 1989 to 24 December 1990: Minister of Hydraulic &amp; Electric Resources in the government of Selim Hoss.
* 25 November 1989 to 24 December 1990: Minister of Housing &amp; Cooperatives in the government of Selim Hoss.
* 16 May 1992 to 31 October 1992: Minister of state in the government of Rachid Solh.

Due to strong Syrian backing and to Berri&#x27;s proximity to Syrian officials in Lebanon, he was reported to have the biggest influence in the Lebanese government formed after the Taif Accord.

Berri headed the list of &quot;Liberation&quot; in the parliamentary elections that took place in southern Lebanon on 6 September 1992, which was won in full. The other lists he headed were &quot;Liberation and Development&quot; in the parliamentary elections on 8 September 1996, which was won in full. Since 1992 he has chaired the Liberation and Development parliamentary bloc.

Berri headed the list of &quot;Resistance and Development&quot; in the parliamentary elections that took place in southern Lebanon on 3 September 2000, which was won in full. He also headed the list of Liberation and Development in the parliamentary elections which took place in June 2005, which was won in full. Currently, Berri heads the list of &quot;Liberation and Development&quot; in the parliamentary elections on 7 June 2009. All the members of the Bloc won the elections in 2009.

=== Speaker ===
He was elected Speaker of the parliament of Lebanon for the first time on 20 October 1992 (105 out of 124 votes). He was re-elected for a second time on 22 October 1996 (122 out of 126 votes). He was elected to the same post on 17 October 2000 unanimously (124 out of 126 votes), on 28 June 2005 (90 out of 126 votes), on 25 June 2009 (90 out of 127 votes), and on 23 May 2018 (98 out of 128 votes). This makes him the longest-serving head of a legislative assembly in the world.
Since 1999, he has chaired the Arab Parliament Committee in charge of disclosing Israeli crimes against Arab civilians. On 3 June 2003, he was elected president of the Arab Parliament and handed the presidency in Damascus on 1 March 2004 for a period of two years. He was elected president of the Council of the Parliamentary Union of the Member States.

On 9 March 2004, Nabih Berri was elected President of the Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States in Dakar-Senegal until 9 March 2006.

Nabih Berri was always and is still a major supporter of the dialogue between all Lebanese parties, religions and sects. During the last national dialogue session in May 2014, Speaker Nabih Berri stressed that &quot;power-sharing between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon would not change under any circumstance,&quot; adding that he spoke on behalf of the Shia, Sunnis and the Druze. In 2013 and 2014 he supported the UCC, the teachers, public employees, and the armed forces in Lebanon, in their fight to increase their salaries, and has held many meeting with political leaders in an effort to attain his goal.

Since 1993, Berri has chaired the Union of Parliamentarians of Lebanese Descent, including 156 members of parliament and senators from 19 countries.

==Personal life==
Berri has married twice and he has six children with Lila, his first wife, and four with his second wife, Randa Assi Berri.

<doc id="592776" wikidata="Q213851" url="?curid=592776" title="Christian Günther von Bernstorff">
<text>Count Christian Günther von Bernstorff (; 3 April 1769 – 18 March 1835) was a Danish and Prussian statesman and diplomat.

==Early life and career==
Bernstorff was born in Copenhagen on 3 April 1769 to Count Andreas Peter von Bernstorff. He was educated for the diplomatic service under his father&#x27;s direction. He began his career in 1787, as attaché to the representative of Denmark at the opening of the Diet of Sweden.

In 1789, he went as secretary of legation to Berlin, where his maternal uncle, Count Leopold Friedrich zu Stolberg, was Danish ambassador. His uncle&#x27;s influence, as well as his own social qualities, obtained him rapid promotion; he was soon chargé d&#x27;affaires, and in 1791 minister plenipotentiary. In 1794, he exchanged this post for the important one of ambassador at Stockholm, where he remained until May 1797, when he was summoned to Copenhagen to act as substitute for his father during his illness. On the death of the latter (21 June), he succeeded him as secretary of state for foreign affairs and privy councillor.

In 1800, he became head of the ministry. He remained responsible for the foreign policy of Denmark until May 1810, a fateful period which saw the battle of Copenhagen (2 April 1801), the bombardment of Copenhagen, and the capture of the Danish fleet in 1807.

After his retirement, he remained without office until his appointment in 1811 as Danish ambassador at Vienna. He remained here, despite Denmark being nominally at war with Austria, until, in January 1814, on the accession of Denmark to the coalition against Napoleon, he publicly resumed his functions as ambassador. He accompanied the emperor Francis to Paris, and was present at the signature of the first peace of Paris.

With his brother Joachim, he represented Denmark at the Congress of Vienna and, as a member for the commission for the regulation of the affairs of the German confederation, was responsible for some of that confusion of Danish and German interests which was to bear bitter fruit later in the Schleswig-Holstein question. He again accompanied the allied sovereigns to Paris in 1815, returning to Copenhagen the same year. In 1817, he was appointed Danish ambassador at Berlin, his brother Joachim going at the same time to Vienna.

==Prussian service==
In the following year, Prince Hardenberg made him the formal proposition that he should transfer his services to Prussia, which, with the leave of his sovereign, he did.

It was, therefore, as a Prussian diplomat that Bernstorff attended the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (October 1818), at the close of which he returned to Berlin as minister of state and head of the department for foreign affairs. Bernstorff&#x27;s management of Prussian policy throughout the many years that he remained in office has been variously judged. He was by training and temperament against the Revolution, and he was initiated into his new duties as a Prussian minister by the reactionary Ancillon. He is accused of having subordinated the particular interests of Prussia to the European policy of Metternich and the Holy Alliance. Whether any other policy would in the long run have served Prussia better is a matter for speculation. It is true that Bernstorff backed the Carlsbad Decrees, and the Vienna Final Act; he was also the faithful henchman of Metternich at the congresses of Laibach, Troppau and Verona. On the other hand, he took a considerable share in laying the groundwork of the customs union (Zollverein), which was destined to be the foundation of the Prussian hegemony in Germany. In his support of Russia&#x27;s action against Turkey in 1828 also he showed that he was no blind follower of Metternich&#x27;s views. In the crisis of 1830 his moderation in face of the warlike clamour of the military party at Berlin did much to prevent the troubles in Belgium and Poland from ending in a universal European conflagration.

From 1824 onward, Bernstorff had been a constant sufferer from hereditary gout, intensified and complicated by the results of overwork. In the spring of 1832, the state of his health compelled him to resign the ministry of foreign affairs to Ancillon, who had already acted as his deputy for a year. He died in 1835.

Adam Zamoyski however claims Bernstorff was in fact dismissed from office in 1832 due to an intrigue organized by Metternich in which a letter from emperor Francis I to king Frederick William III with the seal broken was planted in Bernstorff&#x27;s office and then &quot;discovered&quot;.

<text>Rosario () is the largest city in the central Argentine province of Santa Fe. The city, located northwest of Buenos Aires on the west bank of the Paraná River, is the third-most populous city in the country after Buenos Aires and Cordoba. With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 . One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco architecture that has been preserved in hundreds of residences, houses and public buildings. The city is also famous for being the birthplace of the award-winning Argentine footballer Lionel Messi.

Rosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a port. The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically. Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in 2004, spans the Paraná River, connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria, across the Paraná Delta. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.

Along with Paraná, Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city&#x27;s patron is the &quot;Virgin of the Rosary&quot;, whose feast day is 7 October.

==History==
===Early settlement===

Even though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants. Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a &quot;city&quot; on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as &quot;Pago de los Arroyos&quot; (&quot;land of the streams&quot;), a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the Ludueña Stream, the Saladillo Stream and others, emptying into the Paraná River. In 1689, captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in &quot;reducciones&quot;, a type of mission founded by Franciscans. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region.

Romero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement, an &quot;estancia&quot; — intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the Jesuits bought another part and established &quot;Estancia San Miguel&quot;. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital (Santa Fe), and in turn from Buenos Aires.

In 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today&#x27;s Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.

On February 27, 1812, General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paraná, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the &quot;Cradle of the Argentine Flag&quot;. The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion.

===19th century===

The province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of &quot;village&quot; (&quot;Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario&quot;). Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as &quot;a large town&quot; with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the &quot;caudillo&quot; and Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, banned navigation of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade.

On 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival &quot;caudillo&quot; Justo José de Urquiza. As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros, triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.

Urquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city&#x27;s economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to immigration. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were European immigrants, who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city (contrasting with the more conservative, aristocratic Santa Fe).

During the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. Ovidio Lagos, founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, &quot;La Capital&quot;, was one of the strongest proponents of this idea (one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by Bartolomé Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). In 1911, the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano, Argentina&#x27;s main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.

===Modern history===
In 1969 workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the &quot;Rosariazo&quot; against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens &quot;disappear&quot; in what is known as the Dirty War.

In 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes. Under the Menem administration, the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, unemployment in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario&#x27;s population fell below the poverty line.

Since the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse, Rosario&#x27;s economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment. The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman Héctor Cavallero&#x27;s 1989 election. Cavallero&#x27;s successor, Hermes Binner (elected in 1995), was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket. Mayor Miguel Lifschitz&#x27;s administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget). Mayor Mónica Fein became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.

After the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called &quot;Los Monos&quot; (&quot;The Monkeys&quot;). Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs (&quot;Los Funes&quot; and &quot;Los Camino&quot;) was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.


==Government==

Rosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor (seat: Palacio de los Leones), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: Palacio Vassallo). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.

===Municipal Centre District (CMD)===
Since 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).

The city is divided into six large administrative districts (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.

For years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario, to decentralize the national government.

Since the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga, Héctor Cavallero (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), Hermes Binner (re-elected once), Miguel Lifschitz (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, Mónica Fein. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party, since December 2019, Rosario&#x27;s mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.

The city does not have a police force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called &quot;Guardia Urbana Municipal&quot; (&quot;Municipal Urban Guard&quot;), which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities.
===Municipal statistics===
The municipality of Rosario comprises , of which are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, , 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant.

Electric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.

With the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003–2006, the construction sector added 2 million m2, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.

According to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.

===Health===
Rosario has several public health centers: five municipal hospitals (including a children&#x27;s hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center) and a municipal outpatient-only center, plus two large provincial hospitals (Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario), and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area.

==Economy==

Rosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires. The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.

Other important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the meat industry; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry.
Worldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, General Motors, Cargill, Unilever, John Deere, Petrobrás, ICI, Dow, Tenneco and Mahle.

The main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on San Martín St., and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations, especially through micro credits, and may be considered an &quot;ethical bank.&quot;
The Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paraná River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of &quot;centers of usury&quot; that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an &quot;Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;&quot; the bank opened exactly one year later.

The seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank, and transformed into a joint stock company, with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization.

The Rosario Board of Trade mainly deals in cereals and oilseeds. The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario, with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe.

The largest technological center in Argentina – Polo Tecnológico Rosario (PTR) – is located in Rosario within La Siberia site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.

==Culture==
Rosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city&#x27;s important theaters are El Círculo, Sala Lavardén, Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as Puerto de la Música, designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasília fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.

The city has several museums, including Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum, Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, City Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario (MACRo). The Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in Urquiza Park, which consists of an observatory (inaugurated in 1970) and a planetarium (1984).

The Fundación Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a &quot;cultural bond with Italy&quot;. It has organized a Neapolitan music concert, performances of &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay, renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar, journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge Asís, filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile (Ricardo Lagos), Argentina (Eduardo Duhalde), and Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera).

====National Flag Memorial====

The National Flag Memorial in Rosario is a monumental complex built near the banks of the Paraná River. It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 – the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano, creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.

The complex has a total area of about and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects Ángel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo, and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora, Eduardo Barnes, Alfredo Bigatti, and José Fioravanti.

The Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano&#x27;s crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio Cívico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).

The complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento (&quot;Oath Passage&quot;), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.

The Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system.
 El Puerto de la Música will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paraná River.

Architect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience. The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina. The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario&#x27;s skyline. Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.

====Planetarium====
Located in Urquiza Park, Rosario&#x27;s Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.

The planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.

The assembly is installed in the Room &quot;Oscar Claudio Caprile&quot;, located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.

For its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.

The building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the &quot;Prof. Victor Capolongo&quot; observatory and the experimental science museum.

=====The observatory=====
Municipal Astronomical Observatory &quot;Prof. Victor Capolongo&quot; was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.

The Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.

To that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coudé refractor has a aperture and focal distance provided with Lyot&#x27;s monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.

There are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario&#x27;s sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.

The asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city&#x27;s honor as a result.

=====Experimental Science Museum=====
This museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.

Thus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.

To complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the Space Age, energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.

The museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called &quot;CIENCIANIÑO&quot; (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.

====Statue of Che Guevara====
The 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth. It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide and weighs 2.7 tons. The statue was made by artist Andrés Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina.

==Demographics==
===Demographic distribution===


Rosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina&#x27;s third most populated urban settlement, after Córdoba. Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez, with a population of about 75,000, about from Rosario city center.

To the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Roldán, Pérez, Soldini); Roldán is from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario.

The farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capitán Bermúdez, Fray Luis Beltrán, San Lorenzo (already in a different &quot;departamento&quot;, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Martín, the last being at a distance of from Rosario.

The north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called &quot;Cordón Industrial&quot; (&quot;Industrial Corridor&quot;), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city&#x27;s western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the poverty line; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).

In 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of Liguria.

As of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts, making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off. The population density in Rosario proper was ; but, only about in the suburbs.

The 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).

The ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city&#x27;s population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people. The main contributors were Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro), Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.

Most immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Rosario. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially agricultural colonies) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.

Christianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced, followed by Protestantism. Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina. There is also a local Islamic society.

===Districts===
Rosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called &quot;Centre District&quot; for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called &quot;Centro&quot; (City Centre). The data given below are from the .

; Centre District

==Urban structure==
===Centre District===

At Rosario city center, Córdoba Street is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along Córdoba Ave to the west &quot;Paseo del Siglo&quot; (&quot;Walk of the Century&quot;) was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the &quot;San Martín Square&quot;, and elsewhere, &quot;Plaza Montenegro&quot; (on &quot;Peatonal San Martín&quot;, the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Martín Street) and &quot;Plaza Sarmiento&quot;.

Oroño Boulevard (going north–south) and Pellegrini Avenue (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia, that houses the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, the Newell&#x27;s Old Boys football club, and the sports clubs &quot;Provincial&quot; and &quot;Gimnasia y Esgrima&quot;, as well as the horse racetrack and the former &quot;Sociedad Rural&quot; (Rural Society).

Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.
To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main &quot;barrios&quot; in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream.

Among the districts in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy and Fisherton. To the north-east there lie Pichincha, Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of Rosario Central&#x27;s stadium) and Empalme Graneros.
Next to the stadium, there is the Parque Alem, and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant. To the north lie the districts of Alberdi, La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.

An important part of Rosario&#x27;s urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; Argentine flag Memorial, Parque de España, Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales.

===Greater Rosario===
Through the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream (the natural border with Villa Gobernador Gálvez). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.

Among the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy, and Fisherton (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario).
To the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha (a red-light district in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: &quot;Mercado de antigüedades &quot;Feria Retro La Huella&quot;&quot;), Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of the Rosario Central football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludueña Stream, now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.

Next to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, Parque Alem, and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are Alberdi (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), and Rucci.

The main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of Granadero Baigorria). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.

== Transportation ==
Rosario&#x27;s strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur, the Common Market for the South.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

=== Road transport ===

The Rosario public transport system includes buses, trolleybuses and taxicabs.

The Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation, SEMTUR (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, &quot;Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport&quot;), as are some of Rosario&#x27;s other urban bus lines.

Plaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.

Bus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.

The urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month, by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).

A significant number of buses run on natural gas, as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel.

In 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area. Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.

Rosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.

Rosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal, (&quot;Terminal de Omnibus&quot;), across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin.
The transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguazú, Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunción, Paraguay, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences.

=== Railway ===


Rosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the presidency of Juan Perón, most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.

After the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem&#x27;s presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) handle most of the cargo. Additionally, two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe. The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to Córdoba and Tucumán.

Nowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos, running trains to Rosario Norte with stop in Rosario Sur.

The other station in the main district, Rosario Oeste, used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for freight trains only.

As of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:

Notes:
==== Projects ====

There was a project to build a high-speed train between Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba, scheduled to be started in 2008, with an inauguration in 2012, that would join Rosario and Buenos Aires in 85 minutes, and would reach Córdoba in another 90 minutes at speeds of up to . However it never was constructed and the project was finally suspended after the controversy it generated among the citizens and the media critics because of the high costs it implicated.

==== Trams ====
The city once had a large tramway network with 192 km of track in the centre of the city, however this was abandoned in 1963 after fierce competition from bus transport in the city. The city now has two heritage tramways, one of which uses vintage trams converted to run on rubber tyres, while the other uses the original trams from the city refurbished to run on rails.

More recently, a metro system was proposed for the city, though this was shelved in favour of a new urban tramway network. The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction. It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city.

=== Roadways ===
Rosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), National Route 9 (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through National Route 7 to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre Ríos, over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge).

It is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalación Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city.

The beltway is and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time.
In its length, it intersects with National Route 9, National Route 3, National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.
The official numbering system denotes this road as &quot;A008&quot; but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called &quot;&quot;Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo&quot; (&quot;25 of May Beltway Avenue&quot;&quot;) commemorating the May Revolution of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:

* The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called &quot;National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos Sánchez&quot; by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.
* The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe (the state capital) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called &quot;National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti&quot; by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.
The A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for .

This road is popularly known as the &quot;Second Rosario Beltway&quot;, as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario.
Through National Decree 1595 of 1979 this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.

=== Airports ===

The Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport is located west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.

The airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol Líneas Aéreas and is also served by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Copa and Gol Transportes Aéreos. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata (via Buenos Aires), Mendoza (vía Córdoba), Santa Fe and Villa Gesell (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring).
The airport is at an altitude of . Its longest runway measures .

===Port===

The Port of Rosario is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe, on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paraná River, about upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.

At this point of the course of the Paraná River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of with minor periodic dredging. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards. The Paraná is about wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes wide downstream.

The port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paraná; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Martín (. It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and the Cuyo region; going north–south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paraná waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to .

Cargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino, communicating with Córdoba (west) and Zárate, Buenos Aires (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, that joins the city with the province of Entre Ríos. The Rosario International Airport (located west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.

==Education==

Rosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the National University of Rosario (UNR) since 1968, which includes the Law Faculty, the Medicine Faculty, the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called &quot;Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario&quot; (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.

In the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.

Currently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.

Rosario has private colleges, as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), the Austral University, the University of the Latin American Educational Center (UCEL), the Interamerican Open University (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.

==Language==
Rosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect, notably the voseo (use of &quot;vos&quot; instead of &quot;tú&quot; as pronoun for the second person singular) and the &quot;sheísmo&quot; (form of yeísmo where &quot;ll-&quot; and &quot;y-&quot; are pronounced as a voiceless ). Although the &quot;español rosarino&quot; does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.

One of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario&#x27;s area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the &quot;-s&quot;. When the &quot;-s&quot; is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word &quot;obispo&quot; is pronounced o̞ˈβihpo̞). In the popular and vulgar language, the final &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, or &quot;-d&quot; are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.

Just as in Buenos Aires, the &quot;voseo&quot; is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun &quot;tú&quot; and its associated verbal forms are non-existent (which is not the case in the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final &quot;-s&quot; to the verbal forms of the second person plural (&quot;vos fuistes&quot;, &quot;vos vinistes&quot;), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.

Even though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the &quot;rosarino&quot; speech, both formal and informal.

The &quot;Rosarigasino&quot; is a type of Jerigonza (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of cult among certain local groups.

==Sports==

Rosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central (founded 1889) and Newell&#x27;s Old Boys (founded 1903). Both play in Primera División Argentina. Central has won five National championships (in 1971, 1973, 1980, 1987 and in 2023), six National cups (1913, 1915, two cups in 1916, 1920 and 2018), and one international title: the Conmebol Cup (in 1995, precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana).
Newell&#x27;s has 6 National championships (in 1974, 1988, 1991, 1992, 2004 and in 2013) and 3 National cups (in 1911, 1921 and in 1949). Rosario&#x27;s other football clubs are Club Atlético Central Córdoba, currently playing in Primera C, Club Atlético Tiro Federal Argentino in Torneo Argentino A and Argentino de Rosario in Primera D.

It is also the hometown of Argentine internationals Lionel Messi, Ángel Di María, Maximiliano Rodríguez, César Delgado, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Mauro Icardi, Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Fernández, Ezequiel Garay, Luciana Aymar, Juan Imhoff, Ángel Correa, Nicolás Vergallo and Leonardo Senatore.

The city received international attention as the host of the II South American Games in 1982, as one of the host cities of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship, the 1993 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s U21 World Championship, the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1990 Basketball World Cup. Rosario also bid for the 2019 Pan American Games but the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) voted to support La Punta instead.

Rosario is the second choice site for Argentine rugby tests, after Buenos Aires. Famous rugby clubs from the city include Club Atlético del Rosario – one of the four UAR founding clubs – and also Jockey Club de Rosario and Duendes Rugby Club, both former winners of the Nacional de Clubes title. The city hosted the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship.

The 2010 Women&#x27;s Hockey World Cup, 2004 and 2012 Champions Trophy and the 2014–15 Women&#x27;s FIH Hockey World League Final were played there.

In 2014 the city hosted the Inline speed skating World Championship at Parque de la Independencia and in 2015 it hosted the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and juniors&#x27; FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships at Club Atlético Provincial&#x27;s indoor arena.

Rosario hosted the 2017 World Archery Youth Championships, and will host the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, and the 2019 South American Beach Games.

===Motorsports===
The city was the starting point for the 2014 Dakar Rally, as well as the finishing point in 2016. It also hosted the 2015 World RX of Argentina.

== Geography ==
The city of Rosario measures , not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:
*Latitude: parallels 32°52′18″ and 33°02′22″ South.
*Longitude: meridians 60°36′44″ and 60°47′46″ West.
The geographical center is approximately at 

The city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the Pampas, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres above mean sea level; the original settlement rests on the ravine on the right-hand shore of the Paraná, opposite a group of islands of the Paraná Delta which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of Entre Ríos. The nearest city across the river&#x27;s flood plain (60 km) is Victoria, Entre Ríos, linked to Rosario by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge.

Rosario lies on the ravine of the right-hand shore of the Paraná, about above mean sea level, in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is &quot;Plaza 25 de Mayo&quot; (&quot;May 25 Square&quot;), now surrounded by the municipality (&quot;Palacio de los Leones&quot;), the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Central Post Office, the Decorative Art Museum and a building called &quot;La Bola de Nieve&quot; (&quot;The Snowball&quot;). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is &quot;Pasaje Juramento&quot; (&quot;Oath Passage&quot;), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern.

===Climate===
The Rosario area has a &quot;Pampean&quot;, humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa), and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of maximum and minimum. The annual rainfall is .

Rosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is . This is due in part to the city&#x27;s flat topography, its situation on the Paraná River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.

The temperature difference usually is greater at night than during the day, greater in winter than in summer and most apparent when winds are light. However snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007.
During the spring Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. Rosario has average day-night temperatures of . The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above , when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is on January 9, 2006, while the record low is on July 15, 2020.

== Broadcasting and communications ==

Rosario has two private local television channels, Canal 3 and Canal 5 (the latter is part of the national network Telefé), and a relay station for the public national station, Canal 7 Argentina. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones Cablevisión and Multicanal, and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.

There are four AM radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of FM stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estación del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiofónica, and Clásica Rosario.

The city has three notable newspapers: &quot;La Capital&quot; (Argentina&#x27;s oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), &quot;Rosario/12&quot; (founded in 1991), and &quot;El Ciudadano &amp; La Región&quot; (founded in 1999).

Rosario is located at the center of Argentina&#x27;s optical fiber ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to mobile networks and broadband Internet access through DSL, cable modem and Wi-Fi, and including public Internet navigation centers (cybercafes).

About 96% of homes have a domestic telephone line, giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day and Friend&#x27;s Day in 2004 and 2005.

<doc id="592785" wikidata="Q1382013" url="?curid=592785" title="Everett Silvertips">
<text>The Everett Silvertips are an American major junior ice hockey team based in Everett, Washington. The team plays in the U.S. Division of the Western Conference of the Western Hockey League (WHL), and hosts games at Angel of the Winds Arena. The Silvertips joined the WHL as an expansion team ahead of the 2003–04 season. The team has not missed the playoffs in its 21-year history; Everett twice advanced to the league championship playoff series, but has not won the Ed Chynoweth Cup.

==History==
The city of Everett, with plans to build a new downtown arena complex, applied for a WHL franchise and was awarded conditional approval for an expansion franchise from the league in 2001. With the new team falling within the territorial rights of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Seattle ownership was given right of first refusal to purchase the new team; Bill Yuill decided to sell the Thunderbirds in order to take over the new expansion club. The new multi-million dollar complex, the Everett Events Centre, was completed ahead of the team&#x27;s inaugural season, offering a seating capacity of 8,200. In 2003, the team hired former National Hockey League coach Kevin Constantine to be its first head coach.

Beginning play in the 2003–04 season with a roster built through an expansion draft, the Silvertips rapidly established themselves as the best expansion team in league history. By January, Everett posted its 19th win of the season, breaking the previous expansion record of 18 wins posted by the 1995–96 Calgary Hitmen. The team would go on to win 35 games and finish atop the U.S. Division standings. In the playoffs, the Silvertips advanced all the way to the league final, upsetting the defending champion and heavily-favored Kelowna Rockets in the Western Conference final, with defender Mitch Love opening the series with an overtime goal. The team faced the Medicine Hat Tigers in the championship series, losing four straight games to fall short of the title. By the end of the year, the Silvertips, who earned a reputation as a disciplined defensive team, had set new records for an expansion team in every category. Constantine was named the league&#x27;s coach-of-the-year.

Three seasons later, the Silvertips won the Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy for the best regular season record after its 54-win, 111-point season, before losing in the second round of the playoffs. That season, the team&#x27;s first ever bantam draft selection, Zach Hamill, became the first Silvertip to lead the WHL in scoring.

The team&#x27;s success on the ice translated into fan support, and the Silvertips earned a reputation for drawing strong crowds—more than a decade into the team&#x27;s history, the Silvertips were in the top half of the league in attendance.

Everett established itself as a perennial playoff team, and in 2017–18, led by goaltender Carter Hart and coach Dennis Williams, the Silvertips made a second run to the league championship series. After a 47-win season, the team&#x27;s best since 2007, Everett faced the Swift Current Broncos in the playoff finals, ultimately losing the series in six games. Hart&#x27;s dominant season—he was named the league&#x27;s best player, on top of being named its best goaltender for a third straight season—added to the team&#x27;s historic reputation for exceptional goaltending. After Hart turned professional, Dustin Wolf was named top goaltender two years in a row.

Ahead of the 2024 playoffs, it was announced that long-time coach and manager Williams would be leaving the Silvertips after the season.

=== Rivals ===
The Silvertips have formed an enduring rivalry with the nearby Seattle Thunderbirds. The teams have met regularly in the playoffs, including a three-year stretch between 2016 and 2018 where the winner of the series between the two made it all the way to the championship series.

== Name and logos ==
The team adopted the &quot;Silvertips&quot; name after the grizzly bears of the Pacific Northwest. The team opted for a green and silver color-scheme. Ahead of their inaugural season, the team introduced a bear mascot, Lincoln, named after the aircraft carrier , which was stationed at Naval Station Everett at the time.

<doc id="592786" wikidata="Q1933314" url="?curid=592786" title="Telegram (album)">
<text>Telegram is the first full-length and second overall remix album by Icelandic musician Björk, released on 25 November 1996. The album is a collection of remixes of several tracks from her album &quot;Post&quot;, which had all previously appeared as B-sides of the UK versions of the singles off &quot;Post&quot;, except the &quot;Enjoy&quot; remix which was previously unreleased. The cover was shot by Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki. All of the songs on &quot;Post&quot; were remixed, excluding &quot;The Modern Things&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;. The collection also included one new song entitled &quot;My Spine&quot; which was originally slated to appear on &quot;Post&quot; but was pushed out by &quot;Enjoy&quot;, becoming the B-side to the UK &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; single instead. The album has sold 228,000 copies in US according to SoundScan.

==Content==
The track listing was originally going to contain Talvin Singh&#x27;s &quot;Calcutta Cyber Cafe&quot; mix of &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; and Plaid&#x27;s remix of &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot;. The Japanese version does not include the original version of &quot;I Miss You&quot;.

The original UK LP pressing contains an alternate third track, the &quot;Further Over the Edge Mix&quot; of &quot;Hyperballad&quot; as opposed to the more commonly heard &quot;Further Over the Edge Mix&quot; of &quot;Enjoy&quot;. The remixes are nearly identical with the major difference being the chopped up vocals come from &quot;Hyperballad&quot; for the &quot;Hyperballad&quot; version and from &quot;Enjoy&quot; on the &quot;Enjoy&quot; version. To date the &quot;Hyperballad (Further Over the Edge Mix)&quot; is exclusive to the original UK vinyl pressing while the original CD pressing and all subsequent CD and vinyl pressings contain the more common &quot;Enjoy&quot; version.

Björk also declared that the release of &quot;Telegram&quot; meant the end of an era consisting of &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;.

==Reception==

The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, &quot;&quot;Telegram&quot; works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of where to begin exploring.&quot; According to &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, musically the album contains &quot;a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music&quot;. Douglas Wolk of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; felt the music of &quot;Telegram&quot; was &quot;actually better than &quot;Post&quot;&quot;, describing the tracks as &quot;well-considered reworkings&quot;. The &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it &quot;shed new light on the songs&quot;.

From 1981 to 1987 he was the main presenter of the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the flagship BBC News television programme, and from 1987 until 2019 he presented on the BBC Radio 4 breakfast programme &quot;Today&quot;. He was the host of the BBC Two television quiz show &quot;Mastermind&quot; from 2003 to 2021, for a total of 735 episodes. Humphrys now presents a regular Sunday afternoon show on Classic FM, where he also sometimes fills in on the weekday &quot;More Music Breakfast&quot; show.

Humphrys has a reputation as having been an outspoken and challenging interviewer; occasionally politicians have, after being subjected to a tough interview on live radio, been critical of his style.

== Early life and career ==
Humphrys was born into a working-class environment in Cardiff, at 193 Pearl Street, Adamsdown, son of Winifred Mary (Matthews), a hairdresser, and Edward George Humphrys, a self-employed Conservative-voting French polisher. He was one of five children. During early life Humphrys had a bout of whooping cough and, concerned that he would be known as &#x27;Dismal Desmond&#x27;, his mother opted to use the name John. His parents encouraged him to do his homework and he passed the eleven plus exam. He became a pupil at Cardiff High School (then a grammar school), but he did not fit into the middle-class environment there. He was an average pupil and left school at 15, choosing not to go to university and instead became a reporter with the &quot;Penarth Times&quot;, a weekly newspaper that focused on local news in the town of Penarth, a seaside resort south of Cardiff.

Humphrys later joined the &quot;Western Mail&quot;, a larger regional newspaper based in Cardiff. He joined Television Wales and the West (TWW), a commercial television channel based in Wales, and was the first reporter on the scene of the Aberfan disaster, which killed 144 people and destroyed entire parts of a town, in October 1966.

== Career at the BBC ==
Humphrys joined the BBC later in 1966 as the district reporter for Liverpool and the north-west, where he reported on the dock strikes of that time, sometimes for the national news. He then worked as a foreign correspondent, initially having to go abroad and leave his family for six-to-nine-month periods at a time when his children were still young and growing up. Later he took his family with him to the United States and South Africa where he was sent to open a news bureau. He reported the resignation of president Richard Nixon in 1974 on television by satellite from the United States, and the execution of Gary Gilmore in 1977; later, when based in South Africa, he reported on the end of Rhodesia and the creation of the new nation of Zimbabwe. Humphrys became disillusioned with living in hotels and life on-the-road as a foreign correspondent, and returned to London in 1980 to take up the post of BBC Diplomatic Correspondent.

In 1981, he became the main presenter of the BBC&#x27;s flagship &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. This appointment marked a change in the BBC&#x27;s approach to news broadcasting. With the appointment of Humphrys and John Simpson, the presenters of the news became part of the process of preparing the broadcast, rather than just reading a prepared script as with previous presenters. In addition to this, Humphrys also briefly read the midweek classified football results. Humphrys began presenting &quot;Today&quot; in January 1987, joining Brian Redhead. He still made occasional appearances fronting BBC Television news bulletins in the 1990s. During the 1991 Gulf War, he was a volunteer presenter on the BBC Radio 4 News FM service.

From 1993, he presented the weekly &quot;On The Record&quot; political TV show until its demise in 2002. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in January 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while presenting an edition of &quot;On The Record&quot; at the BBC Television Centre. He also appeared on Series 1 Episode 5 of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, which aired on 28 April 2000.

Humphrys has also presented &quot;Panorama&quot; and was the presenter of the revived version of the game show &quot;Mastermind&quot; between 2003 and 2021. He became the programme&#x27;s fourth regular host, succeeding Magnus Magnusson, Peter Snow and Clive Anderson.

Humphrys is an agnostic, but has said that he has a curiosity to test his agnosticism and challenge established religions to see if they can restore his childhood belief in God. In 2006, he presented a BBC Radio 4 programme, titled &quot;Humphrys in Search of God&quot;, in which he spoke to leading British authorities on Christianity, Judaism and Islam in order to try to restore his faith.

On 12 November 2009, he became a temporary replacement for David Dimbleby as the host of &quot;Question Time&quot; when Dimbleby was recovering from an injury. On 3 January 2011, Humphrys announced that he had extended his contract to present the &quot;Today&quot; programme, but in doing so had agreed to a pay cut. In 2014, he appeared as himself in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot;.

Humphry&#x27;s interview with the Director-General of the BBC George Entwistle on 11 November 2012 on the &quot;Today&quot; programme was widely reported to have been a major factor in Entwistle&#x27;s resignation later that day. In the interview, Entwistle admitted he was unaware of a &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation which wrongly accused a senior Conservative figure of child abuse until after it was broadcast. The report came about during the unfolding of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, which was also considered a factor that contributed to Entwistle&#x27;s resignation.

On the day of the interview, Humphrys&#x27; co-presenter James Naughtie recalled &quot;It was electric in that studio. There were three of us sitting there, George, John and me. And I think all three of us knew we could see a man destroying his own job, on the spot. He was at sea. And it was a deeply uncomfortable 10 minutes.&quot; Humphrys later said: &quot;I know it was said in the papers the following morning that he had been humiliated. I didn&#x27;t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

In a March 2014 interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Humphrys noted some of the biases at the BBC, describing it as &quot;broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative&quot;. He highlighted failings in coverage of the issues of Europe and immigration, stating: &quot;We weren&#x27;t sufficiently sceptical – that&#x27;s the most accurate phrase – of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal. We weren&#x27;t sufficiently sceptical about the pro-immigration argument. We didn&#x27;t look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour.&quot;

In February 2019, Humphrys announced that he was to leave the &quot;Today&quot; programme, saying that he should have quit &quot;years ago&quot;. He hosted his final edition on 19 September, when his interviewees were Tony Blair, Dame Edna Everage and David Cameron.

On 6 February 2021, in his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; column, Humphrys announced he would leave his position on &quot;Mastermind&quot; after 18 years of hosting the programme. His 735th and final episode of the show aired on 26 April 2021. He was replaced by TV presenter Clive Myrie, who made his debut on 23 August 2021.

== Other interests ==
Humphrys has written several books, including &quot;Lost for Words&quot;, in which he criticises what he sees as the widespread misuse of the English language, plus &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, &quot;Beyond Words&quot;, &quot;The Great Food Gamble&quot; and &quot;In God We Doubt: Confessions of a Failed Atheist&quot;. In September 2019, he released his memoir &quot;A Day Like Today&quot;, which included his views on the internal political climate at the BBC.

He played himself in the 2013 crime thriller film &quot;Closed Circuit&quot; with Eric Bana playing the lead.

After leaving the BBC, Humphrys joined the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a weekly columnist and became a presenter on Classic FM on Sunday afternoons between 3 pm and 5 pm.

Humphrys is a keen gardener who makes his home-made compost and uses his own urine to water his lawn.

Humphrys founded Kitchen Table Charities Trust (KTCT) in 2005. The charity collects donations and distributes small grants to projects mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

== Political views ==
Humphrys has been described as a &quot;natural liberal&quot; and does not view himself as conservative, saying; &quot;I am not conservative, you know. I am genuinely one of those pathetic people who has very strong views about issues&quot;.

He also stated that his political views are heavily influenced by what he sees and who he talks to as a reporter. &quot;So every other bloody week I change my mind about something or other, and when you vote, you look for the party that comes closest to what you believe.&quot;

When asked if he was happy with having the extracts of his books published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Humphrys responded, saying: &quot;Yes. They did and they not only did that, but they also sought my approval. I was not particularly happy with the splash [the headline] the Mail used, but you know… I don&#x27;t give a flying fuck whether people think that a particular newspaper is biased in this way or that way. All I&#x27;m concerned with is that my material is presented in the way I&#x27;ve written it and they didn&#x27;t change a word.&quot;

He also responded to a further question titled &quot;Do you understand why some people don&#x27;t like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;?&quot; saying that he has always read the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; simply because it reaches an awful lot of people, and that it may not always be compatible with his own views, but said that he also thinks the same about &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which hosted the interview.

He views himself as feminist, stating in 2019: &quot;I detest the word feminism, because of course I&#x27;m a feminist. God, why does one have to say it?&quot;

== Personal life ==
Humphrys married Edna Wilding (August 1942 – September 1997) in 1964 and they had two children, a son and daughter, Christopher and Catherine. Their marriage broke down in the late 1980s. Wilding died of cancer in Glamorgan, South Wales; Humphrys described her last days in a hospice in his book &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (2000). Humphrys&#x27; son Christopher is now a professional cellist, while his daughter Catherine is a professional vegan chef.

On 2 June 2000, when he was 56 years old, Humphrys and his then partner, Valerie Sanderson, had a son, Owen James. Sanderson was a newsreader with news programme &quot;Spotlight&quot;, then with BBC News 24, and is now a radio producer. Humphrys had a reverse vasectomy. He referred to these facts on 31 October 2006 on BBC Radio 4 in the programme &quot;Humphrys in Search of God&quot;. He and Sanderson subsequently separated. In 2009, he began a relationship with the journalist Catherine Bennett, a contributor to &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Humphrys&#x27; brother, Bob Humphrys, was a sports television presenter on BBC Wales Today. He died of lung cancer in Cardiff on 19 August 2008, aged 56. In December 2013, Humphrys was featured in an episode of the BBC Wales series &quot;Coming Home&quot; where it was revealed that their great-grandmother, Sarah Willey, had been a resident at the Cardiff workhouse and that their paternal great-grandfather was from Finland.

Humphrys is a keen listener to classical music and was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 6 January 2008. His favourite record on the show was Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto.

== Awards ==
Humphrys has won a number of industry awards, including being named Journalist of the Year in February 2000 at an awards ceremony organised by &quot;The House&quot; and Channel 4, the Gold Sony Radio Award in 2003, and a silver platter for Crystal Clear Broadcasting from the Plain English Campaign.

He holds an honorary degree from Abertay University, which is located in Dundee, Scotland.

<text>Wen Tsing Chow (; 1918–2001), was a Chinese-born American missile guidance scientist and a digital computer pioneer, known for the invention of programmable read-only memory or PROM.

==Biography==
Chow was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi in 1918. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in 1940 and an M.S. in EE from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1942.

Chow, working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation, pioneered the use of digital computers in missile, satellite and spacecraft guidance systems, leading the design of the United States Air Force Atlas E/F ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) all-inertial guidance system and guidance computer, the first production airborne digital computer. Mr. Chow personally formulated the design of the first all solid state, high reliability, space-borne digital computer and established the basic systems approach and mechanization of America&#x27;s ICBM guidance systems.

Chow invented and holds a fundamental patent on what is now commonly known as programmable read-only memory or PROM. PROM, in the late 1950s called a &quot;constants storage matrix,&quot; was invented for the Atlas E/F ICBM airborne digital computer.

He would continue working throughout the 1960s and early 1970s to develop and advance missile and spacecraft digital computers and guidance systems technology beyond the state of the art - working at the Aerospace Corporation in the Gemini and Minuteman programs and at IBM in the B-1, B-52, Saturn V and Skylab programs, and of course, in the development of the AP-101 digital computer used in the Space Shuttle Computer Complex.

Chow, uniquely, worked on the guidance computers and guidance systems for every major United States Air Force ICBM and NASA crewed space program from the very beginning with the Atlas, through Titan, Gemini, Saturn, and Skylab, to missiles and spacecraft still in service today, Minuteman and the Space Shuttle.

In 2004, the United States Air Force posthumously awarded Mr. Chow one of their highest awards, the Air Force Space and Missiles Pioneers Award, previously held by only 30 individuals. Chow is one of only a handful of civilians to receive this award and along with John von Neumann, one of only two computer scientists so honored.

<text>The Danish East India Company () refers to two separate Danish-Norwegian chartered companies. The first company operated between 1616 and 1650. The second company existed between 1670 and 1729, however, in 1730 it was re-founded as the [[Danish Asiatic Company|Asiatic Company]] ().

==First company==
The first Danish East India Company was chartered in 1616 under King Christian IV and focused on trade with India. The first expedition, under Admiral Gjedde, took two years to reach Ceylon, losing more than half their crew. The island had been claimed by Portugal by the time they arrived but on 10May 1620, a treaty was concluded with the Kingdom of Kandy and the foundation laid of a settlement at Trincomalee on the island&#x27;s east coast. They occupied the colossal Koneswaram temple in May 1620 to begin fortification of the peninsula before being expelled by the Portuguese. After landing on the Indian mainland, a treaty was concluded with the ruler of the Tanjore Kingdom,
Raghunatha Nayak, who gave the Danes possession of the town of Tranquebar, and permission to trade in the kingdom by treaty of 19November 1620. In Tranquebar they established Dansborg and installed Captain Roland Crappé as the first governor (&quot;opperhoved&quot;) of Danish India. The treaty was renewed on 30July 1621, and afterwards renewed and confirmed on the 10May 1676, by Shivaji the founder of the Maratha Empire.

During their heyday, the Danish East India Company and Swedish East India Company imported more tea than the British East India Company, smuggling 90% of it into England, where it could be sold at a huge profit. Between 1624-36, Danish trade extended to Surat, Bengal, Java, and Borneo, with factories in Masulipatam, Surat, Balasore and at Java, but subsequent European wars in which Denmark participated ruined the Company, and trade in India ceased entirely between 1643–69, during which time all previous acquisitions were lost except Tranquebar, which held out until aid from Denmark arrived in 1669.

===Second company, 16701729===

In 1670, a second Danish East India Company was established, before it too was dissolved in 1729.

==Ships==

<doc id="592793" wikidata="Q157368" url="?curid=592793" title="8405 Asbolus">
<text>8405 Asbolus is a centaur orbiting in the outer Solar System between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. It was discovered on 5 April 1995, by James Scotti and Robert Jedicke of Spacewatch (credited) at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, United States. It is named after Asbolus, a centaur in Greek mythology and measures approximately 80 kilometers in diameter.

== Orbit and classification ==
Centaurs have short dynamical lifetimes due to perturbations by the giant planets. Asbolus is estimated to have an orbital half-life of about 860 kiloannum. Asbolus is currently classified as a SN centaur since Saturn is considered to control the perihelion and Neptune controls the aphelion.

It currently has a perihelion of 6.8 AU, so is also influenced by Jupiter. Centaurs with a perihelion less than 6.6 AU are very strongly influenced by Jupiter and for classification purposes are considered to have a perihelion under the control of Jupiter. In about ten thousand years, clones of the orbit of Asbolus suggest that its perihelion classification may come under the control of Jupiter.

Predicting the overall orbit and position of Asbolus beyond a few thousand years is difficult because of errors in the known trajectory, error amplification by perturbations due to all of the giant planets, and the possibility of perturbation as a result of cometary outgassing and fragmentation. Compared to centaur 7066 Nessus, the orbit of Asbolus is currently much more chaotic.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Asbolus (Greek for &quot;sooty&quot;, &quot;the black one&quot;), a centaur capable to read omens in the flight of birds. He provoked a bloodbath in which the centaurs Chiron and Pholus met their deaths at Heracles″ hands. The minor planets 2060 Chiron, 5145 Pholus and 5143 Heracles are named after these mythological figures. The official naming citation was published on 28 September 1999 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

No resolved images of it have ever been made, but in 1998 spectral analysis of its composition by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a fresh impact crater on its surface, less than 10 million years old. Centaurs are dark in colour, because their icy surfaces have darkened after long exposure to solar radiation and the solar wind. However, fresh craters excavate more reflective ice from below the surface, and that is what Hubble has detected on Asbolus.

<text>Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz (; usually called just Santa Fe, lit. &quot;Holy Faith&quot;) is the capital city of the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. It is situated in north-eastern Argentina, near the junction of the Paraná and Salado rivers. It lies from the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel that connects it to the city of Paraná. The city is also connected by canal with the port of Colastiné on the Paraná River. Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz has about 391,164 inhabitants per the . The metropolitan area has a population of 653,073, making it the eighth largest in Argentina.

Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz is linked to Rosario ( to the south), the largest city in the province, by the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway and by National Route 11, which continues south towards Buenos Aires. Córdoba is about ( west of Santa Fe, through the National Route 19. Santa Fe is home to the Sauce Viejo Airport with daily direct flights to Rosario and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires.

==History==

Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz was founded on the nearby site of Cayastá in 1573 by the conquistador Juan de Garay (1528-1583)
during an expedition which he led from Asunción (in present-day Paraguay) to the Paraná River. (Cayastá today has a historical park containing the grave of Hernandarias (1561-1634), the first American-born governor in South America.) The settlement was moved to the present site in 1653 due to the constant flooding of the Cayastá River. The city of Santa Fe became the provincial capital in 1814, when the territory of the province of Santa Fe was separated from the province of Buenos Aires by the National Constituent Assembly, held in the city in 1853.

Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz became the commercial and transportation center for a rich agricultural area that produces grain, vegetable oils, and meats. The city is the site of the National Technological University – Santa Fe Regional Faculty, Catholic University of Santa Fe (inaugurated in 1959), and the National University of the Littoral (first founded as the Provincial University in 1889, it adopted its current name in 1919).

A suspension bridge was completed in 1924, though severe flooding partially destroyed it in 1983 (a second bridge, the Oroño, was opened in 1971). The city&#x27;s location is still not immune to flooding. On April 29, 2003, the Salado, which empties into the Paraná near Santa Fe, rose almost 2 m (6.5 ft) in a few hours following heavy rainfall, and caused a catastrophic flood. No fewer than 100,000 people had to be evacuated, and large sections of the city remained under water more than a week later. That year, the suspension bridge was reopened, and in 2008, the city&#x27;s historic grain silos were converted into the Los Silos Hotel and Casino, and San Martín Street was converted to pedestrian use.

The city&#x27;s historical role in the Argentine Constitution led national lawmakers to choose it as the site of Constitutional Conventions in 1949, 1957, and 1994.

== Climate ==
The city has a climate considered as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification, with a &quot;Cwa&quot; tendency). Winters are generally mild, though minimum temperatures can fall below on cold nights during the winter. Summers are generally hot and humid. During the most extreme heat waves, temperatures have exceeded . Temperatures have exceeded in every season.

Rainfall can be expected throughout the year though summer is usually the wettest season. Thunderstorms can be intense with frequent lightning, powerful downdraughts and intense precipitation. The lowest record temperature was on June 13, 1967, while the highest recorded temperature was on January 25, 1986.

==The city==


There is infrastructure for tourism that has been developed: river side bars and nightclubs, chic restaurants, the improvement of the major highways and a subfluvial tunnel.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Despite having had four railway stations, nowadays the city Santa Fe is not served by rail transport. The Mitre Railway station is no longer used since 2007, when defunct company Trenes de Buenos Aires cancelled its services to Santa Fe. Likewise, the Santa Fe Belgrano (built in 1891 and named Cultural Heritage) and Guadalupe stations had been entered into disuse in 1993 when the railway privatisation in Argentina ceased all the long-distance services in the country.

In the 2010s, the local municipality remodelled both stations as Guadalupe would be terminus for a new urban train. Nevertheless, the original project was not carried out. On the other hand, the Santa Fe Belgrano station was re-opened as a convention center.

The fourth station (also the oldest of all) had been built by French company Province of Santa Fe Railway in 1885. It was demolished in 1962 and replaced by a bus station.

Railway stations in the city of Santa Fe are:

Notes:
* 1 &quot;No longer active since TBA cancelled its services.&quot;
* 2 &quot;Granted in concession to the Municipality of Santa Fe that remodelled it completely. The station re-opened as a convention center.
* 3 &quot;Refurbished in 2011 by the Municipality to be terminus of an urban train. Nevertheless, the project was not carried out.&quot;
* 4 &quot;Also known as &quot;La Francesa&quot;, it was demolished in 1962 to build a bus station.&quot;

==Sports==
Santa Fe put itself on the international sports map as one of the host cities of the 1990 FIBA World Championship. The games were played in the Estadio de la Facultad Regional Santa Fe. The Estadio Ángel Malvicino was one of the venues of the 2002 FIVB Men&#x27;s Volleyball World Championship. Santa Fe also hosted the first ever Five-pin billiards World Championship in 1965.

The city is also home to two first division football teams: Club Atlético Colón and Club Atlético Unión, who contest the Santa Fe derby. Santa Fe was also the place where the world known Amílcar Brusa was born and raised, and the home of boxers Carlos Baldomir and Julio César Vásquez.

<doc id="592795" wikidata="Q5054946" url="?curid=592795" title="Cave of Adullam">
<text>The Cave of Adullam () was originally a stronghold referred to in the Old Testament, near the town of Adullam, where future King David sought refuge from King Saul.

The word &quot;cave&quot; is usually used but &quot;fortress&quot;, which has a similar appearance in writing, is used as well. Wilhelm Gesenius&#x27; work &quot;Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon to the Old Testament Scriptures&quot; provides notes supporting &quot;Adullam&quot; as meaning &quot;a hiding place&quot;. Brown, Driver, and Briggs&#x27; Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament cite the Arabic word &quot;&#x27;adula&quot; to mean &quot;turn aside&quot; and suggest &quot;Adullam&quot; to mean &quot;retreat, refuge&quot;.

During this period, David passed up several opportunities to kill Saul, who in turn was attempting to kill his young rival, whose followers believed had been chosen by God to succeed King Saul. David refused to fight unethically, for instance when he had an opportunity to kill Saul in his sleep. According to the Old Testament, God honored David&#x27;s high ethical standards and soon King David and his men, who had once hidden in the Cave of Adullam, were known throughout Israel for their deeds of valor.

==Non-biblical usage==
The term &quot;Cave of Adullam&quot; has been used by political commentators referring to any small group remote from power but planning to return. Thus in Walter Scott&#x27;s 1814 novel &quot;Waverley&quot; when the Jacobite rising of 1745 marches south through England, the Jacobite Baron of Bradwardine welcomes scanty recruits while remarking that they closely resemble David&#x27;s followers at the Cave of Adullam; &quot;&quot;videlicet&quot;, every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented&quot;.

The Cathedral&#x27;s construction was completed on 10 September 2006. A small wooden chapel that served as a temporary worship space still stands nearby. 

==Architecture==
The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was designed by architect is Oleg Kopylov. Standing at 70 meters high, the temple was built in the style of church architecture in the duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal. 

==History==
The cornerstone for the structure was laid in 1995. In 1996, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Metropolitan Kirill brought a capsule with earth taken from Moscow&#x27;s Christ the Saviour Cathedral. The upper church of the Resurrection was consecrated on September 10 2006 by Patriarch Alexy II, and timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the opening of the first Orthodox church in Kaliningrad.

The lower church in the name of the Holy Face of Our Saviour was consecrated on September 27, 2007 by Metropolitan of Smolensk and Kaliningrad Kirill (Gundyaev). The &quot;Memel&quot; iconostasis created during the Seven Years&#x27; War for the Russian garrison in Memel (Klaipėda) was subsequently installed here. The lower temple is a temple of military glory and is dedicated to the memory of the Russian soldiers who died in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I and World War II in East Prussia and today&#x27;s Kaliningrad Oblast .

In July 2010 near the cathedral a new small church was opened, established in the same style and dedicated to Saints Peter and Fevronia of Murom.
