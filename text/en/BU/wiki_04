<text>Santali (, , , , ) is a Kherwarian Munda language spoken natively by the Santal people of South Asia. It is the most widely-spoken language of the Munda subfamily of the Austroasiatic languages, related to Ho and Mundari, spoken mainly in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Tripura and West Bengal. It is a recognised regional language of India as per the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. It is spoken by around 7.6 million people in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal, making it the third most-spoken Austroasiatic language after Vietnamese and Khmer.

Santali was a mainly oral language until developments were made by European missionaries to write it in Bengali, Odia and Roman scripts. Eventually, the Ol Chiki script was developed by Raghunath Murmu in 1925. Ol Chiki is alphabetic, sharing none of the syllabic properties of the other Indic scripts, and is now widely used to write Santali in India.

==History==
According to linguist Paul Sidwell, Munda languages probably arrived on the coast of Odisha from Indochina about 4000–3500 years ago, and spread after the Indo-Aryan migration to Odisha.

Until the nineteenth century, Santali had no written language and all shared knowledge was transmitted by word of mouth from generation to generation. European interest in the study of the languages of India led to the first efforts at documenting the Santali language. Bengali, Odia and Roman scripts were first used to write Santali before the 1860s by European anthropologists, folklorists and missionaries including A. R. Campbell, Lars Skrefsrud and Paul Bodding. Their efforts resulted in Santali dictionaries, versions of folk tales, and the study of the morphology, syntax and phonetic structure of the language.

The Ol Chiki script was created for Santali by Mayurbhanj poet Raghunath Murmu in 1925 and first publicised in 1939.

Ol Chiki as a Santali script is widely accepted among Santal communities. Presently in West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand, Ol Chiki is the official script for Santali literature &amp; language. However, users from Bangladesh use Bengali script instead.

Santali was honoured in December 2013 when the University Grants Commission of India decided to introduce the language in the National Eligibility Test to allow lecturers to use the language in colleges and universities.

== Geographic distribution ==

Santali is spoken by over seven million people across India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, with India being its native country and having the largest number of speakers. According to 2011 census, India has a total of 7,368,192 Santali speakers (including 358,579 Karmali, 26,399 Mahli). State wise distribution is Jharkhand (2.75 million), West Bengal (2.43 million), Odisha (0.86 million), Bihar (0.46 million), Assam (0.21 million) and a few thousand in each of Chhattisgarh, and in north-eastern states Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram.

The highest concentrations of Santali language speakers are in Santhal Pargana division, as well as East Singhbhum and Seraikela Kharsawan districts of Jharkhand, the Jangalmahals region of West Bengal (Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia districts) and Mayurbhanj district of Odisha.

Smaller pockets of Santali language speakers are found in the northern Chota Nagpur plateau (Hazaribagh, Giridih, Ramgarh, Bokaro and Dhanbad districts), Balesore and Kendujhar districts of Odisha, and throughout western and northern West Bengal (Birbhum, Paschim Medinipur, Hooghly, Paschim Bardhaman, Purba Bardhaman, Malda, Dakshin Dinajpur, Uttar Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts), Banka district and Purnia division of Bihar (Araria, Katihar, Purnia and Kishanganj districts), and tea-garden regions of Assam (Kokrajhar, Sonitpur, Chirang and Udalguri districts). Outside India, the language is spoken in pockets of Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions of northern Bangladesh as well as the Morang and Jhapa districts in the Terai of Koshi Province in Nepal.

=== Official status===
Santali is one of India&#x27;s 22 scheduled languages. It is also recognised as the additional official language of the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal.

=== Dialects ===
Dialects of Santali include Kamari-Santali, Khole, Lohari-Santali, Mahali, Manjhi, Paharia.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Santali has 21 consonants, not counting the 10 aspirated stops which occur primarily, but not exclusively, in Indo-Aryan loanwords and are given in parentheses in the table below.
:/ /

In native words, the opposition between voiceless and voiced stops is neutralised in word-final position. A typical Munda feature is that word-final stops are &quot;checked&quot;, i. e. glottalised and unreleased.

=== Vowels ===
Santali has eight oral and six nasal vowel phonemes. With the exception of /e o/, all oral vowels have a nasalized counterpart.

There are numerous diphthongs.

===Word prominence===
Santali prosody exhibits iambic patterns with stress is always released in the second syllable in most disyllabic words, excepting loan words from Hindi, Bihari, Bengali and Assamese.

===Vowel harmony===
Like all Kherwarian languages, vowel harmony in Santali is a morphological triggered process.

== Morphology ==
Santali, like all Munda languages, is a suffixing agglutinating language.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for number and case.

==== Number ====
Three numbers are distinguished: singular, dual and plural.

==== Case ====
The case suffix follows the number suffix. The following cases are distinguished:

Transcript version:
==== Possession ====
Santali has possessive suffixes which are only used with kinship terms: 1st person &quot;-ɲ&quot;, 2nd person &quot;-m&quot;, 3rd person &quot;-t&quot;. The suffixes do not distinguish possessor number.

=== Pronouns ===
The personal pronouns in Santali distinguish inclusive and exclusive first person and anaphoric and demonstrative third person.

The interrogative pronouns have different forms for animate (&#x27;who?&#x27;) and inanimate (&#x27;what?&#x27;), and referential (&#x27;which?&#x27;) vs. non-referential.

The indefinite pronouns are:

The demonstratives distinguish three degrees of deixis (proximate, distal, remote) and simple (&#x27;this&#x27;, &#x27;that&#x27;, etc.) and particular (&#x27;just this&#x27;, &#x27;just that&#x27;) forms.

=== Numerals ===
The basic cardinal numbers (transcribed into Latin script IPA) are:

The numerals are used with numeral classifiers. Distributive numerals are formed by reduplicating the first consonant and vowel, e.g. &quot;babar&quot; &#x27;two each&#x27;.

Numbers basically follow a base-10 pattern. Numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by addition, &quot;gel&quot; (&#x27;10&#x27;) followed by the single-digit number (1 through 9). Multiples of ten are formed by multiplication: the single-digit number (2 through 9) is followed by &quot;gel&quot; (&#x27;10&#x27;). Some numbers are part of a base-20 number system. 20 can be &quot;bar gel&quot; or &quot;isi&quot;.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Santali inflect for tense, aspect and mood, voice and the person and number of the subject and sometimes of the object.

==== Santali TAM ====
There are no specific markers for the Imperative.
==== Subject markers ====
==== Object markers ====
Transitive verbs with pronominal objects take infixed object markers.

====Indirect object indexing====
Transitive verbs may form agreements with non-arguments/outside/indirect objects. To denote inalienable possession, prefix &quot;-t-&quot; is attached to the applicative forms of the pronouns; otherwise it is marked in the noun phrase and functions as an attribute.

====Finiteness====
Any finite verbs will attach &quot;-a&quot;, except the imperative and in the subordinate clause.

====Causative====
There are two causative markers: &quot;a-&quot; and &quot;-oco&quot;. &quot;-oco&quot; is attached on every type of verb stems, and &quot;a-&quot; is restricted to two transitive verbs &quot;jɔm&quot; (&#x27;eat&#x27;) and &quot;ɲu&quot; (&#x27;drink&#x27;).

====Reciprocal====
Infix &quot;-pV-&quot; turns transitive and ditransitive verb roots into reciprocal meaning, but in many verbs it also conveys that the action is done together by two participants.

&quot;dal&quot; (&#x27;beat&#x27;) &gt; &quot;dapal&quot; (&#x27;beat each other&#x27;)

&quot;landa&quot; (&#x27;laugh&#x27;) &gt; &quot;lapanda&quot; (&#x27;laugh together&#x27;)

====Benefactive====
The benefactive for transitive and ditransitive stems is &quot;-ka&quot; in Northern Santali dialect and &quot;-ka-k&quot; in Southern Santali. In Southern Santali, if the object is animate, the last &quot;-k&quot; will be replaced by pronominal clitics.

&quot;tɔl&quot; (&#x27;bind&#x27;) &gt; &quot;tɔlka&quot; (&#x27;to bind for somebody&#x27;)

====Medio-passive====
Transitive verbs and a limited number of intransitive and intransitive-transitive verb roots will take &quot;-jɔn&quot; to form the Medio-passive voice.

====Passive and Reflexive====
Transitive roots, transitive-intransitive roots, and causative stems will take &quot;-ok&quot; to derive passive stems. In the transitive-intransitive roots, it denotes the prominence of transitivity. Attaching it to transitive verbs will create reflexivity.

&quot;ɲɛl&quot; (&#x27;see&#x27;) &gt; &quot;ɲɛlok&quot; (&#x27;be seen&#x27;) (passive)

&quot;ranoco&quot; (&#x27;cause to medicate&#x27;) &gt; &quot;ranocok&quot; (&#x27;be caused to medicate&#x27;) (causative &gt; passive)

&quot;mak&quot; (&#x27;cut&#x27;) &gt; &quot;makok&quot; (&#x27;cut oneself&#x27;) (reflexive)

===Serial verb constructions===
Two or more verbs and modifiers can combine together to derive a compound verb. Normally they are combinations of two transitive verbs or two intransitive verbs and limited numbers of transitive+intransitive and intransitive+transitive combination.

===Auxiliary verb constructions===
Complex predicates are pervasive in Munda clause structure. In Santali, there are univerbated auxiliary constructions to mark a quick, sudden, or intense action.

===Negation===
There are three particles in Santali used to express negation: &quot;baŋ&quot;, &quot;ɔhɔ&quot; and &quot;alo&quot;. &quot;baŋ&quot; and &quot;ba&quot; (shortened form) are the negatives for interrogative and declarative sentences; &quot;ɔhɔ&quot; is the emphatic negative of declarative sentences; &quot;alo&quot; is the prohibitive negative in the imperative. These negation particles will take away the subject marker from the verb.

== Syntax ==
The unmarked word order of Santali is SOV, though topics can be fronted. The subject marker may appear enclitic to the verb itself if there is no preceding word.

==Vocabulary==
In daily conversations, Santali speakers generally employ high percentages of words of native Austroasiatic/Munda/Santali origins, compared to other Munda languages such as Kharia and Juang. Loan words, mostly borrowed from Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Nepali, Oriya and even English may account for almost 20% of the lexemes of daily needs. Younger generation who have opportunities to engage in higher education tend to be more accustomed with lexical influence from neighboring languages as well as English.

==Influence on other languages==

Notable linguist Khudiram Das authored the &quot;Santali Bangla Samashabda Abhidhan&quot; (), a book focusing on the influence of the Santali language on Bengali and providing a basis for further research on this subject. &#x27;Bangla Santali Bhasha Samparka () is a collection of essays in E-book format authored by him and dedicated to linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji on the relationship between the Bengali and Santali languages.

<doc id="586558" wikidata="Q2165933" url="?curid=586558" title="Trap–neuter–return">
<text>Trap–neuter–return (TNR), also known as trap–neuter–release, is a controversial method that attempts to manage populations of feral cats. The process involves live-trapping the cats, having them neutered, ear-tipped for identification, and, if possible, vaccinated, then releasing them back into the outdoors. If the location is deemed unsafe or otherwise inappropriate, the cats may be relocated to other appropriate areas (barn/farmyard homes are often considered best). Often, friendly adults and kittens young enough to be easily socialized are retained and placed for adoption. Feral cats cannot be socialized, shun most human interaction and do not fare well in confinement, so they are not retained. Cats suffering from severe medical problems such as terminal, contagious, or untreatable illnesses or injuries are often euthanized.

In the past, the main goal of most TNR programs was the reduction or eventual elimination of free-roaming cat populations. It is still the most widely implemented non-lethal method of managing them. While that is still a primary goal of many efforts, other programs and initiatives may be aimed more towards providing a better quality of life for feral cats, stemming the population expansion that is a direct result of breeding, improving the communities in which these cats are found, reducing &quot;kill&quot; rates at shelters that accept captured free-roaming cats, in turn improving public perceptions and possibly reducing costs, and eliminating or reducing nuisance behaviors to decrease public complaints about free-roaming cats.

Scientific research has not found TNR to be an effective means of controlling the feral cat population. Literature reviews have found that when studies documented TNR colonies that declined in population, those declines were being driven primarily by substantial percentages of colony cats being permanently removed by a combination of rehoming and euthanasia on an ongoing basis, as well as by an unusually high rate of death and disappearance. TNR colonies often increase in population for a number of reasons: cats breed quickly, and the trapping and sterilization rates are frequently too low to stop this population growth; food is usually being provided to the cats; and public awareness of a TNR colony tends to encourage people in the surrounding community to dump their own unwanted pet cats there. The growing popularity of TNR, even near areas of particular ecological sensitivity, has been attributed in part to a lack of public interest regarding the environmental harm caused by feral cats, and the unwillingness of both scientific communities and TNR advocates to engage.

== Terminology ==

TNR usually stands for &quot;trap–neuter–return&quot;. It is sometimes described as trap–neuter–release. The word &quot;return&quot; emphasizes that most feral cats are returned to their original locations under such a program. Variant acronyms and terms include: TNSR (for &#x27;trap–neuter/spay–return&#x27;), TNVR (&#x27;trap–neuter–vaccinate–return&#x27;), TNRM (&#x27;trap–neuter–release–maintain/manage&#x27;) where &#x27;maintain&#x27; generally means caregivers feed and monitor the feral cats after they are returned to their territories, and TTVAR (&#x27;trap–test–vaccinate–alter–release&#x27;).

TVHR (&#x27;trap–vasectomize/hysterectomize–release&#x27;) refers to a different method of cat population management, despite its similar name. TVHR differs in the type of sterilization surgery performed on the cats. Unlike traditional spays (ovariohysterectomy) and neuters (castration), which are done in TNR, the vasectomies and hysterectomies in TVHR result in sterile but sexually active cats.

RTF (&#x27;return to field&#x27;) or TNS (&#x27;trap, neuter, shelter return&#x27;) are alternative approaches that simply focus on the trap and desex portion and do not include a colony management aspect. In some instances, a receiving shelter will return a cat to where it was found; in other cases shelters are completely bypassed – a person takes a free-roaming live-trapped cat in for desexing, then returns it to where it was found.

==Advocacy and opposition==

TNR as a method of managing free-roaming cat populations is controversial. Global attitudes towards these cats vary from those who see them as pets to those who target them as invasive species that need to be eliminated. Many international, national, and regional organizations and association, both professional and advocacy-based, have publicly aligned themselves into three basic groups: those that stridently oppose managing, maintaining, or tolerating free-roaming cats and hence TNR; those who conditionally support TNR as a part of a community cat management program (which includes community cat oversight and monitoring); and those who unconditionally support and endorse TNR.

Organizations that oppose TNR on the basis of animal welfare and wildlife preservation include:

* PETA: PETA does not endorse TNR, citing research finding it is not an effective intervention along with data finding short life expectancies and inhumane living conditions for feral cats.
* The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council: &quot;The IWRC supports the humane removal of feral cat and dog populations, including feral cat colonies, through the rehabilitation and adoption of suitable animals into domestic environments and humane euthanasia of animals that cannot be rehabilitated and re-homed.&quot; They point out that as domestic animals &quot;subsidized&quot; by people, they exceed the ability for the environment to support them without resulting in damage to wildlife.
* The Wildlife Society: &quot;TNR undermines the work of wildlife professionals and severely jeopardizes the integrity of native biodiversity.&quot;
* American Bird Conservancy (ABC): &quot;Cats have been introduced into new habitats across the globe with terrible results. Outdoors, cats are a non-native and invasive species that threaten birds and other wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and spread diseases.&quot; They advocate responsible pet ownership and &quot;oppose Trap, Neuter, Release (TNR) for feral cats because of the persistent and severe threats posed by feral cat colonies.&quot;
* RSPCA Australia: &quot;As a long term strategy, in most of Australia, [TNR] is difficult to recommend. Since resources for cat control are limited, resources in and around towns and cities would be better spent on education, increased community awareness about responsible cat ownership, targeted desexing programs particularly for low-income earners, and better laws and regulations. These strategies should reduce the number of owned animals and their offspring entering the unowned cat population. For remote Australia where feral cats are completely unsocialised and therefore not candidates for rehoming, the most cost-effective and humane option is likely to be targeted and ongoing lethal control in priority areas where adverse environmental impacts are highest.&quot;
* Canadian Veterinary Medical Association: &quot;As typically applied, trap-neuter-release (TNR) alone is ineffective at reducing cat population sizes over reasonable time frames (e.g., less 10 years), with removal strategies such as high-volume adoptions, relocations and euthanasia being more efficacious.&quot;
* Australian Veterinary Association: &quot;These programs cannot be supported as a generalised and key strategy in the management of cats.&quot;

Some organizations that conditionally support TNR include:

* The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: &quot;The ASPCA endorses Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) as the only proven humane and effective method to manage community cat colonies.&quot; It clarifies its position by stating that managing &quot;involves a colony caretaker who provides food and adequate shelter and monitors the cats&#x27; health.&quot;
* The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS): &quot;we support Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) and similar sterilization programs, legislation that allows for and supports non-lethal population control, and coalition-based approaches that involve community leaders, citizens, and stakeholders to implement effective community cat management programs.&quot; They further clarify this view by stating: &quot;The HSUS believes that the humane reduction and eventual elimination of unowned cat populations should be the end goal for all TNR participants and supporters. TNR should be considered a humane means to an end, not a method of permanently maintaining outdoor cat populations. The HSUS estimates that the population of feral cats in the US ranges from 50 to 70million. In contrast, the number of pet cats in the US is approximately 76million.
* The American Humane Association: &quot;In some situations, safe cat colonies can be maintained by caretakers. American Humane Association supports trap, neuter and release programs for colony cats – especially for feral cats. Whenever possible, homes should be found for colony cats that might be successfully socialized.&quot;
* The UK&#x27;s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA): the RSPCA &quot;supports Trap, Neuter and Release (TNR) programmes with veterinary support. Healthy cats should be neutered, ear-tipped and returned or, where appropriate, re-sited.&quot;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Various studies and arguments have been presented both in support of and in opposition to free-roaming cats and TNR.

=== Purported reductions in population over time ===

In general, trap-neuter-release programs are not effective at reducing the population of feral cats, because the rates of trapping necessary to stop population growth are usually unattainable in real world conditions.

Some long-term studies have claimed or been cited to show that TNR is effective in stopping reproduction and reducing the population over time, but the methodology, analysis and conclusions of some of these studies have been called into question. Reviews of these studies, as well as mathematical models of population growth, have shown that TNR colonies only decrease in population where cats experience very high rates of permanent removal (of at least 50% of the colony cats per year, such as by a combination of adoption and euthanasia), combined with high sterilization rates, and low rates of immigration of new cats into the colony. Unless all of these conditions are met, TNR colonies will not decrease in size over time.

* An eleven-year study of a TNR program at the University of Central Florida achieved a population decrease of 66%, from 68 cats in 1996 (when the census was first completed after some trapping) to 23 cats in 2002. No new kittens were born after 1995, and newly arrived stray or abandoned cats were neutered or adopted to homes. However, as many proponents fail to note, TNR was not the sole reason for success. The population reduction was primarily from adoption (47%) and euthanasia (11%), or due to the cats no longer living on site with their whereabouts unknown (15%).
* A TNR program begun in 1992 by the Merrimack River Feline Rescue Society (MRFRS) on the central waterfront of Newburyport, Massachusetts, has been widely cited as an example of TNR success on a community level; however, only superficial reports about what took place have been available and there is very little statistical data to support the claims.

The success of specific focused studies to advocate TNR as a solution for controlling and reducing free-roaming cat populations worldwide is problematic. More broad-based approaches include using matrix population models to estimate the efficacy of euthanasia versus trap-neuter-return for management of free-roaming cats, such as the one researchers established for use in urban environments.

Efforts to assess the effectiveness have been hampered by the lack of sufficient monitoring data. Having some professional assistance, adapting the population monitoring framework developed over decades by wildlife biologists, and systematic monitoring can evolve into a relatively low-cost, high-value adjunct to ongoing management efforts.

The public awareness of TNR colonies encourages people to dump their unwanted pet cats there. In one study, to explain the ingression of cats it was found that &quot;the high quality and visibility of the program[...] may have encouraged abandonment of cats if owners believed that the cats would be well taken care of after abandonment. Abandonment may also have occurred if owners believed that cats would be better off under the care of the program rather than surrendered to a shelter where they would face the risk of euthanasia.&quot; Some of the cats that came in to the TNR colony had already been sterilized; some of these had ear-tips and some did not.

Introgression, particularly of intact cats, has been noted to be a barrier to decreasing cat populations over time through TNR efforts. It has become apparent that while the TNR process can reduce or limit the growth rate of the colony through reproduction, it may not reduce the population numbers if it is the sole method of intervention. Population reduction occurs primarily through adoptions of non-feral cats, natural death or euthanasia of sick animals, and disappearance or emigration of cats. TNR works together with these factors to reduce reproduction and thus to minimize replacement of animals lost from the colony. Other factors such as immigration of cats from surrounding areas can counteract its effect. Thus, the impact of TNR interventions on unowned cat populations can be complex, and ongoing management of colonies becomes an important component in optimizing reductions in the cat population.

=== Euthanasia debate ===
TNR is often presented to public officials and policymakers as a viable alternative to euthanasia with several benefits.

====Reducing euthanasia numbers====
* It has been claimed that euthanasia in shelters is the leading cause of death of cats. Proponents of TNR use this statistic to promote methods of cat population control that do not include euthanasia. However, in the USA there are no exact numbers of animals being euthanized each year. Only a few states require animal shelters to keep records about animals being euthanized, and there is no agency responsible for collecting or verifying this data. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) has noted a marked decrease in euthanasia rates since 2011 and the Humane Society of the United States reported that euthanasia of animals in shelters has been declining sharply since 1970. In addition, the reasons for euthanasia vary. Animals may be euthanized because of shelter over-crowding, for medical reasons (illness or injury), for court-mandated reasons, or because of financial/staff limitations.
* When the number of animals coming into a shelter exceeds its ability to care for, hold, or find foster placements, the facility may end up euthanizing animals. This could include even adoptable kittens or cats simply because they cannot be taken care of. A common outcome for a cat judged to be &quot;feral&quot; after being taken to a traditional shelter not practicing no-kill sheltering is euthanasia (humanely putting the animal to death). Feral cats do not tolerate being caged or handled and many shelters are unable to manage them without putting the animal or the staff at risk. TNR could alleviate this.

====Cost savings====
* Proponents of TNR claim that while neutering cats may be costly, euthanizing them costs more. However, the cost savings associated with TNR are location-specific and accurate estimates involve taking into account numerous variables including volunteer support, donations, grants, and local spay-neuter agreements for low-cost services. Cost savings fluctuate based on the type of TNR program implemented, the extent of animal control involvement, the volunteer base available, and the community&#x27;s overall support of TNR. Over time, through attrition and sterilization efforts, if the free-roaming population declines, savings may be realized by total decreased expenditures on them.
* In a 10-year study in Orange County, Florida, after a feral cat sterilization program was instituted in which 7,903 feral cats neutered, the cost was an estimated $442,568, as compared to $1,098,517 if they had been impounded and euthanized.
* In Port Orange, Florida, a TNR program started in 2013 in the city&#x27;s business areas resulted in fewer stray cats and money saved. In the first year, 214 cats were sterilized for $13,000, which was much less than over $50,000 spent in 2010, when most of the impounded cats were euthanized. A theoretical savings of $123,000 was projected based on not having to impound the offspring that the cats may have produced if not spayed.

====Improved morale and public support====
* A 2011 survey of U.S. pet owners found that 71% agreed that &quot;Animal shelters should only be allowed to euthanize animals when they are too sick to be treated or too aggressive to be adopted,&quot; while only 25% agreed that &quot;Sometimes animal shelters should be allowed to euthanize animals as a necessary way of controlling the population of animals.&quot;
*In 2019, a study was published that concluded &quot;for most Brisbane City (Australia) residents, when awareness is raised about the problem of urban stray cats and management strategies, the majority are supportive of a TNR community program with little or no persuasion required.&quot;
*TNR programs may have a side effect of reducing the stress and strain volunteers and staff have related to euthanasia in shelters. A 2019 study concluded that euthanasia-related strain is prevalent among shelter employees. Such strain is associated with increased levels of general job stress, work-to-family conflict, somatic complaints, and substance use, and with lower levels of job satisfaction.

===Improving the cats&#x27; health and welfare===
It has been claimed that TNR programs improve the welfare of free-roaming cats in many ways:

* Spayed female cats will no longer be burdened by pregnancy or nursing litters: Females have been found to be pregnant throughout the year. A study of the reproductive capacity of free-roaming cats showed they may have an average of 1.4 litters a year, with a median of 3 kittens/litter.
*Alleviating unnecessary suffering of kittens: 75% of the kittens born to free-roaming cats being studied died or disappeared before 6 months of age. Trauma was found to be the most common cause of death.
* Improved overall heath: The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) notes that properly managed programs can improve quality of life through better nutrition, vaccination to prevent disease, and euthanasia of sick and debilitated cats. However, management of colonies is not a mandated practice, nor is ongoing monitoring and follow-up care once released after the neuter-spay. Vaccinations, medical examination, care, or treatments may or may not be a part of any given TNR effort.
*Fighting may decline, thus reducing injuries: A study between four colonies, two of neutered males and two of intact males, found that the frequency of agonistic behavior was lower in the neutered groups. However, the agonistic behavior that was noted in the neutered groups was attributable to interactions involving intact males who had moved into them. As noted above, introgression of cats is a common factor noted in studies.

Not all free-roaming cats, or cats that end up in live traps, are feral. Some are owned, but have been allowed to roam outdoors; some have escaped their homes or owners and are strays; some may have been abandoned or &quot;dumped.&quot; The assessment, after trapping, of &quot;social&quot; (friendly and adoptable), &quot;social but timid or scared&quot; (may adjust and be adoptable), &quot;not social&quot; (not feral, prefers to not be handled, hard to adopt out) or &quot;feral&quot; is crucial if TNR is intended to be in the best interest of the animal. When programs provide for feral kittens to be socialized and adopted, and for friendly cats to be adopted, the welfare of those cats is improved.

Managed TNR programs that involve continuous active intervention on detection along with treatment and prevention of some of the more common diseases and parasites may help improve their overall health.

The overall effect of TNR on the health and welfare of free-roaming cats as a whole is not possible to measure. In numerous studies, many of the cats simply disappeared, so follow-up was impossible. They are subject to injury, illness, or death from numerous things: trauma from humans or human machines or other animals, predation by wildlife, toxins and poisons, contagious diseases, exposure to harsh weather, malnutrition, infections, and parasitic debilitation.

The TNR process itself can result in inhumane outcomes. In 2016, investigative reporting by WFLA found that in Hillsborough County, Florida, TNR cats were being returned to the outdoors the day after their surgical sterilizations, because the Tampa Bay Humane Society did not have &quot;a place to put them for a couple of days&quot; where they could be observed in recuperation. WFLA said they had possession of images of TNR cats bleeding from opened surgical wounds, images of TNR cat with maggots in their incisions, and an image of a bloodied cat trap whose occupant had bled out; the TV station&#x27;s managers declined to allow these images to be broadcast. Officials overseeing that TNR program said that their greatly reduced shelter euthanasia rates were worth it even if their TNR outcomes &quot;weren&#x27;t perfect&quot;.

===Fewer complaints===
TNR may help reduce public complaints pertaining to free-roaming cats. Female cats will &#x27;call&#x27; (come into season and be receptive to the male cat) regularly, about every three weeks during sexually active times of the year if they do not get pregnant. Having un-spayed female cats in an area will attract un-neutered males with the attendant problems of spraying, fighting and caterwauling.

* After starting a TNR program in 1995, animal control in Orange County, Florida, received fewer complaints about cats, even after broadening the definition of a nuisance complaint. 
* A study of a TNR program at Texas A&amp;M University in 1998–2000 reported that the number of cat complaints received by the university&#x27;s pest control service decreased from year 1 to year 2.

=== Effects on wildlife from hunting ===

Free-roaming domestic cats are considered an invasive species around the world.

Numerous studies have shown that free-roaming cats can have a significant negative impact on native wildlife through their predation. They cause considerable wildlife destruction and ecosystem disruption, including the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. They have been linked to the extinction of 63 species and pose a threat to 360 more.

Cats are now thought to be the single largest cause of anthropogenic bird mortality in North America.

There have been recorded instances of species extinction caused by them on islands. In 2004, targeted eradication programs had successfully removed free-roaming domestic cats from at least 48 islands. According to a PLoS One paper published in 2019, evidence of species recovery has been observed post-eradication of feral cats and rats from islands. It was noted by the authors that &quot;more than 1,200 invasive mammal eradications have been attempted on islands worldwide, with an average success rate of 85%&quot;.

Free-roaming cats have been documented hunting and killing prey without eating it.

=== Risks to human and animal health ===
Stray animals in general may have significant impacts on public health due to factors such as a lack of preventive measures (e.g. vaccines, deworming), easy access to intermediate hosts (e.g. rats and birds), and unrestricted entry to public areas such as parks and playgrounds. Their presence is a major risk for the transmission of zoonotic diseases.

Free-roaming cats can act as vectors for diseases that can impact humans as well as other animals, domestic and wild. Transmissions can occur within the species and to other species. Feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, ectoparasites (fleas, mites, lice, ticks), intestinal and protozoan parasites, &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, &quot;and Coxiella (&quot;Q Fever&quot;)&quot; are examples of inter and intra-species shared diseases and parasites.

There are numerous zoonotic pathogens shed in feline feces, such as &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp; ascarids (e.g., &quot;Toxocara cati&quot;); hookworms (&quot;Ancylostoma&quot; spp); and the protozoan parasites &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; spp, &quot;Giardia&quot; spp, and &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Contaminated soil is an important source of infection for humans, herbivores, rodents, and birds and several studies suggest that pet feces contribute to bacterial loading of streams and coastal waters.

Free-roaming cat populations have been identified as a source for several zoonotic diseases that can and have affected humans, including:

* Rabies
* Toxoplasmosis 
* Various nematode parasites including intestinal worms
* Plague
* Tularemia
* Typhus
* Bacterial diseases such as cat-scratch fever (&quot;Bartonella&quot;)
* Avian Influenza A/H5N1 virus
* Fungal diseases, including sporotrichosis

== Treatment by country ==
Domestic cats can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Of the 700million cats in the world, 480million of them are feral. Control of free-roaming dogs and cats is a worldwide problem. Beyond pragmatic and scientific considerations, cultural heritage, ethical beliefs, and social and economic impacts play critical roles in efforts to address it.

The legal status of free-roaming and stray cats varies from location to location, as do the histories and efforts of TNR programs. There are numerous governments supporting trap–neuter–return.

=== Australia ===

, the only place in Australia where TNR is legal is in the Australian Capital Territory, as Australian laws make the release of invasive species illegal in the rest of the country. TNR programs are active in feral cat communities across Canberra. In 2021, the Parliament of Australia issued a report that rejected TNR as an effective means of controlling feral cat populations; however, Australian animal welfare groups generally support it.

===Canada===
Across Canada, municipalities have replaced old animal control bylaws with &quot;responsible pet ownership&quot; rules intended to direct the obligations of pet behavior to their owners. A common feature of the accelerating trend is a requirement that owners get a license for their cats and ensure they do not roam.

In January 2012, a bylaw officer in Merritt, British Columbia, removed cat food and asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to consider criminal charges against those feeding the stray cats. No charges were laid, but the rescue group&#x27;s business license was revoked and it was forced to move from its storefront location.

The City of Toronto, Ontario, includes TNR in its animal services and has a bylaw specifically addressing TNR and managed colonies. The Toronto Animal Services offers spay and neuter for colonies that are registered and have an assigned trained caretaker.

===Denmark===
TNR was practiced in Denmark in the mid-1970s, as reported at the 1980 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) symposium in London. Denmark&#x27;s Society for the Protection of Cats practiced both tattooing and tipping the ear of the neutered cats to identify them.

===France===
In 1978, the city of Paris issued a Declaration of Rights of the Free-living Cat. In that year, Cambazard founded École du Chat and TNR&#x27;d its first cat, continuing to help thousands of cats in the following years.

===Israel===
Like Turkey, Israel struggles with a continually increasing population of stray cats. Cats exist in every location with people, from the southernmost city of Eilat to communities in the Golan Heights. Moreover, it is illegal in Israel to remove cats from the streets as a result of pressure from Let the Animals Live. Due to large amounts of food left by people feeding them, colonies of cats are continuing to increase, with estimates putting the population within the city of Jerusalem at 2,000 cats per square kilometer. Efforts to trap, neuter, return the cats within Israel are not working, as the population is too large to feasibly catch enough cats to make a difference. Moreover, there is no national agreement on what to do regarding the cat population. As a result their population is increasing with no future plan of action. In January 2019, from a push by people who feed the cats, Jerusalem planned to instill &quot;feeding stations&quot; throughout the city. The goal was to facilitate specific areas for feeding to help the populations of stray cats and to improve their welfare. This plan was criticized by ecologists and conservationists, stating that it does nothing to help the welfare of the cats, with Amir Balaban of the Society for the Protection of Nature stating that &quot;If someone cares about animals, they should take them home.&quot;

===Italy===
Killing feral cats has been illegal in the Lazio Region, which includes Rome, since 1988. A study in 2006 found almost 8,000 were neutered and reintroduced to their original colony from 1991 to 2000. It concluded that spay/neuter campaigns brought about a general decrease in cat numbers among registered colonies and censused cats, but the percentage of cat immigration (due to abandonment and spontaneous arrival) was around 21 percent. It suggested that TNR efforts without an effective education of people to control the reproduction of house cats (as a prevention for abandonment) are a waste of money, time and energy.

Since August 1991, feral cats have been protected throughout Italy when a no-kill policy was introduced for both cats and dogs. Feral cats have the right to live free and cannot be permanently removed from their colony; cat caretakers can be formally registered; and TNR methods are outlined in the national law on the management of pets.

=== New Zealand ===
The Department of Conservation (DOC) is legislatively mandated to control feral cats on public conservation land. It has eradicated feral cats from several offshore islands. Control techniques include poisoning, trapping and shooting. Lethal controls follow efficient and humane best-practice techniques and adhere to the Animal Welfare Act 1999.

The Department of Conservation does not support TNR: &quot;We don&#x27;t support the &#x27;trap, desex, release&#x27; approach to managing stray cats. This is because cats are predatory animals that continue to pose a threat to wildlife.&quot;

===South Korea===
Negative attitudes towards cats in general and free-roaming cats in particular are culturally entrenched in South Korea. The 2011 South Korean amendment of its Animal Protection Law required humane methods to be used in the transportation and euthanasia of animals. Some areas have government supported TNR programs, but these programs are often scorned by the public and poorly managed. Negative attitudes and fear towards cats in general have been slow to change and free-roaming cats may be subjected to abuse or violence. In recent years, however, South Korea&#x27;s attitude toward feral cats has improved.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey has a significant problem with free-roaming dogs and cats and the country is struggling with ways to manage the problem. Its Animal Protection Law prohibits killing &quot;ownerless animals&quot; except where permitted by the Animal Health Police Law. They are required to be taken to animal shelters established or permitted by the local authorities. In keeping with the tenents of its main religion, most Turks are very much against euthanasia of animals for &quot;population control&quot;; recent efforts to curb an ever-increasing population include TNR for roaming cats and dogs.

===United Kingdom===
The earliest documented practice of trap–neuter–return was in the 1950s, led by animal activist Ruth Plant in the UK. In the mid-1960s, former model Celia Hammond gained publicity for her TNR work &quot;at a time when euthanasia of feral cats was considered the only option&quot;. Hammond &quot;fought many battles with local authorities, hospitals, environmental health departments&quot; but stated that she succeeded over the years in showing that control &quot;could be achieved by neutering and not killing&quot;.

The first scientific conference on &quot;the ecology and control of feral cats&quot; was held in London in 1980 and its proceedings published by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW). Subsequent UFAW publications in 1982, 1990, and 1995 were the primary scientific references for feral-cat control for many years.

In 2008, the Scottish Wildcat Association began utilizing TNR of feral cats to protect the regionally endangered Scottish wildcat.

===United States===
There is no federal law in the US that explicitly sets policy on feral cats, and state and local laws vary in their approaches. The Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act may be relevant to the legality of TNR. In a federal case, &quot;American Bird Conservancy v. Harvey&quot; (2014), conservationists sued Rose Harvey, the Commissioner of New York State Parks, under the Endangered Species Act for failing to prohibit activities supporting feral cats in a state park where the Piping Plover, a threatened species, was known to nest. Under a settlement and judicial order, the State of New York agreed to remove all of the cats to a shelter, and to trap and permanently remove any cats found in the park in the future.

There are legal theories that TNR programs may have liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, a strict liability statute that states that &quot;it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill[...] any migratory bird, any part, nest, or egg of any such bird,&quot; including unintentional taking, except if otherwise regulated or permitted by the government, and provides for criminal penalties of up to $15,000 in fines and up to six months of incarceration for each bird unlawfully taken. (An example of a successful prosecution under the MBTA was &quot;United States v. Moon Lake Electric Association Incorporated&quot;; in that case a power company was found guilty and sentenced to fines and probation because birds were being electrocuted on power poles that it owned.) Because TNR colonies are supported by people, it is possible that predation of birds by TNR cats might be ruled an illegal intentional take by the courts.

On January 29, 2019, the Hawaii Invasive Species Council adopted a resolution supporting the keeping of pet cats indoors and the use of peer-reviewed science in pursuing humane mitigation of the impacts of feral cats on wildlife and people.

TNR of cats is illegal in Alaska, owing to a law against the release of cats into the wild, even if they were originally captured there. This has left trap-and-kill the only legal method of controlling the feral cat population there; however, the law against TNR is not well enforced and there are proposals to exempt sterilized cats from the rules.

Governments have been sued to try to block their TNR efforts. In December 2010, an injunction was granted to prevent a planned TNR program of the City of Los Angeles until an environmental review was completed under the California Environmental Quality Act. The judge did not rule on any environmental issues, or prohibit other organizations from doing TNR in the city.

<doc id="586559" wikidata="Q1072391" url="?curid=586559" title="Plymouth Rock">
<text>Plymouth Rock is the historical disembarkation site of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in December 1620. 

The Pilgrims did not refer to Plymouth Rock in any of their writings; the first known written reference to the rock dates from 1715 when it was described in the town boundary records as &quot;a great rock&quot;. 

The first documented claim of Plymouth Rock as the landing place of the Pilgrims was made by 94-year-old Thomas Faunce in 1741, 121 years after the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth.

In 1774, the rock broke in half during an attempt to haul it to Town Square in Plymouth. One portion remained in Town Square and was moved to Pilgrim Hall Museum in 1834. It was rejoined with the other portion of the rock, which was still at its original site on the shore of Plymouth Harbor, in 1880. The date 1620 was inscribed at that time. The rock is now ensconced beneath a granite canopy. However, Plymouth Rock has been moved multiple times since 1620. According to Donna D. Curtin, Executive Director of the Pilgrim Hall Museum, the rock has &quot;unquestionably&quot; been relocated several times, including its complete excavation and latest relocation onto the shoreline in 1920. This fact complicates the perception that it remains in its original location, as it has been moved and altered multiple times over the centuries.

==History==
===Early identification===
The two most significant primary sources on the founding of Plymouth Colony are Edward Winslow&#x27;s 1622 &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; and William Bradford&#x27;s 1630–1651 history &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot;, and neither refers to Plymouth Rock. The rock first attracted public attention in 1741 when the residents of Plymouth began plans to build a wharf which would bury it. Before construction began, a 94-year-old church elder named Thomas Faunce declared that the boulder was the landing place of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims. 

However, modern scholarship has cast doubt on the rock’s significance as a landing site, particularly because it has been moved numerous times since 1620. Donna D. Curtin, Executive Director of the Pilgrim Hall Museum, stated that the rock has &quot;unquestionably&quot; been moved multiple times. This includes being raised from its original location due to the construction of a wharf, and its later excavation and relocation onto the shoreline in 1920, indicating that the rock&#x27;s location has changed significantly over time.

Meanwhile Faunce asked to be brought to the rock to say a farewell. According to Plymouth historian James Thacher:

Faunce&#x27;s father had arrived in the colony aboard the ship &quot;Anne&quot; in 1623, just three years after the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landing, and Elder Faunce was born in 1647, when many of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims were still living, so his assertion made a strong impression on the people of Plymouth. The wharf was built but the rock left intact, the top portion protruding from the dirt so as to be visible to curious visitors.

More recent generations have questioned Faunce&#x27;s assertion, alleging that he invented the story or did not have the correct facts, given that he was not an eyewitness to the event. Journalist Bill Bryson, for example, wrote, &quot;The one thing the Pilgrims certainly did not do was step ashore on Plymouth Rock&quot;, arguing that the boulder would have made an impractical landing spot. Others have pointed out that the Pilgrims landed at Provincetown to explore Cape Cod more than a month before they arrived in Plymouth harbor, which lessens the significance of where they set foot in Plymouth. In 1851, a group of Cape Cod residents formed the Cape Cod Association for the purpose of promoting Provincetown as the site of the original Pilgrim landing. Such efforts eventually led to the construction of the Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown, which was completed in 1910.

===Movements===
Col. Theophilus Cotton (son of Plymouth magistrate Josiah Cotton) and the townspeople of Plymouth decided to move the rock in 1774. It split in two, however, so the bottom portion was left behind at the wharf and the top portion was relocated to the town&#x27;s meeting house.

Captain William Coit wrote in &quot;The Pennsylvania Journal&quot; of November 29, 1775 that he brought captive British sailors ashore &quot;upon the same rock our ancestors first trod&quot;.

A large portion of the rock was relocated from Plymouth&#x27;s meetinghouse to Pilgrim Hall in 1834. In 1859, the Pilgrim Society began building a Victorian canopy designed by Hammett Billings at the wharf over the portion of the rock left there, which was completed in 1867. The Pilgrim Hall section of the rock was moved back to its original wharf location in 1880, rejoined to the remaining portion, and the date &quot;1620&quot; was carved into it.

In 1920, the rock was temporarily relocated so that the old wharves could be removed and the waterfront landscaped to a design by architect Arthur Shurcliff, with a waterfront promenade behind a low seawall in such a way that, when the rock was returned to its original site, it would be at water level. The care of the rock was turned over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and a new Roman Doric portico was constructed, designed by McKim, Mead and White for viewing the tide-washed rock protected by gratings.

During the rock&#x27;s many journeys throughout the town of Plymouth, numerous pieces were taken and sold. Today approximately a third remains. It is estimated that the original Rock weighed . Some documents indicate that tourists or souvenir hunters chipped it down, although no pieces have been noticeably removed since 1880. Today there are pieces in Pilgrim Hall Museum and in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

A piece of the Rock is set on a pedestal in the cloister of historic Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights, New York. The church was formed by a merger of Plymouth Church and Church of the Pilgrims and was originally pastored by Henry Ward Beecher, brother of author Harriet Beecher Stowe.

In 1835, French author Alexis de Tocqueville wrote:

===State park attraction===
Today, Plymouth Rock is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of Pilgrim Memorial State Park. From April through November, Pilgrim Memorial is staffed by guides who inform visitors of the story of Plymouth Rock.

While the rock is currently situated beneath a granite canopy at Pilgrim Memorial State Park, it has been moved several times since the 18th century. Experts such as Donna D. Curtin of the Pilgrim Hall Museum and Dr. Simon Engelhart of Durham University&#x27;s Department of Geography confirm that Plymouth Rock has been relocated multiple times, with its current location differing from its original position in 1620. This movement highlights the evolving narrative and physical journey of this historical symbol.

<text>Sharon Carstairs (born April 26, 1942) is a Canadian politician and former Senator.

==Early life==
Carstairs was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of former Nova Scotia Premier and federal Senator Harold Connolly and his wife Vivian. She was educated at Dalhousie University, Smith College, Georgetown University, and the University of Calgary.

==Alberta politics==
She later moved to Western Canada, and was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Calgary-Elbow in the 1975 Alberta provincial election. She served as President of the Alberta Liberal Party between 1975 and 1977, and was on the national executive of the Liberal Party of Canada in the same period.

==Manitoba Liberal leader==
Carstairs became leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1984, at a time when the party held no seats in the legislature. She came second to Progressive Conservative candidate Charlie Birt in a 1984 by-election in the south Winnipeg electoral district of Fort Garry, but was elected for the central Winnipeg district of River Heights in the 1986 provincial election, defeating incumbent Tory Warren Steen. For the next two years, she was the only Liberal in the legislature.

Carstairs led the Liberal Party to a dramatic resurgence in the 1988 provincial election, which saw the New Democratic Party of Manitoba under Howard Pawley reduced from government to third party status, and the election of a Progressive Conservative minority government under Gary Filmon. Carstairs&#x27; Liberals won 20 of 57 seats for their best showing since 1953, largely by drawing many centre-left voters from the NDP. Carstairs became leader of the opposition, the first woman to hold such a position in any Canadian legislature.

Having led the party out of almost 20 years in the political wilderness, it initially seemed that Carstairs had a strong opportunity to lead the Liberals to victory in the following election. Had she done so, she would have become the first woman elected in her own right as a provincial premier in Canada. The 1990 election, however, saw the Tories returned with a majority government and a resurgent NDP under Gary Doer regain official opposition status. The Liberals were reduced to only seven seats. Many Liberals felt Carstairs had squandered their best chance in three decades to form government.

A strong opponent of the Meech Lake Accord, Carstairs remained party leader and, in 1992, campaigned for the &quot;No&quot; side on the Charlottetown Accord, with financial assistance from former party leader Israel Asper. Her efforts were opposed by others in the Liberal Party, and she frequently argued with Lloyd Axworthy on constitutional matters. Carstairs resigned as party leader in 1993 and was succeeded by MLA Paul Edwards. The party has continued to decline since her departure, and has never come anywhere near as close to winning government as it did in 1988; it has only briefly held official party status for slightly more than a year in 2018–19 since.

In 1993, Carstairs published an autobiography entitled &quot;Not One of the Boys&quot;.

==Senate==
On September 15, 1994, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn appointed Carstairs to the Senate of Canada. Carstairs had supported Chrétien&#x27;s campaign to become party leader in 1990.

She held the position of Leader of the Government in the Senate from January 2001 to December 2003, and also served as Minister with Special Responsibility for Palliative Care in Chretien&#x27;s cabinet. She did not serve in the cabinet of Chretien&#x27;s successor, Paul Martin, when he took office in December 2003.

From April 2006 until December 2009, Carstairs continued her earlier work in cabinet by serving as chairperson of the Special Committee on Aging which issued a report that helped get palliative care added to the core curriculum in Canadian medical schools. She also helped create the Canadian Virtual Hospice, a website with information on palliative care.

==Retirement==
In October 2011, Carstairs announced she was resigning from the Senate to return to private life; she was then 69 years old, five and a half years shy of the mandatory retirement age of 75.

In retirement, she and her husband intended to remain in Ottawa to be close to their children. Carstairs became chair of the 
board for a network centre of excellence on caring for the frail elderly, pending the approval of a grant from the federal government.

In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated her expenses that she had submitted to the Senate as part of the Canadian Senate expenses scandal but did not lay charges.

==Honours and awards==
On June 30, 2016, Carstairs was made a Member of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for &quot;her public service and her work as a champion of palliative care.&quot;

<doc id="586567" wikidata="Q193260" url="?curid=586567" title="Yucatán Channel">
<text>The Yucatán Channel or Straits of Yucatán (Spanish: &quot;Canal de Yucatán&quot;) is a strait between Mexico and Cuba. It connects the Yucatán Basin of the Caribbean Sea with the Gulf of Mexico. It is just over wide and nearly deep at its deepest point near the coast of Cuba.

==Currents==
The Yucatán Channel separates Cuba from the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and links the Caribbean Sea with the Gulf of Mexico. The strait is across between Cape Catoche in Mexico and Cape San Antonio in Cuba. It has a maximum depth near the Cuban coast of . Water flows through the Caribbean Sea from east to west. This flow consists of 5 Sv of water from the North Equatorial Current flowing through the Windward Passage and 12 Sv of water from the South Equatorial Current which flows along the coast of Brazil. The total flow is about 17 Sv at a temperature of at least . When this water flows past the Yucatán Peninsula it becomes the Yucatán Current. This current provides most of the inflow of water into the Gulf of Mexico as the amount of water entering by the Straits of Florida is small and intermittent. The Yucatán Current flows strongly on the western side of the channel while the Cuban Countercurrent flows in the opposite direction on the easterly side of the channel. Underneath the Yucatán Current there is a southward-flowing Yucatán Undercurrent which takes water away from the Gulf of Mexico.

==Coral reefs==
As the water flowing through the Yucatán Channel enters the Gulf of Mexico, it passes over the Campeche Bank, a shallow area of sea. Here, there are coral reefs on the outer fringes of the Yucatán shelf about offshore. The main reef-building corals here are &quot;Acropora cervicornis&quot;, &quot;Acropora palmata&quot;, and &quot;Montastraea annularis&quot;, and in the late 1990s many of these died. Some recolonisation has since taken place. The Campeche Bank is a biodiverse area, and this and other parts of the Yucatán Channel are heavily fished by artisan fishermen who converge on the area from along the coast of Mexico. The area is threatened by overexploitation.

<doc id="586571" wikidata="Q1935759" url="?curid=586571" title="Wildflowers (Tom Petty album)">
<text>Wildflowers is the second solo studio album by American musician Tom Petty, released on November 1, 1994, by Warner Bros. Records. It was the first album released by Petty after signing a contract with Warner Bros., where he had recorded as part of the Traveling Wilburys. It was the first of three of his albums produced with Rick Rubin. &quot;Wildflowers&quot; was very well-received by critics upon release and was certified 3× platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2020, &quot;Wildflowers&quot; was ranked at number 214 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Production ==
&quot;Wildflowers&quot; was credited only to Petty and not to his usual band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers because, in Petty&#x27;s words, &quot;Rick [Rubin] and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.&quot; Nonetheless, the Heartbreakers predominantly served as the musicians on the album. The album features all the band&#x27;s members with the exception of drummer Stan Lynch. Petty auditioned numerous drummers for the album, and eventually chose Steve Ferrone. Petty fired Lynch from the Heartbreakers just before the album&#x27;s release, and Ferrone officially joined the touring band the following year, and later became a full band member. (Lynch did play on one outtake from &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, &quot;Something Could Happen&quot;).

Petty wrote and recorded numerous songs for the album, and the original plan was to have &quot;Wildflowers&quot; be a double album, with 25 songs in total. However, Lenny Waronker of Warner Bros. Records felt that the album was too long, and it was decided to reduce the album to 15 tracks. Of the 10 tracks left out, one, &quot;Leave Virginia Alone&quot;, notably became a hit single the following year when it was recorded by Rod Stewart, while another four were included, in modified form, in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; next album, the soundtrack album to the 1996 film &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;. All ten songs, in their original form, were later released in the 2020 edition of &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, &quot;Wildflowers &amp; All the Rest&quot;.

===Outtakes===
*&quot;Girl on LSD&quot; was released as the B-side of the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know How It Feels&quot; single (1994).
*&quot;Leave Virginia Alone&quot; was another song written and recorded during the sessions and left off the finished album. It was given to Rod Stewart for his album &quot;A Spanner in the Works&quot; (1995).
*The songs &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Hope You Never&quot;, &quot;Hung Up and Overdue&quot;, and &quot;Climb That Hill&quot; were all included on the &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; soundtrack album (1996), with various edits across the first three tracks, while &quot;Climb That Hill&quot; was a complete remake.
* In 2018, outtake &quot;Lonesome Dave,&quot; recorded July 23, 1993, was released on Petty&#x27;s posthumous box set &quot;An American Treasure&quot;.
* In 2021, a cover of J.J. Cale&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen Days,&quot; recorded July 22, 1993, was released on the reimagined version of &quot;&quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; soundtrack album&quot;, &quot;Angel Dream&quot;.

== Release and reception ==
Reviewing &quot;Wildflowers&quot; for &quot;USA Today&quot;, Edna Gundersen wrote that, in contrast to the &quot;adolescent fantasies&quot; of fellow rockers such as Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones, Petty explored &quot;middle-age reality&quot; on an effective album of &quot;sweet-and-sour heartland rock&quot;. Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Wildflowers&quot; &quot;is not as sonically adventurous... or as instantly accessible&quot; as previous Petty albums such as &quot;Southern Accents&quot; (1985) and &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; (1989), but its &quot;resolute passion and maturity grow more evident with each listen until the album acquires a haunting, enduring resonance.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan remarked that &quot;misery suits Petty, and &quot;Wildflowers&quot; contains some of the best work of his career&quot;, while Emma Forrest commented in &quot;NME&quot; that &quot;an album that helps you sort your thoughts without interrupting them is just as significant as any furious paean to disgruntled youth.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot said that &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, with its &quot;subtle and painterly&quot; sound, showed Petty moving further into musical &quot;ambiguity&quot;, &quot;and the music seems newly freed, however subdued it may seem at first.&quot;

Although finding it inconsistent, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Chris Willman observed that &quot;Wildflowers&quot; &quot;has such an interesting, subtle kind of resonance you may not bemoan the lack of instant anthems.&quot; David Browne, however, opined in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Petty had failed to progress musically or lyrically, and music critic Robert Christgau felt that Petty sounded &quot;wilted&quot; and &quot;torpid&quot;.

Four singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful of which, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know How It Feels&quot;, reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for one week. It was followed by &quot;You Wreck Me&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be King&quot; and &quot;A Higher Place&quot; which reached Nos. 2, 6, and 12 respectively on the Mainstream Rock chart. The title track, while not released as a single, charted at #16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock Songs chart and at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Lyric Find. and became one of Petty&#x27;s most streamed and popular songs.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that &quot;Wildflowers&quot; is distinguished within Petty&#x27;s discography by &quot;its casual gait&quot; and extended length, allowing it to capture &quot;the full range of Tom Petty as a singer, songwriter, and rocker.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Sam Sodomsky said that it was Petty&#x27;s best solo album, characterized by its &quot;elegantly spare, personal, and intuitive&quot; songs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Wildflowers&quot; as the twelfth-best album of the 1990s, and later ranked the record at number 214 on its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed the album at number 49 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

In April 2015, when Petty&#x27;s back catalog was released in high-resolution audio, this was one of only two albums not included in the series (&quot;Songs and Music from &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;&quot; was the other one), but a hi-res version was available on Pono Music.

The title of the 2020 book &quot;Somewhere You Feel Free: Tom Petty and Los Angeles&quot; comes from a lyric in the album&#x27;s title song &quot;Wildflowers&quot;.

== &quot;Wildflowers &amp; All the Rest&quot; ==
Petty&#x27;s family and bandmates arranged a 2020 re-release of the album that includes deleted songs, demos, and live tracks, entitled &quot;Wildflowers &amp; All the Rest&quot;. Disc four, &quot;Wildflowers Live&quot;, consists of fourteen previously unreleased tracks, two of which had only been distributed to fan club members. These live tracks were recorded on various tours from 1995 to 2017. The super deluxe edition of the box set included a fifth disc of alternate versions of the &quot;Wildflowers&quot; tracks, called &quot;Finding Wildflowers&quot;. In April 2021, &quot;Finding Wildflowers&quot; was released individually.

== Documentary ==
The making of &quot;Wildflowers&quot; is the subject of the 2021 documentary film &quot;Tom Petty: Somewhere You Feel Free – The Making of Wildflowers&quot;, directed by Mary Wharton. The documentary includes a significant amount of archival footage from the recording sessions, recorded by Martyn Atkins, which had only recently been unearthed following Petty&#x27;s death; as well as new interviews with many of the producers and musicians who had been involved with the album. The film was released in November 2021 on YouTube.

<text>The 1968 UEFA European Football Championship final tournament was held in Italy. This was the third UEFA European Championship, an event held every four years and organised by UEFA. The final tournament took place between 5 and 10 June 1968.

It was in this year that the tournament changed its name from the &quot;European Nations&#x27; Cup&quot; to the &quot;European Championship&quot;. There were also some changes in the tournament&#x27;s qualifying structure, with the two-legged home-and-away knock-out stage being replaced by a group phase.

Four countries played in the final tournament, which consisted of the semi-finals, a third place play-off, and the final. The host nation for the finals was selected from the four qualified nations.

==Qualification==
The qualification competition was played in two stages: a group stage (taking place from 1966 until 1968) and the quarter-finals (played in 1968). There were seven groups of four teams and one of three, with matches played in a home-and-away basis. The eight group winners qualified for the quarter-finals, which were played in two legs, home and away. The winners of the quarter-finals went through to the final tournament.

As of 2024, this is the last European Championship finals not to feature a Germany team (united or West), and the only World Cup or European Championship tournament where the team was eliminated in the qualifying stages.

In all matches but the final, extra time and a coin toss were used to decide the winner if necessary. If the final remained level after extra time, a replay would be used to determine the winner.

<text>A Penning trap is a device for the storage of charged particles using a homogeneous magnetic field and a quadrupole electric field. It is mostly found in the physical sciences and related fields of study for precision measurements of properties of ions and stable subatomic particles, like for example mass, fission yields and isomeric yield ratios. One initial object of study was the so-called geonium atoms, which represent a way to measure the electron magnetic moment by storing a single electron. These traps have been used in the physical realization of quantum computation and quantum information processing by trapping qubits. Penning traps are in use in many laboratories worldwide, including CERN, to store and investigate anti-particles such as antiprotons. The main advantages of Penning traps are the potentially long storage times and the existence of a multitude of techniques to manipulate and non-destructively detect the stored particles. This makes Penning traps versatile for the investigation of stored particles, but also for their selection, preparation or mere storage.
==History==
The Penning trap was named after F. M. Penning (1894–1953) by Hans Georg Dehmelt (1922–2017) who built the first trap. Dehmelt got inspiration from the vacuum gauge built by F. M. Penning where a current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field is proportional to the pressure. Citing from H. Dehmelt&#x27;s autobiography: &quot;I began to focus on the magnetron/Penning discharge geometry, which, in the Penning ion gauge, had caught my interest already at Göttingen and at Duke. In their 1955 cyclotron resonance work on photoelectrons in vacuum Franken and Liebes had reported undesirable frequency shifts caused by accidental electron trapping. Their analysis made me realize that in a pure electric quadrupole field the shift would not depend on the location of the electron in the trap. This is an important advantage over many other traps that I decided to exploit. A magnetron trap of this type had been briefly discussed in J.R. Pierce&#x27;s 1949 book, and I developed a simple description of the axial, magnetron, and cyclotron motions of an electron in it. With the help of the expert glassblower of the Department, Jake Jonson, I built my first high vacuum magnetron trap in 1959 and was soon able to trap electrons for about 10 sec and to detect axial, magnetron and cyclotron resonances.&quot; – H. Dehmelt
H. Dehmelt shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for the development of the ion trap technique.

==Operation==
Penning traps use a strong homogeneous axial magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially. The static electric potential can be generated using a set of three electrodes: a ring and two endcaps. In an ideal Penning trap the ring and endcaps are hyperboloids of revolution. For trapping of positive (negative) ions, the endcap electrodes are kept at a positive (negative) potential relative to the ring. This potential produces a saddle point in the centre of the trap, which traps ions along the axial direction. The electric field causes ions to oscillate (harmonically in the case of an ideal Penning trap) along the trap axis. The magnetic field in combination with the electric field causes charged particles to move in the radial plane with a motion which traces out an epitrochoid.

The orbital motion of ions in the radial plane is composed of two modes at frequencies which are called the &quot;magnetron&quot; formula_1and the &quot;modified cyclotron&quot; formula_2 frequencies. These motions are similar to the deferent and epicycle, respectively, of the Ptolemaic model of the solar system.

The sum of these two frequencies is the &quot;cyclotron&quot; frequency, which depends only on the ratio of electric charge to mass and on the strength of the magnetic field. This frequency can be measured very accurately and can be used to measure the masses of charged particles. Many of the highest-precision mass measurements (masses of the electron, proton, 2H, 20Ne and 28Si) come from Penning traps.

Buffer gas cooling, resistive cooling, and laser cooling are techniques to remove energy from ions in a Penning trap. Buffer gas cooling relies on collisions between the ions and neutral gas molecules that bring the ion energy closer to the energy of the gas molecules. In resistive cooling, moving image charges in the electrodes are made to do work through an external resistor, effectively removing energy from the ions. Laser cooling can be used to remove energy from some kinds of ions in Penning traps. This technique requires ions with an appropriate electronic structure. Radiative cooling is the process by which the ions lose energy by creating electromagnetic waves by virtue of their acceleration in the magnetic field. This process dominates the cooling of electrons in Penning traps, but is very small and usually negligible for heavier particles.

Using the Penning trap can have advantages over the radio frequency trap (Paul trap). Firstly, in the Penning trap only static fields are applied and therefore there is no micro-motion and resultant heating of the ions due to the dynamic fields, even for extended 2- and 3-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals. Also, the Penning trap can be made larger whilst maintaining strong trapping. The trapped ion can then be held further away from the electrode surfaces. Interaction with patch potentials on the electrode surfaces can be responsible for heating and decoherence effects and these effects scale as a high power of the inverse distance between the ion and the electrode.

==Fourier-transform mass spectrometry==

Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (also known as Fourier-transform mass spectrometry) is a type of mass spectrometry used for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions are trapped in a Penning trap where they are excited to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field. The excitation also results in the ions moving in phase (in a packet). The signal is detected as an image current on a pair of plates which the packet of ions passes close to as they cyclotron. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (fid), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.

Single ions can be investigated in a Penning trap held at a temperature of 4 K. For this the ring electrode is segmented and opposite electrodes are connected to a superconducting coil and the source and the gate of a field-effect transistor. The coil and the parasitic capacitances of the circuit form a LC circuit with a Q of about 50 000. The LC circuit is excited by an external electric pulse. The segmented electrodes couple the motion of the single electron to the LC circuit. Thus the energy in the LC circuit in resonance with the ion slowly oscillates between the many electrons (10000) in the gate of the field effect transistor and the single electron. This can be detected in the signal at the drain of the field effect transistor.
==Geonium atom==
A geonium atom is a pseudo-atomic system that consists of a single electron or ion stored in a Penning trap which is &#x27;bound&#x27; to the remaining Earth, hence the term &#x27;geonium&#x27;. The name was coined by H.G. Dehmelt.

In the typical case, the trapped system consists of only one particle or ion. Such a quantum system is determined by quantum states of one particle, like in the hydrogen atom. Hydrogen consists of two particles, the nucleus and electron, but the electron motion relative to the nucleus is equivalent to one particle in an external field, see center-of-mass frame.

The properties of geonium are different from a typical atom. The charge undergoes cyclotron motion around the trap axis and oscillates along the axis. An inhomogeneous magnetic &quot;bottle field&quot; is applied to measure the quantum properties by the &quot;continuous Stern-Gerlach&quot; technique. Energy levels and g-factor of the particle can be measured with high precision. Van Dyck, &quot;et al.&quot; explored the magnetic splitting of geonium spectra in 1978 and in 1987 published high-precision measurements of electron and positron g-factors, which constrained the electron radius.

==Single particle==
In November 2017, an international team of scientists isolated a single proton in a Penning trap in order to measure its magnetic moment to the highest precision to date. It was found to be . The CODATA 2018 value matches this.

<text>Matra BAe Dynamics was an Anglo-French 50/50 joint venture formed in August 1996 through a merger between half the missile business of France&#x27;s Matra Hautes Technologies (the aerospace, defence and telecommunications division of the Matra conglomerate) and the missile activities of the UK&#x27;s BAe Dynamics (a division of British Aerospace). During its 5 years of existence, it was Europe`s largest guided weapons company and the third largest in the world.

British Aerospace had previously sought to merge its missile business with that of France&#x27;s Thomson-CSF (now Thales Group). The companies announced their plan to create a new combined company called Eurodynamics in 1989. However, after more than a year of monopoly investigations, the deal collapsed. The formation of Matra BAe Dynamics was followed in 1997 by the acquisition of a 30% share in LFK.

In 1999, the other half of Matra Hautes Technologies&#x27; missile business (Matra Missiles) combined with the missile systems division of the French corporation Aérospatiale to form Aérospatiale Matra Missiles following the merger between Aérospatiale and Matra Hautes Technologies. This new giant, Aérospatiale-Matra, also gained ownership of Matra&#x27;s 50% share in Matra BAe Dynamics as a result of the merger.

Matra BAe Dynamics ultimately merged with Aérospatiale Matra Missiles and the missile activities of Alenia Marconi Systems to form MBDA in December 2001.

<doc id="586610" wikidata="Q4847219" url="?curid=586610" title="Downburst">
<text>In meteorology, a downburst is a strong downward and outward gushing wind system that emanates from a point source above and blows radially, that is, in straight lines in all directions from the area of impact at surface level. It originates under deep, moist convective conditions like cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus. Capable of producing damaging winds, it may sometimes be confused with a tornado, where high-velocity winds circle a central area, and air moves inward and upward. These usually last for seconds to minutes. Downbursts are particularly strong downdrafts within thunderstorms (or deep, moist convection as sometimes downbursts emanate from cumulonimbus or even cumulus congestus clouds that are not producing lightning).
Downbursts are most often created by an area of significantly precipitation-cooled air that, after reaching the surface (subsiding), spreads out in all directions producing strong winds. 

Dry downbursts are associated with thunderstorms that exhibit very little rain, while wet downbursts are created by thunderstorms with significant amounts of precipitation. Microbursts and macrobursts are downbursts at very small and larger scales, respectively. A rare variety of dry downburst, the &quot;heat burst&quot;, is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and squall lines where rainfall is lacking. Heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation and compressional heating during descent. 

Downbursts are a topic of notable discussion in aviation, since they create vertical wind shear, which has the potential to be dangerous to aviation, especially during landing (or takeoff), where airspeed performance windows are the most narrow. Several fatal and historic crashes in past decades are attributed to the phenomenon and flight crew training goes to great lengths on how to properly recognize and recover from a downburst/wind shear event; wind shear recovery, among other adverse weather events, are standard topics across the world in flight simulator training that flight crews receive and must successfully complete. Detection and nowcasting technology was also implemented in much of the world and particularly around major airports, which in many cases actually have wind shear detection equipment on the field. This detection equipment helps air traffic controllers and pilots make decisions on the safety and feasibility of operating on or in the vicinity of the airport during storms.

==Definition==

A downburst is created by a column of sinking air that after hitting the surface spreads out in all directions and is capable of producing straight-line winds of over , often producing damage similar to, but distinguishable from, that caused by tornadoes. Downburst damage radiates from a central point as the descending column spreads out when hitting the surface, whereas tornado damage tends towards convergent damage consistent with rotating winds. To differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst, the term straight-line winds is applied to damage from microbursts.

Downbursts in air that is precipitation free or contains virga are known as dry downbursts; those accompanied with precipitation are known as wet downbursts. These generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface, but they perhaps also could be powered by strong winds aloft being deflected toward the surface by dynamical processes in a thunderstorm (see rear flank downdraft). Most downbursts are less than in extent: these are called microbursts. Downbursts larger than in extent are sometimes called macrobursts. Downbursts can occur over large areas. In the extreme case, a series of continuing downbursts results in a derecho, which covers huge areas of more than wide and over long, persisting for 12 hours or more, and which is associated with some of the most intense straight-line winds.

The term microburst was defined by mesoscale meteorology expert Ted Fujita as affecting an area in diameter or less, distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas. Fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than .

=== Dry microbursts ===

When rain falls below the cloud base or is mixed with dry air, it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air. The denser cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the surface. When the cool air approaches the surface, it spreads out in all directions. High winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as straight-line winds.

Dry microbursts are typically produced by high based thunderstorms that contain little to no surface rainfall. They occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-V at thermal and moisture profile, as viewed on a Skew-T log-P thermodynamic diagram. Wakimoto (1985) developed a conceptual model (over the High Plains of the United States) of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables: mid-level moisture, cloud base in the mid troposphere, and low surface relative humidity. These conditions evaporate the moisture from the air as it falls, cooling the air and making it fall faster because it is more dense.
=== Wet microbursts ===

Wet microbursts are downbursts accompanied by significant precipitation at the surface. These downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of parcels as well as the negative buoyancy which tend to drive &quot;dry&quot; microbursts. As a result, higher mixing ratios are necessary for these downbursts to form (hence the name &quot;wet&quot; microbursts). Melting of ice, particularly hail, appears to play an important role in downburst formation (Wakimoto and Bringi, 1988), especially in the lowest above surface level (Proctor, 1989). These factors, among others, make forecasting wet microbursts difficult.

===Straight-line winds=== 

Straight-line winds (also known as plough winds, thundergusts, and hurricanes of the prairie) are very strong winds that can produce damage, demonstrating a lack of the rotational damage pattern associated with tornadoes. Straight-line winds are common with the gust front of a thunderstorm or originate with a downburst from a thunderstorm. These events can cause considerable damage, even in the absence of a tornado. The winds can gust to and winds of or more can last for more than twenty minutes. In the United States, such straight-line wind events are most common during the spring when instability is highest and weather fronts routinely cross the country. Straight-line wind events in the form of derechos can take place throughout the eastern half of the U.S.

Straight-line winds may be damaging to marine interests. Small ships, cutters and sailboats are at risk from this meteorological phenomenon.

==Formation==
The formation of a downburst starts with hail or large raindrops falling through drier air. Hailstones melt and raindrops evaporate, pulling latent heat from surrounding air and cooling it considerably. Cooler air has a higher density than the warmer air around it, so it sinks to the surface. As the cold air hits the ground or water it spreads out and a mesoscale front can be observed as a gust front. Areas under and immediately adjacent to the downburst receive the highest winds and rainfall, if any is present. Also, because the rain-cooled air is descending from the middle troposphere, a significant drop in temperatures is noticed. Due to interaction with the surface, the downburst quickly loses strength as it fans out and forms the distinctive &quot;curl shape&quot; that is commonly seen at the periphery of the microburst (see image). Downbursts usually last only a few minutes and then dissipate, except in the case of squall lines and derecho events. However, despite their short lifespan, microbursts are a serious hazard to aviation and property and can result in substantial damage to the area.

Downbursts go through three stages in their cycle: the downburst, outburst, and cushion stages.

== Development stages of microbursts ==
The evolution of microbursts is broken down into three stages: the contact stage, the outburst stage, and the cushion stage:
* A downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base. The downdraft accelerates, and within minutes reaches the surface (contact stage).
* During the outburst stage, the wind &quot;curls&quot; as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the surface.
* During the cushion stage, winds about the curl continue to accelerate, while the winds at the surface slow due to friction.
On a weather radar Doppler display, a downburst is seen as a couplet of radial winds in the outburst and cushion stages. The rightmost image shows such a display from the ARMOR Doppler Weather Radar in Huntsville, Alabama, in 2012. The radar is on the right side of the image and the downburst is along the line separating the velocity towards the radar (green), and the one moving away (red).

== Physical processes of dry and wet microbursts ==
=== Basic physical processes using simplified buoyancy equations ===
Start by using the vertical momentum equation:

formula_1

By decomposing the variables into a basic state and a perturbation, defining the basic states, and using the ideal gas law (formula_2), then the equation can be written in the form

formula_3

where B is buoyancy. The virtual temperature correction usually is rather small and to a good approximation; it can be ignored when computing buoyancy. Finally, the effects of precipitation loading on the vertical motion are parametrized by including a term that decreases buoyancy as the liquid water mixing ratio (formula_4) increases, leading to the final form of the parcel&#x27;s momentum equation:

formula_5

The first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion. In some storms this term has a large effect on updrafts (Rotunno and Klemp, 1982) but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on downdrafts (at least to a first approximation) and therefore will be ignored.

The second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion. Clearly, in the case of microbursts, one expects to find that B is negative, meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment. This cooling typically takes place as a result of phase changes (evaporation, melting, and sublimation). Precipitation particles that are small, but are in great quantity, promote a maximum contribution to cooling and, hence, to creation of negative buoyancy. The major contribution to this process is from evaporation.

The last term is the effect of water loading. Whereas evaporation is promoted by large numbers of small droplets, it only requires a few large drops to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels. This term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates. Comparing the effects of water loading to those associated with buoyancy, if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0 g kg−1, this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3 K of negative buoyancy; the latter is a large (but not extreme) value. Therefore, in general terms, negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdrafts.

=== Negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancy ===
Using pure &quot;parcel theory&quot; results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft of

formula_6

where NAPE is the negative available potential energy,

formula_7

and where LFS denotes the level of free sink for a descending parcel and SFC denotes the surface. This means that the maximum downward motion is associated with the integrated negative buoyancy. Even a relatively modest negative buoyancy can result in a substantial downdraft if it is maintained over a relatively large depth. A downward speed of results from the relatively modest NAPE value of 312.5 m2 s−2. To a first approximation, the maximum gust is roughly equal to the maximum downdraft speed.

==Heat bursts==

A special, and much rarer, kind of downburst is a heat burst, which results from precipitation-evaporated air compressionally heating as it descends from very high altitude, usually on the backside of a dying squall line or outflow boundary. Heat bursts are chiefly a nocturnal occurrence, can produce winds over , are characterized by exceptionally dry air, can suddenly raise the surface temperature to or more, and sometimes persist for several hours.

==Danger to shipping==
The sinking of the yacht &quot;Bayesian&quot; in August 2024 was attributed, in part, to a downburst, after previously being attributed to a tornado.

==Danger to aviation==
Downbursts, particularly microbursts, are exceedingly dangerous to aircraft which are taking off or landing due to the strong vertical wind shear caused by these events. Several fatal crashes are attributed to downbursts.

A microburst often causes aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land or shortly after takeoff (American Airlines Flight 63 and Delta Air Lines Flight 318 are notable exceptions). The microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that, once hitting the surface, spreads in all directions. As the aircraft is coming in to land, the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed. When the microburst hits, the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed, caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst. A pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed. The plane would then travel through the microburst, and fly into the tailwind, causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings. The decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced. This decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available, thus causing the aircraft to stall. If the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing, it will not have sufficient altitude to recover.

The strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at Andrews Field, Maryland, on 1 August 1983, with wind speeds reaching .

* On 21 June 2023, a severe thunderstorm in the Greater Houston area resulted in a powerful downburst. The storm was part of a larger tornado outbreak sequence that occurred on 20–26 June 2023. A record-breaking wind gust of 97 mph (156 km/h) was observed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, surpassing the previous record of 82 mph (132 km/h) recorded during Hurricane Ike in 2008. The aftermath left approximately 324,000 customers without power and caused extensive damage to CenterPoint Energy&#x27;s equipment and infrastructure. The storm caused significant damage to buildings, with at least 243 homes damaged. The storm was strong enough to flip a small plane and push another off the tarmac at Hooks Airport in northwest Harris County.
* On 21 May 2022, a particularly intense downburst was responsible for damage in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

* On 16 September 2010, just after 5:30 p.m., a wet macroburst with winds of hit parts of Central Queens in New York City, causing extensive damage to trees, buildings, and vehicles in an area 8 miles long and 5 miles wide. Approximately 3,000 trees were knocked down by some reports. There was one fatality when a tree fell onto a car on the Grand Central Parkway.
* On 24 June 2010, shortly after 4:30 p.m., a wet microburst hit the city of Charlottesville, Virginia. Field reports and damage assessments show that Charlottesville experienced numerous downbursts during the storm, with wind estimates at over . In a matter of minutes, trees and downed power lines littered the roadways. A number of houses were hit by trees. Immediately after the storm, up to 60,000 Dominion Power customers in Charlottesville and surrounding Albemarle County were without power.
* On 11 June 2010, around 3:00 a.m., a wet microburst hit a neighborhood in southwestern Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It caused major damage to four homes, all of which were occupied. No injuries were reported. Roofs were blown off of garages and walls were flattened by the estimated winds. The cost of repairs was thought to be $500,000 or more.

* On 13 May 1989, a microburst with winds over hit Fort Hood, Texas. Over 200 U.S. Army helicopters were damaged. The storm damaged at least 20 percent of the fort&#x27;s buildings, forcing 25 military families from their quarters. In a preliminary damage estimate, the Army said repairs to almost 200 helicopters would cost $585 million and repairs to buildings and other facilities about $15 million.
* On May 9, 1980, a microburst at the leading edge of an advancing cold front struck the freighter MV &quot;Summit Venture&quot; just as it was about to pass through the narrow channel under the Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay. Sudden torrential rain cut visibility to zero and straight-line winds estimated at over pushed the ship into a support pier, causing the catastrophic collapse of the southbound span and 35 deaths as several private vehicles and a Greyhound Bus plummeted into the water.
* On 4 July 1977, the Independence Day Derecho of 1977 formed over west-central Minnesota. As the derecho moved east-southeast, it became very intense over central Minnesota around midday.

<text>A house show (also commonly called a live event) is a professional wrestling event produced by a major promotion that is not televised, though they can be recorded. Promotions use house shows mainly to cash in on the exposure that they and their wrestlers receive during televised events, as well as to test reactions to matches, wrestlers, and gimmicks that are being considered for the main televised programming and upcoming pay-per-views. As house shows are not televised, all matches are technically dark matches, though that term is usually reserved for non-televised matches at otherwise televised events. 

House shows are also often scripted to make the face wrestlers win most matches, largely to send the crowd home happy. If a heel defends a title, the face may win by disqualification, preventing the title from changing hands.

Until the 1990s, most televised professional wrestling programs were taped weeks in advance in small studios and featured primarily matches with lesser-known wrestlers while interviews revolved around feuds between upper level talent that were to be settled at an upcoming major show at the promotion&#x27;s flagship venues. Prior to the 1980s, these were house shows, though with the advent of closed-circuit television, and later pay-per-view, these became televised events as well. Later on in the 1990s, the advent of weekly shows such as WWF&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, where competitive matches between upper level talent and storylines play out as they happen in front of a live audience, and with the increase in number of pay-per-view events held by promotions, angles are now typically developed during weekly shows, and resolved during the next pay-per-view (or, on occasion, a special episode of the series), rendering house shows to be mostly minor events with no long-term story significance.

== Production ==

Since house shows are not televised, promotions do not usually deploy the same setup for staging or pyrotechnics used for their television counterparts. In the past, a WWE house show would consist mainly of a ring, essential lighting, and a crowd. In late 2011, WWE invested US$1.5 million in production improvements, which included three LED-lit entrance stages (one each for Raw and SmackDown, and one backup) featuring a ramp and video display, and leveraging venues&#x27; existing AV equipment for multimedia such as entrances. As of 2021, a new stage was introduced that closer-resembles the stages used by televised events at the time. 

During the first brand extension, each WWE tour was exclusive to either the Raw or SmackDown brand. This remained the case through 2012, even after the first brand extension ended in 2011 on televised programming. In 2013, the shows were rebranded as &quot;WWE Live&quot;, with NXT house shows subsequently branded as &quot;NXT Live&quot;. After WrestleMania 38 in April 2022, WWE began to brand house shows held on weekends as &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; (reviving the branding of a former WWE television series) and &quot;Sunday Night Stunner&quot;.

Because house shows are not televised, sometimes controversial things occur during them (although this is rare) which might not happen on a televised show. For example, on May 19, 1996, the MSG &quot;Curtain Call&quot;, which was also a rare example of a shoot, occurred at a house show taped at Madison Square Garden. At the same show, The Bodydonnas lost their WWF Tag Team Championship to The Godwinns.

With the advent of WWE Network, WWE has televised portions of what are otherwise house shows as hour-long specials on the service, such as Starrcade—an event that shares the name with the flagship pay-per-view of the now-defunct WCW (whose assets were acquired by WWE), and The Shield&#x27;s Final Chapter—a special which featured Dean Ambrose&#x27;s final WWE appearance with his stable The Shield before his departure from the promotion.

Starting in March 2023, All Elite Wrestling launched a series of house shows under the &quot;House Rules&quot; brand.

== Title changes ==

Most major promotions try to develop their angles only during televised shows and will rarely book a major development (such as a title change) for house shows. House show title changes can occur both to gauge how fans would react to a certain outcome, and allow for outcomes that would appeal to local fans—such as Edge winning his first WWF Intercontinental Championship over Jeff Jarrett at a 1999 house show in Toronto.

If there is a title change, the title usually changes back during the same show or at another show on the loop before another televised event, like several titles changes of the WWE Hardcore Championship or when Booker T and Chris Benoit traded the WCW World Television Championship back-and-forth on several house shows, with Booker (the official champion) always having the title back in time for &quot;Nitro&quot;. Edge similarly lost the aforementioned Intercontinental Championship back to Jarrett at Fully Loaded the next evening in Buffalo.

Even rarer is the top title of a promotion changing hands. This has occurred relatively few times, notable occurrences include Bret Hart winning the then-WWF Championship from Ric Flair in 1992 at a live event in Saskatchewan and Diesel winning the WWF Championship from Bob Backlund in 1994 at a live event in Madison Square Garden.

There have also been occasions when title changes occur but are not recognized by the promotion. Some notable house show title changes include an August 10, 1987 match where The Rougeau Brothers (Raymond and Jacques) won over the champion Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) to take the WWF Tag Team championship in the Rougeau&#x27;s home town of Montreal. This change (and the eventual &quot;decision reversal&quot;) was only ever mentioned during segments taped specifically for and shown in the Montreal market. 

A fictional house show can be used to explain a sudden vacation or change of a title caused due to backstage issues on television. For example, on October 4, 1999 edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, the commentators stated that Psychosis had defeated Lenny Lane for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on an unspecified house show (thereby giving the title to Psychosis), after WCW management was forced to drop Lane&#x27;s gimmick that was perceived as offensive by the GLAAD.

== As a metaphor ==
The phrase has been used to pejoratively describe WWE pay-per-views intended primarily for specific markets, including UK-only pay-per-views such as Insurrextion and Rebellion, and WWE&#x27;s events in Saudi Arabia. In 2019, Shawn Michaels defended his one-off return at WWE&#x27;s 2018 Crown Jewel pay-per-view in Saudi Arabia (reuniting D-Generation X to participate in a tag team match against The Brothers of Destruction) despite his retirement, describing the event as being a &quot;glorified house show&quot; that was not as important as WrestleMania or &quot;coming back as the Heartbreak Kid&quot;.

<doc id="586612" wikidata="Q3278450" url="?curid=586612" title="Mayor of Ottawa">
<text>The mayor of Ottawa () is head of the executive branch of the Ottawa City Council. The mayor is elected alongside the city council every four years on the fourth Monday of October; there are no term limits. While in office, mayors are styled &quot;His/Her Worship&quot;. 

Mark Sutcliffe has served as the 59th and current mayor of Ottawa since taking office on November 15, 2022, following the 2022 municipal election.

==Role and authority==
The position of the mayor of Ottawa is set out in the &quot;City of Ottawa Act&quot;, a provincial statute which was first introduced in 1999, which outlines the mayor&#x27;s role as head of council. The duties and powers of the Mayor are outlined in &quot;Municipal By-law No. 2022-410&quot;. In September 2022, the province passed legislation known as the &quot;Strong Mayors, Building More Homes Act, 2022&quot;, followed by the &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act, 2022&quot;, both of which expanded the executive power of the mayor. 

As head of the council, the mayor ensures business is carried out efficiently during council meetings. Items can be added by the mayor directly to the city council&#x27;s agenda without going through a committee. The mayor also holds &quot;ex officio&quot; membership on all council committees. They chair the Finance and Corporate Services Committee and Debenture Committee. The mayor has the power to recommend the chairs of other city committees as well as the deputy mayor, pending final approval from the city council. With the mayor&#x27;s consent, another council member may take the mayor&#x27;s place on committees. The head of the council is also responsible for declaring states of emergency in the city.

Certain powers of the mayor can only be exercised to &quot;advance provincial priorities,&quot; as outlined in the &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act&quot;, the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; and through regulation. While city by-law allows the mayor to add items directly to the council&#x27;s agenda, this power is expanded by the &quot;Strong Mayors Act,&quot; which asserts that the mayor can do so to advance a provincial priority, irrespective of the council&#x27;s procedural by-law. The mayor is also granted a veto, which would allow an override of a city council decision if it is not consistent with a provincial priority; however, the council can override the mayor&#x27;s veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act&quot;, which was passed shortly after the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; further expands this power, allowing the mayor to pass a by-law to advance a provincial priority with one-third support on council. The provincial priorities are set by the Executive Council of Ontario (provincial cabinet), through issuing regulations.

== Deputy mayor ==
Ottawa currently has three Deputy Mayors. The role of Deputy Mayor is outlined in the &quot;Municipal By-law No. 2023-11&quot; and the &quot;Municipal Act, 2001&quot;. As of 2023, the Ottawa City Council has adopted rules, upon the recommendation of 2022-2026 Council Governance Review, which implemented a rotational system where the position of Deputy Mayor would rotate between three different councillors every six months.

==Post-amalgamation mayors of Ottawa==

Over the course of Ottawa&#x27;s history, the municipality&#x27;s borders have greatly expanded through annexations. This most recently occurred in 2001 when several neighbouring communities were amalgamated with Ottawa. The following is a list of mayors of the current post-amalgamation Ottawa.

<doc id="586616" wikidata="Q10285912" url="?curid=586616" title="Lingual frenectomy">
<text>A lingual frenectomy (also known as a tongue-tie release) is the removal of a band of tissue (the lingual frenulum) connecting the underside of the tongue with the floor of the mouth. A lingual frenectomy is performed to correct ankyloglossia (tongue-tie).

The removal of the lingual frenulum under the tongue can be accomplished with either frenectomy or frenuloplasty. This is used to treat a tongue-tied patient. The difference in tongue length is generally a few millimeters and it may actually shorten the tongue, depending on the procedure and aftercare.

Results of lingual frenectomia via laser surgery have been thought to be superior to those of traditional cold steel methods, however, minimal evidence exists. The skill of the provider is most important in the success of this procedure. It is unknown if laser frenectomy results in a lower risk of relapse (i.e. adhesion).

Domenico Maceri, a professor at Allan Hancock College, claims that some South Korean parents have their children undergo frenectomy &quot;which lengthens the tongue by about one millimeter&quot; in the belief they will pronounce English better. Critics regard the surgery as unnecessary, as Koreans born in the United States have no trouble distinctly pronouncing /r/ and /l/.

<doc id="586620" wikidata="Q662814" url="?curid=586620" title="Fox8">
<text>Fox8 (corporately stylised as FOX8, alternatively as Fox 8 or FOX 8) is an Australian pay television channel available on Foxtel, and Optus Television&#x27;s subscription platforms. It is the most watched subscription television channel in Australia (with or without the timeshift). A high definition version of the channel, Fox8HD, was launched on the Foxtel and Austar platforms on 15 November 2008.

==History==
The channel runs many programs produced by Fox and in fact was originally called &quot;Fox&quot; before adding the &quot;8&quot; to the title. The channel was found on channel 8 on Foxtel analogue and Austar standard and channel 108 on Foxtel Digital and Austar Digital. Fox8 is Foxtel&#x27;s most popular subscription channel and peak channel. It is also News Corporation&#x27;s peak Australian channel (similar to Sky1 in the UK and FX in the USA). FOX8 is one of the very few channels to have been continuously broadcast since Foxtel&#x27;s foundation in 1995. During the late 1990s, Fox8 used to show Saturday Night NRL matches.

FOX8+2 was introduced with the Foxtel and Austar Digital Services on Channel 150. This allows the viewing of the same programs on Fox8, but two hours later. One of the known advantages of this TimeShift Channel, is that Western Australian viewers can see this channel at the correct time in their state as advertised. FOX8 and Foxtel have a deal with Network Ten to receive their shows bought from the USA Fox network. Some shows like this include &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;The Simple Life&quot;. During the migration to the digital platform, Foxtel&#x27;s Fox Kids (similar to the US version) channel was discontinued in 2004 and a selection of its programming was moved to FOX8 in the early mornings.

The channel was rebranded significantly at the start of 2005, matching the American Fox channel&#x27;s logo with the addition of the &quot;8&quot; at the end. FOX8&#x27;s overall graphics also changed in style. Shortly after the rebranding, the station received its first official website. The website was relaunched in October 2005 as a fuller visual experience showing extracts from the top shows.

During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the channel screened a 17-day, multiple animated show marathon named &quot;Battle of the Animations&quot; involving &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. The event concluded on Sunday 24 August with a smaller marathon involving the winning show, as chosen by the viewing audience over the course of the 17 days. The winning show was &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

On 1 November 2008, as part of the launch of a new channel named 111 HITS (now Fox Comedy), many shows from Fox8 and other channels moved to 111 Hits.

On 15 November 2009, FOX8 HD launched on Austar and Foxtel. In 2009, it had the highest rating non-sporting related program or event on subscription television in Australia, &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

On 16 March 2010, FOX8 launched a brand new website.

On 21 May 2011, FOX8 underwent a major rebrand, incorporating a new look, with a new style of branding programs.

In October 2011, FOX8 introduced a Program Return Graphic during a program.

In February 2013, Foxtel announced a deal with The Walt Disney Company which included an exclusive output deal with ABC Family. ABC Family produces some of FOX8&#x27;s hit programs such as &quot;Bunheads&quot;, &quot;Switched at Birth&quot; and &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, as well as &quot;&quot;The Fosters&quot;&quot; and &quot;Twisted&quot; which were to premiere later in 2013.

In October 2013, FOX8 launched a new on-air look that included the new slogan &quot;TV for the Now Gen&quot; (replacing &quot;So Fox8&quot;).

On 12 December 2022, it was confirmed that Fox8 would be taking &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and all other Fox adult animation shows off the network in a move to revamp the channel as well as encourage viewers to sign up to Disney+, which has all Fox adult animation shows and which is also available as an app on Foxtel. A final Simpsons marathon aired on the network that month which concluded on 31 December.

On 28 September 2023, inline with the rebrand of Foxtel&#x27;s FOX-branded channels (ex. &quot;FOX Arena&quot; to &quot;Arena&quot;), FOX8 updated their logo.

In September 2024, Fox8 shuffled its schedule, and pulled all live WWE broadcasts off the network in a move to give the slots reserved for the live Raw, SmackDown and NXT broadcasts an entertainment-led revamp, as well as encourage viewers to prepare for the move of all WWE programming to Netflix. 1-hour episodes of WWE NXT and classic episodes of the original WWF Superstars continued to air on Fox8 until December 2024.

<text>DB Cargo UK (formerly DB Schenker Rail UK and English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway) is a British rail freight company owned by Deutsche Bahn and headquartered in Doncaster, England.

The company was established by Wisconsin Central in early 1995 as &quot;North &amp; South Railways&quot;, successfully acquiring and merging five of the six freight companies that were sold during the privatisation of British Rail. On 25 April 1996, the English, Welsh &amp; Scottish EWS brand was revealed and implemented over successive months. By the end of March 1997, it controlled 90% of the UK rail freight market, operated a fleet of 900 locomotives and 19,000 wagons, and had 7,000 employees. During the late 1990s, EWS invested heavily into rolling stock renewal, procuring a large number of British Rail Class 66 diesel locomotives. EWS reduced staff numbers, aiming to reduce numbers by around 3,000 when merging the companies. It also acquired National Power&#x27;s open-access freight operator in April 1998.

During January 2001, the Canadian National Railway acquired a 42.5% stake in the business via its purchase of Wisconsin Central. In 2003, EWS lost the Royal Mail contract to run mail trains. In October 2005, it launched a subsidiary, Euro Cargo Rail, to focus on the French market; that same year, the company acquired the wagon maintenance business Marcroft. During 2006, the Office of Rail Regulation fined EWS £4.1million for anti-competitive practices in the coal haulage sector.

In November 2007, the company was bought by German train operator Deutsche Bahn for £309 million. In January 2009, EWS was rebranded as DB Schenker. In November 2011, a weekly service using European sized swap bodies commenced between Barking, London and Wrocław, Poland using High Speed 1. In March 2016, the company was rebranded as DB Cargo UK.

In October 2016, DB Cargo announced plans to cut 893 jobs in response to a sharp downturn in coal and steel traffic. In the following year, it announced a loss after tax for the financial year of £57 million against a turnover of £325 million. Over the next two years, the company&#x27;s fleet size was reduced somewhat, mainly through the disposal or sale of older elements. During 2019, DB Cargo signed an agreement with Maritime Transport Ltd to launch a new rail freight operation, &quot;Maritime Intermodal&quot;.

==History==

===Background===
In 1988, British Rail&#x27;s (BR) freight operations were split into two divisions Railfreight Distribution (RfD) and Trainload Freight (TLF). RfD took over BR&#x27;s Freightliner and Speedlink services and general wagonload and trainload services, excluding coal, petroleum, aggregates and metals. BR&#x27;s bulk trainload services were handled by the Trainload Freight division. During 1991, the Rail Express Systems brand was created to handle mail and postal services.

After the passing of the Railways Act 1993, five rail freight companies were formed from RfD and TLF. On 1 April 1994, TLF was split into three separate geographical businesses: Trainload Freight North East, Trainload Freight West and Trainload Freight South East, with each initially given existing contracts, based on the geographic origin of the traffic flow or in the case of power station coal the split was determined by the location of the power stations concerned. There were also some trainload services previously operated by the contract services business of RfD. The three new businesses were to be re-branded as Loadhaul, Mainline Freight and Transrail Freight for the short duration of their existence.

The remainder of RfD was split into two companies: Freightliner (container operations between ports), with the residual RfD company operating freight trains through the Channel Tunnel. The Mail and Parcels business were sold as Rail Express Systems and Red Star Parcels. These companies were subsequently put up for sale by competitive tender.

===English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway===
A new company, &quot;North and South Railways Limited&quot;, was formed for the purpose of bidding for the ex-BR freight businesses being offered for sale. It was owned by a consortium, headed by Wisconsin Central, and financed by multiple investment firms, including Berkshire Partners, Goldman Sachs and Fay Richwhite.

On 9 December 1995, North and South Railways purchased Rail Express Systems for £24 million. With this purchase came the contract for the Royal Mail train service, including the Travelling Post Office trains, and the contract to haul the Royal Train. A fleet of 164 locomotives and 677 postal vans were included along with depots at Bristol Barton Hill, Cambridge, Crewe and London Euston.

Then, on 24 February 1996, British Rail&#x27;s three trainload freight companies, Loadhaul, Mainline Freight and Transrail Freight were acquired for £225 million. The sale included 914 locomotives and 19,310 wagons.

All four companies were subsequently merged into North and South Railways, nullifying the government&#x27;s effort to create multiple competitive rail freight firms through the privatisation; the decision to allow the creation of a rail freight company with a dominant market position was justified by the additional competition faced from other transport modes. At the time, rail had a 6% share of the freight market.

Initially, the four companies continued to trade under their existing names. However, on 25 April 1996, the &quot;English, Welsh &amp; Scottish&quot; (EWS) brand was unveiled.

On 10 July 1996, in accordance with the new branding, the holding company&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway Holdings Limited&quot;. In October 1996, Loadhaul and Mainline Freight were merged with Transrail Freight, and employees transferred to Transrail Freight, which was then renamed to English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway Limited.

One of the first actions of the enlarged company was to seek volunteers for redundancy, as it sought to reduce staff numbers by around 3,000, from 7,600.

On 24 December 1996, EWS was announced as the preferred bidder for the loss-making Railfreight Distribution, for which it received grants and subsidies estimated to amount to £242 million over eight years . including subsidies for the use of the Channel Tunnel. Railfreight Distribution&#x27;s businesses included international containerised freight, movement of cars and automotive components by rail, and freight services for the Ministry of Defence. The sale, which included 157 locomotives, was concluded on 12 March 1997. At this point, EWS controlled 90% of the rail freight market. Railfreight Distribution was renamed &quot;English Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway International&quot; on 1 December 1998.

The new company had a vast portfolio, comprising in excess of 900 locomotives, 19,000 freight wagons, and 7,000 employees. Track access charges were renegotiated and, following 1,800 job redundancies, the work force was involved in profit sharing and other incentivised working plans; as a consequence, shipping rates were reduced by over 30%. Many locomotives inherited on foundation were considered unreliable, and expensive to maintain; the company invested heavily in modernisation of its rolling stock; by 2002, £750 million had been invested in this manner, resulting in the delivery of 280 new locomotives and in excess of 2,000 new wagons.
Around this time, the company was represented by a logo that was colloquially known as the &quot;Beasties&quot;, consisting of three heads: the lion of England, the dragon of Wales and the stag of Scotland. A larger version of the logo was called the &quot;Big Beasties&quot;.

Services included mail, locomotive hire, wagonload traffic (branded &#x27;Enterprise&#x27;, founded by Transrail Freight), cross channel trains via the Channel Tunnel, trainload freight including oil, aggregates, cement and traffic related to the coal, electricity generation and steel industries, and infrastructure trains for Railtrack. Following privatisation EWS began to compete for Intermodal contracts, while it faced competition from Freightliner in its core markets. In 1999, the company&#x27;s turnover was £533.7 million, representing an 80% market share in terms of value.

On 1 April 1998, open access operator National Power&#x27;s rail division was taken over by EWS, along with its six Class 59 locomotives and 106 wagons.

During late January 2001, the Canadian National Railway announced it had agreed to purchase Wisconsin Central. The deal, which included Wisconsin Central&#x27;s 42.5% stake in EWS, was concluded in October 2001.

During 2003, the Royal Mail terminated its mail train contract with EWS; this traffic was transferred to aircraft and road transport instead. EWS acquired the assets of wagon bogie company &quot;Probotec Limited&quot; in 2005. It was formed into a new subsidiary, Axiom Rail, that also took over responsibility for some of the depots, and leasing surplus locomotives overseas.

During October 2005, the company launched a new subsidiary, which traded as Euro Cargo Rail, based in the French market. Several Class 66 locomotives were transferred from EWS to Euro Cargo Rail.

In November 2005, EWS acquired the wagon maintenance business &quot;Marcroft&quot;. Due to the potential of the acquisition to reduce competition in the UK wagon repair market, the acquisition was referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading, which required EWS to sell all or part of the business, excluding Marcroft&#x27;s works at Stoke on Trent, which were incorporated into Axiom.

By 2006, company turnover was reportedly approaching £1 billion. In 2006, the Office of Rail Regulation fined EWS £4.1 million for engaging in anti-competitive practices in the coal haulage business; at the time, the company held a virtual monopoly on such traffic, and its practices had led to official complaints from both Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul in the early 2000s.

===DB Cargo UK===

On 28 June 2007, Deutsche Bahn announced it had agreed to purchase EWS, subject to receiving regulatory approval, in exchange for £309 million. At the time of the acquisition, EWS had a market share of around 70% in the United Kingdom rail freight sector and had around 5,000 employees. After the transaction was approved by the European Commissioner for Competition, the transaction was completed on 13 November 2007.

At the time of the sale, it was announced that EWS would not be rebranded, however, on 1 January 2009, EWS was rebranded as &quot;DB Schenker&quot; along with Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s Railion and DB Schenker divisions.

The first locomotive painted in DB Schenker livery was Class 59 59206 at Toton Depot in January 2009, being formally unveiled at the National Railway Museum, York on 21 January 2009. 
During 2009, DB Schenker Rail began work to enable Class 92 hauled trains to operate freight services on the High Speed 1 by installing in cab TVM signalling. The project received funding from the European Commission and it was originally anticipated services would begin in early 2010. On 25 March 2011, a modified Class 92 locomotive travelled from Dollands Moor to Singlewell using the TVM430 signalling system for the first time. The first of five planned test trains ran as a loaded container train from Hams Hall, West Midlands to Novara, Italy on 27 May 2011. DB planned to upgrade an additional five Class 92 locomotives to allow them to run on High Speed 1, making a fleet of six.

In July 2011, a trial run of wagons carrying curtain walled swap bodies built to a larger European loading gauge was run from Dollands Moor, Folkestone to east London. From 11 November 2011, a weekly service using European sized swap bodies has run between Barking, London and Wroclaw, Poland using High Speed 1.

On 2 March 2016, DB Schenker was rebranded as DB Cargo UK. On 17 October 2016, new DB Cargo UK CEO Hans-Georg Werner announced plans to cut 893 jobs in a bid to counter &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; market changes, these being a combination of factors, including changes in the British Government&#x27;s energy policy that had resulted in the early closure of coal-fired power stations, hence DB Cargo UK ran 78% fewer coal trains compared to 2015, while UK steel volumes were also dropping as the industry had been impacted by high energy prices; this resulted in DB Cargo UK running 33% fewer steel trains from 2015. However, Werner recognised that &quot;overall UK steel demand remains stable&quot;.

During 2017, DB Cargo UK announced an after-tax loss for the financial year of £57 million against a turnover of £325 million.

===Maritime Intermodal===
In early 2019, DB Cargo signed an agreement with Maritime Transport Ltd to create a new rail freight operation called &quot;Maritime Intermodal&quot;. From 1 April 2019, Maritime took over the running of DB&#x27;s freight terminals at Trafford Park (Manchester), Birmingham (Birch Coppice) and Wakefield Europort. Seven British Rail Class 66 locomotives have been repainted in blue Maritime livery and named:
* 66005 &quot;Maritime Intermodal One&quot;
* 66047 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Two&quot;
* 66142 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Three&quot;
* 66051 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Four&quot;
* 66162 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Five&quot;
* 66090 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Six&quot;
* 66148 &quot;Maritime Intermodal Seven&quot;

It is expected that up to ten locomotives will receive the blue livery.

==Services and rolling stock==
===Rolling stock===

EWS inherited a fleet of 1,231 locomotives from its British Rail acquisitions. This fleet, which was mainly diesel powered, had an average age in excess of 30 years; furthermore, roughly 300 were inoperable, having been cannibalised for spares. To enable the company to offer lower pricing to customers, EWS needed to reduce operating costs and increase availability, and quickly concluded that this goal would require new traction to be procured.

During May 1996, the company placed a £375 million order for 250 Class 66 and 30 Class 67 diesel-electric locomotives with the American locomotive manufacturer Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD); the deal was referred to as &quot;the biggest British loco order since steam days&quot;. These replaced a large proportion of its original fleet, including all of the 20, 31, 33, 37, 47, 56, 58, 73 and 86 class locomotives. Through improved utilisation, they also replaced many of the newer 60 and 90 class locomotives as well.

During 1999, EWS gained the attention of the Rail Regulator for its practice of scrapping serviceable locomotives rather than making them available for sale to potential competitors; on future disposals, the company was compelled to make efforts to sell units before being allowed to scrap them.

Several of the firm&#x27;s redundant locomotives saw further use on infrastructure trains in Europe, such as numerous Class 37s operated in France (40), Italy (2) and Spain (14), Class 56s in France (30), and Class 58s in France (26), the Netherlands (3) and Spain (8).

During September 2010, twenty Class 60s were offered for disposal by DB Schenker. Many marked for disposal had sustained catastrophic failures or were otherwise in a poor condition. During November 2010, the firm announced that a batch of 20 Class 60s would be overhauled. According to Rail Magazine, rumours that DB Schenker was interested in replacing the Class 60&#x27;s engines were prevalent around this time. In January 2011, DB Schenker announced that seven units would undergo overhauls, along with an option to overhaul a further fourteen members of the class; this work reportedly extended the fleet&#x27;s operational life by 15 years. During January 2013, the overhaul programme was described as an &quot;upgrade&quot; that created a new fleet of &quot;Super 60&#x27;s&quot;. The programme involved the complete overhaul, but not total replacement, of the locomotive&#x27;s engine, as well as the refurbishment of various elements, including the traction motors, bogies, control gear, cabs, and electrical systems.

In 2018, DB Cargo sold ten Class 66 locomotives to GBRf for an undisclosed sum, comprising eight stored and two active locomotives many with significant engine defects. In 2019, it also sold all of its 59/2 fleet to Freightliner following the latter&#x27;s takeover of the Mendip stone traffic. DB Cargo also sold five Class 60s to private sales/metal recyclers.

In 2023 in response to the UK Energy crisis DB Cargo UK&#x27;s current managing director Andrea Rossi announced intentions to withdraw all of their Class 90s with the intention to sell or scrap the locomotives with Rossi stating that the running of electric hauled traction was no longer economically viable, the company instead decided that electric hauled traction would be replaced by diesel traction such as the Class 66 locomotive. The company also stated that they will pledge for further research and implementation of alternative EVO based fuels to meet their climate targets. In September 2023 12 Class 90s were offered for sale on DB&#x27;s website; the locomotives listed were; 90017, 90018, 90022, 90023, 90025, 90027, 90030, 90031, 90032, 90033, 90038 and 90040.

===Current fleet in the UK===
===Former fleet===


=== Carriages and wagons ===
As well as an extensive fleet of freight wagons, DB Schenker Rail operate a small fleet of Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages, some of the latter form the DB Cargo Company Train.

===Depots===
DB Cargo&#x27;s primary maintenance depot is Toton. The electric fleet is maintained at Crewe. With a modern fleet requiring less maintenance, many of the depots EWS inherited have closed. Some of its other facilities including Bristol Barton Hill, Cambridge, Eastleigh and Newcastle were transferred to fellow Deutsche Bahn subsidiary LNWR (now Arriva TrainCare).

During 2001, EWS commenced a contract to service Virgin CrossCountry&#x27;s Class 220/221 fleets at Bristol Barton Hill, Eastleigh, Newcastle, Old Oak Common and Three Bridges.

===Passenger locomotive haulage===
Since its inception, EWS had provided locomotives for the &quot; Caledonian Sleeper&quot;. It inherited the contract from Rail Express Systems to provide Class 37 and 47s north of Edinburgh Waverley. During March 1998, it also began hauling the services south from Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central to London Euston with Class 90s. Class 67s replaced the Class 37s and 47s in the early 2000s. This contract was taken over by GBRf in March 2015.

During April 2003, EWS purchased the Rail Charter Services business from William McAlpine along with its 70 Mark 1 carriages.

By October 2014, EWS Class 67s had started hauling passenger services on behalf of Arriva Trains Wales, Chiltern Railways and First ScotRail. Class 67s are also used as &quot;Thunderbird&quot; rescue locomotives for London North Eastern Railway. EWS also provides locomotives for the Venice-Simplon Orient Express.

EWS have previously hauled passenger trains for Anglia Railways, Arriva Trains Northern, First Great Western First North Western, National Express East Anglia, Valley Lines, Virgin CrossCountry Virgin West Coast and Wrexham &amp; Shropshire.

Since its inception, EWS has held the contract to operate the Royal Train. Initially, two Class 47s were dedicated to this work; these were replaced in 2004 by a pair of Class 67s.

From September 2016, Virgin Trains East Coast hired class 90 locomotives from DB Cargo for use on services to Leeds, York and Newcastle. Locomotives used have varied as demand required.

====Liveries====
During April 1996, EWS adopted a maroon and yellow livery. Initial repaints carried EW&amp;S lettering, however, this was simplified to EWS in January 1997. In January 2009, the DB Schenker corporate red livery was adopted. A few locomotives have been repainted in other liveries including Class 90s in GNER, First ScotRail and Direct Rail Services liveries, and Class 67s in Royal Train, Wrexham &amp; Shropshire and unbranded Arriva Trains Wales liveries.

==Steam operations==

Alongside DB Cargo&#x27;s regular operations, a number of steam charters are operated in the UK by steam locomotives on DB Cargo&#x27;s operating licence.

<doc id="586629" wikidata="Q115681039" url="?curid=586629" title="Bugger">
<text>Bugger or buggar can at times be considered as a mild swear word. In the United Kingdom the term has been used commonly to imply dissatisfaction, refer to someone or something whose behaviour is in some way inconvenient or perhaps as an expression of surprise. In the United States, particularly in the Midwest and South, it is an inoffensive slang term meaning &quot;small animal&quot;.

The term is used in the vernacular of British English, Australian English, New Zealand English, South African English, Hawaiian Pidgin, Indian English, Pakistani English, Canadian English, Caribbean English, Malaysian English and in Sri Lankan English.

== Etymology ==
It is derived from Anglo-Norman , from Latin , in reference to Bulgaria, from which the Bogomils, a sect labeled by church authorities as heretics, were thought to have come in the 11th century, after other &quot;heretics&quot; to whom abominable practices were imputed in an abusively disparaging manner. (The word &quot;Bogomil&quot; itself is not etymologically related.)

==History==
The term is thought to have emerged around the early 13th century, after Pope Innocent III and the northern French kingdom engaged in the Albigensian Crusade in southern France. This led to the slaughter of about 20,000 men, women and children, Cathar and Catholic alike and brought the region firmly under the control of the King of France. The crusade was directed against heretical Christians and the nobility of Toulouse and vassals of the Crown of Aragon. The populace of Provence and Northern Italy sympathized with the victims of the crusade because of their moral purity. It was then that the Catholic clergy launched a vilifying campaign against them, associating them with unorthodox sexual practices and sodomy.

==Usage==

=== Noun ===
In some English speaking communities the word has been in use traditionally without any profane connotations. For instance, within the Anglo-Indian community in India the word &quot;bugger&quot; has been in use, in an affectionate manner, to address or refer to a close friend or fellow schoolmate. In the United States it can be a rough synonym to as in calling a young boy a &quot;little bugger&quot;.

In 1978, Mr Justice Sir Melford Stevenson, QC was reprimanded for calling the British Sexual Offences Act 1967 a &quot;buggers&#x27; charter&quot;.

===Verb===
As a verb, the word is used in Commonwealth English to denote sodomy. In Great Britain, the phrase &quot;Bugger me sideways&quot; (or a variation of this) can be used as an expression of surprise. It can also be used as a synonym for &quot;broken&quot;, as in &quot;This PC&#x27;s buggered&quot; (similar to the verb &quot;bricked&quot;); &quot;Oh no! I&#x27;ve buggered it up&quot;; or &quot;It&#x27;s gone to buggery&quot;. In Anglophone Southern Africa, Australia, Canada and Britain, &quot;buggered&quot; is colloquially used to describe something, usually a machine or vehicle, as broken.

The phrase &quot;bugger off&quot; (&quot;bug off&quot; in American English) means to go, or run, away; when used as a command it means &quot;go away&quot; (&quot;get lost&quot; or &quot;leave me alone&quot;) and can also be used in much the same type of relatively offensive manner.

&quot;I&#x27;m buggered&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll be buggered&quot; and &quot;bugger me&quot; are used colloquially in Great Britain (and often in New Zealand and Australia as well) to denote or feign surprise at an unexpected (or possibly unwanted) occurrence. &quot;I&#x27;m buggered&quot; can also be used to indicate a state of fatigue. In this latter form it found fame in New Zealand in 1956 through rugby player Peter Jones, who—in a live post-match radio interview—declared himself &quot;absolutely buggered&quot;, a turn of phrase considered shocking at the time.

It is famously alleged that the last words of King George V were &quot;Bugger Bognor&quot;, in response to a suggestion that he might recover from his illness and visit Bognor Regis. Variations on the phrase &quot;bugger it&quot; are commonly used to imply frustration, admission of defeat or the sense that something is not worth doing, as in &quot;bugger this for a lark&quot; or &quot;bugger this for a game of soldiers&quot;.

===Interjection===
As an interjection, &quot;bugger&quot; is sometimes used as a single-word expletive. &quot;Buggeration&quot; is a derivation occasionally found in British English.

As with many expletives, its continued use has reduced its shock value and offensiveness. Thus the Toyota car company in Australia and New Zealand ran a popular series of advertisements where &quot;Bugger!&quot; was the only spoken word (with exception of an utterance of &quot;bugger me!&quot;) (frequently repeated); they then ran a censored version of the ad in which &quot;Bugger!&quot; was bleeped out, as a joke against those who spoke out against the ad claiming it was offensive. The term is generally not used in the United States, but it is recognised, although inoffensive there. It is also used in Canada more frequently than in the United States but with less stigma than in other parts of the world. In the pre-watershed television version of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; the opening sequence is modified from repeated exclamations of &quot;Fuck!&quot; by Hugh Grant and Charlotte Coleman when they are late for the first wedding to repeated exclamations of &quot;Bugger!&quot;.

==Derived terms==
===Bagarapim===

&quot;Bagarap&quot; (from &quot;buggered up&quot;) is a common word in Pacific pidgins such as Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea, Brokan (Torres Strait Creole) of Australia and Papua and others, meaning &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;hurt&quot;, &quot;ruined&quot;, &quot;destroyed&quot;, &quot;tired&quot;, and so on, as in Tok Pisin &quot;kanu i bagarap&quot;, Brokan &quot;kenu i bagarap&quot;, &quot;the canoe is broken&quot; or Tok Pisin/Brokan &quot;kaikai i bagarap&quot;, &quot;the food is spoiled&quot;. Tok Pisin &quot;mi bagarap pinis&quot; (&quot;me bugger-up finish&quot;) means, &quot;I am very tired&quot;, or &quot;I am very ill&quot;, while the Brokan equivalent, &quot;ai pinis bagarap&quot;, is more &quot;I&#x27;m done in&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m finished/I&#x27;ve had it&quot;. The term was put to use in the album &quot;Bagarap Empires&quot; by Fred Smith, which was made to capture the peace process in Bougainville, an island province of Papua New Guinea; in a number of the songs he uses Melanesian pidgin, the language used in Bougainville and elsewhere.

===Little buggers===
&quot;Little buggers&quot; means children, a term so familiar in the United Kingdom that there is a series of professional teaching manuals with titles that start &quot;Getting the buggers to ...&quot;

===Bugger about===
&quot;To bugger about&quot; means to mess around, to do something ineffectively.

===Bugger all===

&quot;Bugger all&quot; means &quot;nothing&quot;, as in &quot;You may not like paying taxes, but there&#x27;s bugger all you can do about it&quot; and &quot;The police are doing bugger all about all this aggro that&#x27;s going on&quot;. See also &quot;fuck all&quot;, &quot;sweet FA&quot;, and &quot;Llareggub&quot; (&quot;bugger all&quot; spelled backwards, a fictional Welsh town in Dylan Thomas&#x27; radio play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;).

===Bugger me===
The phrase &quot;bugger me&quot; is a slang term used for a situation that has yielded an unexpected or undesirable result.

Common usage includes &quot;bugger me dead&quot; and &quot;bugger me blind&quot;.

===Bugger&#x27;s muddle===
Colloquial military term for a disorderly group—either assembled without formation or in a formation that does not meet the standards of the commentator: &quot;just form a bugger&#x27;s muddle&quot;, &quot;there&#x27;s a bugger&#x27;s muddle of civvies hanging around the gate&quot;, &quot;Get that bugger&#x27;s muddle of yours fallen in properly&quot;.

===Bugger off===

The phrase &quot;bugger off&quot; is a slang or dismissive term meaning &quot;leave&quot;.

===Buggery===

The word &quot;buggery&quot; today also serves as a general expletive (mild, moderate or severe depending on the context and company), and can be used to replace the word &quot;bugger&quot; as a simple expletive or as a simile in phrases which do not actually refer literally in any sense to buggery itself, but just use the word for its informal strength of impact, e.g., &quot;Run like buggery&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;Run like hell&quot; but would be regarded by most listeners as more obscene.

=== Embuggerance ===
Eric Partridge defined &quot;embuggerance factor&quot; as &quot;a natural or artificial hazard that complicates any proposed course of action&quot;. It was reportedly British military slang in the 1950s. Terry Pratchett used the word in this sense when he referred to his Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which had prevented him from attending conventions, as &quot;the Embuggerance&quot;.

=== Play silly buggers ===

To act in a stupid or reckless manner. (Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)

<text>Direct Rail Services (DRS) is a rail freight company in Great Britain, and is one of the publicly owned railway companies in the United Kingdom.

DRS was created as a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) during late 1994 with the primary purpose of taking over the rail-based handling of nuclear material from British Rail. As early as 1997, the company began diversification into other operations, initially bidding for contracts to haul freight traffic for other companies such as Tesco and Eddie Stobart Group. Furthermore, DRS has branched into passenger services, these have included charters, such as the Northern Belle, and contracts with operators such as National Express East Anglia, Chiltern Railways, and Arriva Rail North. Additional rolling stock, such as the Class 57 and Class 88 locomotives, have been acquired by DRS during the 2010s.

In 2005, DRS was transferred from BNFL to the newly created Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). During early 2021, further restructuring led to DRS, along with sibling subsidiaries Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited (PNTL) and International Nuclear Services (INS), falling under a new NDA division, &quot;Nuclear Transport Solutions&quot; (NTS).

==History==
===Early operations===
The origins of Direct Rail Services (DRS) can be traced back to the privatisation of British Rail during the 1990s; British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) had a long-standing arrangement with British Rail for the latter to undertake the haulage of nuclear flask traffic, but the pending dissolution of British Rail led to BNFL considering other options. In October 1994, it was announced that BNFL had decided to perform rail transport and other railway-related services internally. For this purpose, DRS was set up as a wholly-owned rail freight subsidiary of BNFL, initially using a small fleet of five Class 20/3 locomotives.

Prior to 1998, DRS&#x27;s nuclear haulage activities were exclusively related to the transporting of nuclear fuel rods from overseas to Sellafield for processing. During 1998, DRS took over the movement of fuel rods from various nuclear power stations across Britain, such as Heysham, Valley (for Wylfa), Bridgwater (for Hinkley Point), Berkeley (for Oldbury), Hunterston, Torness, Seaton Carew, Dungeness and Sizewell.

During 1997, DRS began to diversify into the haulage of other traffic, having secured a contract to operate milk traffic from Penrith to Cricklewood. In 2002, it commenced running intermodal freight trains from Grangemouth to the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal using Class 66/4 locomotives; it carries containers for both the Malcolm Group and Asda. In May 2020, DRS announced it had launched a new electrified freight route between the Daventry Freight Terminal and Mossend Yard, outside Glasgow.

The ownership of DRS was transferred from BNFL to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), following the creation of the NDA on 1 April 2005 under the terms of the Energy Act 2004. Since April 2021, DRS, as well as its sibling NDA subsidiaries Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited (PNTL) and International Nuclear Services (INS), have been operated by a newly created NDA division, &quot;Nuclear Transport Solutions&quot; (NTS).

During 2006, DRS started a new service, the &quot;Tesco Express&quot;, on behalf of the Eddie Stobart Group in partnership with Tesco, the UK&#x27;s largest food retailer, to move containers from Daventry north to Mossend and Inverness using a new dedicated low-emission Class 66 locomotive in Eddie Stobart livery, 66411 &quot;Eddie the Engine&quot;. A daily service from Grangemouth to Inverness followed in 2009, with another Class 66 in a promotional livery, this time 66414 &quot;James the Engine&quot;. The Daventry Scotland Stobart contract transferred to DB Schenker in January 2010, along with the onward daily service to Inverness, though this reverted to DRS operation in summer 2011. In January 2022, DRS and Tesco signed a three-year extension deal; by this point, the company was transporting roughly 12,000 containers for Tesco per month.

As of 2021, DRS has stated its intention to grow its presence in the rail freight sector, particular in Scotland.

===Passenger services===

In 2007, seven Mark 3 carriages from Virgin Trains were refurbished at the Oxley depot. The following year saw the coaches used to operate charter services under the Stobart Rail banner, however, the Stobart Rail operation ceased in July 2008.

In June 2009, DRS commenced operating rescue locomotive duties on the Great Eastern Main Line for the train operator National Express East Anglia, as well as hauling Class 90 electric locomotives from to on summer Saturdays. This included Summer Saturday Wherry Lines services. DRS have periodically operated services on the Wherry Lines during periods of diesel multiple unit shortage. During October 2014, it commenced operating a two-year contract to operate services on the Wherry Lines under contract to Abellio Greater Anglia. It was operated by top and tailed Class 47s hauling Mark 2s, top and tail Class 37s were introduced in mid-2015.
Between 30 November 2009 and 28 May 2010, DRS ran a service on the Cumbrian Coast Line between and following a road bridge being destroyed by floods. The trains were made up of Class 37s, Class 47s and Class 57s top and tailing DRS&#x27; Mark 3 carriages.

During April 2011, DRS commenced a five-year contract under which it provided Class 47 locomotives to haul the Northern Belle, a luxury passenger train. By 2013, the company was operating 140 passenger charters annually, roughly 100 of which were for the Northern Belle. By April 2018, the train was being hauled by Class 57s operated by West Coast Railways, the owner of the Northern Belle, instead.

On 9 January 2012, a trial service was introduced for six weeks by the NDA for its workers, with DRS supplying a Class 37 to haul four Mark 2 carriages between and . Although the trial was reported to have been a success, plans to introduce regular services from December 2012 did not materialise until May 2015. To operate these services, DRS purchased a fleet of Mark 2 carriages and had these overhauled at Eastleigh Works. In May 2015, the company started to operate some services on the Cumbrian Coast Line under contract to Northern Rail (later Arriva Rail North) using top and tail Class 37s which hauled Mark 2 coaches. On 27 July 2015, one of the Class 37s was replaced by a DBSO, with the other replaced at a later date. On 29 January 2018, one set was made to be Top and Tail Class 68s, while the other stayed a Class 37 and DBSO. On 21 May 2018, there was only one set out, which was the Top and Tail Class 68s only running between Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness. This service was ultimately replaced by Class 156 Diesel Multiple Units (transferred from ScotRail) on 28 December 2018, with special commemorative &#x27;farewell&#x27; service being run for charity on 11 January 2019.

In June 2014, it was announced that Chiltern Railways had signed a contract with DRS for the latter to provide six of its Class 68 locomotives to haul express passenger services, replacing Class 67s hired from DBS. On 15 December 2014, the first of DRS-hauled Chiltern service departed Marylebone station; Chiltern noted that the Class 68s will be capable of hauling extended trains in the future. In addition to the locomotives themselves, DRS provided commissioning and maintenance services.

==Depots==

Direct Rail Services initially operated from a base at the nuclear reprocessing plant in Sellafield, but in 1998 moved into Carlisle Kingmoor depot which had been disused since 1987.
A second depot was opened at Crewe Gresty Bridge in March 2007. This is on the site of a former wagon works. 
It also operates the Motherwell depot, where it carries out inspection work and re-fuelling.

==Fleet==
The initial fleet of locomotives were five Class 20/3s which were overhauled at Brush Traction, Loughborough for their new duties.
In 1997, six Class 37/6s were purchased from international high speed passenger operator Eurostar. DRS would later build up an extensive fleet of Class 37 and 47 locomotives from various sources. In 2001, a number of Class 33s were purchased. During 2004, three Class 87s were trialed, but returned to their leasing company after six months. During 2008, DRS initiated efforts to acquire Class 57 locomotives; by 2013, it operated nine former Freightliner 57/0s as well as 12 former Virgin Trains 57/3s.

On 12 September 2013, it was announced that DRS would be the launch customer for the new Vossloh Euro Dual dual-mode freight locomotive by Vossloh España. These would become . DRS took delivery of the first of 15 new s in February 2014; these are diesel-only versions of the Class 88s which would arrive later. During October 2014, a further ten were ordered followed by another seven in July 2015. In April 2015, two Class 68s commenced operating Fife Circle Line services for Abellio ScotRail. A further batch of six Class 68s (6802068025) were delivered by on 5 April 2016.
On 8 January 2016, DRS announced it would sell 12 of its older locomotives, including one locomotive (20312), six Class 37 locomotives (37503/510/521/608/611/670) and five Class 47 locomotives (47810/13/18/28/53) along with two of its Mark 2 coaches. By January 2022, the company was in the process of disposing of older rolling stock, such as Class 20s, Class 37s, Class 57s, and Mark 2 coaches, along with associated spare parts and other elements; this was reportedly one part of a wider fleet modernisation effort.

66301-66305 left DRS for GBRf at the end of 2022, as DRS restructured its fleet.

<text>Freightliner Group is a rail freight and logistics company headquartered in the United Kingdom. It is owned by Brookfield, a Canadian investment management company and GIC, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. 

It was originally created after the Transport Act 1968 as Freightliner Limited, a British government-owned company. From its onset, Freightliner was focused on the haulage of international traffic, thus came to centre its activities around Britain&#x27;s sea ports, often building new multimodal freight depots adjacent to such locations to better capture this business. During the late 1970s, it was reorganised under British Rail, and became a part of its Railfreight Distribution subsidiary during the late 1980s. Work to expand the loading gauge on routes such as the East Coast Main Line were undertaken, allowing trains hauling larger containers to be routes, were conducted around this time. Numerous domestic depots previously operated by Freightliner were closed during the 1990s in preparation for the privatisation of British Rail that same decade.

As a consequence of the privatisation initiative, the business unit was reorganised as Freightliner Limited; on 25 May 1996, it was privatised and sold in a management buyout, supported by 3i and Electra Private Equity for £5.4 million. Freightliner quickly set about modernising and expanding its locomotive fleet, ordering Class 57 and Class 66 locomotives. During 1999, it established the &quot;Heavy Haul&quot; business; five years later, the &quot;Logico&quot; service was also launched. By 2014, Freightliner Limited had become the largest intermodal freight transport operator in the United Kingdom, as well as the second largest freight operating company in the country by revenue, behind DB Cargo UK. It had also expanded its operations into various other countries, including Australia, the Netherlands and Poland. In 2008, Freightliner Group was purchased by Railinvest Holding Company, a subsidiary of Arcapita Bank of Bahrain. In 2015, Freightliner was acquired by Genesee &amp; Wyoming.

==History==

===British Rail===
The idea of shipping freight in set-sized containers went back to the 1930s in the UK with the adoption of the Conflat system. But it was Dr Richard Beeching who, in his report &quot;Reshaping Britain&#x27;s Railways&quot;, advanced the concept of containerised freight in the UK.

Beeching proposed 55 depots placed strategically across the UK, serviced by fixed-consist permanently-coupled air-braked trains, with an average journey between depots of and a shortest distance of . British Railways progressed with the concept, envisaging length wagons - later increased to - carrying standard sized international shipping containers in lengths of , later adapted to . These BR UK-adopted standards were formed on the basis of analysis of then current international intermodal practise, and later adopted as the base of the internationally agreed ISO 668. Containers would be loaded at the dedicated inland terminals, using gantry cranes for transshipment between road and rail.

During January 1964, the prototype flat wagon was produced by Shildon railway works; later that same year, 100 production wagons were turned out from Ashford railway works. The first revenue-earning train ran between York Way/Maiden Lane in North London and Gushetfaulds in Glasgow on 15 November 1965. Soon adopting the Freightliner name, the first single-shipper train was operated on 20 August 1968, hauling specially-designed containers carrying parts for Ford Escort cars that were destined for assembly in plants on the European mainland.

===Freightliner Ltd (1968)===
Beeching&#x27;s original concept envisioned Freightliner servicing a domestic freight market, which by 1968 had resulted in British Railways developing 17 purpose-built depots. However, Freightliner&#x27;s most profitable routes were those servicing Britain&#x27;s major ports, specifically traffic to/from continental Europe and Ireland, as well as import/export traffic to the rest of the world. This pattern of profitability was recognised in the Transport Act 1968, whereby Freightliner became a separate listed commercial company wholly owned by the UK Government, but which leased its UK domestic rail transport from British Railways.

By the end of the 1960s, Freightliner operated 28 terminals and 56 routes, however, the company&#x27;s shift in focus from the original domestic freight market to the international market serviced via ports continued for the next 30years, with many of the original domestic depots which did not service port traffic either never opening or eventually closing (i.e.: Kings Cross, Sheffield, Swansea, Swindon), whilst investment in seaport depots - specifically Southampton, Harwich, and the Port of Felixstowe where Beeching&#x27;s plan had never envisaged a depot - continued at an increasing pace. Part of the consolidation of rail depots was enabled by a greater focus on Freighliner&#x27;s own HGV network of dedicated lorries, which expanded the servicing footprint of each rail depot, and hence allowed increased efficiency through creating longer and better utilised train routes.

Dudley Freightliner Terminal, from Birmingham, on the site of the old railway station was opened in October 1967. This initially proved to be one of the most profitable such terminals in the country, while the Birmingham terminal was ultimately one of the least financially viable. In 1981, due to a lack of international traffic, Freightliner was planning to close Dudley and transfer its function to Birmingham. Given a reprieve in 1983, it finally closed during 1986.

Increasing Irish traffic resulted in a depot being opened at the Port of Holyhead, as well as Freightliner having dedicated operations in both Belfast and Dublin. This also resulted in UK Government granting Freightliner funds to create a dedicated multimodal terminal at the Port of Liverpool to replace its previously lost rail freight traffic, and then further investment in second multimodal terminals at both Felixstowe and the Port of Tilbury.

===Return to British Railways===
The Transport Act 1978 brought Freightliner back inside the control of British Railways, mostly driven by the investment required to 
ease the rail network&#x27;s loading gauge restrictions that hampered the transport of shipping containers and in height.

Freightliner immediately made a major pitch to the BR Board to allow 8 ft 6 in contains to be carried on the East Coast Main Line (ECML), which involved lowering the track in , as well as in Peascliffe and Penmanshiel tunnels (in Lincolnshire and the Scottish Borders, respectively). The alterations were successfully completed at Stoke and Peascliffe, but Penmanshiel Tunnel collapsed in March 1979 while work was underway, killing two workers and severing the ECML between Edinburgh and Berwick. The extent of the collapse meant that reconstruction was considered to be too dangerous and expensive, so the tunnel was bypassed by a new section of line constructed in an open cutting slightly to the west of the original alignment that opened five months later in late August. Freightliner later withdraw its services on that stretch of the ECML.

During the 1980s, Freighliner became part of BR&#x27;s 1980s non-bulk Railfreight Distribution (RfD) division, which brought about its first ever allocation of locomotives. After experimenting with other rail operators solutions to coping with the new larger containers, in 1990 BR agreed the order of 700 flat-wagons from SNCF supplier Arbel Fauvet Rail, which could immediately accommodate 8 ft 6inch height containers at 75 mph speeds. This was further supplemented in 1991 with leased flat-wagons from Tiphook. Further experimentation with SNCF-leased Multifret flat-wagons which could accommodate 9 ft containers at speeds of up to led to an order of 45 BR-specified &quot;Lowliner&quot; wagons with a deck height of only , which allowed the transport of containers on routes approved for 8 ft 6 in containers using the existing wagon fleet.

Although designed to accommodate 9 ft containers over the entire BR network, the slow delivery of Lowliners meant that the entire allocation was utilised instead to carry 8 ft 6 in containers on trains to and from London Thamesport, circumventing the restricted clearances on the former South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway. The withdrawal of Sealink&#x27;s dedicated freight service from Holyhead also brought about the end of Freightliner&#x27;s dedicated service to Northern Ireland via North Wales.

===Privatisation - Freightliner (1995) Ltd===

As part of the Privatisation of British Rail, the loss-making RfD division came under increasing pressure, leading to the immediate closure of the Speedlink division. Freightliner closed the residual domestic-serving depots, including London&#x27;s Willesden and Stratford, Bristol (closed in 1992, later reopened in 2014) Glasgow Gushetfaulds, and consolidation of Manchester&#x27;s traffic on the newly opened Euroterminal (later switched back to the previously closed Trafford Park).

The Freightliner business unit had its assets transferred into a new company, Freightliner (1995) Limited, in preparation for sale. Rejected as not sufficiently profitable by English Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway, on 25 May 1996, Freightliner was purchased in a management buyout backed by 3i and Electra Private Equity for a sum of £5.4 million. As part of the sale agreement, the UK Government awarded the company a track-access grant of £75 million up until the year 2000.
Freightliner&#x27;s immediate need was for improved reliability from its locomotive fleet. During 1997, the company commissioned Brush Traction to rebuild of six of its Class 47 locomotives to create the Class 57, which was fitted with reconditioned General Motors power units and reworked ex-Class 56 alternator groups. The first of these was released in July 1998, and coincided with the unveiling of the new British Racing Green Freightliner livery. After an evaluation period, Freightliner was sufficiently impressed to order a further six in June 1999, with plans for an eventual fleet of 25. However, in actuality, no additional Class 57 locomotives were delivered to Freightliner, largely due to the company opting to place orders for new-built Class 66s, all being leased from Porterbrook.

During 1999, Freightliner established its Heavy Haul business. In March 2004, Freightliner launched Logico, providing short-term or one-off spaces on intermodal trains, it is typically active at major British freight hubs such as the South Wales International Terminal and the Port of Felixstowe. By 2014, Freightliner was actively trying to increase such trains in response to requests for higher service frequencies from ports.

During 2007, Freightliner commenced operations in Poland; its primary activity in the Polish market has been the haulage of aggregates and coal traffic.

===Post-privatisation===

On 13 June 2008, Freightliner Group was purchased by Railinvest Holding Company Limited, a subsidiary of Arcapita Bank of Bahrain.

On 30 June 2009, Freightliner commenced operations in Australia, having secured an initial contract with Namoi Cotton Co-operative to haul containerised processed cotton traffic in New South Wales. Over the following six years, it would become an accredited rail service provider in Western Australia, Southern Australia and Queensland, as well as expanding into hauling coal and other agricultural traffic for various customers in New South Wales.

In February 2015, as part of the sale of Freightliner from Arcapita Bank to Genesee &amp; Wyoming, the latter purchased a 95% shareholding which increased to 100% in 2020. At the time of the acquisition, Freightliner&#x27;s portfolio comprised approximately 250 standard gauge locomotives along with 5,500 wagons, and had a headcount in excess of 2,500 employees worldwide.

On 12 November 2015, British Rail Class 47 No. 47830 (D1645), which is operated by Freightliner, was named &quot;Beeching&#x27;s Legacy&quot; to mark 50 years since the first container train ran under British Rail.

In April 2018, Freightliner unveiled its new brand identity during an event at the NEC Birmingham, bringing the brand inline with parent company Genesee &amp; Wyoming.

On 1 July 2019, it was announced that Freightliner&#x27;s parent company Genesee &amp; Wyoming is to be bought for US$8.4billion by a consortium including Brookfield Infrastructure, GIC and Brookfield&#x27;s institutional partners.

In April 2024, Freightliner UK and Europe split from G&amp;W becoming sister companies, since they were both still owned by Brookfield and GIC.

==Subsidiaries==
Freightliner Group has the following subsidiaries: 
* Freightliner Ltd
* Freightliner Heavy Haul
* Freightliner Maintenance (has maintenance facilities in the United Kingdom at Crewe Basford Hall, Leeds Midland Road and Ipswich)
* Freightliner Poland and Germany
* Rotterdam Rail Feeding
* Pentalver Container Sales &amp; Conversions

==Operations==
===United Kingdom===

When Freightliner was privatised in 1996, it only operated Intermodal container services. These ran from ports including Felixstowe, Southampton and Tilbury to terminals such as Birmingham, Trafford Park in Manchester, Stourton (Leeds), Coatbridge (Central Scotland), Ashton Gate (Bristol), and Wentlooge (Newport, South Wales). The network has been expanded with additional destinations added. Freightliner also operate an extensive road distribution network with 300 road vehicles. Freightliner also provides drivers for Scottish TransPennine Express services.

In 1999, Freightliner set up Heavy Haul initially operating railway infrastructure trains for Network Rail moving ballast, rails etc. before moving into other bulk loads including aggregates, cement, coal, petroleum, scrap metal and waste. Initially run as a division of Freightliner Limited, in 2001 operations were transferred to a new subsidiary, Freightliner Heavy Haul Limited. Reportedly, Heavy Haul operations were hit particularly hard during the Great Recession that started in 2008, but, the firm was actively acquiring additional wagons and staff in order to accommodate new growth on top of the recovery of demand from many of its established customers by 2015. Furthermore, due to a lack of available slots on most mainlines, there was an increased emphasis on running longer trains rather than routing additional ones. 

During April 2006, Freightliner Maintenance Limited was established as a separate entity dedicated to the repair and maintenance of traction and rolling stock. It acquired a maintenance depot and took on 13 staff in Leeds from a former supplier that same year, and was promptly made responsible for the maintenance of Freightliner&#x27;s 75 Heavy Haul locomotives. Within its first three years, the division had extended its scope into wagon maintenance, and was reportedly consistently achieving a 95% availability rate on the company&#x27;s 657 coal wagons; it also had engineering teams and mobile workshops stationed in Birmingham, London, Bristol, York, Scotland and Crewe that undertook scheduled maintenance along with unexpected call-outs. The subsidiary competitively tenders for maintenance work, without any preference from the rest of the company. By 2011, Freightliner Maintenance was servicing all 111 of the company&#x27;s UK-based Class 66 locomotives, and had branched into both track maintenance and rail freight development activities as well.

In October 2021, the company switched most of its electric operations to diesel trains due to the increased cost of electricity. One month later, Freightliner announced positive results from an alternative fuel trial it was conducted for its diesel-powered fleet, allegedly halving the carbon emissions incurred.

===Poland===

During 2006, Freightliner expanded its operations into Poland. A subsidiary company, Freightliner PL Sp. z o.o., was established to bid for contracts hauling coal traffic. The first contract was for coal transport from Lubelski Węgiel Bogdanka SA near Bogdanka (Bogdanka-Lublin coal mine) to Kozienice Power Station. The service began in September 2007. Most of Freightliner PL&#x27;s services operate on the Gdańsk to Warsaw corridor and in southern Poland. In February 2015, Freightliner PL signed a €17.5M contract to lease five Newag Gliwice electric six-axle E6DCF Dragon locomotives from ING Lease. With each equipped with a diesel engine for last-mile operation, they are scheduled to be delivered from May to July 2016. Furthermore, Freightliner opted to export 13 of its Class 66 locomotives from the UK to Poland for operations there.

===Australia===
Freightliner began exploring opportunities in the Australian rail market with Freightliner Australia established by April 2007. By June 2008 Freightliner Australia had been accredited as a rail operator in the state of New South Wales and by September 2009 also had accreditation in Queensland and Western Australia. In June 2009, Freightliner Australia commenced operating containerised cotton services from Wee Waa to Port Botany. In September 2009 Freightliner Australia signed a 10-year deal with Xstrata to haul export coal from the Hunter Valley to Newcastle, commencing in September 2010. Under the deal, Xstrata owned the rolling stock with Freightliner Australia providing the engineering, logistics, maintenance and operational support. In May 2012 Freightliner Australia commenced operating a Warren to Port Botany service.

In December 2016, Glencore, who had purchased Xsrata, sold its Hunter Valley coal haulage business to Genesee &amp; Wyoming Australia that was also owned by Freightliner&#x27;s parent company Genesee &amp; Wyoming. Freightliner&#x27;s Australian business was merged into Genesee &amp; Wyoming Australia and the brand retired.

===Netherlands===

In 2013, Freightliner bought Netherlands-based intermodal container operator European Rail Shuttle B.V. from Maersk Line. This subsidiary, has focused on the cross-border intermodal traffic that runs between the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to various cities across Germany, Poland, Italy and elsewhere in continental Europe. In 2018 the business was sold to Swiss-based Hupac.

==Fleet==
===United Kingdom===
Freightliner inherited a fleet of ageing Class 47 diesel locomotives and Class 86 and Class 90 electric locomotives from British Rail.

In 1997, Freightliner placed an order for six Class 57 locomotives. These were rebuilt by Brush Traction at Loughborough from Class 47s and fitted with a refurbished EMD engine and a reconditioned alternator, improving reliability and performance. The first was delivered in July 1998. After an evaluation period Freightliner was sufficiently impressed to order a further six in June 1999.
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Freightliner placed multiple orders for new-build Class 66s, cumulating in 111 locomotives being delivered to the company. In order to better haul heavier trains, Freightliner directed that several of its Class 66s be regeared, which resulted in a reduced maximum speed in exchange for a higher tractive effort. Once in service, the type proved to be quite reliable, with Freightliner reportedly recording a regular availability rate of 98% along with an average of 70,000 miles between failures, more than double that of the Class 57 fleet. By 2004, the company&#x27;s Class 66s had replaced all of the Class 47s, as well as the Class 57s after another two years. Freightliner also leased some Class 66s that had been formerly operated by Direct Rail Services.

During November 2007, Freightliner announced an order for 30 Class 70s under a project called &quot;Project Genesis&quot;. The first two were delivered in November 2009. These have released a number of Class 66s with five going to Colas Rail, 13 to Freightliner Poland and four to GB Railfreight.

Freightliner also used their single Class 47 (47830) on driver route learning. In 2024, 47830 was sold to Locomotive Services Limited and was repainted into BR Green.

===Poland===
Freightliner PL ordered seven EMD Class 66s as well as 432 Greenbrier Eamnoss type coal hopper wagons. These have been supplemented by an EMD Class 66 formerly used by Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln and 12 Class 66s transferred from Freightliner&#x27;s UK operations. A 13th was sent from the UK in October 2012. These units underwent various modifications to allow them to operate on the Polish network.

===Australia===
Freightliner Australia commenced operations using hired in GL class locomotives from Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia (CFCLA). After a longer-term lease was agreed, two were repainted into Freightliner livery in September 2010. The Warren service that commenced in May 2012 also used locomotives hired from CFCLA. Two CF class locomotives were repainted in Freightliner livery. The Xstrata coal contract was operated by XRN class locomotives that were owned by the customer. Wagon types are PHEH and PHYH for the coal traffic and CQBY, CQFY and CQYY on the grain traffic.

In January 2015 two G class locomotives were purchased.

<text>Wilhelm Heinrich Walter Baade (March 24, 1893 – June 25, 1960) was a German astronomer who worked in the United States from 1931 to 1959.

== Early life and education ==
Baade was born the son of a teacher in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He finished school in 1912. He then studied maths, physics and astronomy at the universities of Münster and Göttingen. He received his PhD in 1919.

==Career==
Baade worked at Hamburg Observatory at Bergedorf from 1919 to 1931. In 1920 he discovered 944 Hidalgo, the first of a class of minor planets now called Centaurs which cross the orbits of giant planets.

From 1931 to 1958, he worked at Mount Wilson Observatory

In 1937, the University of Hamburg wanted Baade as successor of Richard Schorr for the Hamburg Observatory, but he refused.

At Mount Wilson Observatory, during World War II, he took advantage of wartime blackout conditions (which reduced light pollution), to resolve stars in the center of the Andromeda Galaxy for the first time. These observations led him to define distinct &quot;populations&quot; for stars (Population I and Population II). The same observations led him to discover that there are two types of Cepheid variable stars. Using this discovery he recalculated the size of the known universe, doubling the previous calculation made by Edwin Hubble in 1929. He announced this finding to considerable astonishment at the 1952 meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Rome.

Together with Fritz Zwicky, he identified supernovae as a new category of astronomical objects. Zwicky and he also proposed the existence of neutron stars, and suggested supernovae might create them.

Beginning in 1952, he and Rudolph Minkowski identified the optical counterparts of various radio sources, including Cygnus A. He discovered 10 asteroids, including 944 Hidalgo, which has a long orbital period (it is actually the first centaur ever discovered, although they were not recognized as a distinct dynamical class until 1977); the Apollo-class 1566 Icarus, the perihelion of which is closer than that of Mercury; and the Amor-type 1036 Ganymed.

==Personal life==

He died in 1960 in Göttingen, West Germany.

<text>Leiopelma is a genus of New Zealand primitive frogs, belonging to the suborder Archaeobatrachia. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Leiopelmatidae. The leiopelmatids&#x27; relatively basal form indicates they have an ancient lineage. While some taxonomists have suggested combining the North American frogs of the genus &quot;Ascaphus&quot; in the family Ascaphidae with the New Zealand frogs of the genus &quot;Leiopelma&quot; in the family Leiopelmatidae, the current consensus is that these two groups constitute two separate families. The three extant species of Leiopelmatidae are only found in New Zealand.

==Overview==
The New Zealand primitive frogs&#x27; defining characteristics are their extra vertebrae (for a total of nine) and the remains of the tail muscles (the tail itself is absent in adults, although it is present in the younger frogs, which need the extra skin surface until their lungs are fully developed). The family Ascaphidae (found only in North America), of the same suborder, shares these primitive characteristics, hence the two have often been described as related, or even part of the same family.

Late jump recovery is unique in Leiopelmatidae. When leiopelmatid species jump, they land in a &quot;belly flop&quot; fashion, repositioning their limbs for takeoff for the next jump only after hitting the ground with the ventral surface of their torsos. The appearance of early jump recovery in more advanced taxa is a key innovation in anuran evolution.

They are unusually small frogs, only in length. Most species lay their eggs in moist ground, typically under rocks or vegetation. After hatching, the tadpoles nest in the male&#x27;s back, all without the need for standing or flowing water. However, Hochstetter&#x27;s frog lays its eggs in shallow ponds and has free-living tadpoles, although they do not swim far from the place of hatching, or even feed, before metamorphosing into adult frogs. Lifespans may be long (more than 30 years) for such small organisms.

Introduced fauna are thought to have had a negative impact on these native frogs, with 93% of all reported predation events on native frogs being attributed to introduced fauna, primarily ship rats.

==Taxonomy &amp; systematics==
===Species===
Family Leiopelmatidae
* Genus Leiopelma
** Archey&#x27;s frog, &quot;Leiopelma archeyi&quot; 
** Hamilton&#x27;s frog, &quot;Leiopelma hamiltoni&quot; 
** Hochstetter&#x27;s frog, &quot;Leiopelma hochstetteri&quot; 

====Extinct species====
Three extinct species are known by subfossil remains, also from New Zealand. They became extinct during the past 1,000 years.
* †Aurora frog, &quot;Leiopelma auroraensis&quot;
* †Markham&#x27;s frog,&quot; Leiopelma markhami&quot;
* †Waitomo frog, &quot;Leiopelma waitomoensis&quot;
One species from the late Pliocene period has recently been described.

* †&quot;Leiopelma bishopi&quot; 

Two species are known from Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans fauna, with indeterminate remains possibly representing additional species

* †&quot;Leiopelma miocaenale&quot;
* †&quot;Leiopelma acricarina&quot;

=== Evolutionary history ===
DNA analysis indicates that Leiopelmatidae share a distant common ancestry with Ascaphidae to the exclusion of all other frogs, and Leiopelmatidae and Ascaphidae diverged from all other frogs around 200 million years ago. &quot;L. archeyi&quot; and &quot;L. hochstetteri&quot; are thought to have diverged from each other between 40 and 50 million years ago, based on genomic divergence estimates. Fossils of the genus are known from the early Miocene (19–16 million years ago) aged St Bathans Fauna of New Zealand.

<text>Mala is a Telugu caste from the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are also present in smaller numbers in the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. They are classified as a Scheduled Caste (SC) by the Government of India. According to 2001 census data, Malas constituted 41.6 percent (5.39 lakh) of the Scheduled Castes population in the then state of Andhra Pradesh, which also included the present state of Telangana.

==History==
During the 12th century, Palanati Brahmanaidu, the minister of Palnadu, took Kannamma Dasu, a Mala who valiantly fought and died in the Battle of Palnadu, under his patronage. Subsequently, the descendants of Kannama Dasu were known as Mala Dasulus and were appointed as head priests of the Chennakesava Swamy Temples. Malas are traditional silk weavers as well. Even these sects exists presently in some parts of Andhra Pradesh.

In 1909, Edgar Thurston noted that Malas were originally a tribe of freelance hill warriors and paid mercenaries who raided and looted under the Polygars of Vijayanagara.

In the 19th century, many Malas, especially in coastal Andhra, converted to Lutheranism after the arrival of Christian missionaries.

In 1917, Bhagya Reddy Varma &amp; Aringe Ramaswamy organised Adi-Andhra movement led Malas alongside Madigas to be part of Dravidian ideology. In the census of 1931, about a lot of them mentioned their castes as Adi Andhra and were officially included into the list of Depressed Classes in 1935 Govt. of India Acts and later got carried in 1950 Constitution of India.

With the advent of the Green revolution, Reddys, who had bought up lands from the erstwhile Brahmin landlords. However, the landless Dalits (mainly Malas) and backward classes still faced dire circumstances due to lack of support from various governments. Dalits were unable to obtain land, or quality education. Starting in the 1980s with the political ascendancy of the Reddy communities, Malas and other Dalits became the targets of violence with increasing frequency and brutality. Influenced by Ambedkarite and Marxist thought, the Dalit Mahasabha, with charismatic leaders such as Katti Padma Rao and Bhojja Tarakam sought the annihilation of caste and untouchability through social transformation, very different from the Gandhian ideals of &quot;upliftment.&quot; Their demands also included true land reform. A boost to their organization occurred after the brutal Tsundur massacre of 1991, where Reddys slaughtered 8 Malas. However, the movement was weakened when Rao sought to enter electoral politics.

== Politics ==
When the Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party won the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 1993, it gave hope to Katti Padma Rao that a similar victory could be achieved in Andhra Pradesh. However, because of this, the movement split: with Rao leading a faction favouring political influence and Tarakam leading a separate faction. Rao&#x27;s dreams were shattered by the assembly elections of 1994, where the TDP promised a slew of populist schemes to counter the mobilization of subaltern castes and won decisively.

Tarakam opposed the &#x27;Madiga Dandora Movement&#x27; in 1990s related to categorisation of the Scheduled Caste quota and denied allegations of snatching major share of caste quotas and established &#x27;Mala Mahanadu&#x27; to counter its demands. However, the CBN government, sensing an opportunity to divide the Dalits, established a commission which recommended sub-categorization of SC quota. This infuriated the Malas and inexorably divided the Malas and Madigas, so that a united Dalit movement would be less strong than earlier.

==Culture==
The Mala of Andhra Pradesh are considered a righthand community (valangai - agricultural basis), whilst the Madiga of the region are the left-hand (idangai - castes based on manufacturing, eg., leatherwork).

==Distribution==
According to Government of India census data from 2001, Malas constituted 41.6 percent (5,139,305) of the Scheduled Castes (SC) population in the then state of Andhra Pradesh, which has subsequently been bifurcated by the creation of Telangana state.

They are also classified as a Scheduled Caste in Karnataka.

==Mala Conversion==
A significant section of the Mala, and almost all in Coastal Andhra, turned to Christianity but after noticing the similar caste politics in the Telugu Catholic church, shifted to Protestantism instead. They are mainly prominent in the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church (AELC) and Church of South India (CSI).

They made good use of the Christian educational programs, elevating some of their social position and now form part of the upper middle class. These Christian Malas are commonly called &quot;Merugumala&quot; people, who came from Godavari Krishna basin. They are eligible to avail themselves of reservation under &quot;Backward Classes -C&quot; category with 1% reservation at state level and as Other Backward Class at the national level, although many claim no reservation and form part of the general Forward caste category.

Some have been demanding central Government to accord them SC status on par with Dalit Buddhists, Dalit Sikhs and not to discriminate them on religious grounds for being Dalit Christians. The case related to their demand is pending with the Supreme Court of India since 2005.

<doc id="586661" wikidata="Q140874" url="?curid=586661" title="1566 Icarus">
<text>1566 Icarus ( ; &quot;provisional designation&quot;: ) is a large near-Earth object of the Apollo group and the lowest numbered potentially hazardous asteroid. It has an extremely eccentric orbit (0.83) and measures approximately in diameter. In 1968, it became the first asteroid ever observed by radar. Its orbit brings it closer to the Sun than Mercury and further out than the orbit of Mars, which also makes it a Mercury-, Venus-, and Mars-crossing asteroid. This stony asteroid and relatively fast rotator with a period of 2.27 hours was discovered on 27 June 1949, by German astronomer Walter Baade at the Palomar Observatory in California. It was named after the mythological Icarus.

== Orbit and classification ==
Icarus orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.19–1.97 AU once every 13 months (409 days; semi-major axis of 1.08 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.83 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar in 1949.

At perihelion, Icarus comes closer to the Sun than Mercury, i.e. it is a Mercury-crossing asteroid. It is also a Venus and Mars-crosser. From 1949 until the discovery of 3200 Phaethon in 1983, it was known as the asteroid that passed closest to the Sun. Since then hundreds of Mercury-crossers have been found, the closest ones are now being and &quot;(also see )&quot;.

=== Meteor shower ===

Icarus is thought to be the source of the Arietids, a strong daylight meteor shower. However other objects such as the short-period Sun-grazing comet 96P/Machholz are also possible candidates for the shower&#x27;s origin.

=== Close approaches ===

Icarus has an &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of , which translates into 13.7 lunar distances (LD). This near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid makes close approaches to Earth in June at intervals of 9, 19, or 28 years.

On 14 June 1968, it came as close as . During this approach, Icarus became the first minor planet to be observed using radar, with measurements obtained at the Haystack Observatory and the Goldstone Tracking Station.

The last close approach was on 16 June 2015, when Icarus passed Earth at . Before that, the previous close approach was on 11 June 1996, at , almost 40 times as far as the Moon. The next notably close approach will be on 13 June 2043, at from Earth.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Icarus, son of Daedalus &quot;(also see 1864 Daedalus)&quot; from Greek mythology. They attempted to escape prison by means of wings constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus ignored his father&#x27;s instructions not to fly too close to the Sun. When the wax in his wings melted he fell into the sea and drowned. The naming was suggested by R. C. Cameron and Dr. Folkman. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in January 1950 (). Both mythological figures are honored with the lunar craters &quot;Icarus&quot; and &quot;Daedalus&quot;.

== Physical characteristics ==

Radiometric observation characterized Icarus as a stony S-type and Q-type asteroid.

=== Rotation period ===

Since 1968, several rotational lightcurves of Icarus were obtained from photometric and radiometric observations. During the asteroid&#x27;s close approach in June 2017, observations of the fast-moving object were taken by Italian astronomers Virginio Oldani and Federico Manzini, Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station () in California, and by Australian astronomers at the Darling Range and Blue Mountains Observatories ().

Lightcurve analysis gave it a consolidated rotation period of 2.2726 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 magnitude (). Icarus is a relatively fast rotator, near the threshold where non-solid rubble piles fly apart.

=== Spin axis ===

Analysis of 2015 radar observations obtained at the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Observatory yields a spin axis of (270.0°, −81.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to several radiometric, photometric, and radar observations, including the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Icarus measures between 1.0 and 1.44 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.14 and 0.51.

Analysis of the radar data obtained at the Arecibo and Goldstone observatories in June 2015 gives the body&#x27;s dimensions: kilometers, with equivalent diameter of 1.44 kilometers. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts an albedo of 0.14 based on the radar-derived equivalent diameter of 1.44 kilometers and absolute magnitude of 16.96.

== Research interests ==

Icarus is being studied to better understand general relativity, solar oblateness, and Yarkovsky drift. In its case, the perihelion precession caused by general relativity is 10.05 arcseconds per Julian century.

== Project Icarus ==

&quot;Project Icarus&quot; was a student project conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the spring of 1967 as a contingency plan in case of an impending collision with .

This project was an assignment by Paul Sandorff for his group of MIT systems engineering graduate students to devise a plan to use rockets to deflect or destroy Icarus in the case that it was found to be on a collision course with planet Earth. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran an article on the endeavor in June 1967 and the following year the student report was published as a book.

The students&#x27; plan relied on the new Saturn V rocket, which did not make its first flight until after the report had been completed. During the course of their study, the students visited the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, where they were so impressed with the Vehicle Assembly Building that they wrote of &quot;the awesome reality&quot; that had &quot;completely erased&quot; their doubts over using the technology associated with the Apollo program and Saturn rockets.

The final plan hypothesized that six Saturn V rockets (appropriated from the then-current Apollo program) would be used, each launched at variable intervals from months to hours away from impact. Each rocket was to be fitted with a single 100-megaton nuclear warhead as well as a modified Apollo Service Module and uncrewed Apollo Command Module for guidance to the target. The warheads would be detonated 30 meters from the surface, deflecting or partially destroying the asteroid. Depending on the subsequent impacts on the course or the destruction of the asteroid, later missions would be modified or cancelled as needed. The &quot;last-ditch&quot; launch of the sixth rocket would be 18 hours prior to impact.

== In fiction ==
The Project Icarus report later served as the basis and inspiration for the 1979 science fiction film &quot;Meteor&quot;.

&quot;Summertime on Icarus&quot; is a science fiction short story by British writer Arthur C. Clarke.

<text>U.S. Route 91 or U.S. Highway 91 (US 91) is a north–south United States highway running from Brigham City, Utah, to Idaho Falls, Idaho, in the U.S. states of Idaho and Utah. Despite the &quot;1&quot; as the last digit in the number, US 91 is no longer a cross-country artery, as it has mostly been replaced by Interstate 15. The highway currently serves to connect the communities of the Cache Valley to I-15 and beyond. Prior to the mid-1970s, US 91 was an international commerce route from Long Beach, California, to the Canada–US border north of Sweetgrass, Montana. US 91 was routed on the main streets of most of the communities it served, including Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas and State Street in Salt Lake City. From Los Angeles to Salt Lake, the route was built along the corridor of the Arrowhead Trail. A portion of the highway&#x27;s former route in California is currently State Route 91.

==Route description==
===Utah===

US 91 begins at Brigham City. The highway was originally routed through Brigham City, but today runs on a southern bypass (locally designated 1100 South). The original routing is now State Route 90. In Brigham City, US 89 becomes concurrent with US 91. 

After leaving Brigham City, the highway begins to climb the Wellsville Mountains. The entire grade across these mountains is colloquially called &quot;Sardine Canyon&quot;. However, Sardine Canyon is the canyon originally used by the first settlers to mark a trail to Cache Valley, so named as they used the litter from their lunch of canned sardines to mark the trail. A new route was constructed in the 1950s that uses the same mountain pass, Sardine Summit, as the old road, however follows different canyons down from the summit. Despite the modern route of US 91 no longer using Sardine Canyon, the name continues to be used by locals and news media alike in describing the traffic, weather conditions or scenery along the entire grade across the Wellsville Mountains.

US 91 enters the Wellsville Mountains via Box Elder Canyon in a climb to the lake and town of Mantua, which has a reputation as a speed trap. After passing the reservoir, the highway resumes climbing, using Dry Canyon to reach Sardine Summit. The highway descends through Wellsville Canyon and reaches the Cache Valley, where it serves as the major thoroughfare. Logan is the largest city in the valley. At Logan, US 89 splits off to the east towards Bear Lake, while US 91 continues north through the valley to the Idaho state line. Both the Utah and Idaho portions of Cache Valley are part of the Logan metropolitan area.

The Utah section of US 91 is defined at Utah Code Annotated § 72-4-115(1). In addition, the segment south of the SR-142 intersection in Richmond is included in the National Highway System.

===Idaho===
US 91 continues serving the Idaho portion of the Cache Valley with Preston as the largest city. The highway passes by the Bear River Massacre Site, a National Historic Landmark, near Preston, and over the geologically significant Red Rock Pass, near Downey.

After leaving Cache Valley, the highway then crosses back to rejoin Interstate 15. At Pocatello, US 91, US 30, and I-15 Business Loop separate from Interstate 15 and run concurrently, passing through a small portion of the Idaho State University campus. US 30 separates from US 91 near Pocatello&#x27;s city hall at what was once the starting point of one of Idaho&#x27;s first designated highways, the Yellowstone Park Highway. From this point the highway generally follows the original route of the Yellowstone Park Highway northeastward, until it reaches its terminus at its intersection with US 26, south of Idaho Falls.

==History==
At its peak, from 1947 to 1965, U.S. Route 91 extended from the Pacific Ocean at Long Beach, California, to Coutts, Alberta. Though a good portion of the highway fit the US highway numbering grid, overall, US 91&#x27;s northern terminus was east of US 89, while its southern terminus was west of US 101. North of Riverside, California, US 91 followed a route that would be largely paralleled by modern I-15 and I-215 where these routes did not completely supplant it. There are some parts where US 91/I-15 had divergent paths. The more southerly is from Littlefield, Arizona, to St. George, Utah, where the two routes took different paths through the Arizona Strip. The more northerly and longer is the surviving portion of US 91 from Brigham City to Downey, where Interstate 15 follows an old route of U.S. Route 191.

Utah first submitted a petition to AASHTO to have the US 91 designation truncated in 1971. This petition was approved on June 21, 1971. However, the state did not take action until 1974. Utah officials co-ordinated a second petition with the transportation departments of California, Nevada and Arizona. In this unified petition officials in Utah proposed the number changeover take place in 1974. Nevada requested postponing the deletion of US 91 as Nevada expected to complete the last piece of I-15 in 1975. Nevada officials suggested U.S. Route 40 be similarly truncated, as this highway largely duplicated Interstate 80 in the same states. Despite Nevada&#x27;s request, the petition was submitted and approved in 1974.

Retracing the path of historic U.S. Route 91 is possible but difficult. In most cities the route of US 91 is still in use as a local street or highway. In many rural areas, I-15 was built on top of the former US 91.

The highway passed through the following states:
* California (until 1974)
* Nevada (until 1974)
* Arizona (10 miles (16 km) in the Arizona Strip, until 1974)
* Utah
* Idaho
* Montana (until 1980)

===California===

US 91&#x27;s original southern terminus was at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue (historically SR 15) and East Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) in Long Beach. This intersection also marked the historic western terminus of US 6, which proceeded west from that intersection. East of the intersection, US 91 proceeded east along East Pacific Coast Highway to Los Alamitos Circle.
The portions in California were replaced with:
*SR 1 (Pacific Coast Highway from Atlantic Avenue to Los Alamitos Circle)
*SR 19 (Lakewood Boulevard from Los Alamitos Circle to Lincoln Avenue)
*SR 214 (route no longer a state highway – Carson Street and Lincoln Avenue)
*SR 91
*I-215
*I-15

===Nevada===

The route of US 91 in Nevada was replaced with I-15 in 1974.

South of Las Vegas, most of the old route is still intact, as it runs parallel and to the east of the freeway from Jean to Sloan. Visitors to the popular &quot;Seven Magic Mountains&quot; art installation must travel at least a dozen miles on the old route to reach the site.

In Las Vegas, US 91 was better known as Las Vegas Boulevard (State Route 604 after the 1976 renumbering of most Nevada state highways). The intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street is the historic intersection with U.S. 93 and U.S. 95. Here, U.S. 466 parted ways with US 91 and headed southeast on Fremont Street with southbound US 93 and US 95. At this intersection, US 93 and 95 departed Fremont Street and turned northeast onto Las Vegas Boulevard, heading northbound with US 91. A few blocks further up, at Bonanza Road, US 95 turned west until it hit Rancho Drive, then continued north. US 91/93 stayed aligned with Las Vegas Boulevard, which turned into Salt Lake Highway after departing the city of North Las Vegas.

Until its decertification in 1974, US 91 followed I-15 to exit 112, where it took present-day NV 170 through Riverside to Mesquite, turned right onto NV 144 (Mesquite Boulevard and Sandhill Boulevard), and then followed Hillside Drive into Arizona (where the road became Fairview Avenue).

===Arizona===

US 91 entered Arizona from Nevada on Fairview Avenue and followed it northeast to Littlefield. Once Fairview Avenue crosses I-15, it became Cane Beds Road through downtown Beaver Dam and into Utah, where the road continued as Old Highway 91. Today, this section of US 91 is known as Mohave County Road 91.

===Utah===
From the State Line to Saint George US 91 followed a semi-circular route that given the name Old Dixie Highway 91 in 2023. Washington County officials gave the former segment of US 91 the name as part of an effort to preserve the nickname Utah&#x27;s Dixie for this region of Utah, co-inciding with the removal of the name Dixie from Utah Tech University. 
Dixie Highway 91 continues to Santa Clara and followed what is now SR-8 and SR-18 to St. George. Where SR-18 intersects St. George Blvd, US 91 then continued east on St. George Blvd. (SR-34) until it intersected Red Cliffs Rd. From there, US 91 went in a north-east direction, with Red Cliffs becoming Telegraph St. in Washington. US 91 followed on Telegraph until becoming Main St. in Leeds. After leaving Leeds, Old 91 is still intact until about a half mile north of the junction with SR-228 where its routing runs right into I-15.

US 91 picks up again in Black Rock in northern Washington County at exit 36 on I-15. It continues parallel to I-15 until just past exit 40, then picks up again on the other side of the freeway. This section of the road is not maintained and some of the original paving is still visible between the end of the road at Lower Taylor Creek Trailhead and when normal paving resumes near the road to New Harmony (old SR-144), at I-15 exit 42. The road, marked as Old US 91, then runs north through Kanarraville and into Cedar City near exit 57, merging into Main St (SR-130) until near the city border with Enoch just past exit 62. Old US 91 continues to parallel I-15 to Summit. The road crosses I-15 again at exit 71 and continues its original route through Parowan, merging with SR-274 after briefly running along modern SR-143. There is no additional signage in Parowan to indicate the original route, though historical maps show that it follows SR-271 through Paragonah. There are some frontage roads along I-15 through Beaver that may be sections of the original highway in Iron County.

In Beaver County, sections of SR-160 through Beaver and the road running north through Manderfield use original sections of US 91. There are also sections of roadway that used to be US 91 from before exit 129 through Cove Fort, Utah, in Millard County, intersecting both I-70 and later I-15 north of the I-70/I-15 interchange, including what is now SR-161. Some frontage roads along I-15 may be parts of US 91. The route picks up again at exit 146 on SR-133 through Kanosh and Meadow before being supplanted by frontage roads and I-15. SR-99 through Fillmore and SR-64 through Holden are also pieces of US 91 before running concurrently with US 50 until it merges again with I-15.

The original alignment of US 91 also diverges from I-15 through most of Juab County. At Chicken Creek Reservoir, the historic route of US 91 leaves I-15 and follows SR-78 northeast to Levan where it turns north along modern SR-28 and continues through Nephi along that city&#x27;s Main Street. North of Nephi, it follows what is now Mona Road, passing through Mona, before rejoining the modern I-15 alignment near Rocky Ridge. In Utah County, the old US 91 leaves I-15 again at Santaquin, following SR-198 northeast through Payson and Salem before reaching Spanish Fork. In Spanish Fork, it ran north on Main Street (now SR-156, east on 800 North, and northeast on what is now SR-51 to Springville.

In Springville US 91 first joined US 89 at one of the oldest grade-separated interchanges in Utah (this portion is now SR-51). From this junction to Logan the two highways ran mostly concurrent. This portion is mostly intact as US 89.

However, US 91 diverged from US 89 between Farmington and Ogden. US 91 split away on what is now State Route 273, State Route 126 and State Route 26. These highways form the Main Street through Kaysville and Layton; State Street from the Layton-Clearfield border to Main Street in Clearfield though the city of Sunset turning into 1900 West at the Sunset-Roy border, then following 1900 West to a junction with Riverdale Road in Roy, then following Riverdale Road through Riverdale, and then meeting back up with US 89 at Washington Blvd in Ogden.

===Idaho===
US 91 formerly entered Idaho Falls along Yellowstone Highway, and returned to the course of modern I-15 north of town. The highway then proceeded north toward Monida Pass where the highway entered Montana. In some small towns streets used by the route are called &quot;Old Highway 91&quot;.

===Montana===
In Montana, the highway&#x27;s alignment slightly changed with the construction of the Clark Canyon Dam.

Starting just south of Dillon, I-15 was built on a new alignment that mostly parallels US 91 and crosses over it several times. In Dillon, the former route of the highway is now known as Atlantic Street and Montana Street. The highway formerly joined with U.S. Route 10 between Rocker and downtown Butte and took a northeasterly path to Elk Park Pass before it was rerouted to its current alignment east of Butte in 1980 (today&#x27;s southbound lanes of I-15). It formed the main street of Boulder before I-15 was completed, and was routed through Helena along what is now Montana Secondary Highway 518 and Montana Secondary Highway 229.

Because of the new alignment of I-15 in Montana, many segments of the former US 91 are still in use today as frontage roads or sportsmen access points along the Missouri River, especially from Helena north to Great Falls and Sweetgrass, and from Butte south to Divide and Dillon.

==In popular culture==
The US 91 corridor in Idaho&#x27;s Cache Valley was the primary filming location for the 2004 movie &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. The former U.S. Route 91 corridor was also the birthplace of both McDonald&#x27;s, with the first location opening on E Street in San Bernardino (E Street was the routing of US 91 before the construction of freeways in the area), as well as the first Kentucky Fried Chicken, with the first location opening in Salt Lake City at State Street and 3900 South. The McDonald&#x27;s location is now a museum, while the KFC is still in operation with a small historical display inside the restaurant.

The novel &quot;Damnation Alley&quot; (1969) by Roger Zelazny features the beginning of a cross-country trip on Route 91, just outside of Los Angeles.

<text>Point Park University is a private university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Formerly known as Point Park College, the school name was revised in 2004 to reflect the number of graduate programs being offered. In 2021, it had a total undergraduate enrollment of 2,575 students.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The university began in 1933 as a one-room business school called Business Training College with an initial enrollment of 50 students, under the direction of Dorothy Finkelhor, a New York native, and her husband, L. Herbert Finkelhor. At the time, it was notable for a woman to found such an institution. Finkelhor provided her students with business and secretarial skills. At the same time, she served in multiple roles as teacher, the dean of women, social chairman, janitor, telephone operator, admissions and finance director, and registrar.

===Becoming a college===

By 1960, the business school had grown to nearly 880 students and moved to the university&#x27;s current academic center, Academic Hall, on Wood Street in central Downtown Pittsburgh. The Finkelhors&#x27; small secretarial school became &quot;Point Park Junior College&quot;, named for the city&#x27;s historic Point State Park. The junior college added two-year programs in engineering technology, education and journalism. It also acquired performing arts space at The Pittsburgh Playhouse in the Oakland neighborhood. Five years later, the college was granted four-year status, officially becoming &quot;Point Park College&quot;. Dance and theatre programs were introduced. These programs laid the groundwork for Point Park&#x27;s current Conservatory of Performing Arts.

Thirty-four years after forming the college, Dorothy Finkelhor retired in 1967. The school&#x27;s reins remained within the family as son-in-law Arthur M. Blum assumed the presidency. Blum purchased the Sherwyn Hotel, a 20-story building across from Academic Hall, which became David L. Lawrence Hall. The hall currently contains most of the school&#x27;s social and entertaining facilities, as well as classrooms, offices and residential facilities.

Blum&#x27;s Lawrence Hall investment continues to benefit the school. Blum also established a campus in Lugano, Switzerland. A gift from Lester Hamburg brought the school a conference center in Portersville, Pennsylvania.

In the early 1970s, John V. Hopkins succeeded Blum, and in time enrollment grew beyond 1,000 students. Eventually, the school introduced its first postgraduate degree, a master&#x27;s degree in journalism and mass communication.

J. Matthew Simon became the college&#x27;s next president in 1986, overseeing the acquisition of a new library, program growth and the school&#x27;s largest endowment. Simon retired in 2007, having taught at Point Park as a professor in the Department of Natural Sciences and Engineering Technology after his tenure as president.

A crisis came with the election of James Hunter as president in the mid-1990s. Hunter, Point Park&#x27;s most controversial leader, served for a little over a year but managed to garner outcry for an admissions scandal and a breakdown of communication within the school.

At the same time, growth remained slow in the city, and Pittsburgh&#x27;s economy still had not recovered from the collapse of the steel industry. The college&#x27;s finances suffered, and Point Park again neared bankruptcy. Negotiations began with Duquesne University to sell what remained of Point Park College to the larger school.

Hunter resigned amidst the melee, and Katherine Henderson was appointed president by the board of trustees soon after.

===Growth and change===
Henderson implemented a strategic plan to revive the college. Plans to sell the school were abandoned as Henderson began another procedural overhaul.

Henderson&#x27;s tenure became the most successful for Point Park. During the late 1990s, budget woes disintegrated as enrollment rose to over 3,000 students and the endowment grew by over 200 percent. Point Park finished major renovations of its existing buildings soon after the turn of the century.

By 2004, the college was officially renamed Point Park University and the administration began an aggressive $1 million branding campaign to attract more enrollment. Two years later, Henderson retired while on a self-imposed sabbatical.

The board of trustees officially named Paul Hennigan as Henderson&#x27;s permanent successor at the beginning of the 2006 fall term. Hennigan has continued the process of creating a new strategic plan. As part of the plan, the university has purchased several Downtown properties for development. Point Park is also poised to become a key player in the city&#x27;s efforts for Downtown revitalization, owning properties along the coveted Fifth and Forbes corridor.

A $16 million state-of-the-art dance complex opened in 2007. The complex includes five rehearsal and performance studios, and recently received Gold LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Located in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh, the complex is home to the George Rowland White Performance Studio, a 188-seat convertible performance space.

Point Park purchased the building occupied by the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh on the Boulevard of the Allies in the spring of 2008. In September 2010, the newly renovated former YMCA building reopened as the interim Student Center with exercise and fitness facilities and equipment, a gymnasium, meeting space and much more.

In 2015, the university began creating a &quot;New Academic Village&quot; that will make the school, and downtown, a vibrant area for students. With the introduction of this initiative, Point Park has evolved into one of the largest investors in Downtown Pittsburgh real estate development. The following year, Point Park University added a new center for journalism at the former location of Nathan&#x27;s Famous hot dogs.

In the Fall of 2018, a coffee shop opened on campus and named Point Perk in a student naming contest. This new coffee shop came after the Starbucks that was previously on campus closed its doors in 2017. While the new coffee shop is not an official corporate Starbucks, it is considered a &quot;We Proudly Brew&quot; location, giving campus food provider CulinArt full control over menu items while still serving Starbucks beverages.

==Academics==
Point Park University offers more than 90 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, and is divided into five schools: School of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Business, School of Communication, School of Education, and Conservatory of Performing Arts.

==Campus==

Point Park is situated about half a mile from Point State Park, the university&#x27;s namesake, in the city&#x27;s Golden Triangle. The school is in the midst of the business district, near both PPG Place (one of the most recognizable buildings in the city’s skyline) and the relatively new LEED Platinum Certified headquarters of PNC Financial Services. The physical campus is mostly vertical, with buildings scattered among non-school structures. Point Park owns the Pittsburgh Playhouse in the Oakland neighborhood, but has replaced it with a new complex in downtown Pittsburgh; demolition of Oakland&#x27;s Pittsburgh Playhouse was scheduled to start in June 2019. Since the campus is not contiguous, the school used the phrase &quot;Pittsburgh is our campus&quot; in its literature.

Because of its downtown locale, the school is within walking distance of the Cultural District and the city&#x27;s sports facilities, PNC Park, PPG Paints Arena, and Acrisure Stadium. It is also close to Pittsburgh&#x27;s major nightlife areas on the Southside, in Station Square, and in the Strip District. Nearly 1,000 full-time undergraduate students live on campus. The majority of Point Park students commute to campus.

With 15 buildings and other properties that run from the Monongahela River to Forbes Avenue, the university has one of the largest footprints in downtown Pittsburgh.

===Department of Public Safety===
The Campus is covered by the &quot;Point Park University Department of Public Safety&quot;, a campus police agency which provides patrol and crime prevention services to the university. Point Park University was cited in 2017 as having the highest campus crime rate per student in Pittsburgh. The department, and in particular the Police Division, have been recognized for innovation in campus law enforcement, for example having become the first campus police agency in Pennsylvania to issue body-worn cameras to officers, and the creation of an anonymous tip app.

The executive of the Point Park University Department of Public Safety is the Assistant Vice President of Public Safety and Chief of Police, currently Jeff Besong, and is appointed by Point Park University. The department consists of two divisions: The Police Division provides patrol and crime scene interaction, while the Public Safety Division provides dispatch and security monitoring services. The Police Division was established in 2011 with five officers, and was initially limited to bike and foot patrol, and became accredited by the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Association in March 2013.

==Student life==
=== Student government ===
The Student Government Association (SGA), formerly known as the United Student Government (USG) is the representative student government of Point Park University. SGA comprises two entities, the Executive Cabinet and the Legislative Body.

===WPPJ-AM student-run radio===
WPPJ (670 AM) is Point Park University&#x27;s student-run radio station. This unlicensed carrier-current station was established in 1967 and is known as &quot;The Voice of Point Park&quot;. It is a co-curricular activity for students with an interest in radio, news, sports, contemporary/popular music, media sales and promotions. WPPJ also serves as a training facility for students of any major who desire a career in professional broadcasting. The station is an open-format college radio station, playing primarily indie rock and hip-hop, with a fair number of sports and talk radio shows. The music department charts independent artists with CMJ.

==Athletics==
The Point Park athletic teams are called the Pioneers. The university is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), where they compete in Division II. The Pioneers are members of the Mountain East Conference (MEC) since the 2024–25 academic year. The Pioneers were previously a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the River States Conference (RSC; formerly known as the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC) until after spring 2016) from 2012–13 to 2023–24; as well as a member of the defunct American Mideast Conference from 1999–2000 to 2011–12 (when the conference dissolved).

Point Park competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include competitive cheer, competitive dance and eSports. Baseball is the dominant sport of the university, bringing home the most championships.

===Pioneers logo===
The Point Park Pioneers logo prominently displays the school name as well as the nickname for the sports teams – Pioneers. A central figure is the bison, which has long been a mascot for the school. The bison was first used as a school mascot in the 1967–68 school year, the first year of intercollegiate competition versus four-year institutions.

The bison became a mascot for the school in 1967 when the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity teamed with the Varsity Club to acquire a live bison. The bison was named Black Diamond II in reference to the Black Diamond bison on the reverse side of the U.S. nickel at the time. It was kept at South Park and was a featured attraction at parades on the Boulevard of the Allies as well as at sporting events.

Black Diamond II was widely popular at Point Park and was a source of pride for the entire school. Although Black Diamond II eventually died, it remains a fixture at the school at present day.

Also prominently displayed is the Downtown Pittsburgh environment of which Point Park is a part. In the back left are iconic pieces of the Pittsburgh skyline, and in the back right are two central pieces to the Point Park campus – Lawrence Hall and Academic Hall. Included is the pedestrian bridge above Wood Street that connects the two Point Park buildings. The shape at the bottom of the logo is representative of the bastions of Fort Duquesne and Fort Pitt, which were once located in the area now known as Point State Park. Point Park University derives its name from Point State Park, which is located at the meeting place of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Point State Park is just a few blocks from the university&#x27;s campus.

The head men&#x27;s basketball coach is Joe Lewandowski. The head coach of the women&#x27;s basketball team is Tony Grenek.

<text>The Locust was an American hardcore punk band from San Diego, California, known for their mix of grindcore aggression and new wave experimentation.

The band has been noted for their use of insect costumes when performing live.

== History ==
Prior to The Locust founding members Justin Pearson and Dylan Scharf were in the hardcore punk band Struggle together, formed in late 1990. The band only lasted three years. Despite this they had opportunities to share musical space with other significant bands with similar ideological perspectives such as Born Against, Downcast, Bikini Kill, and Econochrist. The band disbanded in 1994.

The Locust formed in 1994 by Pearson, Scharf, Bobby Bray, Dave Warshaw, and Dave Astor. The band was initially a powerviolence project whose first release was a split with genre pioneers Man Is the Bastard in 1995. Later releases incorporated synthesizers and became increasingly theatrical. The band regularly played shows in all-ages punk clubs in Los Angeles and San Diego, usually donning insect costumes.

In September 1998, The Locust released their first full-length album, &quot;The Locust&quot;, through Gold Standard Laboratories.

On June 24, 2003, The Locust released their second full-length album, &quot;Plague Soundscapes&quot;, through ANTI-.

On March 20, 2007, The Locust released their third and ultimately final full-length album, &quot;New Erections&quot;, through ANTI-. After a lengthy touring schedule following the release of &quot;New Erections&quot;, The Locust went on hiatus.

On May 18, 2010, The Locust released an archive recording of their Peel Session recorded 9 years prior in 2001, simply named &quot;The Peel Sessions&quot;, released through Radio Surgery. This 16-track recording was the first time Gabe Serbian had started playing drums for The Locust, finalizing the lineup of Bobby Bray, Joey Karam, Justin Pearson and Gabe Serbian that would stay the same for the rest of their time together.

On July 31, 2012, The Locust released a compilation album, &quot;Molecular Genetics from the Gold Standard Labs,&quot; through ANTI-. The album contains all the band&#x27;s material released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label which is all their material from 1997 to 2002.

In 2013, The Locust returned from hiatus and in 2019 they were added to the Desert Daze 2019 festival line up. Bassist Justin Pearson confirmed that the band would add more shows after this, with new material and new costumes.

On May 1, 2022, the band announced the death of drummer Gabe Serbian that had occurred the day before. The band have since announced on their Instagram account that they can no longer be active in the wake of Serbian&#x27;s death, and that no further albums or live performances will occur under the Locust name. The final piece recorded by the group was a remix of the Danny Elfman solo track &quot;Cruel Compensation&quot; which appears on the remix album Bigger. Messier.

== Style and influences ==
The Locust were known for their unique mix of grindcore speed and aggression, complexity, and new wave weirdness. The band&#x27;s musical genre is typically described as grindcore, hardcore punk, powerviolence, mathcore and noise rock.

About the band&#x27;s aesthetic, vocalist/bassist Justin Pearson has said, &quot;I wanted to change the way people perceive music, or maybe just destroy it in general.&quot; The Locust&#x27;s music is complex, dynamic and fast-paced, often featuring abrupt and inconsistent time-signature changes. These erratic elements are, according to vocalist/guitarist Bobby Bray, &quot;a reflection of perhaps how our brains have to function in order to be able to do anything in the Western societies we live in.&quot; &quot;Stylus&quot; described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;Relentless blitzkriegs of high velocity noise, skinny tie keyboards and bloody screaming that often last less than a minute, Locust songs are tightly-wound, dynamic and bizarre expressions of frustration and hatred whose intensity and creativity are currently unparalleled in punk rock.&quot; The New York Times stated &quot;If noise-rock had superheroes, the Locust would surely be among them.&quot; The band was praised by Dave Lombardo of Slayer, who said &quot;There&#x27;s a band called The Locust. Their drummer is named Gabe Serbian, and their music hits me now like D.R.I. hit me in the early &#x27;80s.&quot;

The Locust have had a unique stage presence: costumed in skin-tight, full body nylon suits (which the band refer to as uniforms). The last 5 different suits were designed and made by Ben Warwas. Unlike most bands, which normally have the drums set up behind the other members, the four members of The Locust usually all positioned in a line at the front of the stage. The group recommended that in order to get the full impact of the music, one should see them live.

The Locust boycotted Clear Channel Communications and refused to play in any Clear Channel-owned venues. This boycott affected a 2005 tour with Fantômas, as well as another tour with Yeah Yeah Yeahs. They also had a policy of only playing all-ages shows.

=== Equipment ===
Karam plays an assortment of analog synthesizers, including various Moog models and a patch-panel modular synth. Bray plays a Gibson SG, and Pearson plays a see-through body Dan Armstrong bass made by Ampeg. Serbian played Ludwig drums with Paiste cymbals.

== Controversies ==
Pearson appeared as a &quot;rock-star slut&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. It culminated in a French kiss with Scott Beiben, owner of the record label Bloodlink. Pearson wore a T-shirt for The Locust during the appearance. Pearson later stated &quot;I was beat up during a commercial break by one of the &#x27;security guards&#x27; pretty bad for blowing snot on the carpet.&quot;

The Locust have been accused of encouraging the use of drugs because the band sold vanity mirrors as merchandise: fans and others mistook the mirrors as being intended for use as a surface from which one could snort cocaine. In an interview with Scene Point Blank Justin Pearson was asked &quot;You guys make Locust compacts, modeled after cocaine mirrors. Do you feel it&#x27;s irresponsible to sell these to your younger fans?&quot; Pearson responded &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what you are talking about. I have never done cocaine and we never modeled any sort of merchandising product or idea after cocaine mirrors. However we did have vanity mirrors. In case you were not aware, they could be used for a variety of things such as make-up application, picking food out of your teeth, popping zits, fixing your bangs, etc. About the second part of your question, we are not responsible for anyone besides ourselves. We are a band and in no way are we a babysitting service.&quot;

The Locust organized a number of &quot;gender-baiting incidents&quot;, including Pearson and Serbian staging a fake same-sex marriage while on tour in Hawaii.

<text>Bombinatoridae is a family of toads found in Eurasia. Species of the family have flattened bodies and some are highly toxic.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Fossil specimens of the genus &quot;Bombina&quot; are known from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene. The earliest fossil specimens are &quot;Eobarbourula&quot; from the Eocene of India, and &quot;Hatzegobatrachus&quot; from Late Cretaceous of Hateg island, Romania. The genus &quot;Barbourula&quot; was considered to be situated intermediate between &quot;Discoglossus&quot; and &quot;Bombina&quot;, but closer to the latter, so was added to the Bombinatoridae when that family was split from the Discoglossidae.

===Genera===
Currently, there are two extant and at least two extinct genera recognised in the family Bombinatoridae:
===Extinct Genera===
*†&quot;Eobarbourula&quot; 
*†&quot;Hatzegobatrachus&quot; 

==Description==
&quot;Bombina&quot; species are warty, aquatic toads about in length, and most noted for their bright bellies. They often display the unken reflex when disturbed; the animal will arch its back and limbs to expose the bright belly, and may turn over on its back. This acts as a warning to predators. The vocal behavior of some &quot;Bombina&quot; species are unusual in that the call is produced during inhalation rather than exhalation as in other frogs. They lay pigmented eggs in ponds.

==Distribution and habitat==
Species of the genus &quot;Barbourula&quot; occur in the Philippine Islands and Borneo, while species of the genus &quot;Bombina&quot; are found throughout Eurasia. They are slightly less colored than &quot;Bombina spp.&quot;, and possess webbed fingers in addition to webbed toes. Characteristics of tadpoles of &quot;Barbourula spp.&quot; are unknown.

<text>IITRAN is a discontinued programming language created in the mid-1960s and designed as a first language for students. The primary designer of the language, William S. Worley, also contributed to the design of PL/I, and the two languages have similar syntax. The name derives from Illinois Institute of Technology, where it was developed.

The IITRAN language was initially implemented for IBM 7040, with a compiler made available to students in 1964. This was followed shortly by an IBM System/360 implementation in 1966, for which the language was partially redesigned by a committee led by Dr. Peter G. Lykos. In the early 1970s, a compiler was developed for the Univac 1108 platform. Programming was done using punched cards.

IITRAN was designed and developed in response to the increasing demand for a computer language which would meet the following specifications:

#It should be clear, concise, and easily learned, even for those who have had no previous experience with computers or mathematics;
#It should bear as close a resemblance as possible to the English language;
#It should be free of awkward restrictions and limitations;
#It should be consistent with mathematical and logical foundations;
#It should allow processing of a great number of individual programs in a very short time;
#It should serve as a computational tool for students of science and engineering;
#It should process a clear, easily understood, set of diagnostic error messages.
(Bauer, p. V)

There was a Spanish language version of IITRAN at IIT as well. It utilized Spanish keywords rather than English ones. For example, the keyword &quot;read&quot; was replaced by &quot;leer&quot;.

<text>Ronald Michael Francis Jr. (born March 1, 1963) is a Canadian ice hockey sports executive and former player. He currently serves as the general manager of the Seattle Kraken. He spent most of his career as either a player or executive for the Hartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes organization, 23 years in total (sixteen as a player, seven as an executive).

Drafted fourth overall in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, Francis played 23 seasons in the NHL for the Hartford Whalers (1981–1991), Pittsburgh Penguins (1991-1998), Carolina Hurricanes (1998–2004), and Toronto Maple Leafs (2004). Upon retiring from professional ice hockey in 2004, Francis stood second all-time in career assists (1,249), behind only Wayne Gretzky; fifth in career points (1,798); third in games played (1,731); and 27th in career goals (549).

In 2011, Francis was hired as the director of hockey operations for the Hurricanes. In 2014, he was promoted to general manager. Two years before, Francis had become a minority owner of the team as part of the five-man investor group, Playmakers Management. In March 2018, he was demoted from general manager to president of hockey operations, before being fired on April 30, 2018. On July 18, 2019, he was hired as the first general manager of the Seattle Kraken.

In 2017, Francis was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in the first 100 years of the league.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Francis played in the 1975 and 1976 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.

Francis was drafted by the Hartford Whalers in the first round, fourth overall, of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He was a model of consistency and durability, averaging more than a point a game in over 1,700 games in 23 seasons, and (not counting the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season) averaging just under 77 games played a season. His three Lady Byng Trophies attest to his gentlemanly conduct on and off the ice. Francis stands second all-time in career assists behind Wayne Gretzky with 1,249, fifth in career points (1,798), third in games played (1,731), and twenty-sixth in career goals (549).

Francis played almost ten seasons with the Whalers, serving as captain for almost six and setting nearly every offensive record in franchise history. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins on March 4, 1991, with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings, in exchange for Jeff Parker, Zarley Zalapski, and John Cullen. The trade became a coup for Pittsburgh, where he centred a formidable second line behind Mario Lemieux, as the Penguins won their first Stanley Cup less than three months later. The threat posed by the Francis-centered second line, formidable in its own right, often required opposing teams to throw their best defenseman against two lines, instead of zeroing in on Lemieux&#x27;s line, thus creating more opportunities for both top lines. Francis was also known as one of the best face-off men in the NHL in this period, in both the offensive and defensive ends. In power-play and empty-net situations, his key face-off wins often led to Penguin goals.

Francis was indispensable the following year, as Pittsburgh repeated as champions, in leading the team during the absence of Lemieux in the 1992 playoffs – and in scoring the Cup-clinching goal against the Chicago Blackhawks. At the same time, the trade that brought him to Pittsburgh is considered to be one of the most one-sided trades in NHL history (though &quot;The Hockey News&quot; suggested that Hartford had gotten the better end of the trade at the time); the players Hartford acquired never approached the numbers or impact Francis produced there or with Pittsburgh. Francis would spend seven seasons in Pittsburgh, captaining the team twice, and becoming the first Penguin to win the Selke Trophy in 1995.

Francis returned to his original organization as a free agent for 1998–99, signing with the Carolina Hurricanes (who had moved from Hartford the previous season). He spent the next 5.5 seasons padding his franchise records. He still ranks first all-time in Whalers/Hurricanes history in points, goals, assists and games played. At the time of his retirement, his 1,175 points were more than double those of then-runner up Kevin Dineen. He captained the Hurricanes to a surprise appearance in the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals and scored the winning goal for the Hurricanes in overtime of Game 1, before losing to the Detroit Red Wings in five games.

Francis finished his career with a brief stint with the Toronto Maple Leafs, traded there by the Hurricanes in March 2004 to allow him one last run at the Stanley Cup. He retired from the NHL before the 2005–06 season and assumed a position with the Raleigh Youth Hockey Association.

==Management career==
In June 2011, Francis assumed the position of director of hockey operations with the Carolina Hurricanes before later being named general manager of the team in 2014. On March 7, 2018, Francis was named president of hockey operations by new Hurricanes&#x27; majority owner Thomas Dundon. His Hurricanes contract was terminated on April 30, 2018. On July 18, 2019, Francis was named the first general manager of the Seattle Kraken.

==Personal life==
Francis was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. He is second cousins with Mike Liut.

Francis is married to Mary Lou Robie, a native of Stamford, Connecticut, whom he met in Hartford during his tenure with the Whalers. They married in 1986 and have three children: Kaitlyn (b. 1991), Michael (b. 1993), and Connor (b. 1996). Francis is considered a popular sports figure in Hartford, Pittsburgh and Raleigh, and is also noted for his humanitarian and charity work. Francis also has the distinction of being the first ice hockey player inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame.

==Awards and achievements==
Francis won two Stanley Cups, in 1990–91 and the following season, with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Statistically, his best season was 1995–96, when he recorded 119 points; that season, he led the NHL in assists, with 92. The previous season, he had not only led the League in assists with 48 over the lockout-shortened, half-season schedule, but became the first player to win both the Frank J. Selke Trophy and the Lady Byng Trophy in the same season.

Francis&#x27; Whalers number 10 jersey was raised at the Hartford Civic Center on January 6, 2006 (though not officially retired, the Whalers organization no longer existing in Hartford to retire it), along with Ulf Samuelsson&#x27;s number 5 and Kevin Dineen&#x27;s number 11. Additionally, his Hurricanes number 10 jersey was retired by the Carolina organization on January 28, 2006. He was also pictured in the Pittsburgh Penguins Ring of Honor that formerly circled the upper level of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

On June 28, 2007, Francis was selected to enter the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot. He was formally inducted on November 12, 2007.

<text>In computing, signed number representations are required to encode negative numbers in binary number systems.

In mathematics, negative numbers in any base are represented by prefixing them with a minus sign (&quot;−&quot;). However, in RAM or CPU registers, numbers are represented only as sequences of bits, without extra symbols. The four best-known methods of extending the binary numeral system to represent signed numbers are: sign–magnitude, ones&#x27; complement, two&#x27;s complement, and offset binary. Some of the alternative methods use implicit instead of explicit signs, such as negative binary, using the base −2. Corresponding methods can be devised for other bases, whether positive, negative, fractional, or other elaborations on such themes.

There is no definitive criterion by which any of the representations is universally superior. For integers, the representation used in most current computing devices is two&#x27;s complement, although the Unisys ClearPath Dorado series mainframes use ones&#x27; complement.
== History ==

The early days of digital computing were marked by competing ideas about both hardware technology and mathematics technology (numbering systems). One of the great debates was the format of negative numbers, with some of the era&#x27;s top experts expressing very strong and differing opinions. One camp supported two&#x27;s complement, the system that is dominant today. Another camp supported ones&#x27; complement, where a negative value is formed by inverting all of the bits in its positive equivalent. A third group supported sign–magnitude, where a value is changed from positive to negative simply by toggling the word&#x27;s highest-order bit.

There were arguments for and against each of the systems. Sign–magnitude allowed for easier tracing of memory dumps (a common process in the 1960s) as small numeric values use fewer 1 bits. These systems did ones&#x27; complement math internally, so numbers would have to be converted to ones&#x27; complement values when they were transmitted from a register to the math unit and then converted back to sign–magnitude when the result was transmitted back to the register. The electronics required more gates than the other systemsa key concern when the cost and packaging of discrete transistors were critical. IBM was one of the early supporters of sign–magnitude, with their 704, 709 and 709x series computers being perhaps the best-known systems to use it.

Ones&#x27; complement allowed for somewhat simpler hardware designs, as there was no need to convert values when passed to and from the math unit. But it also shared an undesirable characteristic with sign–magnitude: the ability to represent negative zero (−0). Negative zero behaves exactly like positive zero: when used as an operand in any calculation, the result will be the same whether an operand is positive or negative zero. The disadvantage is that the existence of two forms of the same value necessitates two comparisons when checking for equality with zero. Ones&#x27; complement subtraction can also result in an end-around borrow (described below). It can be argued that this makes the addition and subtraction logic more complicated or that it makes it simpler, as a subtraction requires simply inverting the bits of the second operand as it is passed to the adder. The PDP-1, CDC 160 series, CDC 3000 series, CDC 6000 series, UNIVAC 1100 series, and LINC computer use ones&#x27; complement representation.

Two&#x27;s complement is the easiest to implement in hardware, which may be the ultimate reason for its widespread popularity. Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistors, so eliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings. Mainframes such as the IBM System/360, the GE-600 series, and the PDP-6 and PDP-10 use two&#x27;s complement, as did minicomputers such as the PDP-5 and PDP-8 and the PDP-11 and VAX machines. The architects of the early integrated-circuit-based CPUs (Intel 8080, etc.) also chose to use two&#x27;s complement math. As IC technology advanced, two&#x27;s complement technology was adopted in virtually all processors, including x86, m68k, Power ISA, MIPS, SPARC, ARM, Itanium, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha.

== Sign–magnitude ==

In the sign–magnitude representation, also called sign-and-magnitude or signed magnitude, a signed number is represented by the bit pattern corresponding to the sign of the number for the sign bit (often the most significant bit, set to 0 for a positive number and to 1 for a negative number), and the magnitude of the number (or absolute value) for the remaining bits. For example, in an eight-bit byte, only seven bits represent the magnitude, which can range from 0000000 (0) to 1111111 (127). Thus numbers ranging from −12710 to +12710 can be represented once the sign bit (the eighth bit) is added. For example, −4310 encoded in an eight-bit byte is 10101011 while 4310 is 00101011. Using sign–magnitude representation has multiple consequences which makes them more intricate to implement:

# There are two ways to represent zero, 00000000 (0) and 10000000 (−0).
# Addition and subtraction require different behavior depending on the sign bit, whereas ones&#x27; complement can ignore the sign bit and just do an end-around carry, and two&#x27;s complement can ignore the sign bit and depend on the overflow behavior.
# Comparison also requires inspecting the sign bit, whereas in two&#x27;s complement, one can simply subtract the two numbers, and check if the outcome is positive or negative.
# The minimum negative number is −127, instead of −128 as in the case of two&#x27;s complement.

This approach is directly comparable to the common way of showing a sign (placing a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;−&quot; next to the number&#x27;s magnitude). Some early binary computers (e.g., IBM 7090) use this representation, perhaps because of its natural relation to common usage. Sign–magnitude is the most common way of representing the significand in floating-point values.

== Ones&#x27; complement ==


In the &quot;ones&#x27; complement&quot; representation, a negative number is represented by the bit pattern corresponding to the bitwise NOT (i.e. the &quot;complement&quot;) of the positive number. Like sign–magnitude representation, ones&#x27; complement has two representations of 0: 00000000 (+0) and 11111111 (−0).

As an example, the ones&#x27; complement form of 00101011 (4310) becomes 11010100 (−4310). The range of signed numbers using ones&#x27; complement is represented by to and ±0. A conventional eight-bit byte is −12710 to +12710 with zero being either 00000000 (+0) or 11111111 (−0).

To add two numbers represented in this system, one does a conventional binary addition, but it is then necessary to do an &quot;end-around carry&quot;: that is, add any resulting carry back into the resulting sum. To see why this is necessary, consider the following example showing the case of the addition of −1 (11111110) to +2 (00000010):

In the previous example, the first binary addition gives 00000000, which is incorrect. The correct result (00000001) only appears when the carry is added back in. 

A remark on terminology: The system is referred to as &quot;ones&#x27; complement&quot; because the negation of a positive value x (represented as the bitwise NOT of x) can also be formed by subtracting x from the ones&#x27; complement representation of zero that is a long sequence of ones (−0). Two&#x27;s complement arithmetic, on the other hand, forms the negation of x by subtracting x from a single large power of two that is congruent to +0. Therefore, ones&#x27; complement and two&#x27;s complement representations of the same negative value will differ by one.

Note that the ones&#x27; complement representation of a negative number can be obtained from the sign–magnitude representation merely by bitwise complementing the magnitude (inverting all the bits after the first). For example, the decimal number −125 with its sign–magnitude representation 11111101 can be represented in ones&#x27; complement form as 10000010.

== Two&#x27;s complement ==


In the &quot;two&#x27;s complement&quot; representation, a negative number is represented by the bit pattern corresponding to the bitwise NOT (i.e. the &quot;complement&quot;) of the positive number plus one, i.e. to the ones&#x27; complement plus one. It circumvents the problems of multiple representations of 0 and the need for the end-around carry of the ones&#x27; complement representation. This can also be thought of as the most significant bit representing the inverse of its value in an unsigned integer; in an 8-bit unsigned byte, the most significant bit represents the 128ths place, where in two&#x27;s complement that bit would represent −128.

In two&#x27;s-complement, there is only one zero, represented as 00000000. Negating a number (whether negative or positive) is done by inverting all the bits and then adding one to that result. This actually reflects the ring structure on all integers modulo 2&quot;N&quot;: formula_1. Addition of a pair of two&#x27;s-complement integers is the same as addition of a pair of unsigned numbers (except for detection of overflow, if that is done); the same is true for subtraction and even for &quot;N&quot; lowest significant bits of a product (value of multiplication). For instance, a two&#x27;s-complement addition of 127 and −128 gives the same binary bit pattern as an unsigned addition of 127 and 128, as can be seen from the 8-bit two&#x27;s complement table.

An easier method to get the negation of a number in two&#x27;s complement is as follows:

Method two:

# Invert all the bits through the number. This computes the same result as subtracting from negative one.
# Add one

Example: for +2, which is 00000010 in binary (the ~ character is the C bitwise NOT operator, so ~X means &quot;invert all the bits in X&quot;):

# ~00000010 → 11111101
# 11111101 + 1 → 11111110 (−2 in two&#x27;s complement)

== Offset binary ==


In the &quot;offset binary&quot; representation, also called &quot;excess-K&quot; or &quot;biased&quot;, a signed number is represented by the bit pattern corresponding to the unsigned number plus K, with K being the &quot;biasing value&quot; or &quot;offset&quot;. Thus 0 is represented by K, and −K is represented by an all-zero bit pattern. This can be seen as a slight modification and generalization of the aforementioned two&#x27;s-complement, which is virtually the representation with negated most significant bit.

Biased representations are now primarily used for the exponent of floating-point numbers. The IEEE 754 floating-point standard defines the exponent field of a single-precision (32-bit) number as an 8-bit excess-127 field. The double-precision (64-bit) exponent field is an 11-bit excess-1023 field; see exponent bias. It also had use for binary-coded decimal numbers as excess-3.

== Base −2 ==


In the &quot;base −2&quot; representation, a signed number is represented using a number system with base −2. In conventional binary number systems, the base, or radix, is 2; thus the rightmost bit represents 20, the next bit represents 21, the next bit 22, and so on. However, a binary number system with base −2 is also possible. The rightmost bit represents , the next bit represents , the next bit and so on, with alternating sign. The numbers that can be represented with four bits are shown in the comparison table below.

The range of numbers that can be represented is asymmetric. If the word has an even number of bits, the magnitude of the largest negative number that can be represented is twice as large as the largest positive number that can be represented, and vice versa if the word has an odd number of bits.

== Comparison table ==

The following table shows the positive and negative integers that can be represented using four bits.

Same table, as viewed from &quot;given these binary bits, what is the number as interpreted by the representation system&quot;:

== Other systems ==

Google&#x27;s Protocol Buffers &quot;zig-zag encoding&quot; is a system similar to sign–magnitude, but uses the least significant bit to represent the sign and has a single representation of zero. This allows a variable-length quantity encoding intended for nonnegative (unsigned) integers to be used efficiently for signed integers.

A similar method is used in the Advanced Video Coding/H.264 and High Efficiency Video Coding/H.265 video compression standards to extend exponential-Golomb coding to negative numbers. In that extension, the least significant bit is almost a sign bit; zero has the same least significant bit (0) as all the negative numbers. This choice results in the largest magnitude representable positive number being one higher than the largest magnitude negative number, unlike in two&#x27;s complement or the Protocol Buffers zig-zag encoding.

Another approach is to give each digit a sign, yielding the signed-digit representation. For instance, in 1726, John Colson advocated reducing expressions to &quot;small numbers&quot;, numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In 1840, Augustin Cauchy also expressed preference for such modified decimal numbers to reduce errors in computation.

<text>The Darwin Medal is one of the medals awarded by the Royal Society for &quot;distinction in evolution, biological diversity and developmental, population and organismal biology&quot;.

In 1885, International Darwin Memorial Fund was transferred to the Royal Society. The fund was devoted for promotion of biological research, and was used to establish the Darwin Medal. The medal was first awarded to Alfred Russel Wallace in 1890 for &quot;his independent origination of the theory of the origin of species by natural selection.&quot; The medal commemorates the work of English biologist Charles Darwin (1809–1882). Darwin, most famous for his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; was a fellow of the Royal Society, and had received the Royal Medal in 1853 and the Copley Medal in 1864.

The diameter of the Darwin Medal is inch (5.7 cm). It is made of silver. The obverse has Darwin&#x27;s portrait, while the reverse has a wreath of plants with Darwin&#x27;s name in Latin, &quot;Carolus Darwin&quot;. It is surrounded by the years of his birth and death in Roman numerals (MDCCCIX and MDCCCLXXXII). The general design of the medal was by John Evans, the president of the Royal Numismatic Society.

Since its creation the Darwin Medal has been awarded over 60 times. Among the recipients are Francis Darwin, Charles Darwin&#x27;s son, and two married couples: Jack and Yolande Heslop-Harrison in 1982 and Peter and Rosemary Grant in 2002. Initially accompanied by a grant of £100, the medal is currently awarded with a grant of £2,000. All citizens who have been residents of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth of Nations, or the Republic of Ireland for more than three years are eligible for the medal. The medal was awarded biennially from 1890 until 2018; since then it is awarded annually.

<text>Black cumin can refer to the seeds of either of two quite different plants, both of which are used as spices:

* &quot;Elwendia persica&quot;, black cumin is considered similar to caraway, but they are two distinctly different plants. The seeds differ dramatically in shape, color and size. Caraway seeds appear brown in color, while Black Cumin is mostly black with a slight curve shape. This seed may be used in rice water to bring a slight flavor to the rice. 
* &quot;Nigella sativa&quot;, black caraway is also called kalonji or nigella, and more common in the Far East, Mideast, Bangladesh, India and Africa. The seeds vary in shape, are pure dark black, with no other visible colors. This seed is used at the beginning of Indian Subcontinent cuisine to flavor the oil, onions, other spices, meats and vegetables. </text><links>

<text>Hot-wiring is the process of bypassing a motor vehicle&#x27;s ignition switch and thus starting it without the key. It is often utilized during a vehicle theft. However, a legitimate vehicle owner who has lost a vehicle key or starting a vehicle with inoperable ignition switch (e.g. in run-down old cars) may also use this process.

==Methods==
Hot-wiring generally involves connecting the wires which complete the circuit when the key is in the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;ready&quot; position (turning on the fuel pump, ignition system and other necessary components), then touching another wire that connects to the starter. The specific method of hot-wiring a vehicle is dependent on the particular vehicle&#x27;s electrical ignition system. Remote start units access the same wires as conventional ignition methods. Listings of wire colors and locations and ignition system schematics may sometimes be found in Internet databases.

Vehicles from the 1990s or older, which often have a carbureted engine, a manual transmission, and a single ignition coil and distributor, can be hot-wired from the engine bay. Using standard lock picking to start a vehicle is now usually ineffective, since most cars now use immobilisers or transponder key verification. Conversely, most types of motorcycles are often easier to hot-wire, especially scooters and older naked bikes, which lack advanced security features beyond mechanical locks and conventional ignition switch.

<doc id="586705" wikidata="Q825769" url="?curid=586705" title="Crust punk">
<text>Crust punk (also known as stenchcore or simply crust) is a fusion genre of anarcho-punk and extreme metal that originated in the early to mid-1980s in England. Originally, the genre was primarily mid-tempo, making use of metal riffs in a stripped-down anarcho-punk context, however many later bands pushed the genre to be more grandiose, faster or more melodic. Often songs are political, discussing environmentalism, anarchism, anti-capitalism, feminism and animal rights. 

The genre originated in the early to mid-1980s with Amebix and Antisect, bands active in the anarcho-punk scene who began to incorporate the influence of heavy metal bands such as Hellhammer, Motörhead and Trouble. The influence of these bands led to the genre&#x27;s first wave with Hellbastard, Deviated Instinct and Concrete Sox. By the late 1980s, the genre had begun to merge with hardcore punk, typified by Electro Hippies, Extreme Noise Terror and Doom. During the 1990s, this sound was continued by Swedish and Japanese bands including Skitsystem, Driller Killer, Disclose and Gloom, while other areas brought in outside influences such as Dystopia with sludge metal, His Hero is Gone with powerviolence and Choking Victim with ska. During the 2000s, the most prominent sound in the genre was the neo-crust style of Tragedy, Fall of Efrafa and From Ashes Rise, which pushed the genre into more metal-influenced but also melodic and post-rock-inspired territory. At the same time, Swedish bands like Disfear and Wolfbrigade were also pushing crust punk into an increasingly melodic direction, through the incorporation of elements of melodic death metal.

==Characteristics==

===Lyrics===
Crust punk lyrics generally discuss real-world issues as a means of activism. In particular, they discuss political and social themes such as class struggle, environmentalism, anarchism, and anti-capitalism. Sometimes these themes are hyperbolised to the point of discussing the apocalypse, religious control and nuclear destruction. Many bands also discussed feminism, animal rights and veganism or vegetarianism. In contrast, Amebix&#x27;s lyrics sometimes discussed mysticism and Gnosticism.

===Instrumentation===

Crust punk is a derivative form of anarcho-punk, mixed with metal riffs. The overall musical sound was described by &quot;SFGate&quot; writer Loolwa Khazzoom as being &quot;stripped down&quot;. Drumming is typically done at high speed, with D-beats sometimes being used. In &quot;Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics&quot;, author Gabriel Kuhn referred to the genre as a &quot;blend of 1977 British punk, roots culture and black metal&quot;, with the genre often taking influence from death metal, grindcore and powerviolence.

==Terminology==

The original name for the crust punk genre was &quot;stenchcore&quot;, in reference to Deviated Instinct&#x27;s 1986 demo &quot;Terminal Filth Stenchcore&quot;. In a 2007 interview with &quot;3PRQ&quot;, the band&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist Rob Middleton stated &quot;We came up with the &#x27;stenchcore&#x27; tag on our demo as kind of a joke as there were so many ridiculous &#x27;cores&#x27; going about at the time and people used to comment on our general dishevelment.&quot; This term has stayed in use, however has developed from referring to the genre as a whole, to mean the particular mid–tempo, early extreme metal-influence sound of crust punk&#x27;s first wave such as Deviated Instinct, Amebix and Antisect.

The term &quot;crust&quot; was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 &quot;Ripper Crust&quot; demo. This name was derived from the &quot;crusty&quot; appearance of the genre&#x27;s practitioning bands. Punk historian Ian Glasper states, in his book &quot;Trapped in a Scene&quot;, &quot;&quot;Rippercrust&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] is widely regarded as the first time the word &#x27;crust&#x27; was used in the punk context, and hence the specific starting point of the whole crust punk genre, although some would attribute that accolade to the likes of Disorder, Chaos UK, and Amebix several years earlier. In the same book, he quoted the group&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist Malcolm &quot;Scruff&quot; Lewty &quot;A lot of people say we started the crust punk genre, but whatever. If they wanna say that, I don&#x27;t mind, but I&#x27;m certainly no Malcolm McLaren, saying I invented something I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

==History==
===Precursors===
The most prominent influences upon crust punk were Crass and Discharge. Crass introduced the genre&#x27;s anarchist ideology and its tattered, militaristic aesthetic, while Discharge introduced its apocalyptic themes and influence from heavy metal, particularly Motörhead. Other metal bands to include the style included Hellhammer and Trouble.

=== 1980s ===

Crust punk was established by the bands Amebix and Antisect, who both growing out of the anarcho-punk scene and made use of dark, morbid and post-apocalyptic imagery. Amebix had begun their career playing a style more indebted to Killing Joke, while Antisect began playing simply anarcho-hardcore punk. Amebix first embraced metal influences on their 1983 album &quot;No Sanctuary&quot;, while Antisect did so on their 1985 EP &quot;Out from the Void&quot;. These releases were the earliest crust punk releases, with Amebix&#x27;s subsequent album &quot;Arise&quot; (1985) codifying the sound of the genre. However, Amebix also brought a wider scope of influences than most other bands in the genre, particularly post-punk bands including Public Image Ltd., Bauhaus, Joy Division and especially Killing Joke. Soon, the first wave of crust punk bands was solidified with the formations of Hellbastard, Deviated Instinct and Concrete Sox. This early wave of the genre was closely related to the nascent extreme metal scene, with the members of Amebix and Hellhammer even being in the same tape trading circles, influencing one another.

In the following years, the genre spread to other countries. The largest of these was the Swedish crust punk and d-beat scene which early on produced Anti Cimex and Agnoni, who both quickly toured the United Kingdom. From this scene soon originated the Swedish death metal scene, which would be brought to prominence by Entombed.

American crust punk began in New York City, in the mid-1980s, with the work of Nausea. The group emerged from the Lower East Side squat scene and New York hardcore, living with Roger Miret of Agnostic Front. The early work of Neurosis, from San Francisco, also borrowed from Amebix, and inaugurated crust punk on the West Coast. Disrupt (Boston), Antischism (South Carolina), Misery and Destroy (Minneapolis) were also significant U.S. crust groups.

In the late 1980s, bands including Doom, Excrement of War, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror began to merge crust punk with the sound of UK hardcore punk, creating the crustcore subgenre. Felix Havoc described Extreme Noise Terror&#x27;s segment of the &quot;Earslaughter&quot; split album with Chaos UK as the first album in the genre.

===1990s===

In 1994, Orange County, California&#x27;s Dystopia released their debut album &quot;Human = Garbage&quot; which merged sludge crust punk and sludge metal. An important American crust punk band was Aus Rotten from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Crust punk also flourished in Minneapolis, shepherded by the Profane Existence label. In this period, the ethos of crust punk became particularly codified, with vegetarianism, feminism, and sometimes straight edge being prescribed by many of the figures in the scene. The powerviolence scene associated with Slap-a-Ham Records was in close proximity to crust punk, particularly in the case of Man Is the Bastard and Dropdead. Prominent crust punk groups (Driller Killer, Totalitär, Skitsystem, Wolfbrigade, and Disfear) also emerged from Sweden, which had always had a strong D-beat scene. Many of these groups developed in parallel with the much more commercial Scandinavian death metal scene.

During this time, crust became prominent in the American South, where Prank Records and CrimethInc. acted as focal points of the scene. The most well-known representative of Southern crust was His Hero Is Gone, whose early material incorporate elements of powerviolence and experimental music. By the band&#x27;s final album &quot;The Plot Sickens&quot; (1998), they had begun to incorporate influence from the Japanese hardcore style burning spirits, to create a more grandiose and melodic take on crust punk. This sound was then continued by three of the members&#x27; subsequent band Tragedy At the same time, in Spain bands such as Hongo, Das Plague and Ekkaia were merging crust punk with elements of screamo, creating a fusion genre which at the time was called &quot;emo crust&quot;.

===2000s===
In the early 2000s, the Spanish emo crust genre and Tragedy–His Hero Is Gone melodic crust style began to merge, leading to the beginning of the neo-crust subgenre. During the mid–2000s, this became the most prominent style in the crust scene, producing subsequent acts such as Fall of Efrafa and From Ashes Rise. Soon, bands such as Trap Them emerged, incorporating increasing elements of hardcore and death metal. By the end of the decade, many international crust punk bands had shifted their style to favour black metal influences. In 2017, Bandcamp Daily wrote that Fluff Fest, held in Czechia since 2000, has become a &quot;summer ritual&quot; for many European crust fans.

==Subgenres==
===Crack rock steady===
Crack rock steady is a punk rock fusion-genre, which combines elements of crust punk and ska punk. Lyrics often focus on themes such as drug-use, religion, politics and social issues. Other genres sometimes incorporated in conjunction with the style include hardcore punk and heavy metal. Notable bands within the genre include Choking Victim, Leftöver Crack, Morning Glory and Star Fucking Hipsters.

===Crustcore===

Crustcore (also known as crusty hardcore), is a sub-genre of crust punk that takes influence from hardcore punk and sometimes thrashcore. Crustcore bands include Extreme Noise Terror, Doom, Disrupt, early Wolfbrigade, Neurosis, Baptists, Discharge and Filth.

===Neo crust===
Neo crust is a genre that merges crust punk with elements of various extreme music styles including black metal, screamo, post-rock, hardcore punk, death metal and doom metal. Unlike most other punk–metal fusion genres, neo-crust&#x27;s sound is neither distinctively rooted in punk or metal, instead frequently shifting between the two, disregarding genre boundaries. It is often dark and heavy however also melodic. The genre makes use of a melancholic tone and a post-civilization aesthetic, often including dead trees and barren landscapes, as well as poetic band names and lyrics. Some bands, such as Cwill and Remains of the Day even incorporate violins into their music.

The style originated as a amalgamation of two separate sounds that began concurrently in the late 1990s: the screamo influenced &quot;emo crust&quot; style of Spanish bands Hongo, Das Plague, Ekkaia, Madame Germen and Blünt; and the melodic crust sound of later His Hero is Gone and early Tragedy, which was influenced by the Japanese hardcore style burning spirits. By 2002, Ekkaia and Tragedy had toured together, and subsequently adopted elements of each other&#x27;s styles. This style was soon termed neo-crust by Alerta Antifascista records founder Timo Nehmtow, and saw widespread popularity in the punk scene during the mid–2000s. By the end of the decade, the sound had decline in popularity.

Notable bands include His Hero is Gone, Tragedy, Fall of Efrafa and From Ashes Rise.

===Crasher crust===
Crasher crust is a genre that originated in Japan. It blends d-beat, crust and a huge emphasis on noise elements. Often utilising both fuzz and distorted guitars, reliance on crash cymbals for drumming and raw recording. Acid are pioneered the genre, and Gloom coined its name. Some bands include Gloom, Zyanose, Lebedden Totten, Scene Death Terror and Zodiak.

===Stadium crust===
Stadium crust is a style of crust that puts an emphasis on grandiosity through the incorporation of elements of melodic death metal. It originates in Sweden. Bands include later Wolfbrigade, later Disfear, and Fredag Den 13:e.

==Legacy==
===Black metal===
Crust punk and black metal evolved alongside one another, with the members of early crust band Amebix and first-wave black metal band Hellhammer tape trading with one another. Thus, pioneering black metal bands such as Hellhammer, Bathory and Mayhem were inspired by crust punk, and early crust punk bands such as Sacrilege, Amebix and Antisect were influenced by Hellhammer and Celtic Frost.

====Blackened crust====

Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasising these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk; Iskra coined their own phrase &quot;blackened crust&quot; to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal while the English band Fukpig merge elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore. Germany&#x27;s Downfall of Gaia mix crustgrind and black metal, along with elements of sludge metal, doom metal and post-metal. North Carolina&#x27;s Young and in the Way have been playing blackened crust since their formation in 2009. In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their mid-to-late 2000s material. As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
====Red and anarchist black metal====
Red and anarchist black metal (also known as RABM or anarchist black metal) is a subgenre that melds black metal with anarchist crust punk, promoting ideologies such as anarchism, environmentalism, or Marxism. Artists labelled RABM include Iskra, Panopticon, Skagos, Storm of Sedition, Not A Cost, Black Kronstadt, and Vidargangr.

===Grindcore===
Crust punk led to the development of the grindcore genre, by bands including Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death and Carcass. However, Pete Hurley, the guitarist for the group, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: &quot;&#x27;grindcore&#x27; was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and — I suspect — always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.&quot; This early crust punk-leaning grindcore sound is sometimes dubbed &quot;crustgrind&quot;.

== Culture ==

Crust punks are associated with a DIY-oriented branch of punk garb. Similar to anarcho-punk, most clothing is black in colour. Denim jackets and hooded sweatshirts with sewn-on patches, or vests covered in studs, spikes and band patches are characteristic elements of the crust punk style of dress or pants covered in band patches. Crust punks also sometimes wear dreadlocks and piercings. Julian &quot;Leggo&quot; Kilsby of Deviated Instinct describes crust as &quot;a punk-y biker look, more akin to Mad Max. &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; is the crustiest film ever made!&quot;

Members of the sub-culture are generally outspokenly political, possessing anarchist and anti-consumerist views.

The university was founded by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1842 and received its Tennessee state charter in 1843. In 1847 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added a law school, the first in Tennessee and the first west of the Appalachian Mountains, and in 1854 a school of theology was begun.

The original building, designed by Philadelphia architect William Strickland, housed schools of art, law and theology.

=== Civil War ===
The Civil War nearly destroyed Cumberland University. University Hall was burned to the ground by Confederate forces under the command of General Joseph Wheeler. Cumberland alumni William E. Ward wrote on a ruined Corinthian column the Latin phrase &quot;Ex Cineribus Resurgam&quot; (From the ashes I will arise). The university thereafter adopted the mythical phoenix as its symbol. By 1866, just one year after the war&#x27;s end, all departments were again operating in various locations in the town of Lebanon.

Following the war, the university&#x27;s faculty included former Confederate general A. P. Stewart, who taught there during his post-Civil War Union parole. Students included former Confederate general George Washington Gordon.

=== 1865–1930s ===
Cumberland University moved to its present campus location in 1892. Construction of Memorial Hall, designed by William Crawford Smith, was completed in 1896; it remains the tallest building on campus as of January 2022.

The university fell on hard times during the Great Depression, as did most small private colleges.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, Cumberland University served as the headquarters for the Tennessee Maneuver Area, a training area for the Second Army whose geography resembled that of Belgium, France, and Germany. Over 850,000 soldiers participated in the seven training exercises conducted in the area.

=== Sale of the law school and junior college years ===
After World War II, Cumberland experienced several changes in sponsorship and programs. In 1946, the Tennessee Baptist Convention assumed control of the school, ending a century of operation by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. An attempt to merge Cumberland University and Tennessee School for Women during this period ultimately proved unsuccessful.

In 1951, the Tennessee Baptist Convention closed the College of Arts and Sciences and operated only the School of Law. In 1956, the Board of Trust secured an amendment to the Charter and changed Cumberland to a private, independent corporation. The College of Arts and Sciences was reopened as a two-year junior college, known as Cumberland College of Tennessee. In 1962, the assets of the School of Law were transferred to Howard College, now known as Samford University, in Birmingham, Alabama; the law school is now known as the Cumberland School of Law.

=== Reinstatement and growth as a university ===
The Board of Trust expanded the academic programs of the junior college in 1982, returning Cumberland to a four-year degree institution. It resumed the old name of Cumberland University. Since then, Cumberland has expanded its academic program to include new majors and specialized student-learning opportunities.

==Cumberland School of Law==

In 1847 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added the Cumberland School of Law, the first law school in Tennessee and the first west of the Appalachian Mountains. For many years the law school was located in historic Caruthers Hall, named for Robert Looney Caruthers, a founder of Cumberland University.

The trustees sold the School of Law and its assets in 1962 to what is now Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. The Cumberland School of Law continues to operate there.

==Community outreach==
Cumberland University has a Circle K club, which is affiliated with Kiwanis International. On February 13, 2010, Cumberland University hosted a conference basketball game, and donated half of its gate admissions to Sherry&#x27;s Run, a non-profit organization created to benefit people with cancer. Also, the Cumberland University cycling team formed its own chapter of local non-profit organization Ride for Reading.

== Greek life ==
The university has three sororities and five fraternities. The sororities include the Lambda Omicron chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi and the Delta Mu chapter of Alpha Sigma Tau as well as Zeta Phi Beta (NPHC). The fraternities include the Theta Prime chapter of Kappa Sigma, the Nu chapter of Sigma Chi. There are 3 NPHC fraternities: Gamma Rho Gamma chapter of Phi Beta Sigma, the Phi Delta Delta chapter of Omega Psi Phi and the Rho Rho chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi.

== Athletics ==
The Cumberland athletic teams are called the Phoenix (formerly known as the Bulldogs until 2016). The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) since the 2012–13 school year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1996–97 to 2001–02. The Phoenix previously competed in the TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) from 2002–03 to 2011–12; and in the Tennessee Collegiate Athletic Conference (TCAC) from 1986–87 to 1995–96.

Cumberland competes in 23 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance and eSports.

=== Sports Hall of Fame ===
The Cumberland University Sports Hall of Fame consists of individuals who have achieved excellence in athletics by either competing, coaching, or contributing in other ways. Members include those who only made an athletic impact at the university, such as volleyball player and coach Kathy Palk Slaughter and coach/contributor Mitch Walters, as well as others who went on to greater athletic notoriety at other institutions, such as Coastal Carolina University men&#x27;s basketball coach Cliff Ellis and Winthrop University women&#x27;s basketball coach Bud Childers. Still others, such as Allison B. Humphreys Jr. and Cale Young Rice, are remembered today for their non-athletic contributions.

=== Attempt to move to NCAA Division II ===
On August 7, 2013, Cumberland University was granted provisional membership into the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) after a vote of league presidents, paving the way for the university to apply to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for admittance into Division II in February 2014. Cumberland&#x27;s application to join Division II was denied in 2014. As of 2024, Cumberland has not yet re-applied to transition into NCAA Division II.

=== Nickname ===
On January 4, 2016, Cumberland University changed the sports nickname of its athletic program from &quot;Bulldogs&quot; to &quot;Phoenix&quot;, stating that, &quot;For more than 150 years, the Phoenix has personified the spirit of Cumberland University.&quot;

=== Football ===
Cumberland football began on October 26, 1894, with a 6–6 tie with Peabody and finished that first year with a 2–1–1 season record. The pinnacle of the early days of CU football was the 1903 season that began with a (6–0) win over Vanderbilt then a (0–6) loss to Sewanee and continued with a five-day road trip with victories over Alabama (44–0) November 14, 1903, LSU (41–0) November 16, 1903, and Tulane (28–0) November 18, 1903. Cumberland played a postseason game against Coach John Heisman&#x27;s Clemson team on Thanksgiving Day that ended in an 11–11 tie and a record of 4–1–1. This gave Coach A.L. Phillips and Cumberland University the Championship of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. 

The 1916 game against Georgia Tech is famous as the most lopsided loss in the history of college football, with Georgia Tech defeating Cumberland 222-0.

=== Baseball ===
Cumberland&#x27;s baseball program won the NAIA World Series following the 2004, 2010, and 2014 seasons; the 1995 and 2006 teams were runners-up in this event. 

From 1980 to 2021, Woody Hunt served as head coach of the Cumberland baseball program, compiling a 1,630-774-5 record. He was named NAIA National Coach of the Year in 2006 and was runner-up for the award four times. Hunt was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame (2013), the Boyle County (Kentucky) Sports Hall of Fame, the Cumberland University Hall of Fame, the NAIA Hall of Fame (2007), and the Tennessee Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame (2009). The NAIA awarded Hunt the 2019 Robert E. &quot;Ish&quot; Smith Award, and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame awarded him the Pat Summitt Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020.

Three Cumberland baseball players have played for MLB teams: Jack Farmer, Luis Martinez, and Aaron Wilkerson.

=== Basketball ===
The women&#x27;s basketball team finished as NAIA National Tournament Runner-Up in 2007 and made it to the semifinals in 2013.

The men&#x27;s basketball team earned trips to the NAIA National Tournament following the 2004, 2008, and 2009 seasons.

On August 17, 2018, the university named the basketball court in Dallas Floyd Phoenix Arena after Cliff Ellis, who coached Cumberland to a 78-12 record from 1973 to 1975.

=== Soccer ===
The 2014 women&#x27;s team reached the NAIA quarterfinals, and the 2017 team went undefeated in the regular season before losing in the Mid-South Conference finals.

The men&#x27;s team won the 2017 Mid-South Conference Tournament.

=== Wrestling ===
The wrestling program has produced four individual champions: Keith Cupp (174 lbs.), 2005; Corey Bleaken (157 lbs.), 2011; and Jake Williams (149 lbs.), 2014 and 2015.

=== Other sports ===
Cumberland achieved a top-ten finish at the National Collegiate Cycling Association&#x27;s National Championship. Cumberland achieved a National Tournament appearance for the No. 16-ranked Men&#x27;s Tennis Team in 2022.

==Notable alumni==

Cumberland University alumni include a U.S. Secretary of State, two U.S. Supreme Court justices, dozens of members of Congress, prominent social activists, significant military figures, and notable contributors to business, humanities, education, and the arts.

<doc id="586715" wikidata="Q1858886" url="?curid=586715" title="Vought OS2U Kingfisher">
<text>The Vought OS2U Kingfisher is an American catapult-launched observation floatplane. It was a compact mid-wing monoplane, with a large central float and small stabilizing floats. Performance was modest because of its low-powered engine. The OS2U could also operate on fixed, wheeled, taildragger landing gear.

The OS2U was the main shipboard observation seaplane used by the United States Navy during World War II, and 1,519 of the aircraft were built. It served on battleships and cruisers of the U.S. Navy, with the United States Marine Corps in Marine Scouting Squadron Three (VMS-3), with the United States Coast Guard at coastal air stations; at sea with the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy; with the Soviet Navy; and with the Royal Australian Air Force.

The Naval Aircraft Factory OS2N was the designation of the OS2U-3 aircraft built by the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The OS2U first flew on 1 March 1938.

==Design and development==

In the late 1930s, Vought engineer Rex Beisel was tasked with designing an observation monoplane aircraft for the U.S. Navy suitable for many tasks, including directing battleship fire. In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations making it the first production type to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced high-lift devices and spoilers. In a unique arrangement, deflector plate flaps and drooping ailerons were located on the trailing edge of the wing to increase the camber of the wing and thus create additional lift. Beisel&#x27;s first prototype flew in 1938, powered by an air-cooled, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985-4 Wasp Junior radial engine.

For combat missions, the pilot had a Browning M1919 machine gun, the receiver mounted low in the right front cockpit, firing between the engine cylinder heads, while the radio operator/gunner manned another machine gun (or a pair) on a flexible Scarff ring mount. The aircraft could also carry two bombs or two depth charges. Additionally, the &quot;Kingfisher&quot;, as it was designated, served as a trainer in both its floatplane and landplane configurations.

==Operational history==


The first 54 Kingfishers were delivered to the U.S. Navy beginning in August 1940, and 6 had been assigned to the Pearl Harbor–based Battle Force before the end of the same year. Many of the following 158 OS2U-2s were attached to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, but 53 were assigned to equip the newly established Inshore Patrol Squadrons, based at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. In 1942, nine more Inshore Patrol Squadrons were established, all exclusively equipped with OS2N-1s built by the Naval Aircraft Factory.

The Kingfisher was widely used as a shipboard, catapult-launched scout plane on U.S. Navy battleships, heavy cruisers, and light cruisers during World War II and played a major role in support of shore bombardments and air-sea rescue. Two examples showing the plane&#x27;s rescue capabilities include the recovery of World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker and his crew from the Pacific in November 1942 and Lieutenant John A. Burns&#x27; unique use of the aircraft on 30 April 1944 to taxi airmen rescued from Truk Lagoon to the submarine , which was serving rescue duty near the atoll. In all, Burns rescued ten survivors on two trips and was awarded the Navy Cross for his efforts.

The United States Coast Guard received 76 OS2U-3 Kingfishers starting in 1942 and employed them in anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance, and search and rescue roles. No Coast Guard Kingfisher is credited with sinking any enemy submarines; however, they were successful in rescuing sailors from ships sunk by enemy torpedoes. The Coast Guard operated Kingfishers until October 1944.

Australia received 18 Kingfishers from a batch of aircraft ordered by the Dutch East Indies that was diverted to Australia in 1942. They were initially used as training aircraft for pilots destined for flying boats, but in 1943 they were used to equip No. 107 Squadron RAAF, which carried out convoy escort duties until disbanded in October 1945. One Kingfisher was used in support of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947–48.

Throughout its U.S. Navy service, the OS2U and even its predecessor, the Curtiss SOC Seagull, served much longer than planned, as the planned successor, the Curtiss SO3C Seamew, suffered from an insufficiently powerful engine which was a complete failure. The OS2U was only slowly replaced in the latter stages of World War II with the introduction of the Curtiss SC Seahawk, the first examples reaching the U.S. Navy in October 1944.

<doc id="586719" wikidata="Q141082" url="?curid=586719" title="Marcel Dionne">
<text>Marcel Elphège Dionne (born August 3, 1951) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers between 1971 and 1989. A prolific scorer, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading scorer in 1979–80, and recorded 50 goals or more in a season six times, and 100 points or more in a season 8 times during his career. Internationally Dionne played for the Canadian national team at two Canada Cups and three World Championships. Dionne was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2017 Dionne was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Junior career==

Dionne played in the 1962, 1963 and 1964 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with his Drummondville youth team. Dionne&#x27;s first junior season was in 1968 for the Drummondville Rangers of the former Quebec Junior Hockey League, in which he scored over two goals a game in Drummondville&#x27;s losing effort in the Memorial Cup playoffs.

When the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League formed in 1969, Dionne departed to play in the Ontario Hockey Association, then regarded as a higher-calibre level of competition, spending the next three seasons with the St. Catharines Black Hawks. He became the league&#x27;s preeminent star, winning scoring titles in 1970 and 1971 and adding a record 122 points in 43 playoff games. He attended St. Catharines Collegiate during this time.

Dionne&#x27;s scoring feats were marred by one of the most infamous events in Canadian junior hockey during the 1971 Richardson Cup finals against the Quebec Remparts. Following a riot in Quebec City after the penalty-filled fourth game of the series in which Dionne&#x27;s Black Hawks&#x27; team bus was attacked by the mob, the fifth game was played at a neutral site, and the remainder of the series was not played due to fears of further violence.

Dionne finished his junior career by shattering the OHA&#x27;s career scoring record, which was not broken until Dale McCourt did so in the 1977 season. He was subsequently drafted in the first round (second overall, behind Rempart rival Guy Lafleur) by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==

===Detroit Red Wings===
Dionne played his first four seasons with the Red Wings, where he was one of the few stars on an otherwise stagnant team that failed to make the playoffs.

===Los Angeles Kings===
Despite having teammates such as Alex Delvecchio and Mickey Redmond, Dionne&#x27;s frustrations with losing were evident. His agent, Alan Eagleson pushed for more money. The owner of the Los Angeles Kings, Jack Kent Cooke, offered Dionne $300,000 per year. A deal was struck with the Red Wings and Dionne was traded for Terry Harper, Dan Maloney, cash, and draft picks; Dionne then signed with the Kings on June 23, 1975, and became their franchise player. At the time, it was the richest deal in hockey history.
During Dionne&#x27;s time with the Los Angeles Kings, he played eleven and a half seasons and formed the famed &quot;Triple Crown Line&quot;, centring Charlie Simmer and Dave Taylor. Despite Dionne&#x27;s production during the regular season, he was frustrated with the Kings&#x27; lack of playoff success; they made the postseason from 1976 to 1982 but only advanced to the second round three times for a total of 43 playoff games. During the 1986–87 season, Dionne mentored the rookies of the Kings as Mickey Redmond had mentored him during his rookie years in Detroit. He took eventual Calder Trophy winner Luc Robitaille, Jimmy Carson and Steve Duchesne under his wing. As a fundraiser for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in 1979, Dionne, Simmer, and Taylor recorded a song written by Alan Thicke, &quot;Please Forgive My Misconduct Last Night,&quot; which appeared as the B side of &quot;Hockey Sock Rock&quot; by Phil Esposito and some of the New York Rangers.

Despite the rapport with the rookies, there was also a falling out with coach Pat Quinn; moreover, the aging Kings were on track to miss the playoffs. Dionne did not want to be part of a rebuilding project and either wanted an immediate upgrade to the roster or a trade to a contender. He was traded to the New York Rangers on March 10, 1987; the Kings &quot;did&quot; reach the playoffs in the season he was traded.

===New York Rangers===
Dionne played his remaining two and a half seasons there, where the Rangers lost in the first round of the playoffs twice and missed the playoffs once. He retired in 1989.

==Retirement==
In January 2004, Dionne was featured on a Canadian postage stamp. As part of the NHL All-Stars Collection, Dionne was immortalized along with five other All-Stars.

Dionne has homes in Niagara Falls, Ontario and Clarence Center, New York. He has maintained a large business and investment portfolio since his playing days, owning the Blue Line Diner in Niagara Falls, operating a sports memorabilia store in Buffalo and buying and selling real estate.

==Achievements==
During Dionne&#x27;s first season for Detroit in 1972, he set an NHL record for scoring by a rookie with 77 points. This record has since been surpassed.

Dionne&#x27;s best season was 1979–80 when he had 137 points. That season, he was tied for the league lead in points with Wayne Gretzky. He was awarded the Art Ross Trophy for scoring two more goals than Gretzky, the only time he won the award. Dionne also won the Lester B. Pearson Award in 1979 and 1980, and the Lady Byng Trophy in 1975 and 1977.
Dionne was the third of eight men to reach the 700-goal plateau, and currently ranks sixth among all-time goal scorers, with 731. He is ranked sixth in points, with 1771. He is tenth in career assists with 1,040. He was second in assists, goals, and points when he retired in 1989 (he is 70 goals, 9 assists, and 79 points behind Gordie Howe in all categories). Dionne is the highest-scoring player to have never won the Stanley Cup.

He was also the last active player in the NHL to have participated in the 1972 Summit Series. Despite not playing in the 1972 Summit Series, he did play for Team Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup and the 1981 Canada Cup. For the 1976 Canada Cup, his linemates were Bobby Hull and Phil Esposito. He was also on a line with Lanny McDonald and Darryl Sittler and they were on the ice when the tournament winning goal was scored. While on the 1981 team, he was on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Guy Lafleur. Dionne also won a bronze medal in the 1978, 1983 and 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships. In the 1978 edition, he was named the top forward.

Dionne is third in the NHL for most 100+ point seasons. He has had eight 100+ point seasons in his NHL career, only behind Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s fifteen 100+ point seasons and Mario Lemieux&#x27;s ten 100+ point seasons.

Dionne was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1998, he was ranked number 38 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, the highest-ranking player to have not won a Stanley Cup since 2001 when No. 14-ranked Ray Bourque won with the Colorado Avalanche. Dionne had not come close to doing so, as he never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs. When the Los Angeles Kings finally reached the Stanley Cup finals in 1993, after advancing to and winning their first conference finals, Dionne gave Dave Taylor a congratulatory call.

The former Centre Civique arena in Drummondville was renamed Centre Marcel Dionne in his honour after his retirement.

Dionne&#x27;s younger brother Gilbert also played in the NHL and won a Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.

Prior to the start of the 1993–94 season, Dionne helped to create local interest in the ECHL&#x27;s newest franchise, the South Carolina Stingrays. With the help of some young players, Dionne gave an on-ice demonstration of the rules of hockey to the southern audience.

Dionne currently resides in Niagara Falls, Ontario, and owns Marcel Dionne Enterprises. He is an occasional member of the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team despite never playing, or living there as a player. He is also a Royal Ambassador for the Kings organization.

<text>The Alytidae are a family of primitive frogs. Their common name is painted frogs or midwife toads. Most are endemic to Europe, but three species occur in northwest Africa, and a species formerly thought to be extinct is found in Israel.

This family is also known as Discoglossidae, but the older name Alytidae has priority and is now recognized by major reference works. Some researchers, though, suggest that &quot;Alytes&quot; and &quot;Discoglossus&quot; are different enough to be treated as belonging to separate families, implying resurrection of the Discoglossidae. The term &quot;discoglossid&quot; has also been used to refer to many primitive fossil frogs that share plesiomorphic (ancestral) similities to alytids, but that are probably not closely related.

==Genera and species==
The family contains three extant genera, &quot;Alytes&quot;, &quot;Discoglossus&quot;, and &quot;Latonia&quot;. The first is somewhat toad-like and can often be found on land. The second is smoother and more frog-like, preferring the water. The third genus was until recently considered extinct, and is represented by the recently rediscovered Hula painted frog. All of the species have pond-dwelling tadpoles.

The genera &quot;Bombina&quot; and &quot;Barbourula&quot; also used to be under this family, but have now been moved to the Bombinatoridae.

<text>Archaeobatrachia (Neo-Latin &quot;archaeo-&quot; (&quot;old&quot;) + &quot;batrachia&quot; (&quot;frog&quot;)) is a suborder of the order Anura containing various primitive frogs and toads. As the name suggests, these are the most primitive frogs. Many of the species (28 in total) show certain physiological characteristics which are not present in other frogs and toads, thus giving rise to this group. They are largely found in Eurasia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Borneo, and are characteristically small. In addition, the family Ascaphidae is found in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, and is only represented by two species. The taxon is considered paraphyletic.

<text>The Empire Club of Canada is a Canadian speakers&#x27; forum. Established in 1903, the Empire Club has provided a forum for many thousands of different speakers.

Through a variety of presentation formats, the Empire Club invites local, national and international leaders and other change-agents to address the topical, relevant issues of the day. The club is based in Toronto, Ontario, with luncheon-style meetings held at several different downtown hotel and meeting spaces. It pivoted to virtual meetings as a result of health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

== History ==
The Empire Club of Canada was established in 1903 as a result of a political discussion which created considerable unrest in Canada. Growing dissent against the British was influencing Toronto&#x27;s political and social landscape. In an attempt to refrain from a severing of ties with the British Empire, a group of men under the leadership of Brig.-Gen. James Mason discussed the creation of an organization that would promote public discourse and discussion about key issues of the day, both at home and abroad.

With this mandate in mind, the group gathered to draft the constitution for a new club to be named The Empire Club of Canada. Canada&#x27;s &quot;Imperial bond&quot; with Britain was the cornerstone of the Empire Club of Canada, as its founders believed it would be beneficial to Canada to maintain strong political and economic ties with the Empire. This organization, with a plan of weekly luncheons, which would be addressed by prominent individuals who spoke with authority on the issues of the day, would also have the distinctive basis of the British connection in its work and policy. Membership was restricted to British subjects—there was no legal Canadian citizenship at the time—who would pay dues of one dollar a year, with a maximum membership of 500. Within a month, membership exceeded 300. A year or two later, the club had a waiting list of those wishing to join.

The first luncheon speaker on December 3, 1903, was a clergyman and professor, William Clark, who said: &quot;I can quite understand that to many persons, the formation of a club of this kind will seem a very little thing, ... I have not the least doubt that this Club will become of great influence and power in this Dominion&quot;. Clark&#x27;s address became the first of many, with the Empire Club&#x27;s podium hosting countless great leaders of politics, business, social issues and arts &amp; culture. 

Since its inaugural meeting in December 1903, the Empire Club of Canada has provided a forum to discuss ongoing issues of local, national and international importance. More than 3,500 addresses have been delivered from the Empire Club podium, and every address is kept on record in the Empire Club of Canada&#x27;s annual Red Book.

== Notable speakers ==

Some highly notable speakers who have addressed the Empire Club podium have included:
* Indira Gandhi
* Brian Mulroney
* The Dalai Lama
* Margaret Thatcher
* Bill Gates
* Audrey Hepburn
* John Diefenbaker
* Ronald Reagan
* Margaret Mead
* Prince Philip
* Winston Churchill
* Billy Graham
* Chrystia Freeland
* Pierre Trudeau
* Grey Owl
* Henry N.R. Jackman
* Jean Chrétien

* Roberta Bondar
* Adrienne Clarkson
* Paul Martin
* Stephen Harper
* Michael Ignatieff
* Mark Carney
* Christopher Plummer
* Gordon Pinsent
* Beverley McLachlin
* Kyle Dubas 
* Bobby Webster
== The Empire Club Foundation ==

The Empire Club Foundation was incorporated in January 1969 and serves as a vehicle for the publication and wide-distribution of the Club&#x27;s speeches. Copies are sent to a large distribution of schools, libraries, consulates and embassies.

Registered as a charity, its objectives are to promote the interest in current and public affairs, and to establish a historical database of all Empire Club speeches. All of the Empire Club speeches since 1903 are available via the Empire Club&#x27;s website. In 2021, Dr. Gordon McIvor, Past President of the Empire Club of Canada, was appointed as the Chair of the Empire Club Foundation (gordonmcivor.ca).

<doc id="586740" wikidata="Q750003" url="?curid=586740" title="Sleeper (1973 film)">
<text>Sleeper is a 1973 American science fiction comedy film directed by and starring Woody Allen, who co-wrote it with Marshall Brickman. Parodying a dystopic future of the United States in 2173, the film involves the misadventures of the owner of a health food store who is cryogenically frozen in 1973 and defrosted 200 years later in an ineptly led police state. Contemporary politics and pop culture are satirized throughout the film, which includes tributes to the classic comedy of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin. Many elements of notable works of science fiction are also paid tribute to, or parodied.

==Plot==
Miles Monroe is a jazz musician and owner of the &quot;Happy Carrot&quot; health-food store in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. He walks into the hospital in 1973 for a routine operation, which goes wrong, leaving him relegated to 200 years of anonymous cryopreservation. Two scientists in 2173 illegally revive him. They are members of an underground rebellion at odds with the police state the United States had become after the massive destruction caused when &quot;a man named Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead.&quot;
It is ostensibly ruled by a dictator known only as &quot;The Leader&quot;, and about to implement a secret plan known as the &quot;Aries Project.&quot; The rebels hope to use Miles as a spy to infiltrate and derail it, as he is the only member of the dystopian society without a known biometric identity.

The authorities grow suspicious and arrive in force to question the scientists, who are arrested and taken to have their brains &quot;electronically simplified&quot;. Miles escapes by disguising himself as a robot, which is then randomly delivered to work in the home of idle socialite Luna Schlosser. When Luna decides to have her new butler&#x27;s rather unattractive head replaced with something more &quot;aesthetically pleasing,&quot; Miles reveals his true identity. Spooked at his disclosure and unsympathetic to the rebels, she threatens to turn him in to the authorities. In response, Miles kidnaps her and goes on the run, searching for the Aries Project.

After much bickering, Miles and Luna fall in love. Miles is captured and brainwashed into becoming a complacent member of society, while Luna escapes and joins the rebellion. The rebels kidnap Miles and perform successful reverse-brainwashing. Miles falls into the routine of rebel life, but grows jealous when he catches Luna kissing the handsome, hunky rebel leader, Erno Windt, and she announces that she has come to believe in free love.

Miles tries to win Luna back. Eventually he and Luna infiltrate the Aries Project, wherein they quickly learn that the national Leader had been killed by a rebel bomb ten months previously. All that survives is his nose. Miles and Luna disguise themselves as doctors, resulting in a case of mistaken identity, causing them to be placed in charge of cloning the Leader from his sole remaining part. Miles steals the nose and deadends the government&#x27;s cloning scheme by dropping the nose in the path of a road roller.

The pair escape, and later debate their future together. Miles tells Luna that Erno will inevitably become as corrupt as the Leader, as that is how all revolutions end up. Miles and Luna confess their love for one another, but she claims that science has proven men and women cannot have meaningful relationships due to chemical incompatibilities. Miles dismisses this, saying that he does not believe in science. Luna then points out that he does not believe in God or political systems either, and asks if there is anything he does believe in. He responds, &quot;Sex and death—two things that come once in a lifetime—but at least after death, you&#x27;re not nauseous.&quot; The two embrace and kiss.

==Production==
Much of the film was shot in and around Denver, Colorado. The outdoor shots of the hospital were filmed at the Mesa Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. There is a brief shot of the main building of the Denver Botanic Gardens and of the concrete lamp posts. Other scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, Monterey and at the Culver City Studios.

The Sculptured House, designed by architect Charles Deaton, is a private home located on Genesee Mountain near Genesee Park, west of Denver. The Mile Hi Church of Religious Science in Lakewood, Colorado, was turned into a futuristic McDonald&#x27;s, featuring a sign counting the number sold: 795 followed by 51 zeroes.

Author Christopher Turner has suggested that the orgasmatron, the electromechanical device that Monroe encounters, was a parody of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s orgone accumulator.

Science fiction author Ben Bova was an uncredited science advisor to the film.

==Reception==
&quot;Sleeper&quot; opened at the Coronet and Little Carnegie theatres in New York City on December 17, 1973. It received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 100% approval rating based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 8.03/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;In &quot;Sleeper&quot;, Woody Allen&#x27;s madcap futurist comedy, practically each joke and one-liner hits its target.&quot;

Vincent Canby, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the film &quot;terrific&quot;, saying it confidently advances the Allen art into slapstick territory that I associate with the best of Laurel and Hardy. It&#x27;s the kind of film comedy that no one in Hollywood has done with style in many years, certainly not since Jerry Lewis began to take himself seriously. &quot;Sleeper&quot; is a comic epic that recalls the breathless pace and dizzy logic of the old two-reelers. Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ out of four stars, saying Allen &quot;gives us moments in &quot;Sleeper&quot; that are as good as anything since the silent films of Buster Keaton.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The movie&#x27;s rapid pace and often slapstick action is mirrored by a lively soundtrack composed heavily of Dixieland-style jazz, much of it performed by members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. Allen, an amateur clarinetist with a regular weekly gig as a member of the &quot;Ragtime Rascals&quot; at Michael&#x27;s Pub in midtown Manhattan, sat in with the Band. The New Orleans Funeral and Ragtime Orchestra was also featured. Additional recording was done at Michael&#x27;s.

==Accolades==
In 1973, the film was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation at Discon II, the 32nd World Science Fiction Convention, in Washington, D.C.

In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;Sleeper&quot; the 30th Greatest Comedy Film of All Time.

In 2000, American Film Institute included the film in its list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs (#80).

In October 2013, the film was voted by readers of the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the tenth best film directed by Allen.

==Film as tribute==
Aspects of the film&#x27;s storyline are similar to the plot of the 1910 H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;.

In &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, Kim Newman writes that &quot;Sleeper&quot;″s &quot;vision of the future [is] informed by films like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), and &quot;Z.P.G.&quot; (1972).&quot;

The anthem sung by the rebels &quot;(&quot;Rebels are we, ...&quot;)&quot; is the same as the one sung by the guerrillas in Allen&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Bananas&quot;.

In a 2007 interview, Allen stated that &quot;Sleeper&quot; was made as a tribute to the comedians whom he deeply admired, including Groucho Marx and Bob Hope.

<doc id="586746" wikidata="Q42218456" url="?curid=586746" title="24 Hours to Live">
<text>24 Hours to Live is a 2017 science fiction action thriller film directed by Brian Smrz and starring Ethan Hawke, Xu Qing, Paul Anderson, Liam Cunningham, and Rutger Hauer. It follows a career assassin who goes on a rampage to exact revenge and find redemption after he is mortally wounded and brought back to life for 24 hours using a newly developed technology. The film premiered at the Austin Film Festival on October 26, 2017, and was released on VOD and in select theaters on December 1, 2017.

==Plot==
In South Africa, a convoy of Interpol agents led by Lin (Xu Qing) transports a prisoner, Keith. At a checkpoint, they are ambushed. Most of the agents are killed, but Lin escapes with Keith.

Travis Conrad (Ethan Hawke), a hitman, fishes with his father in law, Frank (Rutger Hauer). They scatter ashes in the ocean, noting the one year anniversary of the deaths they commemorate. After Frank falls asleep, Travis goes to a bar to get cocaine. He assaults two thugs following him who tell him Jim wants to see him. Jim offers Travis $1 million per day to clean up the botched assassination attempt on Keith and Lin. Though he initially refuses, claiming he&#x27;s retired, the money convinces him. He travels to Hong Kong and meets Lin&#x27;s son, from whom he steals his cell phone and determines Lin&#x27;s location. He meets her at the airport and seduces her. The next morning, he gets Keith&#x27;s location from her phone but chooses not to kill her; she realizes he is an agent and kills him.

Travis&#x27; agency, Red Mountain, brings him back to life using an experimental procedure. Once he tells them Keith&#x27;s location, Jim, his friend and former fellow Marine, informs him that they just revived him to get the location, and the doctor plans to kill him upon her return. Travis obtains a scalpel and cuts his restraints; when the doctor returns he kills a guard and learns from her that with a timer on his wrist, he has 24 hours to live. He escapes with her as a hostage and pursues Lin, telling her not to make him regret not killing her.

Keith testifies against Red Mountain, revealing they experimented on over 70 civilians to develop the resurrection procedure and forced him to dispose of the bodies. Just after he testifies, Jim snipes several guards from a clocktower and Red Mountain assaults the building. Lin and Keith escape when Travis arrives to help, knowing Red Mountain betrayed him. During the chase, Keith is killed, but he managed to get the camera&#x27;s memory card before they left. Travis entrusts the card to Lin, but Jim calls to inform them that they have taken her son in exchange for the card. Travis decides to help her retrieve him and collects guns and explosives from a safe house.

They travel to the village where the civilians Red Mountain experimented on lived and enlist their help in avenging them. Travis knows prisoner transport protocol; they corner and ambush the convoy and get the boy back. Travis tells Lin to get the testimony to the authorities and decides to spend his last half hour alive delaying Red Mountain from pursuing her. He forces a surviving Red Mountain agent to drive him to base claiming he is the prisoner; when he arrives he kills several guards and drives the car into the building. He detonates the car and assaults the office where Jim and the Red Mountain leader, Wetzler, are holed up. After killing all the agents in the room, Wetzler tries to goad Travis into killing Jim, who knew that Wetzler ordered his wife and son killed in an attempt to keep him from quitting the company. Though angered, Travis feels remorse for all the killing he&#x27;s done and lets Jim live. Jim then approaches Wetzler to kill him as police arrive. Though they warn him not to shoot, he shoots Wetzler and is killed by the police.

Travis dies and has a vision of his family on a beach. He beckons for his son, but he runs away. Travis begins to hear the doctor&#x27;s voice and awakes in the lab where he was first resurrected.

<doc id="586749" wikidata="Q5172650" url="?curid=586749" title="Corpus Christi Hooks">
<text>The Corpus Christi Hooks are a Minor League Baseball team of the Texas League and the Double-A affiliate of the Houston Astros. They are located in Corpus Christi, Texas, and are named for the city&#x27;s association with fishing. The team is owned by the Houston Astros. The Hooks play their home games at Whataburger Field, which opened in 2005 and is located on Corpus Christi&#x27;s waterfront.

==History==
The history of the Hooks&#x27; franchise dates back to 1968, when it got its start in the Texas League as the Memphis Blues. That club won the league crown twice, in 1969 and 1973. In 1974, the franchise moved to Victoria, Texas and played in Toro Stadium, where it captured the league title in its lone season as the Toros. The following year, the club moved to Jackson, Mississippi where it would remain for the next 25 seasons, first as the Mets (1975–1990), then as the Generals (1991–1999). The franchise qualified for the playoffs 13 times and won the TL championship on five occasions (1981, 1984, 1985, 1993 and 1996). During the years 1980–1987, Jackson dominated the league, making it to eight consecutive post-seasons.

Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan and his group acquired the franchise following the 1998 season and moved it from Jackson to Round Rock in time for the 2000 season. The Round Rock Express, led by Morgan Ensberg and Roy Oswalt, powered their way to the Texas League title in that first season at The Dell Diamond. The Express, which shattered league attendance records throughout their five-year run, also qualified for post-season play in four of those five seasons.

The move of the franchise from Round Rock to Corpus Christi following the 2004 season was made possible when the owners of the Express, Ryan Sanders Baseball, acquired the Triple-A franchise in Edmonton, Canada and announced their intention to move the club to Round Rock. That paved the way for the Double-A franchise to relocate to the Gulf Coast of Texas.
In 2004 the organization held a &quot;Name the Team&quot; contest that sought suggestions from the community for a new name for the team. The contest was won by Corpus Christi resident, Michael Braly. The team&#x27;s new name, Corpus Christi Hooks was born. The team&#x27;s colors are white, red, and light blue, representing the ocean and sky of the popular South Texas fishing area. The team mascots are Sammy the Seagull and Rusty the Fish Hook.

===2006 championship team===
One of the most exciting moments in the team&#x27;s history was an appearance by Roger Clemens on June 11, 2006, as he prepared for his return to the Astros. Clemens&#x27; start attracted nationwide attention and a record crowd of 9,022. Clemens struck out 11 batters in 6 innings on his way to the victory. Tickets were being sold on eBay for up to $230.

On September 14, 2006, in a wild 5 hour, 14 inning marathon, the Corpus Christi Hooks eclipsed the Wichita Wranglers, 8–7, clinching the third and decisive game to defeat Wichita 3 games to 1 in the best of five series to win the 2006 Texas League Championship. This marked the first time a Corpus Christi franchise has won the TL Championship since the 1958 Corpus Christi Giants. Manager Dave Clark was named 2006 Texas League Manager of the Year and pitcher Matt Albers was named 2006 Texas League Pitcher of the Year.

===Post-championship===
On June 25, 2007, Whataburger Field played host to the 2007 installment of the Texas League All-Star Game. Seven Hooks players were invited to play on the squad. From 2005 to 2010, the Hooks graduated 29 players to the major leagues and had another 31 players with big-league experience wear the Corpus Christi uniform. From 2005 to 2010, a total of 163 men played for the Hooks.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Hooks were organized into the Double-A Central. For the 2021 season, the Hooks played every Wednesday game as the &quot;Corpus Christi Honey Butter Chicken Biscuits&quot;. Whataburger, which sponsors the team&#x27;s ballpark, sells the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit, and was founded in Corpus Christi. The uniforms resembled Whataburger&#x27;s table tents. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Notable Hooks who played in the major leagues==

A number of Hooks players have been called up to the major leagues since the team has been in Corpus Christi. These include Charlton Jimerson, Héctor Giménez, J. R. House, Matt Albers, Fernando Nieve, Chris Sampson, Jason Hirsh, Hunter Pence, Jason Castro, Chris Johnson, Jose Altuve, Fernando Abad, Arcenio León, J. D. Martinez, Dallas Keuchel, Josh Zeid, Carlos Correa, Philip Barzilla, Alex Bregman, J. D. Davis, George Springer, and Yordan Alvarez.

<doc id="586750" wikidata="Q920926" url="?curid=586750" title="Paul Coffey">
<text>Paul Patrick Coffey (born June 1, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played for nine teams over 21 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Known for his speed and scoring prowess, Coffey ranks second all-time among NHL defencemen in goals, assists, and points, behind only Ray Bourque. He won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman three times and was voted to eight end-of-season All-Star teams (four first-team and four second-team). He holds the record for the most goals by a defenceman in one season, 48 in 1985–86, and is the only defenceman to have scored 40 goals more than once, also doing it in 1983–84. He is also one of only two defencemen to score 100 points in a season more than once, as he did it five times; Bobby Orr did it six times. Coffey holds or shares 33 NHL records in the regular season and playoffs.

During his NHL career, he played for the Edmonton Oilers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Los Angeles Kings, Detroit Red Wings, Hartford Whalers, Philadelphia Flyers, Carolina Hurricanes, Chicago Blackhawks, and Boston Bruins. He is a four-time Stanley Cup champion, winning three times with Edmonton and a fourth with Pittsburgh.

Coffey was born in Weston, Ontario, and grew up in Malton, Ontario. The city of Mississauga renamed Malton Arena to Paul Coffey Arena and Wildwood Park to Paul Coffey Park in a ceremony on September 23, 2016. In 2017, Coffey was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

==Playing career==
In his youth, Coffey played in the 1974 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mississauga.

Coffey was drafted sixth overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1980 NHL entry draft. He blossomed in the 1981–82 season, scoring 89 points and was named a second-team NHL All-Star. In the Oilers&#x27; first Stanley Cup-winning season, 1983–84, he became only the second defenceman in NHL history to score 40 goals in a season and added 86 assists to finish second in point scoring. He won his first James Norris Memorial Trophy in 1984–85 while posting 37 goals and 121 points. On December 26, 1984, in a game against the Calgary Flames, Coffey became the last defenceman in the 20th century to score four goals in one game. Coffey went on to post a historic post-season in the 1985 Playoffs, setting records for most goals (12), assists (25), and points (37) in one playoff year by a defenceman on the way to another Stanley Cup. He won the Norris Trophy again in 1985–86, while breaking Bobby Orr&#x27;s record for goals in a season by a defenceman, scoring 48. His 138 points that year was second only to Orr (139 in 1970–71) among defencemen.

Coffey helped Edmonton to a third Cup in 1986–87, but the deciding Game 7 of that year&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals against the Philadelphia Flyers would be his last in an Oiler uniform. Coffey had two years remaining on a contract that paid him a reported $320,000 a year, but held out at the beginning of the 1987–88 season, wanting the contract renegotiated to pay him $800,000 a year. Team owner Peter Pocklington refused to do so, and offended Coffey by suggesting he lacked courage when playing; Coffey vowed never to put on an Edmonton uniform again and demanded a trade. On November 24, 1987, the Oilers traded Coffey, along with Dave Hunter and Wayne Van Dorp, to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Craig Simpson, Dave Hannan, Moe Mantha, and Chris Joseph.

As the Penguins&#x27; Rod Buskas was already wearing uniform number 7, Coffey agreed to change his uniform number from 7 to 77. He would wear it for most of the rest of his career until his final season in Boston, where he wore 74. Coffey played four and a half seasons with Pittsburgh. On December 22, 1990, Coffey became the second defenceman to record 1,000 points, doing so in a record-breaking 770 games. Coffey won a fourth Stanley Cup in 1990–91 with Pittsburgh. During the 1992 season, Coffey passed Denis Potvin to become the career leader in goals, assists, and points by a defenceman. He was then traded to the Los Angeles Kings where he was reunited with former Oilers teammates Wayne Gretzky and Jari Kurri for parts of two seasons.

After his brief stint with Los Angeles, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings where he played for three and a half seasons. In the lock-out shortened 1994–95 NHL season, Coffey led his team in scoring for the only time in his entire career and was awarded the Norris Trophy for the third time. In the 1995 playoffs, he led all defencemen in scoring while helping Detroit to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the favoured Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four games. Coffey would then help the Red Wings to an astounding 62 regular season wins the following year, though the team would ultimately get eliminated by the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals. During Game 1 of that series, Coffey scored two goals but also accidentally scored on his own net after Colorado&#x27;s Stephane Yelle attempted to pass the puck into the slot but it instead ended up on Coffey&#x27;s stick.

After a falling-out with Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman, Coffey was traded to the Hartford Whalers at the start of the 1996–97 season as part of a package to acquire Brendan Shanahan – a move that Coffey was unhappy with.

Coffey only played 20 games for the Whalers before being traded to the Flyers. He played for Philadelphia for a season and a half, reaching the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, his seventh, against his former team, Detroit. Coffey&#x27;s Final series was not successful, being on the ice for six of Detroit&#x27;s goals and was in the penalty box for a seventh when the Flyers conceded a power-play goal, ending up with no points and being minus-2 and minus-3 in the first two games, and a hit from Darren McCarty in game two left Coffey sidelined for the rest of the series with a concussion.


After a very brief stint (10 games) with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes, where he played one and a half seasons. He played his final season in 2000–01 with the Boston Bruins.

During Coffey&#x27;s last NHL season, Ray Bourque passed his career goal, assist, and point records, and Bourque and Coffey both retired after the 2000–01 season. Coffey finished with 396 goals, 1135 assists, and 1531 points, and remains second only to Bourque in all-time career scoring by a defenceman. Coffey, however, averaged more points per game than did Bourque, having played 203 fewer games but lagging by only 48 points.

Paul Coffey was voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004, his first year of eligibility, and the Edmonton Oilers retired his uniform number 7 in 2005.
==Post-playing career==
While coaching a game for the Toronto Marlboros midget &#x27;AAA&#x27; team in February 2014, Coffey was assessed a gross misconduct penalty for a &quot;discriminatory slur&quot;. The Greater Toronto Hockey League investigated the misconduct penalty and Coffey was handed a three-game suspension. Coffey is a co-owner of the OJHL&#x27;s Pickering Panthers.

On November 12, 2023, Coffey returned to the Edmonton Oilers as the assistant coach.

==Personal life==
Coffey was the owner of a car dealership in Bolton, Ontario. Coffey and his wife have three children.

<text>Captain Harry Willes Darell de Windt (9 April 1856, Paris – 30 November 1933, Bournemouth) was the aide-de-camp to his brother-in-law Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak (Harry&#x27;s sister Margaret was Brooke&#x27;s wife), and is best known as an explorer and travel writer. His books were published under the name of Harry de Windt.

Harry de Windt was the son of Captain Joseph Clayton Jennyns de Windt, of Blunsdon Hall, between Swindon and Highworth in Wiltshire, England. He was admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1875, but did not take a degree, travelling with his brother-in-law from 1876 to 1878.

His first wife was Frances Laura Arabella Long, sister to the 1st Viscount Long of Wraxall, whom he married in London in 1882. They were divorced in 1888. There was one child from this union, a daughter, Margaret Maude. Harry married Hilda Frances E Clark, daughter of the Rev Professor William Robinson Clark, in 1899; she died in 1924. In 1927, Harry married the actress Charlotte Elizabeth Ihle, better known by her stage name, Elaine Inescourt.

<text>Cogito is a philosophical magazine published by Nefeli publications (Athens, Greece) and a member of the Eurozine network. It was founded in 2004 with the intention of making philosophy accessible to the lay reader without compromising it through oversimplification. &quot;Cogito&quot; is therefore an attempt to approach everyday issues and themes through a philosophically rigorous lens. Contributors, most of them professional philosophers but also academics from a variety of disciplines, as well as writers, consider such varied topics as colors, taste, gardens, cinema, desire and love, art and aesthetics, and logical paradoxes. Each issue, consisting of a number of articles, is dedicated to a different topic: privacy, intelligence both natural and artificial, applied ethics, history and narrative, friendship. Each issue further presents a philosopher to its readers. In the past, subjects of this &#x27;philosophical library&#x27; have included Plato, Wittgenstein, J.S. Mill, and Kant.

<text>Jon Gordon Langseth Jr. (born January 29, 1981), known as Jonny Lang, is an American blues, gospel, rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He has recorded five albums that have charted on the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and won a Grammy Award for &quot;Turn Around&quot;.

==Biography==
Jonny Lang was born Jon Gordon Langseth Jr. in Fargo, North Dakota and is of Norwegian descent. He started playing the guitar for his friends at age 12. He played a wide variety of music. He also performed a rendition of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s version of the National Anthem. Soon after his father took him to see the Bad Medicine Blues Band, one of the few blues bands in Fargo, Lang started taking guitar lessons from Ted Larsen, the band&#x27;s guitar player. Several months after Lang began, he joined the band, which was then renamed Kid Jonny Lang &amp; The Big Bang. Two years later, A&amp;M Records, who had signed Janet Jackson and Soundgarden, was invited to come to see him at a live performance at Bunkers Bar in Minneapolis, and he was signed to the label in 1986, becoming the latest in a trend of young blues guitarists that then included Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Derek Trucks. The band moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and independently released the album &quot;Smokin&quot;&#x27; when Lang was 14. He released &quot;Lie to Me&quot; on January 28, 1997 and its title track would go on to become his most successful. The next album, &quot;Wander this World&quot;, was released on October 20, 1998, and earned a Grammy nomination. This was followed by the more soulful &quot;Long Time Coming&quot; on October 14, 2003. Lang also made a cover of Edgar Winter&#x27;s &quot;Dying to Live&quot;. Lang&#x27;s 2006 album, the gospel-influenced &quot;Turn Around&quot;, won him his first Grammy Award.

In his earliest performing years, Lang always performed barefoot on stage because &quot;it feels good&quot; and once in tribute to Luther Allison, a friend who had recently died. He has since given up that practice, after several near-accidents and electric shocks.

Lang made a cameo appearance in the 1998 film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000,&quot; as a janitor. In 1999, he was selected by the newly elected Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. Later that year, he was invited to play at the White House for President Bill Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Clinton. In 2004, Eric Clapton asked Lang to play at the Crossroads Guitar Festival to raise money for the Crossroads Centre Antigua. In more than ten years on the road, Lang has toured with many notable artists such as the Rolling Stones, Buddy Guy, Beth Hart, Aerosmith, B.B. King, Blues Traveler, Jeff Beck and Sting.

Lang also appears regularly as a part of the Experience Hendrix Tour, along with many other well-known guitarists to pay tribute to the deceased guitar legend.

On September 17, 2013, Lang released his first studio album in seven years, &quot;Fight for My Soul&quot;.

&quot;Signs&quot; was released on September 1, 2017 in Europe, and on September 8, in North America.

On January 12, 2021, it was announced that all confirmed concert dates were canceled until further notice because of a medical issue that affects Lang&#x27;s singing.

==Musical equipment==
Jonny Lang, since the beginning with The Big Bang, has used a 1972 Fender Telecaster Thinline made by the Fender Custom Shop, as well as a 1958 reissue custom shop Gibson Les Paul in more recent years as his sound and style have grown and flourished. His original Custom Shop Tele - with a black flamed maple top, flamed maple neck, pearl signature inlay and his trademark pinup girl character on the aft body was stolen some years ago. He has added a couple more custom thin-line teles-all carrying the basic aesthetic motif, but with varying colors from a burnt orange/amber to a deep violet throughout the years since. The 1972 Fender Telecaster Thin line is a semi-hollow spruce body, maple top, and a maple neck and fretboard. He has not, however, sported the pearl &quot;Jonny Lang&quot; signature inlay since his original custom tele, but still stays true to his WWII-style pinup girl at body artwork. Jonny&#x27;s Telecasters have three Bill Lawrence Pickups (L500 Neck, L500XL Bridge) with a 5-way pickup switch and a coil tap for accessing a single-coil tone. On his pedalboard for his 2014 tour was the Analog Man King of Tone, a Whirlwind The Bomb boost, a Visual Sound V2 Route 808, a Fulltone Ultimate Octave, a JAM Pedals Tube Dreamer, and a Boss AW-3 Dynamic Wah. On this tour, he played his Custom Shop Tele and the 1958 reissue Custom Shop Gibson Les Paul through a pair of modified Fender ’65 Deluxe Reverb amps. Lang also used an Arbiter Fuzz Face and an Electro-Harmonix POG for The Experience Hendrix tour. Lang has also used Audio tech Guitar Products ABC Selector CCM on his 2005 acoustic tour.

The guitar featured on the cover of &quot;Lie to Me&quot; is not a Telecaster but an original Fender Esquire. Upon filming the music video for the title track &quot;Lie to Me&quot; which took place in a San Francisco music store, the store owner suggested Lang play the Esquire in the video. Lang fell in love with the guitar and it was purchased and given to him as a gift. He continues to use it, but not as often as his Custom Shop Telecaster and Signature Series Les Paul.

==Band personnel==
From 1993 to 1996, Lang&#x27;s backing band was the Big Bang. This group consisted of three founding members of the Bad Medicine Blues Band: Ted &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Boy&quot; Larsen on guitar, his brother Michael Rey Larsen on drums, and Jeff Hayenga on bass. Keyboardist Bruce McCabe joined The Big Bang in 1995 after Lang and this young band from Fargo impressed him with their set opening for McCabe&#x27;s band at the time, The Hoopsnakes.

From 1996 to 2004, Lang&#x27;s backing band included Paul Diethelm on guitar, Bruce McCabe on keyboards, Doug Nelson on bass and Billy Thommes on drums. Also appearing on keyboards during 2003 and 2004 was Donnie La Marca, filling in for McCabe during his break from touring. Nelson was killed in a traffic accident in 2000 and was replaced by Billy Franze. Franze was in turn replaced by Jim Anton in 2003. Saxophone player David Eiland was added in 2000, providing Lang with a foil for extended instrumental jams. In 2005, Lang replaced the entire lineup, except for Anton, and embarked on an acoustic tour. He performed with Wendy Alane Wright at the 2000 pre-Grammy party. Guitarist Reeve Carney was the band&#x27;s opening act for several shows in 2005, as well as for the 2006 and 2007 tours.

The recent band lineup includes Barry Alexander from Minneapolis on drums, Jim Anton from Minneapolis on bass, Akil Thompson from Nashville on rhythm guitar, Dwan Hill from Nashville on keys, Missi Hale from Los Angeles on background vocals. 

As of 2017, Lang&#x27;s band line up was Barry Alexander on drums, Jim Anton on bass, Tyrus Sass on keyboards and Zane Carney on rhythm guitar.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Lang married former &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; cast member Haylie Johnson on June 8, 2001, making him the brother-in-law of actress Ashley Johnson. Lang and his wife share the same birthday, although she is one year older. They live in Los Angeles and have five children.

Lang has two older sisters, Stephanie and Heidi Jo. He has one younger sister, Jessica &quot;Jesse&quot; Langseth, who was a contestant on season 8 of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

=== Conversion to Christianity ===
Lang became a Christian in 2000. In an interview with Sara Groves in &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Lang gave details about his conversion, assuring her that he had had a supernatural experience with the Holy Ghost. In his own words, he has said that he formerly &quot;hated Christianity&quot; and &quot;despised the things of God&quot;, but now he wants to share with others about Jesus&#x27; love.

The songs &quot;Only a Man&quot; and &quot;Thankful&quot; from his album &quot;Turn Around&quot;, are about his belief in God. He has also co-written a couple of songs with contemporary Christian music artist Steven Curtis Chapman, notably &quot;My Love Remains&quot;.

<text>Frank Brown (August 8, 1846 – February 3, 1920), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 42nd Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1892 to 1896. He also served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1876 to 1878.

==Early life==
Frank Brown was born on August 8, 1846, near Sykesville, Maryland, to Susan A. (née Bennett) and Stephen T. Cockey Brown. His great-grandfather Abel Brown emigrated from Dumfries, Scotland, to Maryland. His mother&#x27;s father was a farmer in Carroll County. Brown studied at schools in Carroll, Howard and Baltimore counties. At a young age, Brown worked at R. Sinclair and Company in Baltimore.

==Career==
In 1870, he became a clerk of one of the state&#x27;s tobacco warehouses. He worked there until 1876. Brown served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1876 to 1878. In 1880, Brown became the president of the Maryland State Agricultural and Mechanical Society. He served in that role until 1892. In 1885, he was treasurer of the Democratic State Central Committee. In 1886, Brown succeeded I. Parker Veazey as the postmaster of Baltimore. He served in that role until 1890. While postmaster, sub-stations to the post office were created, a system of post parcel and newspaper boxes was established and carts were first used for mail collection.

In 1887, Brown was one of five candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but he lost to Elihu Emory Jackson. In 1891, Brown defeated Republican candidate William J. Vannort in the election for Governor of Maryland. He served as governor from January 13, 1892, to January 8, 1896. In 1892, Brown was a delegate at-large at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. While governor, he helped negotiate with strikers during the 1894 coal strike in Frostburg. He also commuted the capital punishment sentence to life imprisonment for four black men who were convicted of the murder of Dr. Hill of Chestertown. During his tenure, he pushed for the arresting of Coxey&#x27;s Army. Brown held a non-partisan tax conference to discuss the issue of taxation. A constitutional amendment allowing another judge to serve on the Baltimore City Supreme Court was passed in 1893. Legislation was also passed that banned child labor and the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery was incorporated. He reorganized the Maryland Agricultural College and the tobacco warehouse system. He supported the Springfield Hospital for the Insane.

For the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 Brown was the president of the board of managers in Maryland. Later in life he served two terms as the president of the Capital Traction Company. Brown later was campaign manager for Thomas G. Hayes&#x27;s run for mayor of Baltimore in 1899 and J. Barry Mahool&#x27;s run for mayor of Baltimore in 1906. His last position was the City Collector for Baltimore. In 1905, Brown served as a presidential elector. In 1908, Brown put his name forward as a candidate for the Maryland Senate, but later withdrew his name.

==Personal life==
Brown married Mary (née Ridgely) Preston, widow of Horatio Preston and daughter of David Ridgely, of Baltimore in 1879. They had two children. She died in 1895. He lived in Carroll County, but after the death of his wife spent more time in Baltimore.

Brown died on February 3, 1920, in Baltimore. He is buried at the Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

<text>The Kingdom of Aragon (; ; ; ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It was part of the larger Crown of Aragon, which also included other territories—the Principality of Catalonia (which included the former Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece—that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon.

In 1479, upon John II of Aragon&#x27;s death, the crowns of Aragon and Castile were united to form the nucleus of modern Spain. The Aragonese lands retained autonomous parliamentary and administrative institutions, such as the Corts. The arrangement remained until the Nueva Planta decrees, promulgated between 1707 and 1715 by Philip V of Spain in the aftermath of the War of the Spanish Succession, centralised power in Spain. However, the title &quot;King of Aragon&quot; would continue to be used by the centralised Spanish crown.

== History ==

=== Independent kingdom ===
Aragon was originally a Carolingian feudal county around the city of Jaca, which in the first half of the 9th century became a vassal state of the kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarre), its own dynasty of counts ending without a male heir in 922. The name &quot;Aragón&quot; is the same as that of the river Aragón, which flows by Jaca. It might derive from the Basque &quot;Aragona/Haragona&quot; meaning &quot;good upper valley&quot; (&quot;haran+goi+ona&quot;, where &quot;haran&quot; = &quot;valley&quot;, &quot;goi&quot; = &quot;upper, high&quot;, and &quot;ona&quot; = &quot;good&quot;). Alternatively, the name may be derived from the earlier Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis.

On the death of Sancho III of Navarre in 1035, the Kingdom of Navarre was divided into three parts: (1) Pamplona and its hinterland along with western and coastal Basque districts, (2) Castile, and (3) Sobrarbe, Ribagorza and Aragon. Sancho&#x27;s son Gonzalo inherited Sobrarbe and Ribargorza. His illegitimate son Ramiro received Aragon. Gonzalo was killed soon after and all the land he owned went to his brother Ramiro, thus becoming the first de facto king of Aragon, although he never used that title.

By defeating his brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre, Ramiro achieved independence for Aragon. His son Sancho Ramírez, who also inherited the kingdom of Navarre, was the first to call himself &quot;King of the Aragonese and Pamplonese&quot;. As the Aragonese domains expanded to the south, conquering land from Al Andalus, the capital city moved from Jaca to Huesca (1096), and later to Zaragoza (1118). After Alfonso the Battler died childless in 1134, different rulers were chosen for Navarre and Aragon, and the two kingdoms ceased to have the same ruler. By 1285 the southernmost areas of what is now Aragon had been taken from the Moors.

=== Dynastic union with the County of Barcelona ===

The Kingdom of Aragon gave the name to the Crown of Aragon, created in 1150 with the dynastic union resulting from the marriage of the Princess of Aragon, Petronilla, and the Count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer IV. Their son Alfonso II inherited all of the territories ruled by his father and mother. The King of Aragon also held the title of Count of Barcelona and ruled territories that consisted of not only the present administrative region of Aragon, but also Catalonia, and later the kingdoms of Majorca, Valencia, Sicily, Naples and Sardinia. 

The King of Aragón was the direct ruler of the Aragonese region, and held the titles of Count of Provence, Count of Barcelona, Lord of Montpellier, and Duke of Athens and Neopatria. Each of these titles gave him sovereignty over a certain region, and these titles changed as he won and lost territories. In the 14th century, his power was greatly restricted by the Union of Aragon.

=== Union of the Crowns of Aragon and Castile and afterwards ===
The Crown of Aragon became a part of the Spanish monarchy after the dynastic union with Castile, which supposed the &quot;de facto&quot; unification of both kingdoms under a common monarch. The house of Barcelona held the Crown until 1410, when it went extinct. Subsequently, in 1412 the Aragonese secured the election of a Castilian prince, Ferdinand of Antequera, to the vacant Aragonese throne, over strong Catalan opposition. One of Ferdinand&#x27;s successors, John II of Aragon (1458–1479), countered residual Catalan resistance by arranging for his heir, Ferdinand, to marry Isabella, the heir presumptive of Henry IV of Castile.

In 1479, upon John II&#x27;s death, the crowns of Aragon and Castile were united to form the nucleus of modern Spain. Aragonese territories retained their autonomous parliamentary and administrative institutions, such as the Corts, until the Nueva Planta decrees, which were promulgated between 1707 and 1715 by Philip V of Spain in the aftermath of the War of the Spanish Succession. The decrees &quot;de jure&quot; ended the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia and Mallorca, and the Principality of Catalonia, and merged them with Castile to officially form the Spanish kingdom. A new Nueva Planta decree in 1711 restored some rights in Aragon, such as the Aragonese Civil Rights, but upheld the end of the political independence of the kingdom.

The previous Kingdom of Aragon remained as an administrative unit until 1833, when it was divided into the three existing provinces. In the aftermath of Francisco Franco&#x27;s death, Aragon became one of the autonomous communities of Spain in 1982.

<doc id="586782" wikidata="Q519614" url="?curid=586782" title="Wells Cathedral">
<text>Wells Cathedral, formally the , is a Church of England cathedral in Wells, Somerset, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Bath and Wells and the mother church of the diocese of Bath and Wells. There are daily Church of England services in the building, and in 2023 it was reported to receive over 300,000 visitors per year. The cathedral is a Grade I listed building. The cathedral precincts contain the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and several buildings linked to its medieval chapter of secular canons, including the fifteenth-century Vicars&#x27; Close.

The earliest record of a church on the present site is a charter of 766. A bishopric was established in 909, however in 1090 the cathedral of the diocese was moved to Bath Abbey and remained there until Wells became co-cathedral in 1218. The remains of the tenth-century cathedral lie to the south of the present building, beneath the cloister. The present cathedral has a cruciform plan with a chapter house attached to the north and a cloister to the south, and is largely the result of two building campaigns which took place between to and to . The western half of the cathedral, including the nave and western transepts, belongs primarily to the first building phase and is constructed in the Early English style of Gothic architecture. The east end, including the lady chapel, eastern transepts, chapter house, and central tower, belongs to the second phase and uses the Decorated Gothic style; it also retains much medieval stained glass. Two towers were added to the west front between 1385 and 1410 in the Perpendicular Gothic style, and the cloisters were remodelled in the same style between 1420 and 1508. The cathedral was restored over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Wells has been called &quot;unquestionably one of the most beautiful&quot; and &quot;most poetic&quot; of English cathedrals. The architectural historian John Harvey sees it as Europe&#x27;s first truly Gothic structure, breaking from the last constraints of the Romanesque style. The west front, which contains 300 sculpted figures, has been described by Harvey as the &quot;supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England&quot;, however the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described it as &quot;spare&quot;, with &quot;harsh uprights and horizontals [...] like steel scaffolding&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The earliest remains of a building on the site are of a late-Roman mausoleum, identified during excavations in 1980. An abbey church was built in Wells in 705 by Aldhelm, first bishop of the newly established Diocese of Sherborne during the reign of King Ine of Wessex. It was dedicated to St Andrew and stood at the site of the cathedral&#x27;s cloisters, where some excavated remains can be seen. The font in the cathedral&#x27;s south transept is from this church and is the oldest part of the present building. In 766 Cynewulf, King of Wessex, signed a charter endowing the church with eleven hides of land. In 909 the seat of the diocese was moved from Sherborne to Wells.

The first bishop of Wells was Athelm (909), who crowned King Æthelstan. Athelm and his nephew Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. During this period a choir of boys was established to sing the liturgy. Wells Cathedral School, which was established to educate these choirboys, dates its foundation to this point. There is, however, some controversy over this. Following the Norman Conquest, John de Villula moved the seat of the bishop from Wells to Bath in 1090. The church at Wells, no longer a cathedral, had a college of secular clergy.

=== Seat of the bishop ===
The cathedral is thought to have been conceived and commenced in about 1175 by Reginald Fitz Jocelin, who died in 1191. Although it is clear from its size that from the outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese, the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of Glastonbury and Bath, before settling at Wells. In 1197 Reginald&#x27;s successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.

Savaric&#x27;s successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop&#x27;s seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of Hugh (II) of Lincoln and was present at the signing of Magna Carta. Jocelin continued the building campaign begun by Reginald and was responsible for the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, the choristers&#x27; school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at Wookey, near Wells. Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the Pope by Jocelin&#x27;s representatives in Rome, he did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by Pandulf Verraccio, a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and Bishop of Norwich, who was asked by the Pope to investigate the situation but did not respond. Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral; the memorial brass on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.

In 1245 the ongoing dispute over the title of the bishop was resolved by a ruling of Pope Innocent IV, who established the title as the &quot;Bishop of Bath and Wells&quot;, which it has remained until this day, with Wells as the principal seat of the bishop. Since the 11th century the church has had a chapter of secular clergy, like the cathedrals of Chichester, Hereford, Lincoln and York. The chapter was endowed with 22 prebends (lands from which finance was drawn) and a provost to manage them. On acquiring cathedral status, in common with other such cathedrals, it had four chief clergy, the dean, precentor, chancellor and sacristan, who were responsible for the spiritual and material care of the cathedral.

=== Building the cathedral ===
The building programme, begun by Reginald Fitz Jocelin, bishop in the 12th century, continued under Jocelin of Wells, who was a canon from 1200, then bishop from 1206. Adam Locke was master mason from about 1192 until 1230. It was designed in the new style with pointed arches, later known as Gothic, which was introduced at about the same time at Canterbury Cathedral. Work was halted between 1209 and 1213 when King John was excommunicated and Jocelin was in exile, but the main parts of the church were complete by the time of the dedication by Jocelin in 1239.

By the time the cathedral, including the chapter house, was finished in 1306, it was already too small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars&#x27; Close and the Vicars&#x27; Hall, to give the men who were employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.

John Harewell raised money for the completion of the west front by William Wynford, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost master masons of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers, the north-west of which was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking under the weight of the crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.

=== Tudors and Civil War ===
By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter&#x27;s representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.

Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral&#x27;s stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean&#x27;s stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.

=== 1660–1800 ===
In 1661, after Charles II was restored to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king&#x27;s chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop for two years before his death in 1672. His brass lectern, given in thanksgiving, can be seen in the cathedral. He donated the nave&#x27;s great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton&#x27;s appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst&#x27;s long tenure the cathedral was restored, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.

Restoration began again under Thomas Ken who was appointed by the Crown in 1685 and served until 1691. He was one of seven bishops imprisoned for refusing to sign King James II&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Indulgence&quot;, which would have enabled Catholics to resume positions of political power, but popular support led to their acquittal. Ken refused to take the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II because James II had not abdicated and with others, known as the Nonjurors, was put out of office. His successor, Richard Kidder, was killed in the Great Storm of 1703 when two chimney stacks on the palace fell on him and his wife, while they were asleep in bed.

=== Victorian era to present ===
By the middle of the 19th century, a major restoration programme was needed. Under Dean Goodenough, the monuments were moved to the cloisters and the remaining medieval paint and whitewash removed in an operation known as &quot;the great scrape&quot;. Anthony Salvin took charge of the extensive restoration of the choir. Wooden galleries installed in the 16th century were removed and the stalls were given stone canopies and placed further back within the line of the arcade. The medieval stone pulpitum screen was extended in the centre to support a new organ.

In 1933 the Friends of Wells Cathedral were formed to support the cathedral&#x27;s chapter in the maintenance of the fabric, life and work of the cathedral. The late 20th century saw an extensive restoration programme, particularly of the west front. The stained glass is currently under restoration, with a programme underway to conserve the large 14th-century Jesse Tree window at the eastern terminal of the choir.

In January 2014, as part of the Bath film festival, the cathedral hosted a special screening of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. This provoked some controversy, but the church defended its decision to allow the screening. In 2021, a contemporary sculpture by Anthony Gormley was unveiled on a temporary plinth outside the cathedral.

== Ministry ==

Since the 13th century, Wells Cathedral has been the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Its governing body, the chapter, is made up of five clerical canons (the dean, the precentor, the canon chancellor, the canon treasurer, and the archdeacon of Wells) and four lay members: the administrator (chief executive), Keeper of the Fabric, Overseer of the Estate and the chairman of the cathedral shop and catering boards. The current bishop of Bath and Wells is Michael Beesley, who was installed in a service in the cathedral on 19 November 2022. The current dean of Wells is Toby Wright, who was installed on 16 June 2024.

Staff include the organist and master of choristers, head Verger archivist, librarian and the staff of the shop, café and restaurant. The chapter is advised by specialists such as architects, archaeologists and financial analysts.

More than a thousand services are held every year. There are daily services of Matins, Holy Communion and Choral Evensong, as well as major celebrations of Christian festivals such as Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and saints&#x27; days. The cathedral is also used for the baptisms, weddings and funerals of those with close connections to it. In July 2009 the cathedral undertook the funeral of Harry Patch, the last British Army veteran of World War I, who died at the age of 111.

Three Sunday services are led by the resident choir in school terms and choral services are sung on weekdays. The cathedral hosts visiting choirs and does outreach work with local schools as part of its Chorister Outreach Project. It is also a venue for musical events such as an annual concert by the Somerset Chamber Choir.

Each year about 150,000 people attend services and another 300,000 visit as tourists. General admission tickets can be purchased via the Welcome Desk. There is no charge for people who wish to come into the Cathedral to pray, attend a service, or light a candle.

== Architecture ==
=== Dates, styles and architects ===
Construction of the cathedral began in about 1175, to the design of an unknown master-mason. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be built, from its foundation, in Gothic style. According to art historian John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple lancet arches without tracery and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.

From about 1192 to 1230, Adam Lock, the earliest master-mason at Wells for whom a name is known, continued the transept and nave in the same manner as his predecessor. Lock was also the builder of the north porch, to his own design.

The Early English west front was commenced around 1230 by Thomas Norreys, with building and sculpture continuing for thirty years. Its south-west tower was begun 100 years later and constructed between 1365 and 1395, and the north-west tower between 1425 and 1435, both in the Perpendicular Gothic style to the design of William Wynford, who also filled many of the cathedral&#x27;s early English lancet windows with delicate tracery.

The undercroft and chapter house were built by unknown architects between 1275 and 1310, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter house in the Geometric style of Decorated Gothic architecture. In about 1310 work commenced on the Lady Chapel, to the design of Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.

Later changes include the Perpendicular vault of the tower and construction of Sugar&#x27;s Chapel, 1475–1490 by William Smyth. Also, Gothic Revival renovations were made to the choir and pulpitum by Benjamin Ferrey and Anthony Salvin, 1842–1857.

=== Plan ===
Wells has a total length of . Like Canterbury, Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals, it has the distinctly English arrangement of two transepts, with the body of the church divided into distinct parts: nave, choir, and retrochoir, beyond which extends the Lady Chapel. The façade is wide, with its towers extending beyond the transepts on either side. There is a large projecting porch on the north side of the nave forming an entry into the cathedral. To the north-east is the large octagonal chapter house, entered from the north choir aisle by a passage and staircase. To the south of the nave is a large cloister, unusual in that the northern range, that adjacent the cathedral, was never built.

=== Elevation ===
In section, the cathedral has the usual arrangement of a large church: a central nave with an aisle on each side, separated by two arcades. The elevation is in three stages, arcade, triforium gallery and clerestory. The nave is in height, very low compared to the Gothic cathedrals of France. It has a markedly horizontal emphasis, caused by the triforium having a unique form, a series of identical narrow openings, lacking the usual definition of the bays. The triforium is separated from the arcade by a single horizontal string course that runs unbroken the length of the nave. There are no vertical lines linking the three stages, as the shafts supporting the vault rise above the triforium.

=== Exterior ===
The exterior of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since the greater part of the building was executed in a single style, Early English Gothic. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles. At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple tracery, the construction of a parapet that encircles the roof, and the addition of pinnacles framing each gable, similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front. At the eastern end there is a proliferation of tracery with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric and Flowing Decorated tracery.

==== West front ====
The west front is high and wide, and built of Inferior Oolite of the Middle Jurassic period, which came from the Doulting Stone Quarry, about to the east. According to the architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor, it is &quot;one of the great sights of England&quot;.

West fronts in general take three distinct forms: those that follow the elevation of the nave and aisles, those that have paired towers at the end of each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of the aisles, but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.

The west front rises in three distinct stages, each clearly defined by a horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the cross-sectional divisions of nave, aisles and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the façade.

At the lowest level of the façade is a plain base, contrasting with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in stark contrast to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.

Above the basement rise two storeys, ornamented with quatrefoils and niches originally holding about four hundred statues, with three hundred surviving until the mid-20th century. Since then, some have been restored or replaced, including the ruined figure of Christ in the gable.

The third stages of the flanking towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, to the design of William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425. The design maintains the general proportions, and continues the strong projection of the buttresses.

The finished product has been criticised for its lack of pinnacles, and it is probable that the towers were intended to carry spires which were never built. Despite its lack of spires or pinnacles, the architectural historian Banister Fletcher describes it as &quot;the highest development in English Gothic of this type of façade.&quot;

===== Iconography of the west front =====
The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger. Together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.

In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as &quot;a calendar for unlearned men&quot; illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.

According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.

Above the course, zones four and five, as identified by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many of the figures survive and many have been identified in the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.

The niches in the lowest zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell identifies Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the spandrel of the door.
==== Crossing tower ====
The central tower appears to date from the early 13th century. It was substantially reconstructed in the early 14th century during the remodelling of the east end, necessitating the internal bracing of the piers a decade or so later. In the 14th century the tower was given a timber and lead spire which burnt down in 1439. The exterior was then reworked in the Perpendicular style and given the present parapet and pinnacles. Alec Clifton-Taylor describes it as &quot;outstanding even in Somerset, a county famed for the splendour of its church towers&quot;.

==== North porch ====
The north porch is described by art historian Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;sumptuously decorated&quot;, and intended as the main entrance. Externally it is simple and rectangular with plain side walls. The entrance is a steeply arched portal framed by rich mouldings of eight shafts with stiff-leaf capitals each encircled by an annular moulding at middle height. Those on the left are figurative, containing images representing the martyrdom of St Edmund the Martyr. The walls are lined with deep niches framed by narrow shafts with capitals and annulets like those of the portal. The path to the north porch is lined by four sculptures in Purbeck stone, each by Mary Spencer Watson, representing the symbols of the Evangelists.

==== Cloisters ====
The cloisters were built in the late 13th century and largely rebuilt from 1430 to 1508 and have wide openings divided by mullions and transoms, and tracery in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The vault has lierne ribs that form octagons at the centre of each compartment, the joints of each rib having decorative bosses. The eastern range is of two storeys, of which the upper is the library built in the 15th century.

Because Wells Cathedral was secular rather than monastic, cloisters were not a practical necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.

==== Restoration ====
In 1969, when a large chunk of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became apparent that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods selected were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.

The conservation was carried out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing through corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.

=== Interior ===
==== Choir, transept and nave ====
The particular character of this Early English interior is dependent on the proportions of the simple lancet arches. It is also dependent on the refinement of the architectural details, in particular the mouldings.

The arcade, which takes the same form in the nave, choir and transepts, is distinguished by the richness of both mouldings and carvings. Each pier of the arcade has a surface enrichment of 24 slender shafts in eight groups of three, rising beyond the capitals to form the deeply undulating mouldings of the arches. The capitals themselves are remarkable for the vitality of the stylised foliage, in a style known as &quot;stiff-leaf&quot;. The liveliness contrasts with the formality of the moulded shafts and the smooth unbroken areas of ashlar masonry in the spandrels. Each capital is different, and some contain small figures illustrating narratives.

The vault of the nave rises steeply in a simple quadripartite form, in harmony with the nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was extended and the whole upper part elaborated in the second quarter of the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.

Until the early 14th century, the interior of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen. The bracing arches are known as &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Cross arches&quot;, in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – rightly or wrongly – as &quot;brutally massive&quot; and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.

==== Lady Chapel and retrochoir ====
Wells Cathedral has a square east end to the choir, as is usual, and like several other cathedrals including Salisbury and Lichfield, has a lower Lady Chapel projecting at the eastern end, begun by Thomas Witney in about 1310, possibly before the chapter house was completed. The Lady Chapel seems to have begun as a free-standing structure in the form of an elongated octagon, but the plan changed and it was linked to the eastern end by extension of the choir and construction of a second transept or retrochoir east of the choir, probably by William Joy.

The Lady Chapel has a vault of complex and somewhat irregular pattern, as the chapel is not symmetrical about both axes. The main ribs are intersected by additional non-supporting, lierne ribs, which in this case form a star-shaped pattern at the apex of the vault. It is one of the earliest lierne vaults in England. There are five large windows, of which four are filled with fragments of medieval glass. The tracery of the windows is in the style known as Reticulated Gothic, having a pattern of a single repeated shape, in this case a trefoil, giving a &quot;reticulate&quot; or net-like appearance.

The retrochoir extends across the east end of the choir and into the east transepts. At its centre the vault is supported by a remarkable structure of angled piers. Two of these are placed as to complete the octagonal shape of the Lady Chapel, a solution described by Francis Bond as &quot;an intuition of Genius&quot;. The piers have attached shafts of marble, and, with the vaults that they support, create a vista of great complexity from every angle. The windows of the retrochoir are in the Reticulated style like those of the Lady Chapel, but are fully Flowing Decorated in that the tracery mouldings form ogival curves.

==== Chapter house ====

The chapter house was begun in the late 13th century and built in two stages, completed about 1310. It is a two-storeyed structure with the main chamber raised on an undercroft. It is entered from a staircase which divides and turns, one branch leading through the upper storey of Chain Gate to Vicars&#x27; Close. The Decorated interior is described by Alec Clifton-Taylor as &quot;architecturally the most beautiful in England&quot;. It is octagonal, with its ribbed vault supported on a central column. The column is surrounded by shafts of Purbeck Marble, rising to a single continuous rippling foliate capital of stylised oak leaves and acorns, quite different in character from the Early English stiff-leaf foliage. Above the moulding spring 32 ribs of strong profile, giving an effect generally likened to &quot;a great palm tree&quot;. The windows are large with Geometric Decorated tracery that is beginning to show an elongation of form, and ogees in the lesser lights that are characteristic of Flowing Decorated tracery. The tracery lights still contain ancient glass. Beneath the windows are 51 stalls, the canopies of which are enlivened by carvings including many heads carved in a light-hearted manner.


== Art and treasures ==
=== Stained glass ===
Wells Cathedral contains one of the most substantial collections of medieval stained glass in England, despite damage by Parliamentary troops in 1642 and 1643. The oldest surviving glass dates from the late 13th century and is in two windows on the west side of the chapter-house staircase. Two windows in the south choir aisle are from 1310 to 1320.

The Lady Chapel has five windows, of which four date from 1325 to 1330 and include images of a local saint, Dunstan. The east window was restored to a semblance of its original appearance by Thomas Willement in 1845. The other windows have complete canopies, but the pictorial sections are fragmented.

The east window of the choir is a broad, seven-light window dating from 1340 to 1345. It depicts the &quot;Tree of Jesse&quot; (the genealogy of Christ) and demonstrates the use of silver staining, a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black. The combination of yellow and green glass and the application of the bright yellow stain gives the window its popular name, the &quot;Golden Window&quot;. It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340–45. In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.

The panels in the chapel of St Katherine are attributed to Arnold of Nijmegen and date from about 1520. They were acquired from the destroyed church of Saint-Jean, Rouen, with the last panel having been purchased in 1953.

The large triple lancet to the nave west end was glazed at the expense of Dean Creighton at a cost of £140 in 1664. It was repaired in 1813, and the central light was largely replaced to a design by Archibald Keightley Nicholson between 1925 and 1931. The main north and south transept end windows by James Powell and Sons were erected in the early 20th century.

=== Carvings ===
The greater part of the stone carving of Wells Cathedral comprises foliate capitals in the stiff-leaf style. They are found ornamenting the piers of the nave, choir and transepts. Stiff-leaf foliage is highly abstract. Though possibly influenced by carvings of acanthus leaves or vine leaves, it cannot be easily identified with any particular plant. Here the carving of the foliage is varied and vigorous, the springing leaves and deep undercuts casting shadows that contrast with the surface of the piers. In the transepts and towards the crossing in the nave the capitals have many small figurative carvings among the leaves. These include a man with toothache and a series of four scenes depicting the &quot;Wages of Sin&quot; in a narrative of fruit stealers who creep into an orchard and are then beaten by the farmer. Another well-known carving is in the north transept aisle: a foliate corbel, on which climbs a lizard, sometimes identified as a salamander, a symbol of eternal life.

Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may be found in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the 51 stalls include numerous small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.

The 15th-century cloisters have many small bosses ornamenting the vault. Two in the west cloister, near the gift shop and café, have been called sheela na gigs, i. e. female figures displaying their genitals and variously judged to depict the sin of lust or stem from ancient fertility cults.
==== Misericords ====
Wells Cathedral has one of the finest sets of misericords in Britain. Its clergy has a long tradition of singing or reciting from the Book of Psalms each day, along with the customary daily reading of the Holy Office. In medieval times the clergy assembled in the church eight times daily for the canonical hours. As the greater part of the services was recited while standing, many monastic or collegiate churches fitted stalls whose seats tipped up to provide a ledge for the monk or cleric to lean against. These were &quot;misericords&quot; because their installation was an act of mercy. Misericords typically have a carved figurative bracket beneath the ledge framed by two floral motifs known, in heraldic manner, as &quot;supporters&quot;.

The misericords date from 1330 to 1340. They may have been carved under the direction of Master Carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered 90, of which 65 have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral, and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered the prebendary clerics to pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, having been called to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which during the Protestant Reformation had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One misericord, showing a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 came a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.

The subject matter of the carvings of the central brackets as misericords varies, but many themes recur in different churches. Typically the themes are less unified or directly related to the Bible and Christian theology than small sculptures seen elsewhere within churches, such as bosses. This applies at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is directly based on a Bible story. The subjects, chosen either by the woodcarver, or perhaps by the one paying for the stall, have no overriding theme. The sole unifying elements are the roundels on each side of the pictorial subject, which all show elaborately carved foliage, in most cases formal and stylised in the later Decorated manner, but with several examples of naturalistic foliage, including roses and bindweed. Many of the subjects carry traditional interpretations. The image of the &quot;Pelican in her Piety&quot; (believed to feed her young on her own blood) is a recognised symbol for Christ&#x27;s love for the Church. A cat playing with a mouse may represent the Devil snaring a human soul. Other subjects illustrate popular fables or sayings such as &quot;When the fox preaches, look to your geese&quot;. Many depict animals, some of which may symbolise a human vice or virtue, or an aspect of faith.

Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe feeding a lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves drinking from a ewer. Eighteen have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five are clearly narrative, such as the Fox and the Geese, and the story of Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel, and a woman wearing a veil over hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings show human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with a cheek, a hand and a foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while a further figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.

=== Fittings and monuments ===
Some of the cathedral&#x27;s fittings and monuments are hundreds of years old. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I. The bishop&#x27;s throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. The brass lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. 

The monuments and tombs include Gisa, bishop; † 1088; William of Bitton, bishop; † 1274; William of March, bishop; † 1302; John Droxford; † 1329; John Godelee; † 1333; John Middleton, died †1350; Ralph of Shrewsbury, died †; John Harewell, bishop; † 1386; William Bykonyll; † ; John Bernard; † 1459; Thomas Beckington; † died 1464; John Gunthorpe; † 1498; John Still; † 1607; Robert Creighton; † 1672; Richard Kidder, bishop; † 1703; George Hooper, bishop; † 1727 and Arthur Harvey, bishop; † 1894.

=== Clock ===
In the north transept is Wells Cathedral clock, an astronomical clock from about 1325 believed to be by Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury. Its mechanism, dated between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century and the original moved to the Science Museum in London, where it still operates. It is the second oldest surviving clock in England after the Salisbury Cathedral clock.

The clock has its original medieval face. Apart from the time on a 24-hour dial, it shows the motion of the Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial presents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack: a small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.

On the outer wall of the transept, opposite Vicars&#x27; Hall, is a second clock face of the same clock, placed there just over seventy years after the interior clock and driven by the same mechanism. The second clock face has two quarter jacks (which strike on the quarter-hour) in the form of knights in armour.

In 2010 the official clock-winder retired and was replaced by an electric mechanism.

== Music ==
=== Organ and organists ===

The first record of an organ at this church dates from 1310. A smaller organ, probably for the Lady Chapel, was installed in 1415. In 1620 an organ built by Thomas Dallam was installed at a cost of £398 1s 5d.

The 1620 organ was destroyed by parliamentary soldiers in 1643. An organ built in 1662 was enlarged in 1786 and again in 1855. In 1909–1910 an organ was built by Harrison &amp; Harrison of Durham, with the best parts of the old organ retained. It has been serviced by the same company ever since.

Since November 1996 the cathedral has also had a portable chamber organ, by the Scottish makers, Lammermuir. It is used regularly to accompany performances of Tudor and baroque music.

The first recorded organist of Wells was Walter Bagele (or Vageler) in 1416. The post of organist or assistant organist has been held by more than 60 people since. Peter Stanley Lyons was Master of Choristers at Wells Cathedral, and Director of Music at Wells Cathedral School in 1954–1960. The choral conductor James William Webb-Jones, father of Lyons&#x27;s wife Bridget (whom he married in the cathedral), was Headmaster of Wells Cathedral School in 1955–1960. Malcolm Archer was the appointed Organist and Master of the Choristers from 1996 to 2004. Matthew Owens was the appointed organist from 2005 to 2019.

=== Cathedral choir ===
There has been a choir of boy choristers at Wells since 909. Currently there are 18 boy choristers and a similar number of girl choristers, aged from eight to fourteen. The Vicars Choral—church singers were originally referred to as &quot;vicars choral&quot;—was formed in the 12th century and the sung liturgy provided by a traditional cathedral choir of men and boys until the formation of an additional choir of girls in 1994. The boys and girls sing alternately with the Vicars Choral and are educated at Wells Cathedral School.

The Vicars Choral currently number twelve men, of whom three are choral scholars. Since 1348 the College of Vicars had its own accommodation on the cathedral grounds, with a bridge added in 1459 so that the singers (all male) would not be subjected to temptation by local women, forming Vicars&#x27; Close. The Vicars Choral generally perform with the choristers, except on Wednesdays, when they sing alone, allowing them to present a different repertoire, in particular plainsong.

In December 2010 Wells Cathedral Choir was rated by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine as &quot;the highest ranking choir with children in the world&quot;. It continues to provide music for the liturgy at Sunday and weekday services. The choir has made many recordings and toured frequently, including performances in Beijing and Hong Kong in 2012. Its repertoire ranges from the choral music of the Renaissance to recently commissioned works.

In 2024 the houses in Vicars&#x27; Close—thought to be the most complete and continuously occupied medieval street in Europe and still regularly occupied by singers as &quot;grace-and-favour&quot; residences—were in a serious state of disrepair, and the cathedral set up a project to repair the Grade-1 listed houses.

=== Chamber Choir ===
The Wells Cathedral Chamber Choir is a mixed adult choir of 25 members, formed in 1986 to sing at the midnight service on Christmas Eve, and invited to sing at several other special services. It now sings for about 30 services a year, when the Cathedral Choir is in recess or on tour, and spends one week a year singing as the &quot;choir in residence&quot; at another cathedral. Although primarily liturgical, the choir&#x27;s repertoire includes other forms of music, as well as performances at engagements such as weddings and funerals.

=== Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society ===
The cathedral is home to Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society (WCOS), founded in 1896. With around 160 voices, the society gives three concerts a year under the direction of Matthew Owens, Organist and Master of the Choristers at the cathedral. Concerts are normally in early November, December (an annual performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;) and late March. It performs with a number of specialist orchestras including: Music for Awhile, Chameleon Arts and La Folia.

== Bells ==
The bells at Wells Cathedral are the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world, the tenor bell (the 10th and largest), known as Harewell, weighing . They are hung for full-circle ringing in the English style of change ringing. These bells are now hung in the south-west tower, although some were originally hung in the central tower.

== Library ==
The library above the eastern cloister was built between 1430 and 1508. Its collection is in three parts: early documents housed in the Muniment Room; the collection predating 1800 housed in the Chained Library; and the post-1800 collection housed in the Reading Room. The chapter&#x27;s earlier collection was destroyed during the Reformation, so that the present library consists chiefly of early printed books, rather than medieval manuscripts. The earlier books in the Chained Library number 2,800 volumes and give an indication of the variety of interests of the members of the cathedral chapter from the Reformation until 1800. The focus of the collection is predominantly theology, but there are volumes on science, medicine, exploration, and languages. Books of particular interest include Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; printed in 1472, an &quot;Atlas of the World&quot; by Abraham Ortelius, printed in 1606, and a set of the works by Aristotle that once belonged to Erasmus. The library is open to the public at appointed times in the summer and presents a small exhibition of documents and books.

=== Original records ===
Three early registers of the Dean and Chapter edited by W. H. B. Bird for the Historical Manuscripts Commissioners – &quot;Liber Albus I&quot; (White Book; R I), &quot;Liber Albus II&quot; (R III) and &quot;Liber Ruber&quot; (Red Book; R II, section i) – were published in 1907. They contain with some repetition, a cartulary of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land back to the 8th century, well before hereditary surnames developed in England, and acts of the Dean and Chapter and surveys of their estates, mostly in Somerset. The current archivist is Dr Anne Crawford, formerly of the Public Record Office and widow of the medieval historian Charles Ross.
== Precincts ==

Adjacent to the cathedral is a large lawned area, Cathedral Green, with three ancient gateways: Brown&#x27;s Gatehouse, Penniless Porch and Chain Gate. On the green is the 12th-century Old Deanery, largely rebuilt in the late 15th century by Dean Gunthorpe and remodelled by Dean Bathurst in the late 17th century. No longer the dean&#x27;s residence, it is used as diocesan offices.

To the south of the cathedral is the moated Bishop&#x27;s Palace, begun about 1210 by Jocelin of Wells but dating mostly from the 1230s. In the 15th century Thomas Beckington added a north wing, now the bishop&#x27;s residence. It was restored and extended by Benjamin Ferrey between 1846 and 1854.

To the north of the cathedral and connected to it by the Chain Gate is Vicars&#x27; Close, a street planned in the 14th century and claimed to be the oldest purely residential street in Europe, with all but one of its original buildings intact. Buildings in the close include the Vicars Hall and gateway at the south end, and the Vicars Chapel and Library at the north end.

The Liberty of St Andrew was the historic liberty and parish that encompassed the cathedral and surrounding lands closely associated with it.

== In the arts and popular culture ==

The English painter J. M. W. Turner visited Wells in 1795, making sketches of the precinct and a watercolour of the west front, now in the Tate gallery. Other artists whose paintings of the cathedral are in national collections are Albert Goodwin, John Syer and Ken Howard.

The cathedral served to inspire Ken Follett&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; and with a modified central tower, featured as the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral at the end of the 2010 television adaptation of that novel. The interior of the cathedral was used for a 2007 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode, &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;, while the exterior shots were filmed at Southwark Cathedral.

An account of the damage to the cathedral during the Monmouth Rebellion is included in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1889 historical novel &quot;Micah Clarke&quot;.

The cathedral provided settings for scenes for the 2019–2020 television series &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot;.

<text>The Crazy Canucks was the nickname for a group of World Cup alpine ski racers from Canada who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. Jungle Jim Hunter, Dave Irwin, Dave Murray, Steve Podborski, and Ken Read earned themselves a reputation for fast and seemingly reckless skiing in the downhill event.

==History==
These five men earned their title &quot;Crazy Canucks&quot; from ski journalist and World Cup co-founder Serge Lange, who after watching their different styles came up with the name that caught on with sports journalists throughout the skiing world. Other similar nicknames included &quot;Kamikaze Canadians.&quot;

These five men were at the top of their game and better known in Europe than in North America. Once they hit the Alps, they consistently challenged the Europeans on the World Cup circuit at a level previously unseen.

Canadian Corner is a section of the Lauberhorn downhill course near Wengen, Switzerland. The heavily twisting curve at the left-hand transition to the Alpweg is named after the Crazy Canucks, Dave Irwin and Ken Read, who fell there in 1976.

Four of the five &quot;Crazy Canucks&quot; live on today; Murray died of skin cancer in 1990 at age 37. The downhill course at Whistler Creekside, utilized for World Cup and Olympic races, was named for him.

In 2006, it was announced that the four original Crazy Canucks would receive stars on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, inducted as one group. The only other ski racer on the walk is Canadian alpine legend Nancy Greene.

==TV film==
&quot;Crazy Canucks&quot; was a TV movie named after and based on the history of the team. It was released in 2004 in Canada. The film was directed by Randy Bradshaw and starred Sandy Robson (Hunter), Lucas Bryant (Read), Curtis Harrison (Podborski), Kyle Labine (Murray) and Robert Tinkler (Irwin).

<text>Neo-feudalism or new feudalism is a theorized contemporary rebirth of policies of governance, economy, and public life, reminiscent of those which were present in many feudal societies. Such aspects include, but are not limited to: Unequal rights and legal protections for common people and for nobility, dominance of societies by a small and powerful elite, a lack of social mobility, and relations of lordship and serfdom between the elite and the people, where the former are rich and the latter poor.

==Use and etymology==
Generally, the term neo-feudalism refers to 21st century forms of feudalism which in some respects resemble the societal models of Medieval western Europe. In its early use, the term was deployed as both a criticism of the political Left and of the Right.

On the other hand, Jürgen Habermas used the term &quot;Refeudalisierung&quot; (&quot;refeudalisation&quot;) in his 1962 &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&quot; to criticise the privatisation of the forms of communication that he believed had produced an Enlightenment-era public sphere. While not talking about &quot;neo-feudalism&quot; as such, later commentators have noted that these ideas are similar to the idea of neo-feudalism. Correspondingly, in 1992 Immanuel Wallerstein expressed views on global development, listing neo-feudalism among three other variants. By &quot;neo-feudalism&quot;, Wallerstein referred to autarky regions with a localised hierarchy and hi-tech goods available only for the elite.

==Description==

The concept of neo-feudalism may focus on economics, though it is not limited to it. Among the issues claimed to be associated with the idea of neo-feudalism in contemporary society, are: class stratification, globalization, neoconservative foreign policy, multinational corporations, and &quot;neo-corporatism&quot;.

According to Les Johnston, Clifford Shearing&#x27;s theoretical approach of neo-feudalism has been influential. Shearing &quot;use[s] this term in a limited sense to draw attention to the emergence of domains of mass private property that are &#x27;gated&#x27; in a variety of ways&quot;.

Lucia Zedner responds that this use of neo-feudalism is too limited in scope; Shearing&#x27;s comparison does not draw parallels with earlier governance explicitly enough. Zedner prefers more definitive endorsements.

Neo-feudalism entails an order defined by commercial interests and administered in large areas, according to Bruce Baker, who argues that this does not fully describe the extent of cooperation between state and non-state policing. The significance of the comparison to feudalism, for Randy Lippert and Daniel O&#x27;Connor, is that corporations have power similar to states&#x27; governance powers. Similarly, Sighard Neckel has argued that the rise of financial-market-based capitalism in the later twentieth century has represented a &#x27;refeudalisation&#x27; of the economy.

The widening of the wealth gap, as poor and marginalized people are excluded from the state&#x27;s provision of security, can result in neo-feudalism, argues Marina Caparini, who says this has already happened in South Africa. Neo-feudalism is made possible by the commodification of policing, and signifies the end of shared citizenship, says Ian Loader. A primary characteristic of neo-feudalism is that individuals&#x27; public lives are increasingly governed by business corporations, as Martha K. Huggins finds.

John Braithwaite notes that neo-feudalism brings a different approach to governance since business corporations, in particular, have this specialized need for loss reduction.

Author Jonathan Bluestein has written about neo-feudalism as a feature of social power: economic, political and martial alike. He defines the neo-feudal sovereigns as those who, while not directly referred to as lords, aristocrats, kings or emperors, still hold an equivalent power in a modern sense. That is, people who are not subject to everyday laws, can create their own laws to an extent, dominate large markets, employ immense swathes of individuals, have the means to hold a private military force, wield the economic might equivalent of entire nations, and own assets, especially real-estate, on a massive scale. In his books, Bluestein both criticizes this phenomenon, and proposes social and economic solutions for it.

Being the first to coin the term: techno-capitalist-feudalism, or TCF for short, political economist, Michel Luc Bellemare, released a seminal tome on the subject, titled &#x27;Techno-Capitalist-Feudalism&#x27;, in early September 2020. Described as the political economy of Scientific Anarchist-Communism, or structural-anarchism, TCF is a compilation of 15 years of economic research by the author, which began in the mid 2000s. According to Bellemare, in the book, &quot;the epoch of techno-capitalist-feudalism is the epoch of totalitarian-capitalism, whereby the logic of capitalism attains totalitarian dimensions and authoritarian supremacy&quot;. One of the primary characteristics of the age of techno-capitalist-feudalism, according to Bellemare, is &quot;the degeneration of the old modern class-system into a post-modern micro-caste-system, wherein an insurmountable divide and stratum now exists in-between the &quot;1 percent&quot; and the &quot;99 percent&quot;, or more specifically, the state-finance-corporate-aristocracy and the workforce/population. Moreover, according to Bellemare, in the dark age of techno-capitalist-feudalism, &quot;the determination of values, prices, and wages are no longer based upon the old Marxist notion of socially necessary labor-time, but rather upon the arbitrary use of force and influence, namely, through an underlying set of ruling capitalist power-relations and/or ideologies, which impose by force and influence, numeric values, prices, and wage-sums upon goods, services, and people, devoid of any considerations pertaining to labor-time&quot;. Ultimately, in the dark age of techno-capitalist-feudalism, &quot;whatever a capitalist entity or a set of entities can get away with in the sphere of production and/or in the marketplace is deemed valid, legitimate, and normal, regardless of labour-time expenditures&quot;. As well, contra Marx, Bellemare&#x27;s book argues that, in the dark age of TCF, &quot;workers can be paid below subsistence levels&quot;, wherefore, they must now work a multiplicity of jobs and more hours in order to make ends meet, which, in many instances, they cannot do without social assistance. In turn, according to Bellemare, &quot;in the dark age of TCF, most machine-technologies are capitalist in origin, meaning, these technologies are congealed power-relations and/or ideologies that are impregnated and programmed with capitalist biases&quot;. That is, a set of specific biases that maintain, reproduce, and expand, the power of the ruling capitalist relations and ideologies, undergirding the overall system. Thereby, according to Bellemare&#x27;s book, in the dystopian age of TCF, &quot;most capitalist machine-technologies are used to maintain, reproduce, and expand, the divisions in-between the &#x27;1 percent&#x27; and the &#x27;99 percent&#x27;, by keeping the &#x27;99 percent&#x27; predominantly bolted-down upon the lower-stratums of the system, all the while, keeping the &#x27;1 percent&#x27; perched atop the upper-stratums of the system, indefinitely. In sum, in the dark age of TCF, the new aristocracy, that is, the capitalist oligarchy or the 1 percent, concerns itself first and foremost with the accumulation of power, control, and capital, as well as, reproducing hierarchical-stasis by any means necessary&quot;. As a result, for Bellemare, in the dark age of TCF, &quot;the capitalist aristocracy does not seek to steal units of unpaid labor-time from workers, but rather, it seeks to influence and control all aspects of the workers&#x27; everyday lives&quot;. Thus, the accumulation of power, control, and capital, orchestrated by the 1 percent, their corporations, and the State, &quot;is always at the expense of the workforce/population, which itself, is gradually impoverished, disempowered, and continually relegated to the margins of the system, namely, the margins of the techno-capitalist-feudal-edifice, as lowly wage-serfs and/or debt-serfs&quot;.

During the course of the years 2020-2021, Yanis Varoufakis has written and lectured much about his theory concerning neo-feudalism. He posits that traditional capitalism has evolved into a new feudal-like structure of economies and societies, which he refers to as &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;. Varoufakis explains that unlike in capitalism, feudal economies have the quality of being dominated by very small groups of people, and predetermine the behaviour of markets as they see fit. Taking the example of massive online enterprises such as Facebook, Amazon and others, Varoufakis noted that such venues are primarily governed by the whims of single individuals and small teams, and thus are not truly capitalist markets of free trade, but rather feudal markets of stringent control. Others, such as Jeremy Pitt, have raised similar opinions and concerns, also noting that techno-feudalism threatens freedom of information over the Internet.
In early September, 2022, Bellemare, has offered a short and direct critique of &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;, on the grounds that &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27; skews the facts and daily realities of workers, toiling under the jackboot of totalitarian-capitalism, or more accurately, the jackboot of &quot;techno-capitalist-feudalism&quot;. According to Bellemare&#x27;s article, using the term &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;, instead of “techno-capitalist-feudalism” is a disservice to workers. To drop the term &#x27;capitalist&#x27; from techno-capitalist-feudalism, &quot;only muddies the clear blue waters of the terminal stage of capitalist development&quot;, namely, the new dawning epoch of totalitarian-capitalism, that is, the new dystopian dark age of techno-capitalist-feudalism, run-amok. 
As Bellemare states, in the article, &quot;just because the old capitalist bourgeoisie has embraced digital algorithms and invasive surveillance technologies as its own, and abstracted itself at a higher-level of socio-economic existence, away from the workforce/population, whereby, it now appears invisible and increasingly distant from the everyday lives of workers, does not mean the old capitalist bourgeoisie has vanished into thin air, or has been usurped by a strictly technological aristocracy&quot;. According to Bellemare&#x27;s article, &quot;what has happened is that the old capitalist bourgeoisie has become a techno-capitalist-feudal-aristocracy, since, the logic of capitalism, capitalist profit, and capitalist technological innovations continue to inform and motivate this authoritarian capitalist aristocracy and all its overlapping networks of large-scale ruling power-blocs&quot;. Thereby, the specter of capitalism haunts &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;, in the sense that &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;, or more accurately, &#x27;techno-capitalist-feudalism&#x27;, is the result of &quot;the capital/labor relationship at its most lopsided, oppressive, and technologically dominating. The capital/labor relationship continues to hold, since, the logic of capitalism continues to be the foundation and the fundamental under-girder of this new economic system&quot;. Therefore, within the evolutionary whimper of &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27;, &quot;the logic of capitalism is thriving, laughing all the way to the bank, as the term &#x27;techno-feudalism&#x27; only empowers capitalist supremacy at the expense of workers’ liberation and self-management&quot;.

==In popular culture and literature==
After the financial crisis of 2007–2008, American technology billionaire Nick Hanauer stated that &quot;our country [i.e. the United States] is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society&quot;. His views were echoed by, amongst others, the Icelandic billionaire Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson. The idea that the early 21st century boom and bust in Iceland saw the country returning to feudal structures of power was also expressed by a range of Icelandic novelists, among them Sigrún Davíðsdóttir in &quot;Samhengi hlutanna&quot;, Bjarni Bjarnason in &quot;Mannorð&quot;, Bjarni Harðarson in &quot;Sigurðar saga fóts&quot;, Böðvar Guðmundsson in &quot;Töfrahöllin&quot;, and Steinar Bragi in &quot;Hálendið: Skáldsaga&quot;.

Similar ideas are found in some Anglophone fiction. For example, Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series of novels is set in the distant future with a neo-feudalistic galactic empire known as the Imperium. In these novels, after a series of wars known as the Butlerian Jihad humanity has come to prohibit all kinds of &quot;thinking machine technology&quot;, even its simpler forms. Subsequently, the political balance of power in the Dune Universe gradually became dominant by a myriad of royal houses, each dominating one or several planets. Albeit operating in the distant future, the social and political dynamics of said royal houses are similar in many respects to those previously seen in medieval times.

In David Brin&#x27;s near-future science fiction novel &quot;Existence&quot;, American politicians campaign on legally transitioning the United States into a neo-feudalist society.

In the year 2020, head of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab published a book titled &quot;COVID-19: The Great Reset&quot;. The book argues that the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity for politicians and governments to change the world&#x27;s economies, societies and structures of government, by introducing a system of &quot;Stakeholder Capitalism&quot;, doing so via the guidelines of a plan known as &#x27;The Great Reset&#x27;. Schwab also refers to his goals as &quot;The Fourth Industrial Revolution&quot;. Other authors have criticized The Great Reset as being a form of Neo-Feudalism.

<text>A mass spectrum is a histogram plot of intensity vs. &quot;mass-to-charge ratio&quot; (&quot;m/z&quot;) in a chemical sample, usually acquired using an instrument called a &quot;mass spectrometer&quot;. Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same; for example, some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into &quot;fragments&quot;; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation. A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment applied. Common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the &quot;McLafferty rearrangement&quot; and &quot;alpha cleavage&quot;. Straight chain alkanes and alkyl groups produce a typical series of peaks: 29 (CH3CH2+), 43 (CH3CH2CH2+), 57 (CH3CH2CH2CH2+), 71 (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2+) etc.

==X-axis: &quot;m/z&quot; (mass-to-charge ratio)==
The x-axis of a mass spectrum represents a relationship between the mass of a given ion and the number of elementary charges that it carries. This is written as the IUPAC standard &quot;m/z&quot; to denote the quantity formed by dividing the mass of an ion (in daltons) by the dalton unit and by its charge number (positive absolute value). Thus, &quot;m/z&quot; is a dimensionless quantity with no associated units. Despite carrying neither units of mass nor charge, the &quot;m/z&quot; is referred to as the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion. However, this is distinct from the mass-to-charge ratio, m/Q (SI standard units kg/C), which is commonly used in physics. The &quot;m/z&quot; is used in applied mass spectrometry because convenient and intuitive numerical relationships naturally arise when interpreting spectra. A single &quot;m/z&quot; value alone does not contain sufficient information to determine the mass or charge of an ion. However, mass information may be extracted when considering the whole spectrum, such as the spacing of isotopes or the observation of multiple charge states of the same molecule. These relationships and the relationship to the mass of the ion in daltons tend toward approximately rational number values in &quot;m/z&quot; space. For example, ions with one charge exhibit spacing between isotopes of 1 and the mass of the ion in daltons is numerically equal to the &quot;m/z&quot;. The IUPAC Gold Book gives an example of appropriate use: &quot;for the ion C7H72+, m/z equals 45.5&quot;.

===Alternative x-axis notations===
There are several alternatives to the standard &quot;m/z&quot; notation that appear in the literature; however, these are not currently accepted by standards organizations and most journals. &quot;m/e&quot; appears in older historical literature. A label more consistent with the IUPAC green book and ISO 31 conventions is &quot;m/Q&quot; or &quot;m/q&quot; where &quot;m&quot; is the symbol for mass and &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;q&quot; the symbol for charge with the units u/e or Da/e. This notation is not uncommon in the physics of mass spectrometry but is rarely used as the abscissa of a mass spectrum. It was also suggested to introduce a new unit thomson (Th) as a unit of &quot;m/z&quot;, where 1 Th = 1 u/e. According to this convention, mass spectra x axis could be labeled &quot;m/z&quot; (Th) and negative ions would have negative values. This notation is rare and not accepted by IUPAC or any other standards organisation.

===History of x-axis notation===

In 1897 the mass-to-charge ratio formula_1 of the electron was first measured by J. J. Thomson. By doing this he showed that the electron, which was postulated before in order to explain electricity, was in fact a particle with a mass and a charge and that its mass-to-charge ratio was much smaller than the one for the hydrogen ion H+. In 1913 he measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions with an instrument he called a parabola spectrograph. Although this data was not represented as a modern mass spectrum, it was similar in meaning. Eventually there was a change to the notation as &quot;m/e&quot; giving way to the current standard of &quot;m/z&quot;.

Early in mass spectrometry research the resolution of mass spectrometers did not allow for accurate mass determination. Francis William Aston won the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1922. &quot;For his discovery, by means of his mass spectrograph, of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the Whole Number Rule.&quot; In which he stated that all atoms (including isotopes) follow a whole-number rule This implied that the masses of atoms were not on a scale but could be expressed as integers (in fact multiple charged ions were rare, so for the most part the ratio was whole as well). There have been several suggestions (e.g. the unit thomson) to change the official mass spectrometry nomenclature formula_2 to be more internally consistent.

==Y-axis: signal intensity==
The &quot;y&quot;-axis of a mass spectrum represents signal intensity of the ions. When using counting detectors the intensity is often measured in counts per second (cps). When using analog detection electronics the intensity is typically measured in volts. In FTICR and Orbitraps the frequency domain signal (the &quot;y&quot;-axis) is related to the power (~amplitude squared) of the signal sine wave (often reduced to an rms power); however, the axis is usually not labeled as such for many reasons. In most forms of mass spectrometry, the intensity of ion current measured by the spectrometer does not accurately represent relative abundance, but correlates loosely with it. Therefore, it is common to label the &quot;y&quot;-axis with &quot;arbitrary units&quot;.

===Y-axis and relative abundance===
Signal intensity may be dependent on many factors, especially the nature of the molecules being analyzed and how they ionize. The efficiency of ionization varies from molecule to molecule and from ion source to ion source. For example, in electrospray sources in positive ion mode a quaternary amine will ionize exceptionally well whereas a large hydrophobic alcohol will most likely not be seen no matter how concentrated. In an EI source these molecules will behave very differently. Additionally there may be factors that affect ion transmission disproportionally between ionization and detection.

On the detection side there are many factors that can also affect signal intensity in a non-proportional way. The size of the ion will affect the velocity of impact and with certain detectors the velocity is proportional to the signal output. In other detection systems, such as FTICR, the number of charges on the ion are more important to signal intensity. In Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and Orbitrap type mass spectrometers the signal intensity (Y-axis) is related to the amplitude of the free induction decay signal. This is fundamentally a power relationship (amplitude squared) but often computed as an [rms]. For decaying signals the rms is not equal to the average amplitude. Additionally the damping constant (decay rate of the signal in the fid) is not the same for all ions. In order to make conclusions about relative intensity a great deal of knowledge and care is required.

A common way to get more quantitative information out of a mass spectrum is to create a standard curve to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an internal standard which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed from the bottom up to be quantitative.

===Spectral skewing===
Spectral skewing is the change in relative intensity of mass spectral peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral skewing is not observed in ion trap (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.

<text>University of Latvia (, shortened &quot;LU&quot;) is a public research university located in Riga, Latvia. The university was established in 1919.

==History==
The University of Latvia, initially named as the Higher School of Latvia () was founded on September 28, 1919, on the basis of the former Riga Polytechnic (founded in 1862). The first rector of the university was chemist Paul Walden. In 1923, the school received its current name with the approval of its constitution, the University of Latvia (Universitas Latviensis).

In the period between 1919 and 1940, the University of Latvia was the main centre of higher education, science and culture in the Republic of Latvia. The former building of the Riga Polytechnic on Raiņa bulvāris 19 serves as the university&#x27;s main building. In the pre-WWII years, it was possible to gain higher academic education not only at the University of Latvia but also at the Latvian State Conservatory and Academy of Arts.

With the beginning of the Soviet occupation, the university was renamed as the Latvian State University (LVU, ) from 1940 to 1941 and from 1944/1945 to 1958. Under the Nazi occupation, from 1942 to 1944/1945 its name was the University of Riga (). After World War II, over time the Latvian University of Agriculture, Riga Stradiņš University, and Riga Technical University separated from the University of Latvia and became well-known centres of education and research in their own right. In 1958, the university was renamed as the Pēteris Stučka Latvian State University (), which was its official name until 1990.

With Latvia regaining independence, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia reconfirmed the Constitution of the University of Latvia on September 18, 1991. It stated that the institution is &quot;a state establishment of academic education, science and culture which serves the needs of Latvia and its people&quot;. Alongside the Constitution (the Satversme of the UoL), the flag, the anthem, the university&#x27;s emblem, the rector&#x27;s chain, and the official garments for the rector, vice-rector and deans were re-adopted as attributes of the University of Latvia.

The EuroFaculty, created by the CBSS to support reforms at the universities in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius, was organized with its headquarters at the University of Latvia from 1993 to 2005. The Riga Teacher Training and Educational Management Academy was merged into the university in 2017.

In recent years, the university has often faced serious reputational problems. Several professors have been caught plagiarizing. The current rector and his former deputy have been charged with serious crimes. A criminal investigation into the embezzlement of European funds in the project led by the former chairman of the Constituent Assembly of the University is underway.
==Enrollment==
The University of Latvia offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels of study and in October 2014 more than 14,000 students, including Ph.D. and exchange students, had enrolled in various study programs. Almost one third of them studied in business and economics related programs.

In addition to the university&#x27;s various faculties, the Student Council and its medical wing, the Riga Medical College (&quot;Rīgas Medicīnas koledža&quot;), the University of Latvia offers most of the resources traditionally associated with accredited universities, including several libraries, research facilities, study centres, a language school, and a career centre. The faculties are currently undergoing restructuring and will be reduced in number.

==Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science==
The Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Latvia (, IMCS) was founded in 1959 as a computer research centre, now consisting of about 200 researchers, assistants, engineers, and software developers.

==Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformatics==

The Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformatics (GGI) of the University of Latvia () is the reestablishment of the Institute of Geodesy since 1994. The researchers of the Institute of Geodesy (1924-1944) worked successfully on the research and education in many advanced topics of that time – development and adjustment of National geodetic networks, photogrammetry, studies of vertical Earth movement and research in gravimetric and magnetic measurements. Currently, the research areas are developed in satellite geodesy and geoinformatics. The main topic is the development of satellite laser ranging systems (SLR), both the hardware and control software. Two SLR prototypes were developed until 2010 by spending low expenditures. The third most improved model is under development now. All the knowledge and experience of the staff gained since 1975 is applied. Younger colleagues are involved in the development process.

The prototype digital zenith camera for studies of vertical deflection has been developed recently. The test results reach a precision of 0.1 arc second which is very promising for the improvement of the quality of the National model of Latvia gravity field modelling. The recent version of the National gravity field developed at the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformatics has achieved a precision of about 2 cm which is much higher than the previous model (7–8 cm) used in Latvia. The high precision gravity field model is very important for practice. It gives the possibility to achieve correspondingly high precision of normal height determination using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in geodetic measurements.

There has been achieved at the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformatics the high precision results in studies of vertical and horizontal motion of the Earth in Latvia by carrying out the analysis of the 7 year GNSS observations at the LatPos and EUPOS-RIGA permanent station networks.

There are developed the GIS database for Latvia and cities of Latvia, developed digital terrain models.

==Amateur Art Activities==

<doc id="586821" wikidata="Q7555428" url="?curid=586821" title="Sokuhi Nyoitsu">
<text>was a Buddhist monk of the Ōbaku Zen sect, and was also an accomplished poet and calligrapher. His teacher Ingen Ryūki, Mokuan Shōtō and Sokuhi were together known as the &quot;Three Brushes of Ōbaku&quot; or Ōbaku no Sanpitsu.

==China==
Sokuhi was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, Southeast China. He was born into a declining Confucian scholar gentry family of the Chen clan. Life became difficult for him and his mother after his father died. He was ordained at 17 by Feiyin Tongrong. At 21 he became a disciple of Ingen, abbot of Wanfu Temple, Mount Huangbo, Fujian. There he became a colleague of Muyan. In 1651 he nearly died due to asphyxiation while fighting a forest fire near the temple, and was suddenly enlightened. Sokuhi received dharma transmission from Ingen and the next year received a promotion to high monastic office. He then became abbot of Chongsheng Temple on Mount Xuefeng, also in Fujian.

==Japan==
In 1654, Ingen and Mu&#x27;an travelled to Japan and summoned Sokuhi, who followed to Nagasaki in 1657. Sokuhi was made abbot of Sōfuku-ji, a Chinese temple built in 1629, and Mu&#x27;an was serving as abbot of Fukusai-ji. The two became known as &quot;nikanromon&quot; (&quot;two gates to enlightenment&quot;). In 1663 Sokuhi met Ingen for the first time in 12 years, after he received permission to go to Uji where he was abbot of Manpuku-ji. In 1664 Sokuhi left for Nagasaki intending to return to China but was convinced to stay by lord of Kokura and found a new temple Fukuju-ji on Mount Kujū (now in Fukuoka). In 1668 he passed this position to his Japanese disciple Houn Myodo and returned to Sōfuku-ji to retire. He became ill in 1670 and died at Nagasaki in 1671. He was cremated and his remains were placed at Fukuju-ji and Sōfuku-ji.
