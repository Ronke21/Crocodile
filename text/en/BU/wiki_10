<text>The Byzantine Rite, also known as the Greek Rite or the Rite of Constantinople, is a liturgical rite that is identified with the wide range of cultural, devotional, and canonical practices that developed in the Eastern Christian church of Constantinople.

The canonical hours are extended and complex, lasting about eight hours (longer during Great Lent) but are abridged outside of large monasteries. An iconostasis, a partition covered with icons, separates the area around the altar from the nave. The sign of the cross, accompanied by bowing, is made very frequently, e.g., more than a hundred times during the divine liturgy, and there is prominent veneration of icons, a general acceptance of the congregants freely moving within the church and interacting with each other, and distinctive traditions of liturgical chanting.

Some traditional practices are falling out of use in modern times in sundry churches and in the diaspora, e.g., the faithful standing during services, bowing and prostrating frequently, and priests, deacons, and monastics always wearing a cassock and other clerical garb even in everyday life (monastics also sleep wearing a cassock) and not shaving or trimming their hair or beards.

In addition to numerous psalms read every day, the entire psalter is read each week, and twice each week during Great Lent, and there are daily readings of other scriptures; also many hymns have quotes from, and references to, the scriptures woven into them. On the numerous fast days there is prescribed abstention from meat and dairy products, and on many fast days also from fish, wine, and the use of oil in cooking. Four fasting seasons are prescribed: Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles&#x27; Fast and Dormition Fast. In addition, throughout the year most Wednesdays and Fridays, as well as Mondays in monasteries, are fast days.

==History==
In its present form, the rite is the product of a long cultural synthesis that developed in the years after the 8th-9th century Iconoclasm, in which monasteries and their cultural contacts with the Holy Land played a decisive role. From the 9th to the 14th centuries, the influence of the Palestinian Rite exerted a dominating influence and the rite has been called a &quot;hybrid&quot; between an earlier ceremonial rite which scholars have dubbed the cathedral rite of Constantinople, called the &quot;asmatiki akolouthia&quot; (&quot;sung services&quot;) and the Palestinian Rite of Jerusalem, the &quot;Hagiopolitan&quot; (Gr. &quot;of the Holy City&quot;) in Greek, chiefly through the monastic &quot;typikon&quot; of the Mar Saba monastery near Jerusalem. Later developments were usually connected to monasteries at Constantinople and Mount Athos patronized by the imperial court, such as Studion, whose Rule formed the nucleus of early monastic communities in Bulgaria and Kievan Rus&#x27;. In the early modern period, the traditions of the rite received further elaboration from the interface of Christian and Islamic mystical traditions fostered in the Ottoman court.

By the mid-17th century, the practices of the Russian Church differed to those of other Orthodox Christians, who followed contemporary Greek practices. Patriarch Nikon made efforts to correct the translations of texts and institute liturgical reforms so that they were aligned with Greek practices. Nikon&#x27;s reforms were not accepted by all, and the resulting schism () split Russian Christianity into the present Russian Orthodox Church and the historically persecuted Old Believers, who maintained many archaic practices of worship.

==Sacred Mysteries==
The &quot;Holy Mysteries&quot;, or &quot;Sacred Mysteries&quot;, or similar, refer to the elements of Holy Communion, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, in the texts of the Divine Liturgy, the prayers before and after communion, and elsewhere, as, for example, in the first petition of the ectenia after communion, &quot;Arise! Having partaken of the divine, holy, pure, immortal, heavenly, life-creating, and awesome Mysteries of Christ, let us worthily give thanks to the Lord.&quot;

Also termed the sacred mysteries is a broad theological category including the seven sacraments defined in the Western Church but differing slightly in emphasis—stressing their ineffable character and forgoing the intense theological definitions which emerged in the centuries following the Reformation. Although all modern Orthodox churches customarily observe the same seven sacraments as in Catholicism, the number has no dogmatic significance and, up to the 17th century, individual authors varied greatly in the number of rites considered &quot;mysteries&quot;. Despite the historical differences, modern Orthodox and Catholic faithful are generally united in viewing the West&#x27;s seven sacraments and Orthodoxy&#x27;s looser number of sacred mysteries—seven only by convention—as effectively equivalent. The Catholics regard the two as identical.

Divine Liturgy
The divine liturgy may be celebrated on most days, the exceptions, known as aliturgical days, being in or near Great Lent. Typically, however, the liturgy is celebrated daily only in cathedrals and larger monasteries but elsewhere only on Sundays, major feast days, and some other days, especially during Great Lent.

These three forms of the eucharistic service are in use universal usage:
* The Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is the one most commonly celebrated throughout the year.
* The Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated ten times a year.
* The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is celebrated on certain weekdays of Great Lent and of Holy Week.

==Daily office==
The daily cycle begins with vespers and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:

The typica is used whenever the divine liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, &quot;i.e.&quot;, when there is a vesperal liturgy or no liturgy at all. On days when the liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the typica follows the sixth hour (or matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein; otherwise, on 

or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.

Also, there are Inter-Hours for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. Their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the Lenten alleluia replaces &quot;God is the Lord&quot; at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the ecclesiarch when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.

In addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, canons) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the Eucharist.

The full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other Katholika (sobors). In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation); otherwise, the Prothesis is served during matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the Liturgy of the Catechumens beginning immediately after the troparion following the Great Doxology.

The Midnight Office is seldom served in parish churches, except at the Paschal Vigil as the essential office, wherein the burial shroud is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.

===Aggregates===
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.

The most common groupings are as follows:

====Ordinary days====
* Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
* Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the Divine Liturgy or Typica

====Weekdays during Lent====
*Evening — Great Compline
*Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
*Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, Typica, Vespers (sometimes with the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)

====When there is an all-night vigil====
On the eves before Great Feasts and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used. However, the All-night vigil is usually abridged so as to not last literally &quot;all-night&quot; and may be as short as two hours; on the other hand, on Athos and in the very traditional monastic institutions, that service followed by the hours and Liturgy may last as long as 18 hours.

*Afternoon — Ninth Hour, Little Vespers, Compline (where it is not read at the commencement of the Vigil)
*Early night — Compline (where it is not the custom for it to follow small vespers), Great Vespers, a reading, Matins, First Hour

====When the royal hours are read====
*Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
*Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins
*Morning — First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Hours and the Typica

====On the eves of Christmas, Theophany, and Annunciation====
When the feast is a weekday (or, in the Russian tradition, on any day for Christmas, Theophany), Vespers (with the Liturgy in most instances) is served earlier in the day and so Great Compline functions much as Great vespers does on the vigils of other feast days.

*Evening — Great Compline (in some traditions) and, if there be an All-Night Vigil, the reading, matins, first hour.
*Morning Watches — (unless there be an all-night vigil) midnight office, matins, first hour.

==Sacraments and other services performed as needed==

===The Holy Mysteries (Sacraments)===

====Baptism====
Baptism transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through Baptism a person is united to the Body of Christ by becoming a member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, water is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times, once in the name of each of the figures of the Holy Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the &quot;old man&quot; by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection. Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person&#x27;s name.

Children of Orthodox families are normally baptized shortly after birth. Converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptized into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received back into the church through the mystery of Chrismation.

Properly, the mystery of Baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptize. In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptized by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.

The service of Baptism used in Orthodox churches has remained largely unchanged for more than 1500 years. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386), in his &quot;Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism&quot;, describes the service; it is largely consistent with the service currently in use in the early 21st century.

====Chrismation====
Chrismation grants the gift of the Holy Spirit through anointing with Holy Chrism. It is normally given immediately after baptism as part of the same service. It may also be used to formally receive again lapsed members of the Orthodox Church. As baptism is a person&#x27;s participation in the death and resurrection of Christ, so chrismation is a person&#x27;s participation in the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

A baptized and chrismated Orthodox Christian is a full member of the Church and may receive the Eucharist regardless of age and, indeed, does so beginning at the first liturgy attended after chrismation, infant communion being the universal norm.

The sanctification of chrism may, in theory, be performed by any bishop at any time, but in longstanding practice is performed no more than once a year by hierarchs of most of the autocephalous churches, although some autocephalous churches obtain their chrism from another church. Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, and according to the prayer of consecration of chrism, the apostles made the initial chrism, laying their hands on it, for priests to substitute for laying on of hands for sundry practices, where only the apostles could perform said laying on of hands.

====Holy Communion (Eucharist)====

The Eucharist is at the center of Orthodox Christianity. In practice, it is the partaking of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ in the midst of the Divine Liturgy with the rest of the church. The bread and wine are believed to be transubstantiated as the genuine Body and Blood of the Christ Jesus through the operation of the Holy Spirit.

Communion is given only to baptized Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The wine is administered with a spoon directly into the recipient&#x27;s mouth from the chalice. From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.

Because of the Orthodox understanding of mankind&#x27;s fallen nature in general, those who wish to commune prepare themselves in a way that reflects mankind in paradise. First, they prepare by having their confession heard and the prayer of repentance read over them by a priest. They are encouraged to increase their prayer rule, adding the prescribed prayers in preparation for communing. Finally, they fast completely from food, drink, and sexual activity from the evening before, a time interpreted variously in sundry locations as: from arising from sleep, or from midnight, or from sunset the previous evening.

====Confession====

When one who has committed sins repents of them, wishing to reconcile to God and renew the purity of original baptisms, they confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female, who has been given a blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very carefully, as this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the priest lays his hands on the penitent&#x27;s head while reciting the prayer of absolution.

Sin is a mistake made by the individual, but there is the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of penance (), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing a deeper understanding of the mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess. Though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, they also have an opportunity for spiritual growth.

====Marriage====
From the Eastern Orthodox understanding of marriage, it is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments. As well as in many other Christian traditions, for example in the Catholic Church, it serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the purpose of following Christ and His Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy family through their holy union. The church understands marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, and certain Orthodox leaders have spoken out strongly in opposition to the civil institution of same-sex marriage.

Jesus said that &quot;when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven&quot; (Mk 12:25). For the Orthodox Christian this passage should not be understood to imply that Christian marriage will not remain a reality in the Kingdom, but points to the fact that relations will not be &quot;fleshy&quot;, but &quot;spiritual&quot;. Love between wife and husband, as an icon of relationship between Christ and Church, is eternal.

The Church does recognize that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man. Ecclesiastically divorced Orthodox (not civilly divorced only).

Should a married deacon or priest die, it is common for his wife to retire to a monastery once their children are out of the house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently enter monasteries.

The order of a first marriage consists of three distinct services: the Betrothal, the Mystery of Crowning, and the Taking off of the Crowns, but nowadays these are performed in immediate succession. There is no exchange of vows.

====Holy Orders====
Since its founding, the Church spread to different places and its leaders in each region came to be known as (overseers, plural of , overseer—Gr. ), which became &quot;bishop&quot; in English. The other ordained roles are (Gr. , elder), which became &quot;prester&quot; and then &quot;priest&quot; in English, and (Gr. , servant), which became &quot;deacon&quot; in English (see also subdeacon). There are numerous administrative positions among the clergy that carry additional titles.

Bishops are always monks. Although someone who is not a monk may be elected to be a bishop, which frequently happens with widowed priests, he must receive a monastic tonsure before consecration to the episcopate. Deacons and priests, however, are typically married, and it is customary that only monks or married men be ordained. It is considered preferable for parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests usually are monks and live in monasteries, though when there is of a shortage of married priests, a monk-priest may be assigned to a parish.

A deacon or priest would have to abandon his orders, i.e. be liaised, to marry after ordination; it is common for widowed clergy to enter a monastery. Also, widowed wives of clergy, who are discouraged from remarrying, often become nuns when their children are grown.

Only men can take holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church. This has fallen out of practice, the last deaconess having been ordained in the 19th century; however, in 2016, Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria decided to reinstate the order of deaconesses and, in February 2017, Patriarch Theodoros II appointed six nuns to be subdeacons.

====Unction====
Anointing with oil, often called &quot;unction&quot;, is one of the mysteries administered by the Orthodox Church and it is not reserved only for the dying or terminally ill, but for all in need of spiritual or bodily healing, and with reception of this sacrament comes forgiveness of sins. In Greece, during the Ottoman occupation, when parish priests were not allowed to hear confessions, it became the custom to administer this mystery annually on Great Wednesday to all believers so that all could commune the following days through Pascha. In recent decades, this custom has spread to many other locations.

===Other services performed as needed===

==Local variations==
Two main strata exist in the rite, those places that have inherited the traditions of the Russian Church which had been given only the monastic Sabbaite typicon which she uses to this day in parishes and cathedrals as well as in monasteries, and everywhere else where some remnant of the cathedral rite remained in use; therefore, the rite as practiced in monasteries everywhere resembles the Russian recension, while non-Russian non-monastic customs differs significantly. For example, in the Russian tradition, the &quot;all-night vigil&quot; is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (although it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have matins on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, vespers and matins are rather less abridged but the Divine Liturgy commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.

Also, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.

==Liturgical books==

 (; Church Slavonic: , ), or &quot;Book of Hours&quot;, provides the fixed portions of the Daily Cycle of services () as used by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.

Numerous movable parts of the service are inserted into this fixed framework. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books:

*Psalter (Greek: , ; Slavonic: or , ) A book containing the 150 Psalms divided into 20 sections called Kathismata together with the 9 Biblical canticles which are chanted at Matins; although these canticles had been chanted in their entirety, having over time come to be supplemented by interspersed hymns (analogously to stichera) to form the Canon, the canticles themselves are now only regularly used in a few large monasteries. The Psalter also contains the various &quot;selected psalms&quot;, each composed of verses from a variety of psalms, sung at matins on feast days, as well as tables for determining which Kathismata are to be read at each service; in addition to the Psalms read at the daily offices, all the Psalms are read each week and, during Great Lent, twice a week.
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , or , )—Literally, the Book of the &quot;Eight Tones&quot; or modes. This book contains a cycle of eight weeks, one for each of the eight (church modes of the Byzantine musical system of eight modes), providing texts for each day of the week for Vespers, Matins, Compline, and (on Sundays) the Midnight Office. The origins of this book go back to compositions by St. John Damascene. The (Great) is also called . containing only Marianic hymns are called . Since the 17th century, different collections of the Octoechos had been separated as own books about certain Hesperinos psalms like the an octoechos collection for the psalm 103, the for psalm 140, and the for the psalm verse 150:6 and also the .
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , )—A twelve-volume set which provides liturgical texts for each day of the calendar year, printed as 12 volumes, one for each month of the year. Another volume, the &quot;General Menaion&quot; contains propers for each class of saints for use when the propers for a particular saint are not available. Additionally, locally venerated saints may have services in supplemental volumes, pamphlets, or manuscripts.
* (Greek: ) A collection of the lives of the saints and commentaries on the meaning of feasts for each day of the calendar year, also printed as 12 volumes, appointed to be read at the meal in monasteries and, when there is an all-night vigil for a feast day, between vespers and matins.
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , ; Romanian: ), also called the Lenten Triodion. The Lenten Triodion contains propers for:
**the Pre-Lenten Season
**the Forty Days of Great Lent itself
**Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday
**Holy Week
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , , literally &quot;Flowery Triodon&quot;; Romanian: ) This volume contains the propers for the period from Pascha to the Sunday of All Saints. This period can be broken down into the following periods:
**Bright Week (Easter Week) Commencing with matins on Pascha (Easter Sunday) through the following Saturday
**Paschal Season—The period from Thomas Sunday until Ascension
**Ascension and its Afterfeast
**Pentecost and its Afterfeast
**All Saints Sunday (the Sunday after Pentecost)
* (Greek: ; Georgian: სჳნაქსარი, &quot;swnak̕sari&quot;; Romanian: )—The contains for each day of the year brief lives of the saints and meanings of celebrated feasts, appointed to be read after the Kontakion and Oikos at Matins.
* (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , )—Contains the chanted at the Canon of Matins and other services. The hymns of the books and had been collected earlier in a book called or .
*Priest&#x27;s Service Book (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , ) It contains the portions of the services which are said by the priest and deacon and is given to a deacon and to a priest with his vestments at ordination. The &#x27; contains the portions of the services for the whole year which are said by the priest (&#x27;), the bishop (&#x27;) or the deacon (&#x27;). The two largest parts are the &#x27; with the liturgies for the whole year and the &#x27; with the blessings.
*Bishop&#x27;s Service Book (Greek: , Slavonic: , ) the portions of the services which are said by the Bishop; for the Canonical Hours, this differs little from what is in the Priest&#x27;s Service Book.
* (Greek: , Georgian: საწინასწარმეტყველო, &quot;sacinascarmetqvelo&quot;) It contains the Old Testament Lectionary readings appointed at Vespers and at other services during the Church year.
*Gospel Book (Greek: , or , ) Book containing the 4 Gospels laid out as read at the divine services.
*Apostle Book (Greek: or , or ; Georgian: სამოციქულო, &quot;samoc̕ik̕ulo&quot;; Slavonic: , ) Contains the readings for the Divine Liturgy from the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles together with the and Alleluia verses that are chanted with the readings.
*Patristic writings Many writings from the Church fathers are prescribed to be read at matins and, during great lent, at the hours; in practice, this is only done in some monasteries and frequently therein the abbot prescribes readings other than those in the written rubrics. Therefore, it is not customary to enumerate all the volumes required for this.
*Collections (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , ) There are numerous smaller anthologies available which were quite common before the invention of printing but still are in common use both because of the enormous volume of a full set of liturgical texts and because the full texts have not yet been translated into several languages currently in use. Some of the anthologies are called .
*Typicon (Greek: , ; Georgian: ტიპიკონი, &quot;tipikoni&quot; Slavonic: , or , ) Contains all of the rules for the performance of the Divine Services, giving directions for every possible combination of the materials from the books mentioned above into the Daily Cycle of Services.
* (Greek: ) is a service book that contains the Anastasima (Resurrectional) hymns of vespers, Sunday matins and other hymns.
* (Greek: ) it contains the stichera for the morning and evening services throughout the year. Chant compositions in the sticheraric melos can also be found in other liturgical books like the or the .
* (Greek: ) is a liturgical book which contains the paracletic canons of the week.
*Homilies (Greek: ) some homilies of the Church Fathers are recited regularly or on special occasions, such as the Paschal Homily of St. John Chrysostom.

Also some books for special occasions, such as the book for the great week- , the for the 15. August, or the including certain excerpts. The Apostolike Diakonia of the Church of Greece and some Greek-orthodox bishops have also published certain old liturgies. Such as the Liturgy of St. James and others.

==Calendar==
The fixed portion of the liturgical year begins on September 1. There is also a movable Paschal cycle fixed according to the date of Pascha (Easter), which is by far the most important day of the entire year. The interplay of these two cycles, plus other lesser cycles influences the manner in which the services are celebrated on a day to day level throughout the entire year.

Traditionally, the Julian Calendar has been used to calculate feast days. Beginning in 1924, several autocephalous churches adopted, for fixed dates, the Revised Julian Calendar which is aligned with the Gregorian calendar; the Paschal cycle, however, continued to be calculated according to the Julian Calendar. Today, some churches and portions of some other churches continue to follow the Julian Calendar while others follow the Revised Julian (Eastern Orthodox) or Gregorian (usually the more Latinized Byzantine Catholic) Calendar. Among Eastern Orthodox, only the Orthodox Church of Finland has adopted the Western calculation of the date of Pascha (see computus); all other Orthodox Churches, and a number of Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as the Ukrainian Lutheran Church, celebrate Pascha according to the ancient rules.

===Liturgical cycles===
Various cycles of the liturgical year influence the manner in which the materials from the liturgical books (above) are inserted into the daily services:

====Weekly cycle====
Each day of the week has its own commemoration:
*&quot;Sunday&quot;—Resurrection of Christ
*&quot;Monday&quot;—The Holy Angels
*&quot;Tuesday&quot;—St. John the Forerunner
*&quot;Wednesday&quot;—The Cross and the Theotokos
*&quot;Thursday&quot;—The Holy Apostles and Saint Nicholas
*&quot;Friday&quot;—The Cross
*&quot;Saturday&quot;—All Saints and the departed

Most of the texts come from the , which has a large collections of hymns for each weekday for each of the eight tones; during great lent and, to a lesser degree, the pre-lenten season, the &quot;Lenten Triodion&quot; supplements this with hymns for each day of the week for each week of that season, as does the during the pascal season. Also, there are fixed texts for each day of the week are in the and &quot;Priest&#x27;s Service Book&quot; (e.g., dismissals) and the Kathismata (selections from the &quot;Psalter&quot;) are governed by the weekly cycle in conjunction with the season.

====Fixed cycle====
Commemorations on the Fixed Cycle depend upon the day of the calendar year, and also, occasionally, specific days of the week that fall near specific calendar dates, e.g., the Sunday before the Exaltation of the Cross. The texts for this cycle are found in the .

====Paschal cycle====
The commemorations on the Paschal Cycle (&quot;Movable Cycle&quot;) depend upon the date of Pascha (Easter). The texts for this cycle are found in the &quot;Lenten Triodion&quot;, the , and the , as well as the &quot;Gospel Book&quot; and &quot;Apostle Book&quot; because the daily Epistle and Gospel readings are determined by this cycle. The cycle of the continues through the following great lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year&#x27;s and the current year&#x27;s dates of Easter.

=====8 Week cycle of the octoechos=====
The cycle of the eight Tones is found in the , and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter, that week using the first tone, the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent Palm Sunday.

=====11 Week cycle of the matins gospels=====
The portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day&#x27;s Matins Gospel.

===Eastern Catholic Churches===
Within Eastern Catholicism, several Eastern Catholic Churches are using Byzantine Rite, in its original Greek or some other form (Slavic, Romanian, Hungarian, Albanian, Arabic, Georgian).

====History====
During the Early Middle Ages, Byzantine liturgical practices were employed in some (mainly southern) regions of Byzantine Italy. Churches in those regions were returned to papal authority after the Norman conquest of southern Italy in the 11th century, thus creating the base for inclusion of local Byzantine-Rite communities into the Catholic Church. Most notable among those communities was the famous Monastery of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata.

Since the Union of Florence (1439), several efforts were made towards promotion of church union among Orthodox Slavs, who were employing Church Slavic variant of Byzantine Rite in their liturgy. In Latin terminology, Eastern Slavs were also known under an exonymic designation as Ruthenians, and thus an Eastern Slavic form of Byzantine Rite came to be known as the &quot;Ruthenian Rite&quot;.

Since the 14th century, several regions of the former Kievan Rus&#x27; came under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Kingdom of Poland, that later created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the end of the 16th century, many among Orthodox Slavs within the borders of the Commonwealth accepted union with the Catholic Church, but kept their Slavic variant of Byzantine Rite, commonly known as &quot;Ruthenian Rite&quot; in Latin terminology. What was historically called the Ruthenian Uniate Church was set up to accommodate the local Christians and their ecclesiastic leadership under the Catholic umbrella in a state known for its religious tolerance. At the time, the religious boundaries of the Schism were comparatively fluid, and the leadership of what is now western Ukraine had from the 13th to the 15th centuries repeatedly vacillated between eastern and western leadership. The Union of Brest in 1595 finalized the shift of the Orthodox leadership of the lands of White and Little Russia (modern Belarus and Ukraine) to Uniate status. The population of those countries became Greek Catholic without a break in administration. Later, when Muscovite Russia conquered the same, the ecclesiastical leadership largely switched its allegiance again. The modern Ukrainian, Ruthenian, and Hungarian Greek Catholic Churches (approx. 5 million total) compose the great majority of Greek Catholics today, but are only a fraction of the early modern Greek Catholic or Uniate population.

The last Greek Catholic congregation of any size, the Arabic-speaking Melkite Greek Catholic Church (approx. 1.5 million), predominantly resident in Syria and with a large diaspora, is descended from a split within the far more numerous Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch (approx. 4.3 million), when in 1729 a claimant to the Antiochene See, removed from his position by the Ottoman authorities, received recognition by the Papacy as the legitimate incumbent. The Melkite Patriarch is presently resident in Damascus, having fled the city of Antioch upon its annexation by Turkey in 1939, a move disputed by Syria.

The Byzantine Rite is distinct from other Eastern Catholic liturgies, themselves using the Aramaic-Syriac, Armenian, and Coptic liturgies of the Oriental Orthodox churches that separated from both Greek and Latin worlds before the Great Schism.

===Byzantine Rite Lutheranism===
* The Ukrainian Lutheran Church uses liturgical formulae from the Byzantine Rite to form the base text for the Order of Service in the Ukrainian Evangelical Service Book, as well as the &quot;Revised Julian Calendar&quot;.
* It has also been used by the German Eastern Rite Community (Ostkirchlicher Konvent), St. Valentine&#x27;s Lutheran Fellowship of the Grand Canyon Synod (ELCA), and in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia.
* Several other Lutheran communities also use the Byzantine Rite that has been adapted to Lutheran theology.

<text>Alan Warren Haig (July 19, 1922 – November 16, 1982) was an American jazz pianist, best known as one of the pioneers of bebop.

==Biography==
Haig was born in Newark, New Jersey, and raised in nearby Nutley. In 1940, he majored in piano at Oberlin College. He started performing with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker in 1945, and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of Eddie Davis and His Beboppers in 1946 (also featuring Fats Navarro), and the Eddie Davis Quintet in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under Stan Getz from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for Guild Records in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the nonet on the first session of Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;.

For much of the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Haig was all but a forgotten giant&quot;, in Brian Case&#x27;s words; &quot;Jazz pianism, ever more percussive in a crass simplification of [Bud] Powell&#x27;s methods, had no room for the crystalline touch and swift, logical turnover of ideas. Haig got by with semi-cocktail piano in New York bars.&quot; Although Haig is best remembered for playing bebop, he spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.

In 1969, Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey, on October 9, 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig&#x27;s second wife, challenged Haig&#x27;s account in her 2007 book, &quot;Death of a Bebop Wife&quot;. Rutan&#x27;s book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie&#x27;s story in detail, depicting an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan observed that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig&#x27;s violent personality that went unheeded. She quotes bassist Hal Gaylor, who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie&#x27;s death.

In 1974, Haig was invited to tour Europe by Tony Williams, owner of Spotlite Records in the United Kingdom. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the &quot;Invitation&quot; album for Spotlite with Bibi Rovère on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and, over the next eight years, he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He also recorded for several Japanese labels.

Haig died from a heart attack on November 16, 1982, and was survived by his wife Joanne and his sons Alan and Daniel.

<doc id="588324" wikidata="Q447464" url="?curid=588324" title="Preference utilitarianism">
<text>Preference utilitarianism (also known as preferentialism) is a form of utilitarianism in contemporary philosophy. Unlike value monist forms of utilitarianism, preferentialism values actions that fulfill the most personal interests for the entire circle of people affected by said action.

==Description==
Unlike classical utilitarianism, in which right actions are defined as those that maximize pleasure and minimize pain, preference utilitarianism entails promoting actions that fulfil the interests (i.e., preferences) of those beings involved. Here beings might be rational, that is to say, that their interests have been carefully selected and they have not made some kind of error. However, &#x27;beings&#x27; can also be extended to all sentient beings, even those who lack the capacity to contemplate long-term interests and consequences. Since what is good and right depends solely on individual preferences, there can be nothing that is in itself good or bad: for preference utilitarians, the source of both morality and ethics in general is subjective preference. Preference utilitarianism therefore can be distinguished by its acknowledgement that every person&#x27;s experience of satisfaction is unique.

The theory, as outlined by R. M. Hare in 1981, is controversial, insofar as it presupposes some basis by which a conflict between A&#x27;s preferences and B&#x27;s preferences can be resolved (for example, by weighting them mathematically). In a similar vein, Peter Singer, for much of his career a major proponent of preference utilitarianism and himself influenced by the views of Hare, has been criticised for giving priority to the views of beings capable of holding preferences (being able actively to contemplate the future and its interaction with the present) over those solely concerned with their immediate situation, a group that includes animals and young children. There are, he writes in regard to killing in general, times when &quot;the preference of the victim could sometimes be outweighed by the preferences of others&quot;. Singer does, however, still place a high value on the life of rational beings, since killing them does not infringe upon just one of their preferences, but &quot;a wide range of the most central and significant preferences a being can have&quot;.

<doc id="588325" wikidata="Q225418" url="?curid=588325" title="Ivica Kralj">
<text>Ivica Kralj (, ; born 26 March 1973) is a Montenegrin former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

During his playing career, Kralj was best known for his time at Partizan, having three spells at the club and winning five major trophies. He also played for Porto and PSV.

At international level, Kralj represented FR Yugoslavia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, reaching the knockout stage in both tournaments.

==Club career==

===Partizan===
Born in Kotor and raised in Tivat, Kralj started out at his local club Arsenal Tivat, before joining Partizan as a trainee in the summer of 1987. He broke into their first team at the age of 16, sitting on the bench during a 5–4 away loss to Celtic in the second leg of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup first round on 27 September 1989. In order to gain experience, Kralj was later sent out on loan to Zvezdara (1992–93) and Jastrebac Niš (1993–94), before returning to Partizan. He made his league debut for the club in the 1995–96 season, as they won the championship title. In the 1996–97 campaign, Partizan won their second consecutive title, as Kralj became the club&#x27;s undisputed first-choice goalkeeper and earned his first national team cap. He also won the FR Yugoslavia Cup in the 1997–98 season, before going abroad.

===Porto===
In the summer of 1998, Kralj moved to Portugal and signed with Porto. He initially established himself as the club&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper, helping them win the Supertaça on 9 September 1998. However, following Vítor Baía&#x27;s return to Porto in the 1999 winter transfer window, Kralj completely lost his place in the starting lineup. He was subsequently loaned to Radnički Kragujevac until the end of the 1998–99 season.

===PSV===
In the 1999 summer transfer window, Kralj was transferred to Dutch club PSV. He featured in the UEFA Champions League of that year where PSV suffered a 4–1 defeat to Rangers in the group stage. Shortly after, Kralj suffered a hamstring injury, ruling him out for five months. He returned to action in April 2000, but was mainly a backup to Ronald Waterreus and Patrick Lodewijks, as the club convincingly won the domestic league in his debut season at Philips Stadion. After failing to make any appearances in the first half of the 2000–01 season, Kralj was loaned to his former club Partizan in January 2001. He added one more national cup trophy to his collection, despite not getting any game time in the competition. After returning to PSV, Kralj was the club&#x27;s third-choice goalkeeper behind Waterreus and Lodewijks. He eventually left the club by mutual consent in 2002.

===Return to Partizan===
In June 2003, Kralj made another return to Partizan, signing a one-year deal. He quickly found his form and helped the team qualify for the Champions League in the 2003–04 campaign, saving two penalties in the shootout against Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park in the final qualifying round. However, Kralj failed to make any appearances in the group stage due to an injury. He eventually signed a three-year extension to his contract with Partizan in May 2004. After recovering from injury, Kralj was a first team regular, helping his team win the league title in 2005, with an unbeaten record. He left the club at the end of his contract, stating his disappointment towards some members of the club&#x27;s board.

===Rostov===
In August 2007, Kralj moved to Russia as a free agent and signed with Rostov. He was joined by his former teammate Albert Nađ. However, Kralj failed to make any competitive appearance for the club, as they suffered relegation from the top flight after finishing bottom of the table. He was released by Rostov in December 2007, alongside Nađ and several other players.

===Spartak Trnava===
In July 2008, Kralj moved to Slovak club Spartak Trnava, signed by his former manager Vladimir Vermezović, on a two-year deal. He agreed to leave the club in late 2009, due to his chronic injury problems, eventually retiring from the game.

==International career==
Kralj made his international debut for FR Yugoslavia on 28 December 1996, coming on as a late second-half substitute for Zvonko Milojević in a 3–2 friendly win away to Argentina. He subsequently became the first-choice goalkeeper for the national team under Slobodan Santrač, helping them to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In the final tournament, Kralj played the full 90 minutes in all of his team&#x27;s four games, as they were eliminated by the Netherlands in the knockout stage.

Despite not playing regularly at club level, Kralj was named by Vujadin Boškov in Yugoslavia&#x27;s final UEFA Euro 2000 squad, choosing the number 22 shirt. They went on to reach the quarter-finals of the competition, where the team was eliminated by the Netherlands. The hosts achieved a convincing 6–1 victory, including a hat-trick by Patrick Kluivert and a brace by Marc Overmars.

In June 2001, after a one-year absence from the national team, Kralj was selected to represent his country at the Kirin Cup. He made his last appearance for FR Yugoslavia in a 1–1 home draw with Slovenia on 5 September 2001, as the country failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Over a five-year international career, Kralj earned 41 caps for Yugoslavia.

==Post-playing career==
After hanging up his boots, Kralj worked for some time as a player agent. He was appointed as president of Mačva Šabac in January 2015. In November 2020, after spending five and a half years in charge, Kralj stepped down from his position.

In September 2022, Kralj was appointed as sporting director of Partizan. In September 2024, Kralj was dismissed from the position, and was replaced by previous sporting director Ivica Iliev.

<text>The kepi ( ) is a cap with a flat circular top and a peak, or visor. In English, the term is a loanword from , itself a re-spelled version of the , a diminutive form of , meaning . In Europe, the kepi is most commonly associated with French military and police uniforms, though versions of it were widely worn by other armies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In North America, it is usually associated with the American Civil War, as it was worn by soldiers on both sides of the conflict.

==French Army==
The kepi was formerly the most common headgear in the French Army. Its predecessor originally appeared during the 1830s, in the course of the initial stages of the occupation of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress caps called &quot;casquette d&#x27;Afrique&quot;. These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered leather French Army shako. As a light and comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less practical shako being relegated to parade use. In 1852, a new soft cloth cap was introduced for campaign and off-duty. Called &quot;bonnet de police à visière&quot;, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as &quot;bec de canard&quot; (duck bill). This kepi had no chinstrap (&quot;jugulaire&quot;). Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps and buttons. The kepi became well known outside France during the Crimean War and was subsequently adopted in various forms by a number of other armies (including the U.S. and Russian) during the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1870, when troops were mobilized for the Franco-Prussian War, large numbers of French soldiers either refused to wear the issued shakos or threw them away. Emperor Napoléon III abolished the infantry shako for active service and replaced it with the kepi on 30 July 1870.

In 1876, a new model appeared with a rounded visor, as the squared visor drooped when wet and curled when drying. The model used in World War I was the 1886 pattern, which was a fuller shape incorporating air vents. Described as an &quot;ideal headdress - which was cheap, distinctive and easy to produce&quot;, the M1886 kepi&#x27;s only significant drawback was that the sunken crown collected rain.

By 1900, the kepi had become the standard headdress of most French army units and (along with the red trousers of the period 1829–1914) a symbol of the French soldier. It appeared in full dress (with inner stiffening and ornamental plume or ball ornament) and service versions. Officers&#x27; ranks were shown by gold or silver braiding circling the centre and as a trefoil on the crown. The different branches were distinguished by the colours of the cap – see the table. Cavalry normally wore shakos or plumed helmets, reserving red kepis with light or dark blue bands for wear in barracks. General officers wore (and continue to wear for ceremonial purposes) kepis with gold oak leaves embroidered around the band.

In 1914, most French soldiers wore their kepis to war. The highly visible colours were hidden by a medium blue-grey cover, following the example of the Foreign Legion and other North African units who had long worn their kepis with white (or later khaki) covers in the field. With the adoption of &quot;horizon blue&quot; (light blue-grey) uniforms and steel Adrian helmets in 1915 to replace the conspicuous peacetime uniforms worn during the early months of the war, the kepi was generally replaced by folding forage caps. Officers, however, still wore kepis behind the lines.

Following the war, the kepi was gradually reintroduced in the peacetime French Army, but was never adopted for wear in the Navy or Air Force. The Foreign Legion resumed wearing it in 1926; initially in red and blue, and then in 1939, with white covers on all occasions. The bulk of the French army readopted the kepi in the various traditional branch colours for off-duty wear during the 1930s. It had now become a straight-sided and higher headdress than the traditional soft cap. This made it unsuitable for wartime wear, and after 1940, it was seldom worn, except by officers. An exception was the Foreign Legion, who, previously just one of the many units that wore the kepi, now adopted it in its white version as a symbol.

==Modern French usage==
===Army===
The decision in 1991 to end conscription in France, and to rely on voluntary enlistment, has led to the readoption of various traditional items for dress wear. This has included the reappearance in the army of the kepi which is now worn by all ranks in the majority of units, on appropriate occasions. Within the army, particularly notable are the kepis of the French Foreign Legion, whose members are sometimes called &quot;képis blancs&quot; (white kepis), because of the unit&#x27;s regulation white headgear. Former cavalry units wear light blue kepis with red tops plus silver braid (for officers) and insignia. Other colours include all dark blue with red piping (for artillery units), dark blue with red tops (line infantry) and crimson with red tops (medical). The &quot;dark blue&quot; of officers&#x27; kepis is very similar to black. 
===Other French organizations===
The kepi was adopted in 1854 for wear as a working headdress by police &quot;agents&quot; and &quot;sergents de ville&quot; as an alternative to the heavy and less practical bicorne previously worn. 

The French National Police discarded their dark blue kepis in 1984 as part of a general updating of uniforms, adopting a low peaked cap. The reason given was that the rigid kepi, while smart and distinctive, was inconvenient for ordinary use and too high to be comfortably worn in vehicles. 
French customs officers (&quot;douaniers&quot;) and the Gendarmerie still wear kepis for ceremonial duty. Customs officers wear a baseball style cap for ordinary duties (since 1994 with many variations) while the Gendarmerie introduced a &quot;soft kepi&quot; in the early 2000s.

== North American usage ==


In the United States, the kepi is most often associated with the American Civil War era, and continued into the Indian Wars. Union soldiers were generally issued kepis for fatigue use. A close copy of the contemporary French kepi,
it had a sunken top and squared visor. It was often called a &quot;McClellan cap&quot;, after the Union commander of the Army of the Potomac, G. B. McClellan. For field officers, the caps were often decorated in a French-influenced style, with a dark velvet band around the base and black silk braiding on the crown. The kepi was also popular with various state units and as privately purchased headgear; e.g., it was standard issue in 1861 for New York infantry regiments.

The kepi is not to be confused with the model 1858 forage cap, sometimes called a &quot;bummer cap&quot; or McDowell cap, which evolved directly from the shako used by the regular army earlier in the 1850s (see the design of the crown, chinstrap, brim, and buckle). Essentially, the forage cap, described by some troops as &quot;shapeless as a feedbag&quot;, was a less-expensive and more comfortable version of the earlier shako with the stiffening removed. The forage cap became the most common form of cap worn by U.S. regulars and volunteers during the American Civil War, though it is most commonly associated with the eastern theater of the war, since western troops generally preferred broad-brimmed felt hats (see photos of Sherman&#x27;s army parading through Washington D.C. at war&#x27;s end). Some Union units wore coloured variants, as some illustrative examples show:

*14th New York State Militia (from Brooklyn) – dark blue base, red sides, dark blue top, red circular insert
*12th New York Infantry – red base, grey sides, red top, white piping and later – dark blue base, light blue top and sides, white piping
*11th Indiana Infantry – all red cap
*United States Cavalry – Dark blue with a yellow base.
*U.S. Sharpshooters – dark green (also used forage caps)

While some Confederate troops wore the forage cap (Confederate General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson wore the plain dark blue round-visored forage cap from his days as an instructor at the Virginia Military Institute), Confederate uniform regulations specified a French-style kepi. These were to be trimmed as follows:

*Confederate Regulars:
**1st pattern
***Infantry – light blue base, grey sides and top
***Cavalry – yellow base, grey sides and top
***Artillery – red base, grey sides and top
**2nd pattern
***Infantry – dark blue base, light blue sides and top
***Cavalry – dark blue base, yellow sides and top
***Artillery – dark blue base, red sides and top

The regulations were often ignored because of the scarcity of materials and the need for rapid production. The average Confederate kepi usually was a simple gray or butternut cap made of wool or jean wool. To save leather for shoes and accoutrements, by mid-war Confederate kepi brims often were made of tarred cloth; chinstraps were sometimes omitted. Many Confederate units wore unique versions of the kepi. These included:

*Winchester Zouave Cadets (of South Carolina) – all red
*Kentucky Brigade cavalry – all yellow
*Alexandria Rifles (of Virginia) – dark green

After the war the U.S. Army issued a series of kepi undress caps, characterised by their increasing smartness and decreasing practicality. The last model was issued in 1896. When the United States introduced a revised blue dress uniform in 1902, the kepi was discontinued in favour of a conventional visor cap with wide top and a steep visor.

The US Army&#x27;s and Air Force&#x27;s current patrol cap, the standard covers in utility uniforms (the ACU and ABU, respectively), is a variation of the flat-topped, visored kepi. Its modern lineage can be traced to World War II, and during the Cold War period was &quot;blocked&quot; with heavy starching and ironing (referred to as a &quot;Ridgeway cap&quot;). It was replaced with a flat kepi-style cap with a metal rim reinforced crown and baseball cap-styled rounded visor during the Vietnam War. The present-day patrol cap was introduced in the 1980s with the transition to the M81 BDU uniforms, and was retained when the Army adopted the UCP digital-pattern camouflage uniforms in 2005; and with the Air Force&#x27;s adoption of the ABU in 2007.

==South America==
During the Paraguayan War between Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay versus Paraguay — the Brazilian, Argentine, and Uruguayan troops and officers primarily wore kepis, though many Brazilian troops wore brimmed hats, and Uruguayan and Argentine light infantry wore shakos. The Paraguayans mostly wore leather shakos, but senior officers were given kepis. Leather kepis were however issued as a forage cap to Paraguayan troops, and because of poor supply standards, were often seen in combat.

With the exception noted below, the Chilean Army no longer wears kepis, but during the War of the Pacific, it was part of the standard army uniform. Similarly, the kepi is no longer worn by the modern Peruvian armed forces and police, but was part of the uniforms worn during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Today, the following ceremonial units in several countries still use the kepi:

* in Chile, the 4th Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment &quot;Chacabuco&quot; and the 1st Historical Company of the 4th Mechanized Infantry Brigade &quot;Rancagua&quot;;
* in Peru, the &quot;Fanning Marine Company&quot; of the Peruvian Navy; and the National Police of Peru&#x27;s &quot;Guards Inspector Mariano Santos Company&quot;. Both retain the War of the Pacific uniforms, respectively, of the Peruvian Navy and the Civil Guards of Peru. A Peruvian Army company has recently adopted the kepi and white uniforms worn by the 2nd Infantry Battalion &quot;Zepita&quot; — a style used during the War of the Pacific — for public parades.
* The Bolivian Colorados Regiment (1st Infantry) and the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Regiments of the Bolivian Army, together with cadets of the Army NCO School, also wear the kepi as part of their full dress uniforms on major ceremonial occasions.
* The Paraguayan Army Presidential Guard Regiment, together with the Army Headquarters, have platoons dressed in the Paraguayan War uniforms complete with black kepis.

The Argentine National Gendarmerie (Gendarmería Nacional Argentina; GNA) members wears a green kepi as part of fatigue and full dress uniforms.

==Military/police usage elsewhere==

The practical nature and relatively low cost of the kepi made it a popular military headdress from the mid-nineteenth century on. Many Latin American armies wore kepis in the late 19th and early 20th centuries which were close copies of the French model. Other armies that favoured kepis during the final period of colourful uniforms that ended with World War I included the Danish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian (officers only), and Romanian armies. Even the Japanese Army adopted French-style kepis for senior officers in full dress, as well as for their Gendarmerie units and military bands. Significantly such historic opponents of France as Germany and Britain, avoided the use of kepis, with only a few short-lived exceptions, such as for service in India during the 1850s-60s. During this time the Albert shako was preferred. This may have been for practical rather than patriotic reasons, as the distinctive profile of the kepi would be likely to lead to confusion in battle.

===Belgium===
Influenced by France&#x27;s adoption of the kepi, Belgium introduced it in 1845 as a forage cap for infantry other ranks. This headdress was worn until 1868 when a new model without a vizor was adopted. Officers of infantry and cavalry regiments wore their own version of the kepi from 1859 until the First World War.
It was modified several times over the decades, the last version being the 1900/1910 model. By that time it had evolved into a comparatively tall cylinder with the national emblem at the front and a cross-shaped Austrian knot on the crown. The wearer&#x27;s rank was indicated by a system of horizontal and vertical bands of gold or silver braid. The kepi was also worn by officers of the General Staff.

In September 1914 the wide range of peacetime headdresses (shakos, busbies, &quot;Corsican&quot; caps, czapkas and bearskins) still being worn by the Belgian Army, were replaced by the universal &quot;Yser&quot; kepi. This consisted of a dark blue or green soft cap with folding double flaps.
With the adoption of a British-style khaki uniform from 1915, the kepi was abandoned in favour of the peaked cap for all ranks,
with the exception of the paramilitary &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;, who continued to wear the kepi as part of their parade dress until the 1960s.

===Denmark===
Used by all soldiers of the Danish army until World War II, it is now only retained as part of the full dress uniforms for officers.

===Germany===

In Nazi Germany, the brown stiff kepi () of Hitler&#x27;s Brownshirt Stormtroopers (SA, ) and its black version initially worn by the members of the SS (before it was replaced by a peaked cap) were derived from surplus Austrian equipment.

===Greece===
The Hellenic Army and the paramilitary Hellenic Gendarmerie historically followed French patterns in organization, doctrine, and dress since its establishment. A dark blue (green for cavalry) kepi was adopted in the 1860s, and used until khaki field uniforms were introduced in 1910, whereupon it remained in use in ceremonial uniforms. The 1915 pattern uniform adopted a German-inspired peaked cap instead, but after Greece&#x27;s entry in World War I, the Greek military was re-equipped by the French, and the kepi returned to use. It was retained as part of both field and ceremonial uniforms until the adoption of British-style uniforms in 1937. Ceremonial use continued in the No.1 gala uniform until the early 1970s. In the post-1974 Third Hellenic Republic, it is used exclusively by the officer instructors and cadets of the Hellenic Army Academy (in blue), by the cadets of the NCO Academy, and by the honour guards of the Ministry of National Defence (in blue). 

As a result of the historical military usage, the kepi is still widely used by uniformed marching bands in Greece. 

===India===

In India, during the French colonial rule of Pondicherry, Yanam, Karaikal and Mahé, kepis were worn by two kinds of policemen, the Armed and the Indigenous, differentiated by the colour of the kepis they wore. While the law and order forces wore bright red caps, the armed constabulary was conspicuous by its blue kepis. After Indian Independence, the former French colonial territory was integrated into the Union Territory of Puducherry and the bright red kepi continues to be the headgear of the constabulary — both for the local and the armed police signifying the cultural and administrative legacies left by the former colonialists.

===Iran===
In Iran this kind of headdress was known as the &quot;Pahlavi hat&quot; (kolah pahlavi, کلاه پهلوی). Only worn for a brief period, from 1927 until the 1930s, it was generally of a grey color.

===Italy===
The kepi was the main headdress in the Italian Army from its constitution to 1933, in both ceremonial and field uniforms. It had different degrees of markings for branch or unit, and rank. From its traditional blue, rigid shape, the kepi evolved in 1909 a field version, more comfortable and in the Army&#x27;s traditional &#x27;grigioverde&#x27; (gray-green), with increasingly less visible markings. Since then, it was gradually substituted with the more comfortable side cap and later - during the Second World War - the beret; the kepi remains standard issue with historical uniforms for both the Army and the Police, especially for musicians and education institutions, as part of their ceremonial dress.

===Latvia===
In modern ceremonial dress the Latvian National Armed Forces Staff Battalion and musicians of the Central Military Band of the Latvian National Armed Forces both wear backward sloping kepis of the style worn by the Belgian Army immediately prior to World War I.

===Luxembourg===
Kepis with a slightly higher back were formerly worn by the Luxembourg Army until 1945. Since World War II they were replaced by British Army-style peak caps.

The same kepis with higher back were also worn by the former Grand Ducal Gendarmerie in a blue version corresponding to the colour of their uniforms.

The kepi is still used by the newly created Grand Ducal Police which replaced the Gendarmerie and the local police forces in 2000.

===Northern Ireland===
A form of kepi is worn by female officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It was formerly worn in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

===Norway===
The Norwegian armed forces used kepis until World War II and still retain them as part of the full dress of officer cadets.

===Spain===
In Spain, a version of the kepi (actually a low shako), the &quot;ros&quot;, is used by the &quot;Guardia Real&quot; (Royal Guard) and the &quot;Regimiento de Infantería Inmemorial del Rey&quot; for ceremonial functions. The Spanish 1887 regulation kepi or Teresiana was made of black oilcloth with a tortoise shell visor. A plainer form of kepi was retained by the Civil Guard as its non-ceremonial headdress for normal police duties, until it was abolished under the 2011 revised regulations and replaced by a baseball cap.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the kepi has been used with several uniform types for the Swedish Army. The most common was the grey kepi worn as part of the M1923 field uniform and the dark blue kepi worn as part of the uniform types m/1886 and m/1895, and still in use by the Life Guards.

===Switzerland===

In Switzerland, the kepi was worn as a part of the dress uniforms of senior NCOs (Sergeant major and above) and officers (with additional rank insignia) until the 1995 army reform (Swiss Armed Forces). Since then, it has only been worn by senior staff officers (Brigadier general and higher).
===Thailand===

In Thailand,The Royal Thai Police Cadet Academy (RPCA) has adopted the culture of wearing the Kepi cap of the Gendarmerie police since about 1902 CE onwards. the kepi cap has been used with the study uniform and casual attire of police cadets at the RPCA.

== Non-military use ==

Kepis also found their way into the uniforms of numerous railway and streetcar operators in the United States. From there it was adopted by other public transport operators around the world, including the examples given below:
*in Brisbane, Australia, drivers and conductors continued to wear distinctive white kepis with black visors until 1961. Brisbane bus inspectors continued to wear black kepis with decorative braid until the introduction of a blue version in 1987. Brisbane Transport finally replaced inspectors’ kepis in 1995, although as of 2006 they could still be worn at official functions.
*Belgian Railways conductors (but not train drivers or other personnel) wear a kepi as part of their daily uniform.
*Train dispatchers (&quot;Pengatur Perjalanan Kereta Api&quot;/&quot;PPKA&quot;) of the Indonesian Railways wear a red kepi as part of their uniform.
*A form of kepi modeled on the Austrian ski-cap was the standard headgear of uniformed British Rail male employees from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.
*A round peak-less cap with an outline resemblance to a kepi is also worn by traditional student fraternities () in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium. They come in different varieties and are very colorful in appearance.
*In the United States, the Nation of Islam&#x27;s security/executive protection force, the Fruit of Islam, also wears a dark blue version of the kepi.

<text>British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace.

==History==
British Aerospace was created in April 1977 by the merger of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation.

===Formation===
There were two companies in the formation:
* BAC (Guided Weapons)
* Hawker Siddeley Dynamics

The missile, weapon systems and space businesses of these companies were merged into British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL), a wholly owned subsidiary of BAe.

In December 1979, Euromissile Dynamics Group was formed with Aérospatiale of Toulouse, France and MBB of Ottobrunn.

===Subsidiary company===
On 1 January 1992, British Aerospace Defence Ltd began trading as a wholly owned subsidiary of BAe. Previously separate defence companies now operated as divisions of that subsidiary:
* British Aerospace (Dynamics) Ltd
* British Aerospace (Military Aircraft) Ltd,
* Royal Ordnance plc
* British Aerospace Systems and Services Division (BAe SSD)

In 1994, the BAe Dynamics subsidiary British Aerospace Space Systems was sold to Matra Marconi Space.

===Merger with Matra===
In 1996, BAe Dynamics&#x27; guided weapons division was merged with a division of Matra Defense to form the then largest European missile manufacturer, Matra BAe Dynamics. This group now forms part of MBDA.

==Products==
===Missiles===
* ALARM (missile), built with Marconi Space and Defence Systems
* Rapier (missile) SAM, designed earlier by BAC (Guided Weapons), and developed with Marconi Space and Defence Systems (the Blindfire radar), and was superior to the comparative Roland
* Sea Dart (missile), designed earlier by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics
* Sea Eagle (missile) ASM
* Sea Skua ASM
* Sea Wolf (missile) SAM
* Skyflash AAM

===Satellites===
* Giotto (spacecraft), approached Halley&#x27;s Comet in March 1986 (made at Filton)
* Orbital Test Satellite
* Skynet (satellite), built with MSDS

<doc id="588330" wikidata="Q978423" url="?curid=588330" title="Hardening (computing)">
<text>In computer security, hardening is usually the process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface, which is larger when a system performs more functions; in principle a single-function system is more secure than a multipurpose one. Reducing available ways of attack typically includes changing default passwords, the removal of unnecessary software, unnecessary usernames or logins, and the disabling or removal of unnecessary services.

Hardening measures can include setting up intrusion prevention systems, disabling accounts, reducing file system permissions and using encrypted network connections.

== Binary hardening ==

Binary hardening is a security technique in which binary executables are analyzed and modified to protect against common exploits. Binary hardening is independent of compilers and involves the entire toolchain. For example, one binary hardening technique is to detect potential buffer overflows and to substitute the existing code with safer code. The advantage of manipulating binaries is that vulnerabilities in legacy code can be fixed automatically without the need for source code, which may be unavailable or obfuscated. Secondly, the same techniques can be applied to binaries from multiple compilers, some of which may be less secure than others.

Binary hardening often involves the non-deterministic modification of control flow and instruction addresses so as to prevent attackers from successfully reusing program code to perform exploits. Common hardening techniques are:

* Buffer overflow protection
* Stack overwriting protection
* Position independent executables and address space layout randomization
* Binary stirring (randomizing the address of basic blocks)
* Pointer masking (protection against code injection)
* Control flow randomization (to protect against control flow diversion)

<doc id="588348" wikidata="Q1624024" url="?curid=588348" title="R38-class airship">
<text>The R.38&quot; class(also known as the A&quot; class) of rigid airships was designed for Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy during the final months of the First World War, intended for long-range patrol duties over the North Sea. Four similar airships were originally ordered by the Admiralty, but orders for three of these (&quot;R.39&quot;, &quot;R.40&quot; and &quot;R.41&quot;) were cancelled after the armistice with Germany and &quot;R.38&quot;, the lead ship of the class, was sold to the United States Navy in October 1919 before completion.

On 24 August 1921, &quot;R.38&quot; (designated ZR-2 by the USN) was destroyed by a structural failure while in flight over the city of Hull. It crashed into the Humber Estuary, killing 44 out of the 49 crew aboard and one black cat named Snowball. At the time of its first flight it was the world&#x27;s largest airship. Its destruction was the first of the great airship disasters, followed by the Italian-built US semi-rigid airship &quot;Roma&quot; in 1922 (34 dead), the French &quot;Dixmude&quot; in 1923 (52 dead), the USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; in 1925 (14 dead), the British R101 in 1930 (48 dead), the in 1933 (73 dead), the USS &quot;Macon&quot; in 1935 (2 dead), and the German &quot;Hindenburg&quot; in 1937 (36 dead).

==Design and development==
The &quot;R.38&quot; class was designed to meet an Admiralty requirement of June 1918 for an airship capable of patrolling for six days at ranges of up to 300 miles from home base and altitudes of up to 22,000 ft (6,700 m). A heavy load of armaments was specified, to allow the airship to be used to escort surface vessels. Design work was carried out by an Admiralty team led by Constructor-Commander C. I. R. Campbell, of the Royal Corps of Navy Constructors. The construction contract was awarded to Short Brothers in September 1918 but cancelled on 31 January 1919 before work had been started. It was then re-ordered on 17 February: on the same day, Oswald Short was informed that the Cardington, Bedfordshire works, recently built as a specialised airship production facility, was to be nationalised. Construction of &quot;R.38&quot; started at Cardington in February 1919. It was intended to follow &quot;R.38&quot; with orders for three airships of the same class: &quot;R.39&quot;, identical to &quot;R.38&quot;, to be built by Armstrong-Whitworth, and two others, &quot;R.40&quot; and &quot;R.41&quot;, of a design variant with the length reduced to 690 ft (210.31 m) due to the limited size of existing manufacturing sheds. The Armistice coupled with the assignment of airships from the admiralty to the Royal Air Force and a decision to nationalize the Shorts airship plant into the Royal Airship Works confused the matter of whom was responsible for what. Constructor-Commander Campbell became both Manager and Chief Designer of the Royal Airship Works.

Later in 1919, several airship orders were cancelled as a peacetime economy measure, including the three planned &quot;R.38&quot; class ships. In a further round of cutbacks, the cancellation of the unfinished &quot;R.38&quot; also appeared imminent, but, before this actually happened, the project was offered to the United States. The United States Navy demanded significant changes in the airship including modification to the bow in order to allow mooring to a mast, access to the mast from the keel and the addition of weight to the stern to ensure balance.

The hull contained 14 hydrogen-filled gasbags. The 13-sided mainframes were apart, and were made up of diamond-shaped trusses connected by 13 main and 12 secondary longitudinal girders and a trapezoidal keel. There were two secondary ring frames between each pair of mainframes. The forward-mounted control car was directly attached to the hull. The cruciform tail surfaces were unbraced cantilevers and carried aerodynamically balanced elevators and rudders. The six Sunbeam Cossack engines, each driving a two-bladed pusher propeller, were housed in individual cars arranged as three pairs: one pair aft of the control car, one pair amidships, and the third pair aft.

== Sale to United States ==
The United States Navy had decided that it wanted to add rigid airships to its fleet and originally hoped to get two Zeppelins as part of war reparations, but these had been deliberately destroyed by their crews in 1919 in actions connected with the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow. An order was placed with the Zeppelin company for a new craft, to be paid for by the Germans (which became USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot;), and, to go with it, they also planned to build one in the United States (which became USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;). With the news of the impending termination of &quot;R.38&quot;″s construction, the possibility of taking over the project was investigated. An agreement was reached in October 1919 for its purchase for £300,000, and work on the airship was resumed. As work progressed the US Navy began checking the documentation given them by the British. Following significant girder failures during testing Commander Jerome Hunsacker and Charles Burgess raised questions over the strength of &quot;R.38&quot;. Burgess concluded that &quot;This investigation indicates that the transverses of the R.38 are only just strong enough, &quot;and have no factor of safety&quot;.

==Operational history==

The airship was to be given a curtailed series of tests before being handed over to the U.S. Navy, who would fly it across the Atlantic. J. E. M. Pritchard, the officer in charge of flight testing, proposed to carry out 100 hours of flight testing, including flights in rough weather, followed by 50 more flown by an American crew before crossing the Atlantic. The commander of the Howden Detachment Commander Maxfield disagreed and urged that the test of R.38 be completed in one day. Air Commodore Edward Maitland as the man most responsible for testing the R.38 was appalled and disagreed. He protested the abbreviated test schedule. He was told to not provide advice unless asked. The Air Ministry ruled that 50 hours would be sufficient. The decision had been made in ignorance by officials unfamiliar with airships as well as the knowledgeable officers who were reluctant to release an airship of unproven strength, egged on by an eagerness to return to America by Commander Maxfield.

The &quot;R.38&quot; made its first flight on 23–24 June 1921, when it flew registered as R.38 but bearing the US designation ZR-2; the seven-hour flight revealed problems with over-balance of the control surfaces. With the balance area of the top rudder reduced, a second test flight was carried out on 17–18 July. The control balance problem remained, and, on return to Cardington, all the control surfaces were reduced in area. On 17–18 July, a third flight was made, during which the airship was flown from Cardington to Howden and then out over the North Sea, where the speed was increased to , causing the ship to begin hunting over a range of around . The highly experienced Pritchard took over the controls from the American coxswain and reduced the oscillation, but several girders in the vicinity of the midship engine cars had already failed. The control surfaces were still over balanced. More importantly girders of intermediate frame 7b as well as longitudinal Girder F had failed in one place, while frame 7a and longitudinal F&#x27; each had failed in two locations. R.38 returned to Howden at reduced speed. Work on reinforcing the buckled girders was carried out and completed by 30 July at Howden. There were increasing doubts being expressed about the design, including some made by Air Commodore E. M. Maitland, the very experienced commander of the Howden base. Maitland urged that all future speed trials be conducted at higher altitude as was the practice of the Germans while testing the fragile Zeppelins upon which the R.38 design was based. There was considerable concern expressed by Admiral Griffen, the chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering. Burgess at the Bureau of Construction and Repair was also concerned. Starr Truscott of the Bureau of Construction and Repairs believed that the negative endorsements of Admirals Griffin and Taylor would suffice to extend trials for the ZR-2 (R.38) but he was soon proven wrong. Admiral Taylor endorsed Commander Maxfield&#x27;s optimistic report of July 20. Truscott later came to accept that decision writing &quot;We must accept ship as per British practice, i.e., if acceptable to Air Ministry it must be to us. Question of starting flight is up to people in England.&quot;

===Fatal crash===
Following a spell of bad weather, the airship was walked out on 23 August and, in the early morning, took off for its fourth flight, which had an intended destination of RNAS Pulham in Norfolk, where it could be moored to a mast (a facility unavailable at Howden). The mooring, however, proved impossible because of low cloud, so the airship returned to sea for the night. The next day, after a brief speed trial (during which a speed of was reached), a series of turning trials was started at a speed of and an altitude of . Passing over Hull, a series of control reversals were started which the Germans would never have attempted at such a low altitude. Wann, who was in the control gondola, stated that the controls were never put beyond 15 degrees, while Bateman, from the National Physical Laboratory who was recording pressures upon the vertical fins, stated clearly that the rudders were being driven rapidly from hard over to hard over which would have been 25 degrees from one side to 25 degrees to the other. At 17:37, while close offshore near Hull and watched by thousands of spectators, the structure failed amidships. Eyewitnesses reported seeing creases diagonally along the hull towards the stern. Both ends drooped. The R.38 then cracked open with men and objects dropping from the rupture. The two sections separated with the forward section catching fire followed by two colossal explosions. The two explosions broke windows over a large area with the flaming fore section falling rapidly followed by the aft section descending slowly. The remains fell into the shallow waters of the Humber Estuary. 16 of the 17 Americans, and 28 of the 32 Britons, in the crew were killed, including both Maitland and Pritchard. The only American to survive was Rigger Norman Otto Walker. Four of those who survived were in the tail section, Flight Lieutenant Archibald Herbert Wann, R.38&#x27;s British Commanding Officer, was in the control gondola and survived.

A memorial was erected at Hull, and in 2021, a centenary memorial service was held at Hull Minster.

===Aftermath===

The loss of the R.38, which represented the hope of airship men in Britain, resulted in three official enquiries into the disaster. The first, chaired by Air Vice-Marshal Sir John Salmond and composed mainly of RAF personnel, was convened on 27 August. Its remit was to consider the general circumstances of the accident, and, although it came to the conclusion that the structure had failed while extreme control forces were being exerted, it was considered necessary to carry out a more detailed technical inquiry into the airship&#x27;s design. The report also criticized the system by which a single authority was responsible both for the airship&#x27;s construction and for inspection of the work, and, given the great differences between R.38 and previous British designs, held that the design should have been subjected to a more thorough scrutiny.

The Admiralty held a second inquiry into the history of the design of the airship, and into its construction up to the point where it was taken over from the Admiralty by the Air Ministry. In contrast to the previous inquiry, this one concluded that the design did not incorporate any new features which affected the airship&#x27;s strength, and further maintained that &quot;there was at the time no body in existence which could have been called in to advise on the structural strength of R.38.&quot;

The technical Committee of Enquiry, chaired by Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman, concluded that no allowance had been made for aerodynamic stresses in the design, and that while no loads had been placed on the structure during testing that would not have been met in normal use, the effects of the manoeuvres made had weakened the hull. No blame was attached to anyone, as this was not part of the committee&#x27;s remit.

The R.38 disaster led to a rigorous investigation of the structure of airships preceding the design of the next two airships built in Britain, the R.100 and the more radical R.101. What is curious is that the practice of having responsibility for design and ultimately judging the airworthiness of that design remained in the same hands.
Nevil Shute Norway (who was the novelist Nevil Shute) worked on the design of the R.100 airship for Vickers Ltd. from 1924. When he researched previous airship calculations and read the reports of the 1921 R.38 crash he was &quot;unable to believe the words he was reading&quot; that &quot;the civil servants concerned had made no attempt to calculate the aerodynamic forces ... &quot; and he asked one of his chiefs &quot;if this could possibly be true. Not only did he confirm it but he pointed out that no one had been sacked over it or even suffered any censure.&quot; For the men who built the R.38 its sale to the US Navy represented a last chance to salvage something from the Royal Navy&#x27;s rigid airship program and its takeover and abandonment by the RAF. The demands of the Exchequer and the US Navy&#x27;s commander Maxwell converged to cause risks to be taken which were questioned at the time and ignored with fatal consequences.

==Specifications (&quot;R.38&quot;/ZR-2)==

== R.38 Memorial Prize ==
In December 1922, the Council of the Royal Aeronautical Society decided to offer an annual prize for technical papers on airships, open to international competition. This would be known as the R.38 Memorial Prize. The first R.38 Memorial Prize was awarded to C.P. Burgess, Jerome Hunsacker, and Starr Truscott who presented their paper &quot;The Strength of Rigid Airships.&quot;

<text>In the theory of algebraic groups, a Borel subgroup of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; is a maximal Zariski closed and connected solvable algebraic subgroup. For example, in the general linear group &quot;GLn&quot; (&quot;n x n&quot; invertible matrices), the subgroup of invertible upper triangular matrices is a Borel subgroup.

For groups realized over algebraically closed fields, there is a single conjugacy class of Borel subgroups.

Borel subgroups are one of the two key ingredients in understanding the structure of simple (more generally, reductive) algebraic groups, in Jacques Tits&#x27; theory of groups with a (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) pair. Here the group &quot;B&quot; is a Borel subgroup and &quot;N&quot; is the normalizer of a maximal torus contained in &quot;B&quot;.

The notion was introduced by Armand Borel, who played a leading role in the development of the theory of algebraic groups.

==Parabolic subgroups==
Subgroups between a Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; and the ambient group &quot;G&quot; are called parabolic subgroups. 
Parabolic subgroups &quot;P&quot; are also characterized, among algebraic subgroups, by the condition that &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is a complete variety. 
Working over algebraically closed fields, the Borel subgroups turn out to be the minimal parabolic subgroups in this sense. Thus &quot;B&quot; is a Borel subgroup when the homogeneous space &quot;G/B&quot; is a complete variety which is &quot;as large as possible&quot;.

For a simple algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, the set of conjugacy classes of parabolic subgroups is in bijection with the set of all subsets of nodes of the corresponding Dynkin diagram; the Borel subgroup corresponds to the empty set and &quot;G&quot; itself corresponding to the set of all nodes. (In general, each node of the Dynkin diagram determines a simple negative root and thus a one-dimensional &#x27;root group&#x27; of &quot;G&quot;. A subset of the nodes thus yields a parabolic subgroup, generated by &quot;B&quot; and the corresponding negative root groups. Moreover, any parabolic subgroup is conjugate to such a parabolic subgroup.) The corresponding subgroups of the Weyl group of &quot;G&quot; are also called parabolic subgroups, see Parabolic subgroup of a reflection group.

== Example ==
Let formula_1. A Borel subgroup formula_2 of formula_3 is the set of upper triangular matricesformula_4and the maximal proper parabolic subgroups of formula_3 containing formula_2 areformula_7Also, a maximal torus in formula_2 isformula_9This is isomorphic to the algebraic torus formula_10.

==Lie algebra==

For the special case of a Lie algebra formula_11 with a Cartan subalgebra formula_12, given an ordering of formula_12, the Borel subalgebra is the direct sum of formula_12 and the weight spaces of formula_11 with positive weight. A Lie subalgebra of formula_11 containing a Borel subalgebra is called a parabolic Lie algebra.

<text>The Dornier Do 24 is a 1930s German three-engine flying boat designed by the Dornier Flugzeugwerke for maritime patrol and search and rescue. A total of 279 were built among several factories from 1937 to 1945.

==Design and development==

The Dornier Do 24 was designed to meet a Royal Netherlands Navy requirement for a replacement of the Dornier Wals being used by its Naval Aviation Service in the Dutch East Indies, with the Netherlands government signing a contract for six Dornier Do 24s on 3 August 1936. Two more prototypes were built for the German navy to be evaluated against the Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138.

The Do 24 was an all-metal parasol monoplane with a broad-beamed hull and stabilising sponsons. Twin tails were mounted on the upswept rear of the hull, while three wing-mounted tractor configuration engines powered the aircraft. Fuel was carried in tanks in the sponsons and the wing centre section. Up to of bombs could be carried under the aircraft&#x27;s wings, while defensive armament consisted of three gun turrets, one each in nose, dorsal and tail positions. In early aircraft the turrets were each fitted with a machine gun but later aircraft carried a 20 mm cannon in the dorsal turret. The Do 24 was one of the few German Luftwaffe aircraft that featured a tail turret.
Do 24 V3, the first of the Dutch X boats, as they would be called in Dutch service, took off from Lake Constance on 3 July 1937, with the second Dutch boat, Do 24 V4 following soon after. As the Dutch required that their flying boats use the same engines as the Martin 139 bombers in use in the Dutch East Indies, they were fitted with Wright R-1820-F52 Cyclone radial engines. Test results were good, with the new flying boat proving capable of operating from extremely rough open seas and the Dutch placed an order for a further 12 Do 24s on 22 July 1937. Do 24 V1, the first of the two aircraft for Germany, powered by three Junkers Jumo 205C diesel engines, flew on 10 January 1938 but after evaluation, the two German boats were returned to Dornier for storage.

The Netherlands was enthusiastic and planned to purchase as many as 90. Of these, 30 were to be built by Dornier (with all but the first two prototypes assembled by Dornier&#x27;s Swiss subsidiary based at Altenrhein). The remaining aircraft were to be built under licence in the Netherlands by Aviolanda at Papendrecht. Of these aircraft, all but one of the German and Swiss built aircraft and the first seven Aviolanda-built aircraft were to be Do 24K-1s, powered by the original R-1820-F52 engines, while the remaining aircraft were to be Do 24K-2s, with more powerful R-1820-G102 engines and additional fuel.

With the German occupation, production was paused, however while the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Küstenfliegergruppen Maritime reconnaissance branch was uninterested in the partially completed aircraft as they had already chosen the Blohm und Voss Bv 138 for the role, the Dutch production line resumed, to provide aircraft for the otherwise poorly equipped &quot;Seenotdienst&quot; (Sea Emergency Service), which was still operating Heinkel He 59 biplanes. The 13 airframes on the Aviolanda assembly line were completed with Dutch-bought Wright Cyclone engines but later models used the BMW Bramo 323R-2. An additional 159 Do 24s were built in the Netherlands during the occupation, most under the designation Do 24T-1.

Another production line for the Do 24 was established in the CAMS factory at Sartrouville, France, during the German occupation. This line was operated by SNCAN and produced 48 Do 24s during the war and another 40 after the liberation of France, which served with the French Navy until 1952.

==Operational history==

=== Australia ===
Of the six Do-24K aircraft that Australia obtained, five served with No. 41 Squadron RAAF, performing transport, reconnaissance and rescue missions in Australia and New Guinea. Due to the lack of maintenance equipment and spare parts, the aircraft were frequently unserviceable while awaiting repairs. One aircraft was lost to a fire in March 1944, and the remaining aircraft were placed in long term storage by June 1944.

A Do-24k engine is on display at Broome Airport. The plaque states that the flying boat was destroyed by an attack of 9 Japanese Zeros in Roebuck Bay and Broome Airport on 3rd March 1942.:File:Broome_Airport_Engine_Display_Plaque.jpg

=== Germany ===
The two prototypes were used during the invasion of Norway to transport troops to Narvik.

The aircraft captured and produced in the Netherlands were pressed into service with &quot;Seenotstaffeln&quot; and deployed in the Arctic, Baltic, North Sea, Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean, and Black Sea. They were also used as transports, notably for keeping contact with the troops left behind on the Aegean Islands and Crete, and for supporting the Kuban bridgehead in early 1943.

=== Netherlands ===
Thirty-seven Dutch- and German-built Do 24s had been sent to the East Indies by the time of the German occupation of the Netherlands in June 1940. Until the outbreak of war, these aircraft would have flown the tri-color roundel. Later, to avoid confusion with British or French roundels, Dutch aircraft flew a black-bordered orange triangle insignia. 

A Dutch Dornier Do 24 is credited with sinking the Japanese destroyer &quot;Shinonome&quot; on 17 December 1941 while the ship was escorting an invasion fleet to Miri in British Borneo. After the Japanese invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, six surviving Do 24s were transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1942. They served in the RAAF through most of 1944 as transports in New Guinea.

=== Spain ===
In 1944, 12 Dutch-built Do 24s were delivered to Spain with the understanding that they would assist downed airmen of both sides. After the war, a few French-built Do 24s also found their way to Spain. Spanish Do 24s were operational at least until 1967, and possibly later. In 1971, one of the last flying Spanish Do 24s was returned to the Dornier facility on Lake Constance for permanent display.

=== Sweden ===
On 31 October 1944, a German Do 24 (CM+RY of &quot;Seenotgruppe&quot; 81) made a forced landing in neutral Sweden, was impounded and eventually bought, and remained in Swedish service until 1952.

<doc id="588372" wikidata="Q2344349" url="?curid=588372" title="2002 Dutch general election">
<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 15 May 2002. The elections were amongst the most dramatic in Dutch history, not just in terms of the electoral results, as they were completely overshadowed by the assassination of leader Pim Fortuyn only nine days before election day.

Fortuyn had led the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, a right-wing populist party that represented his political views. He had drawn controversy in the campaign with his views on Islam, attacked the government&#x27;s immigration policies and had also questioned many aspects of government by the previous &#x27;purple&#x27; cabinets of Wim Kok, which he blamed for everything from crime to waiting lists in health services. After his death, the LPF made its general election debut with 17% of the vote, coming in second place. The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), which took a neutral stance towards Fortuyn, gained seats to become the country&#x27;s largest political party. On the other hand, the three parties in the government all lost a significant number of seats.

Two months after the election Jan Peter Balkenende formed his first cabinet, with a coalition of the CDA, the LPF and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). However, the LPF was unstable due to its lack of strong leadership and its members&#x27; lack of experience; this resulted in the new cabinet resigning before the end of the year.

==Background==
Prime Minister Wim Kok had been in power since the 1994 general election in a coalition between his Labour Party (PvdA), the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and Democrats 66 (D66). The government, which won a second term in the 1998 general election, was often referred to as a &#x27;purple&#x27; coalition due to the participation of the &#x27;red&#x27; Labour Party and the &#x27;blue&#x27; VVD. During its time in power, the government had often enjoyed high approval ratings and presided over a strong economy. They had also introduced innovative social legislation, such as the introduction of same-sex marriage and euthanasia. Kok announced in December 2001 that he would retire from the premiership at the next election. Ad Melkert then replaced Kok as the party leader. The Christian Democratic Appeal, the largest opposition party, was led by newly elected leader Jan Peter Balkenende. Balkenende was at the time considered to be an interim leader who lacked charisma or experience, but his campaign would ultimately prove relatively successful.

==Campaign==
At the start of the year, Melkert and the VVD leader Hans Dijkstal appeared to be the frontrunners in the race to become prime minister. The situation changed with the arrival of the controversial politician Pim Fortuyn. Fortuyn was a critic of Islam and had questioned whether its culture was compatible with Western society even before the September 11 attacks. He was elected the leader of Liveable Netherlands in November 2001, but he was expelled from the party after making controversial comments in an interview with De Volkskrant on 9 February 2002. Fortuyn had described Islam as a &quot;backward culture&quot;, criticizing its attitude to homosexuality (he himself was openly gay). Part of the reason for the uproar was that the Dutch word for &quot;backward&quot; (&quot;achterlijk&quot;) can also be used in an insulting sense (with a similar meaning to the word &quot;retarded&quot;); Fortuyn stated he used the word in the former sense. Two days later, he formed his own party, the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) in order to contest the upcoming general election, while maintaining the leadership over the local Livable Rotterdam party.

In the 2002 municipal elections, held on 6 March, Liveable Rotterdam took 35% of the vote in the city of Rotterdam, a city with a high immigrant population. They formed the city&#x27;s first non-Labour government since the Second World War. In the same month, he released the book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (&quot;The Wreckage of eight purple years&quot;) criticising the record of the governing coalition. &quot;The Economist&quot; described the rise in support for Fortuyn as a shock for the Dutch political establishment and their traditional system of consensus.

The government resigned on 16 April - only a month before polling day - after the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation published the &quot;&quot; report, criticizing the Dutch government&#x27;s handling of the events that led to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. However, the ministers remained in office as a caretaker government until after the elections and the formation of the next government, and the date of the election was not changed.

On 6 May, Fortuyn was assassinated in Hilversum by Volkert van der Graaf. Months later, Van der Graaf stated his motivation was his belief that Fortuyn was exploiting Muslims as &quot;scapegoats&quot; and targeting &quot;the weak members of society&quot; in seeking political power. The murder was a shock to the Netherlands; it was denounced by Kok and other Dutch politicians and other national leaders. It was the country&#x27;s first political assassination in modern times.

==Opinion polls==

==Result==
The great losers of the election were Labour Party, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democrats 66, the coalition parties of the &#x27;purple&#x27; cabinets. Especially the Labour Party under the technocratic leadership of Ad Melkert suffered a landslide defeat.

The Christian Democratic Appeal was the surprising winner of the election, gaining 14 seats (from 29 to 43) and becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives. This success is in part owed to its new leader Jan Peter Balkenende, who went on to become prime minister, and to its neutral attitude in the debate with Fortuyn, not having participated in the supposed ‘demonization’ by the political Left.

Fortuyn&#x27;s former party Livable Netherlands also contested the election. While they had been overshadowed by Fortuyn, they also entered the House of Representatives, winning 2 seats.

The 15 May 2002 election was the beginning of a year of political chaos in the Netherlands following the LPF leader&#x27;s assassination on 6 May the same year. The power vacuum resulted in violent internal conflicts in LPF, which eventually led to the fall of the first Balkenende cabinet (CDA-LPF-VVD), which governed from 22 July 2002 to 16 October 2002. The CDA once again became a coalition party after eight years in opposition (1994–2002) in a government which, however, became the shortest-ruling Dutch cabinet since the Second World War, lasting less than five months.

<doc id="588381" wikidata="Q2063424" url="?curid=588381" title="Robert A. Lovett">
<text>Robert Abercrombie Lovett (September 14, 1895May 7, 1986) was an American politician who served as the fourth United States Secretary of Defense, having been promoted to this position from Deputy Secretary of Defense. He served in the cabinet of President Harry S. Truman from 1951 to 1953 and in this capacity, directed the Korean War. As Under Secretary of State, he handled most of the tasks of the State Department while George C. Marshall was secretary.

Lovett was a core member of the group of foreign policy elders known as &quot;The Wise Men&quot;, and was deemed an &quot;architect of the cold war&quot; by social scientist G. William Domhoff, in his 1970 book, &quot;The Higher Circles: The Governing Class in America&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Lovett was born on September 14, 1895, in Huntsville, Texas, to Robert S. Lovett, president and chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad and a director of both The National City Bank of New York and Western Union.
On April 19, 1919, Lovett married debutante Adele Quartley Brown, daughter of James Brown (1863–1935), a descendant of Alexander Brown (1764—1834) and the New York Brown banking family that, in 1931, would merge with another Wall Street firm, Harriman Brothers &amp; Company, forming Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., and Adele Quartley (1866 – 1954), daughter of famed seascape painter, Arthur Quartley; the couple had two children.

==Education==
Lovett graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in 1914. He was a member of the Skull and Bones society at Yale University, where he graduated in 1918. From 1919 to 1921, Lovett undertook postgraduate studies in law, then business administration, at Harvard University.

==Career==
===Military service===
A member of the First Yale Unit, Lovett became a naval ensign during World War I. A passionate aviator, He flew with the British Naval Air Service on patrol and combat missions, and then commanded a US naval air squadron, achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. He remained interested in aeronautics, especially in European commercial and military aviation. 

===Industry===
Lovett &quot;joined his father&#x27;s banking firm in 1921,&quot; later moving to his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s banking firm, Brown Brothers Harriman, where he became a partner in 1926.

Beginning in the 1930s, Lovett was an intermittent director of Freeport Sulphur for more than 25 years.
===Politics===
In December 1940, Lovett was appointed special assistant for air affairs to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. At the same time, John J. McCloy became general assistant secretary, and Harvey H. Bundy became special assistant to the secretary of war.

In April 1941, Lovett was named assistant secretary of war for air, a position that had been vacant since Roosevelt&#x27;s 1933 inauguration. Lovett served with distinction, overseeing the massive expansion of the Army Air Forces and the procurement of huge numbers of aircraft during World War II. In awarding Lovett the Distinguished Service Medal in September 1945, President Harry Truman wrote, &quot;He has truly been the eyes, ears and hands of the Secretary of War in respect to the growth of that enormous American airpower which has astonished the world and played such a large part in bringing the war to a speedy and successful conclusion.&quot;

President Truman refused to accept the resignation of Lovett and McCloy when they and Bundy gave their resignations in September 1945. On October 22, 1945, Secretary of War Robert Patterson created the Lovett Committee, chaired by Robert A. Lovett, to advise the government on the post-World War II organization of US intelligence activities, which led to the creation of the CIA.

In December 1945, Lovett returned to Brown Brothers Harriman, only to be called back to Washington a little more than a year later to serve with General George Marshall as undersecretary of state. Through dialogue with Senator Arthur Vandenberg, he helped draft the Vandenberg resolution, which led to the establishment of NATO. Marshall was in poor health and had never been a workaholic. He turned over major responsibilities to his deputies. especially Lovett, and refused to be troubled by minutiae. By 1948, with frailties building up, Marshall&#x27;s participation was further curtailed. He said, &quot;The fact of the matter is that Lovett bears the principal burden as I get away whenever possible.&quot;

In January 1949, Lovett went back to his investment business. Marshall, however, insisted for Lovett to join him again when he took over at the Pentagon as Secretary of Defense in September 1950. As deputy secretary of defense to Marshall, Lovett again played the major role in the department&#x27;s management.

When Lovett became Secretary of Defense, the end of the Korean War was not yet in sight. His main concern continued to be the long-range rearmament program. Like Marshall, Lovett believed that the United States erred seriously at the end of World War II by disintegrating the military. He had also joined Marshall in opposing the recognition of the new state of Israel in 1948 because he thought it was contrary to long-term US strategic interests in the region.

When the Korean War unexpectedly broke out, he designed a massive rearmament program intended both to meet the demands of the limited war and to serve as a deterrent and mobilization base in future military emergencies. As Lovett put it, &quot;Heretofore this country has only had two throttle settings: one, wide-open for war, and the other, tight-shut for peace. What we are really trying to do is to find a cruising speed.&quot;

Lovett argued for large monetary budgets to carry on the Korean War and to improve US defensive strength, asking for large sums of money and arguing strenuously against additional congressional cuts, emphasizing the need to expand Army, Navy, and Marine Corps forces. He argued toward working toward a goal of 143 Air Force wings (as compared with 95 then authorized) and a larger military. Lovett did not get all that he wanted. The actual amount his department received for 1953 came to about $44.2 billion, almost $13 billion less than the previous year. He had asked for initially $71 billion, later reducing his requests to $49 billion.

Lovett&#x27;s efforts to meet rearmament and preparedness goals suffered in 1952 from a major dispute between the federal government and the steel industry. Truman tried to avert a threatened strike, caused mainly by a wage dispute, by taking over the steel mills in April 1952. The strike occurred after the Supreme Court held that Truman&#x27;s seizure order was unconstitutional. Lovett supported the president&#x27;s action as essential to maintaining defense production and expressed serious concern about the strike&#x27;s effects on the nation&#x27;s military capabilities. Even so, he noted that &quot;the last six months of 1952 saw the most significant increases in the military effectiveness of the United States since the beginning of partial mobilization.&quot;

By the end of the Truman administration, the Defense Department had met successfully the challenges of the Korean War mobilization and embarked on a long-term preparedness effort.

Besides the preparedness issue, Lovett inherited a number of other matters that were still unresolved in the early 1950s, including the proper military role of nuclear weapons. Lovett&#x27;s stands on the nuclear weapons question and other major military issues generally followed those of his predecessors. He strongly supported universal military training, regarding it as the only viable long-term approach to building a reserve force, and thus making possible a smaller regular military establishment. A firm proponent of NATO, he played an important role when the NATO Council in February 1952 adopted force goals totaling 50 divisions and 4,000 aircraft to be achieved at the end of 1952.

Despite a relatively smooth administration, Lovett felt a growing dissatisfaction with the existing defense organization. Although he recognized that real unification could result only from an evolutionary process, not from legislative edict, as the end of his term approached, he discerned the need for changes in the National Security Act beyond those made in 1949. Commenting about unification at a press conference a week before he left office, Lovett observed that the Department of Defense would have to be reorganized substantially if the United States became involved in a major conflict. He put forward his recommendations in a long letter to President Truman on November 18, 1952, proposing clarification of the secretary of defense&#x27;s relationship to the president, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the military departments; redefinition of JCS functions; reorganization of the military departments; and reorganization and redefinition of the functions of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board.

Lovett meant his recommendations for practical consideration by his successor, and they indeed played an important role in the formulation of a reorganization plan during the early months of the Eisenhower administration. Concerned about the need for an orderly post-election changeover in the Department of Defense, Lovett met several times during the transition period with the incoming secretary, Charles E. Wilson, and made sure that he was thoroughly briefed on current issues.

Lovett&#x27;s diaries while he was Under Secretary of State (1947–1949) are available in the Brown Brothers Harriman Collection, housed in the manuscripts collection at New-York Historical Society.

==Later life and death==
After Lovett left office on January 20, 1953, he returned again to Brown Brothers Harriman, where he remained active as a general partner for many years. Lovett has been recognized as one of the most capable administrators to hold the office of secretary of defense and as a perceptive critic of defense organization. His work in completing the Korean War mobilization and in planning and implementing the long-range rearmament program, as well as his proposals to restructure the Department of Defense, were among his major contributions.

But his work for the U.S. Government was not yet quite completed. By January 1956, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower persuaded Lovett to take on a part-time job with the brand new President&#x27;s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities which, years later, would become known as the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board.

Following the 1960 presidential election, Joseph P. Kennedy – who had served with Lovett on the President&#x27;s Board of Consultants – advised his son John F. Kennedy to offer Lovett any U.S. Cabinet post he might desire. Lovett graciously declined, citing health reasons. In 1963, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction. In 1964, he was awarded the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy for his service to the country.

Domhoff—who described Lovett, Harvey Bundy and John McCloy as having a close working relationship; and credited John F. Kennedy as accepting Lovett&#x27;s advice to appoint Dean Rusk as Secretary of State, Robert S. McNamara as Defense Secretary, and C. Douglas Dillon as Treasury Secretary in 1961.

Lovett died in Locust Valley, New York, on May 7, 1986, at the age of 90. He was preceded in death by his wife, Adele, on January 4, 1986. Both outlived their children, Evelyn Springer Lovett Brown (1920–1967) and Robert Scott Lovett, II (1927–1984). They were interred in Locust Valley Cemetery there.

The Department of History at Yale University, his alma mater, has the Robert A. Lovett Chair of Military and Naval History in his honor. Its current incumbent is John Lewis Gaddis, the noted historian of the Cold War.

<doc id="588384" wikidata="Q7268309" url="?curid=588384" title="Quadrangle Club">
<text>The Princeton Quadrangle Club, often abbreviated to &quot;Quad&quot;, is one of the eleven eating clubs at Princeton University that remain open. Located at 33 Prospect Avenue, the club is currently &quot;sign-in,&quot; meaning it permits any second-semester sophomore, junior or senior to join. The club&#x27;s tradition of openness is demonstrated as far back as 1970, when Quadrangle became one of the first coeducational eating clubs (Princeton University itself began admitting women in 1969, and the last eating clubs to include women did so in 1991).

==History==
The club was formed in 1896 in a house built on the south side of Prospect Avenue. In its early years, it changed its location several times. In 1901, it moved to the north side of &quot;the Street,&quot; and in 1903 it moved back to the south side, where the Princeton Tower Club now stands. In 1910 it moved to a house built in 1887 for James McCosh, the eleventh president of Princeton University. In 1915, Quadrangle Club sold the McCosh house and built its own house, designed by Henry Milliken, Princeton Class of 1905 in a classic brick Georgian Revival structure. The club has existed in this building since 1916.

F. Scott Fitzgerald described Quadrangle Club in &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; as &quot;Literary Quadrangle.&quot; Fitzgerald later commented that he might have felt more comfortable in &quot;Literary Quadrangle&quot; with contemporaries such as John Peale Bishop, an American poet.

In 2016, Quad signed-in 115 new members, a 342% increase from the year before and more than any other sign-in eating club except for Terrace Club. The current Chairman of the Board is alumnus Dinesh Maneyapanda.

==Musical tradition==
With some funding from the Princeton Undergraduate Student Government, the Quadrangle Club has hosted to some of the biggest concerts on Princeton&#x27;s campus, including Barenaked Ladies in 1993, Lifehouse in 2003, Maroon 5 in 2004, Rihanna in 2006, and T-Pain in 2013. These concerts have been documented as having drawn more than half of the university&#x27;s entire undergraduate population. Below is a listing of the groups that have performed at the club in recent years at the semiannual University-wide festival called &quot;Lawnparties&quot;.

The club’s perspicacious interest in music also extends to identifying early musical talent and booking intimate club music evenings with future superstars. For example, in the late 1980s Blues Traveler played a party at Quadrangle before the release of their first album.

<text>The McGuire Sisters were a singing trio in American popular music. The group was composed of three sisters:
* Ruby Christine McGuire (July 30, 1926 – December 28, 2018)
* Dorothy &quot;Dottie&quot; McGuire (February 13, 1928 – September 7, 2012)
* Phyllis Jean McGuire (February 14, 1931 – December 29, 2020)

Among their most popular songs are &quot;Sincerely&quot; and &quot;Sugartime&quot;, both number-one hits.

== Early years ==
The McGuire sisters were born to Asa and Lillie (Fultz) McGuire in Middletown, Ohio, and grew up in Miamisburg near Dayton. Their mother, Lillie, was a minister of the Miamisburg First Church of God, where, as children, they sang in church at weddings, funerals, and revivals. When they started singing in 1935, the youngest sister, Phyllis, was four years old. Eventually, they sang at occasions outside church, and by 1949 were singing at military bases and veterans&#x27; hospitals, performing a more diverse repertoire than they had in church.

==Career in show business==
The McGuire Sisters signed with Coral Records in 1952. In the same year, they appeared on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts,&quot; and Godfrey hired them for his other shows, where they remained for seven years. The November 1953 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; called them &quot;Godfrey&#x27;s Merry McGuires&quot;. The sisters often were compared to the Andrews Sisters. Maxene Andrews said in an interview with Joe Franklin on WOR (AM) radio in 1979, &quot;The McGuire Sisters were fine once they stopped imitating the Andrews Sisters.&quot; While working on the Godfrey show, the McGuires befriended singer Lu Ann Simms and attended her wedding to music publisher Loring Buzzell in July 1956. Buzzell&#x27;s music publishing firm, Hecht-Lancaster &amp; Buzzell Music (co-owned by Harold Hecht and Burt Lancaster) provided two songs for the McGuire Sisters, &quot;May You Always&quot;, which became the best-selling 45 and sheet music of 1959, and &quot;Theme from The Unforgiven (The Need for Love)&quot;, which became another big hit in 1960.

The McGuire Sisters were the Mystery Guests on the May 29, 1955 airing of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; Fred Allen guessed who they were. In 1958, their mother appeared as a guest challenger on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth.&quot; In December 1958 they appeared and performed as themselves in Season 4, Episode 11 of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, &quot;Bilko Presents the McGuire Sisters&quot;.

The McGuire Sisters and the Andrews Sisters met several times during their careers. Phyllis credited Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews during a television interview with Maxene in the 1990s, hosted by Sally Jessy Raphael, saying that her sisters and she met the Andrews Sisters in New York in the early 1950s and received important advice. The McGuires moved when they sang, often executing dance routines in lavish production numbers on countless television specials. The Andrews Sisters performed similarly in films in the 1940s, and were the first female vocal group to move when they sang, rather than just standing at a microphone. The sisters had mimicked that style, as well as those of the Mills Brothers and the Dinning Sisters ever since they were young, when they would perform short shows for family and friends in their parents&#x27; living room. Phyllis McGuire recounted that she and her sisters did not know any popular songs when they became famous, only the hymns taught to them by their mother. The trio imitated other singing groups long before their success.

They performed for five Presidents of the United States: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, and for Queen Elizabeth II. In London they performed a set for the Royal Variety Performance of 1961.

During the 1960s, the sisters maintained a busy television schedule, making frequent appearances on popular variety programs hosted by Ed Sullivan, Dean Martin, Danny Kaye, Milton Berle, Andy Williams, Perry Como, and Red Skelton. The trio was dressed and coiffed identically, and performed synchronized body movements and hand gestures with military precision. Their recordings of &quot;Sincerely&quot;, &quot;Picnic&quot;, and &quot;Sugartime&quot; all sold more than one million copies. 

==End to the group&#x27;s public appearances==
They retired from public appearances in 1968, giving their last performance that year on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; Phyllis McGuire continued to perform solo for a time. The demise of the group is often attributed to Phyllis&#x27; long-standing personal relationship with mobster Sam Giancana (although for years she claimed that their friendship was strictly platonic), which reportedly led to the group&#x27;s blacklisting.

During one of his 1960s court appearances for which Phyllis was subpoenaed, Giancana told reporters outside the courthouse, &quot;Phyllis knows everything&quot; about the rumored unethical behaviors of John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert. Giancana was shot in 1975 by an unknown gunman thought to be Dominic &quot;Butch&quot; Blasi, his closest confidante and right hand man of sorts.

Phyllis resided for decades in a famously showcased mansion in Las Vegas, boasting its own beauty parlor, a swan moat, and a replica of the Eiffel Tower which actually rose through the home&#x27;s roof. When asked by Barbara Walters during a 1980s ABC-TV &quot;20/20&quot; interview from within the mansion if any of the money to build the lavish home came from Giancana, Phyllis denied the suggestion, claiming that she invested heavily in oil when the sisters were at the height of their popularity. In the same interview, she acknowledged that her relationship with Giancana was in fact a love affair, saying, &quot;When I met him, I did not know who he was, and he was not married, and I was an unmarried woman. And according to the way I was brought up, there was nothing wrong with that. And I didn&#x27;t find out until sometime later really who he was, and I was already in love.&quot;

The sisters reunited in 1986, performing at Toronto&#x27;s Royal York Hotel for the first time since their retirement. Numerous nightclub engagements followed in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and New York City&#x27;s Rainbow &amp; Stars, showcasing the group and Phyllis&#x27; impersonations of Peggy Lee, Judy Garland, Pearl Bailey, Ethel Merman, and even Louis Armstrong.

Singing their greatest hits as part of their act, they were also featured performing specialty numbers such as the frantic &quot;I Love a Violin&quot;, the &quot;a cappella&quot; &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, and a segment during which Phyllis retired backstage as Christine and Dorothy shared the spotlight playing a concert arrangement of &quot;The Way We Were&quot; on twin pianos. Other highlights in the act were a comical Trinidad-flavored tune, a soft rendering of &quot;Memory&quot; from Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot;, and a &quot;Money Medley&quot;, which they also performed live on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon in 1994. Since then, the sisters had made occasional public appearances together, including in 2004, when they reunited to perform in a PBS special &quot;Magic Moments: Best of &#x27;50s Pop.&quot; The sisters&#x27; command of their vocal cords and harmonious blend, perhaps the most impressive of any trio before or since, had not significantly diminished.

After their careers wound down, they opened a restaurant in Bradenton, Florida, calling it McGuire&#x27;s Pub.

==Legacy==
They were inducted into the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, and in 2001, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. They also have been inducted into the Coca-Cola Hall of Fame and the Headliners&#x27; Hall of Fame. They were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Family==
Christine was married six times. Her first marriage to Harold Ashcraft (1942 until August 16, 1950) she had two children, Herold and Asa. Christine later married John Henry Teeter (December 30, 1952 until December, 18, 1962), Robert Hugh Spain (December 12, 1967 until 1970), Guy Marks (from 1975 until unknown), George Rosenfeld (from ?? until his death on August 23, 1996), and David Mudd (2002 until his death on August 19, 2011). All the latter marriages remained childless.

Christine&#x27;s grandson, Army Cpl. Evan Asa Ashcraft, aged 24, was killed in Iraq in 2003, when the convoy he was traveling in came under fire.

On July 30, 1951, Dorothy married Sgt. John Henry Brown, whom she divorced on January 9, 1956. During their childless marriage, Dorothy was romantically linked with singer Julius La Rosa. On December 6, 1958, she married Lowell James Williamson, with whom she had two sons, Rex and David.

In November 1952, Phyllis married Cornelius (Neal) Anthony Burke Van Ells. They divorced in 1956. She had no children.

==Deaths==
On September 7, 2012, Dorothy McGuire died at her son&#x27;s home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, after suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and age-related dementia; she was 84. Dorothy&#x27;s husband of 54 years, Lowell Williamson, died six months later on February 25, 2013, after sustaining a fractured back from a fall; he was 89.

Christine McGuire died in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 28, 2018, at the age of 92. No cause of death was given.

Phyllis McGuire, the last surviving member of the trio, died peacefully at her estate in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 29, 2020, of natural causes; she was 89.

==In popular culture==
The McGuire Sisters, and most especially Phyllis McGuire, who lived in Las Vegas, were the subjects of the 1995 HBO movie &quot;Sugartime&quot;, which depicted a romantic relationship between Phyllis and mobster Sam Giancana. Giancana was played by actor John Turturro, and Phyllis was played by actress Mary-Louise Parker.

The Robert Altman film &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean&quot; (1982) prominently features the music of The McGuire Sisters. Their number one single, &quot;Sincerely&quot;, is lip-synced by the film&#x27;s stars Cher, Karen Black and Sandy Dennis as &quot;The Disciples of James Dean.&quot;

&quot;Join the Club&quot;, the second episode of the sixth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, references both The McGuire Sisters and Sam Giancana.

<doc id="588397" wikidata="Q147891" url="?curid=588397" title="216 Kleopatra">
<text>216 Kleopatra is a large M-type asteroid with a mean diameter of and is noted for its elongate bone or dumbbell shape. It was discovered on 10 April 1880 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Pola Observatory, in what is now Pula, Croatia, and was named after Cleopatra, the famous Egyptian queen. It has two small minor-planet moons which were discovered in 2008 and later named Alexhelios and Cleoselene.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Kleopatra&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1–3.5 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,706 days; semi-major axis of 2.79 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Leipzig Observatory on 20 April 1880, ten days after its official discovery observation at Pola Observatory.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Size and shape ===
Kleopatra is a relatively large asteroid, with a mean (volume-equivalent) diameter of and an unusually elongated shape.

The initial mapping of its elongated shape was indicated by stellar occultation observations from eight distinct locations on 19 January 1991. Subsequent observations with the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at La Silla, run by the European Southern Observatory, were interpreted to show a double source with two distinct lobes of similar size. These results were disputed when radar observations at the Arecibo Observatory showed that the two lobes of the asteroid are connected, resembling the shape of a ham-bone. The radar observations provided a detailed shape model that appeared on the cover of Science Magazine. Later models suggested that Kleopatra was more elongate and the most recent models using radar delay-Doppler imaging, adaptive optics, and stellar occultations provide dimensions of 267 × 61 × 48 km.
=== Satellites ===
In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort was fruitless. In September 2008, Franck Marchis and his collaborators announced that by using the Keck Observatory&#x27;s adaptive optics system, they had discovered two moons orbiting Kleopatra. In February 2011, the minor-planet moons were named Alexhelios (outer) and Cleoselene (inner), after Cleopatra&#x27;s children Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. The outer and inner satellites are about 8.9 ± 1.6 and 6.9 ± 1.6 km in diameter, with periods of 2.7 and 1.8 days, respectively.

=== Mass, density, and composition ===
The presence of two moons provides a way to estimate Kleopatra&#x27;s mass, although its irregular shape makes the orbital modeling a challenge. The most recent adaptive-optics observations and modeling provides a mass of Kleopatra of , or , which is significantly lower than previously thought. When combined with the best volume estimate for Kleopatra, this indicates a bulk density of .

These recent bulk density results call into question the canonical view of Kleopatra as a pure metallic object. Kleopatra&#x27;s radar albedo suggests a high metal content in the southern hemisphere, but is similar to the more common S- and C-class asteroids along the equator. One way to reconcile these observations is to hypothesize that Kleopatra is a rubble-pile asteroid with significant porosity in dynamic equilibrium.

== Origin ==

One possible origin that explains Kleopatra&#x27;s shape, rotation, and moons is that it was created by an oblique impact perhaps 100 million years ago. The increased rotation would have elongated the asteroid and caused Alexhelios to split off. Cleoselene may have split off later, around 10 million years ago. Kleopatra is a contact binary – if it were spinning much faster, the two lobes would separate from each other, making a true binary system.

<doc id="588404" wikidata="Q387539" url="?curid=588404" title="Hollywood Records">
<text>Hollywood Records is an American record label owned by the Disney Music Group which focuses on pop, rock, alternative, hip hop and country genres, also specializing in recordings for a more mature audience not suitable for the flagship Walt Disney Records label.

Founded in December 1989, its current roster includes artists such as Sofia Carson, Tini, Area21, Queen, Little Image, Almost Monday, Andy Grammer, Adrian Lyles, Freya Skye, and Kenzie. The label also releases soundtrack albums and digital releases from Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, ABC, National Geographic, Hulu, 20th Television, FX, and ESPN since their acquisitions by The Walt Disney Company.

== History ==
=== 1989–1995: Founding and early years ===

Hollywood Records was founded in December 1989 by Michael Eisner, then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company, as a way of expanding the company&#x27;s music operations by looking to develop and promote the careers of a wide variety of artists in various genres. At the time, the company was limited to the release of soundtracks from Touchstone, and Hollywood Pictures films. The first act to be signed to the label was The Party, after being formed from Mouseketeers on The Mickey Mouse Club. Lawyer Peter Paterno was the first president of the label, until his resignation in 1993 because of the division&#x27;s lackluster sales. After failing to sign popular new artists such as Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Naughty by Nature, Cypress Hill and Dr. Dre, the label experienced its first major success in February 1990, when it acquired the North American distribution rights to Queen&#x27;s entire catalog for $10 million. The following year, the first Queen album under Hollywood, &quot;Innuendo&quot;, was released. The deal&#x27;s outlook as an important economic opportunity was immediately affected by the death of the band&#x27;s lead singer Freddie Mercury, although the band&#x27;s catalog sales managed to successfully generate nearly $94 million in revenue for Disney from 1991 to 1995.

=== 1995–1998: Financial struggles and restructuring ===
Bob Pfeifer was named president of the label in March 1995 after a whole year without a president, but problems continued to the label and Pfeifer was fired in 1997, after the label revealed that he had lost over 150 million dollars since 1990. In 1997, Disney acquired Mammoth Records, in order to get an already-established record label that could succeed. However, the acquisition of Mammoth was a failure and the label was closed and integrated to Hollywood in 2003. Additionally, during this time, they had signed Duran Duran to a three-album contract, and subsequently released &quot;Pop Trash,&quot; only to terminate their contract after disappointing album sales. In 1998, the company decided to form Buena Vista Music Group (now Disney Music Group), integrating the operations of Walt Disney Records along with Hollywood, Lyric Street, Mammoth, and Disney Music Publishing. Bob Cavallo, former manager of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Prince was appointed as chairman of the group, and president of Hollywood Records. This movement looked to organize the music operations of the company under a more integrated direction.

=== 1998–2012: Return to success ===
In 1998, Hollywood Records had its first major success in seven years with Fastball&#x27;s second album, &quot;All the Pain Money Can Buy&quot;, whose accompanying hit single &quot;The Way&quot; helped the label return to mainstream prominence. Five years later, Hilary Duff&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was released and became a success to the label, selling over three million copies in the United States. The launch of Duff&#x27;s career represented a new business model for the record, utilizing the synergies around the company, including important outlets like Disney Channel, Radio Disney, ABC Family and ABC. Duff&#x27;s albums released under Hollywood proved to be equally successful including Duff&#x27;s self-titled third album and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted&quot;. Duff&#x27;s success led to Hollywood utilizing talent from Disney Channel (such as Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, the Jonas Brothers and Bridgit Mendler) as artists into the mid-2010s, with several records that attained Platinum or Gold certifications. These artists&#x27; music careers proved the label to be successful. At the same time, the label continued to develop the careers of acts with a less mainstream profile such as Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals, Breaking Benjamin or Plain White T&#x27;s, but who had been successful in its own terms. The label also continued to release soundtracks from films and television shows, mainly those derived from Marvel Studios productions in conjunction with Marvel Music. In 2010, Hollywood absorbed the remaining operations of country music label Lyric Street Records, which became an imprint for the catalog of the defunct-label, currently managed by Hollywood. Later that same year, Queen left EMI Records for Universal Music-owned Island Records, with Hollywood continuing to remain the group&#x27;s North American music distributor.

=== 2012–present: Hollywood under Ken Bunt ===
In January 2012, after 14 years of a successful tenure, Bob Cavallo retired as chairman of the group and Ken Bunt was appointed as president of the group. Several changes have been done under his tenure, including the retirement of long-time executives from the Cavallo&#x27;s era like Abbey Konowitch, Justin Fontaine and Jhon Linda and the appointment of new A&amp;R&#x27;s like Mio Vukovic and Mike Daly. In March 2013, Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group announced the expansion of their relationship with a new commercial and creative agreement that enable Hollywood Records&#x27; artists to collaborate with the roster of producers and songwriters that are part of Universal. Since 2013, Hollywood Records also uses the brand name DMG Nashville to specialize in country music. The genre label was founded to provide music licensing for Bigger Picture Music Group. After Bigger Picture&#x27;s closure in 2014, DMG Nashville released its first studio album; Lucy Hale&#x27;s &quot;Road Between&quot;. Starting in 2020, Hollywood Records has released a series of EPs under the name Music for the Movement, with social justice and protest songs.

== Hollywood Basic ==

Hollywood BASIC [&quot;sic&quot;] was Hollywood&#x27;s short-lived hip-hop subsidiary, run by Dave Funkenklein, which existed from 1990 to 1995. It did not survive the distribution transition its parent made to PolyGram Records, and all of its recordings were deleted, save for those by Organized Konfusion, which were repressed under the new deal. It was the first label to record DJ Shadow, releasing his &quot;Lesson 4&quot; (a reference to Double Dee and Steinski) as the B-side of a 1991 single by Lifers Group, a hip hop group composed of prisoners at East Jersey State Prison in Rahway, New Jersey. It also released Shadow&#x27;s Legitimate Mix on the B-side of a single by the group Zimbabwe Legit in 1992. Arguably the most high-profile release was due to be &quot;BASIC Queen Bootlegs&quot;, a 10-track collection of hip-hop remixes and reinterpretations of tracks by the rock band Queen and featuring roster names plus guests such as Ice Cube. Although the &quot;BASIC Beats Sampler&quot; confirmed its release date for April 1992, the album was not commercially released although it has since leaked online. Other notable releases came from Organized Konfusion; its challenging second album, &quot;&quot; (1994), was widely acclaimed. The label was also home of Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf, although, following the shooting death of Charizma in 1993, the music the duo recorded for the label was not released. This would later inspire Peanut Butter Wolf to found Stones Throw Records in order to make this music available. Acts on Hollywood BASIC&#x27;s roster included Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf, Lifers&#x27; Group, Organized Konfusion, Raw Fusion, Hi-C, and Zimbabwe Legit.

== Distribution ==

Upon its 1989 launch, Hollywood was distributed in the United States and Canada by Elektra Records, at the time owned by Disney rival Time Warner. Distribution in North America switched to PolyGram (acquired by Universal Music Group) in 1995 (partnered with A&amp;M in Canada until PolyGram&#x27;s acquisition by Universal Music in 1999). Today, Universal Music Group markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog worldwide. Also, several Hollywood artists including Demi Lovato, Bridgit Mendler, Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene, Nick Jonas &amp; the Administration, Joe Jonas, Miley Cyrus, Sofia Carson, Jonas Brothers, Sabrina Carpenter, and the new addition Dixie D&#x27;Amelio signed to Universal Music UK&#x27;s Fascination Records. There were reports in 2011 that Disney Music Group would start an independent US distribution arm for its label&#x27;s releases, but as of February 2012, those plans have yet to be enacted. Universal Music Group acquired most of EMI in 2013 but pledged not to renew its European license with Disney; both sides eventually changed their minds. In March 2013, Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group announced the expansion of their relationship with a new commercial and creative agreement that enabled Hollywood Records&#x27; artists to collaborate with the roster of producers and songwriters that are part of Universal Music.

<doc id="588416" wikidata="Q7527727" url="?curid=588416" title="Sir John Donne">
<text>Sir John Donne (c.1420s – January 1503) was a Welsh courtier, diplomat and soldier, a notable figure of the Yorkist party. In the 1470s, he commissioned the Donne Triptych, a triptych altarpiece by Hans Memling now in the National Gallery, London. It contains portraits of him, his wife Elizabeth and a daughter. He may well have been related to the Jacobean poet John Donne, although not as a direct ancestor, as he had no Donne grandchildren.

==Family and early career==
The Donnes of Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, were a distinguished family (&quot;Dwnn&quot; in Welsh). His father Griffith (Gruffydd) reputedly fought at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 and certainly in many other French campaigns; he was Lieutenant of Cherbourg in 1424. His mother was Joan Scudamore, a grandchild of Owain Glyndŵr, the last independent Prince of Wales, who disappeared into hiding in 1412. John Donne was born in France, &quot;in parts of Picardy&quot;, probably in the 1420s.

Donne was their third son who entered, probably in his late teens, the service of the Duke of York, father of Edward IV. He may have done so through the patronage of the leading Yorkist in South Wales, William ap Thomas, also an Agincourt veteran and father of Donne&#x27;s contemporary William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423-1469). Donne is recorded as having fought in France for the Duke, which must have been before 1447. It is from this and his apparent age in the Memling that his birth in the 1420s is estimated. He also fought for the Duke in England, and in the late 1440s in Ireland.

Donne married, before 1465, to Elizabeth Hastings, sister of William, Lord Hastings, the favourite of Edward IV, who was executed by Edward&#x27;s brother King Richard III of England in 1483. Hastings had also been in the service of the Duke of York for all his adult life, so he and Donne must have known each other very well. The Donnes&#x27; surviving children were first two daughters, Anne and Margaret, then two sons Edward and Griffith (both later knighted). Elizabeth Donne died in 1507 or 1508.

On Edward&#x27;s accession in 1461 he was made an &quot;Usher of the Chamber&quot; and started to become wealthy. From 1465 to 1469 he was an &quot;Esquire of the Body&quot; and he was knighted on the field after the huge Yorkist victory of the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 (along with many others). His wife was a &quot;damicellae&quot; or Lady-in-waiting, of the Queen. In the portrait he and his wife wear lavish Yorkist gold collar chains of suns and roses with the personal livery of Edward in pendants of his emblem, a lion, both in white &quot;ronde bosse&quot; enamel with gold highlights, clutching a ruby in their raised paws. These chains would presumably have been presents from Edward to his close followers.

==Calais and the continent==
He was probably the &quot;Jehan Don&quot; present at the extravagantly celebrated wedding in Bruges in 1468 of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York, sister of Edward IV. He may well have accompanied Edward in his Burgundian exile in 1470–1, as Hastings did. Much later, he was present when the widowed Margaret (his &quot;true friend&quot;) met her brother at what is now Syon House in 1480.

In 1468, he is described as &quot;out of Calais&quot;, England&#x27;s outpost in France, and this connection continued for the rest of his career; Hastings was &quot;lieutenant of Calais&quot; or governor, and his brother-in-law Donne his deputy. He owned a house there, and was a member of the Calais council in 1471, involved in negotiations in 1472, and recorded as there in 1475 and several later years. By 1483, he was Deputy of the Tower of Risban, an outlying fort, and before 1497 Lieutenant of the Castle. It may well have been his main base for much of his career; it remained under Yorkist control throughout Edward IV&#x27;s exile.

The &quot;Donne Triptych&quot; by Hans Memling would presumably have been made in Bruges, and is believed to date from the 1470s. Many sources still date it to 1468, because they were only aware of Donne&#x27;s visit to Bruges for the wedding in that year, and because when the donor was first identified as Donne in 1840, the writer (J. G. Nichols) wrongly stated that he was killed in the Battle of Edgcote in 1469. 

The National Gallery now favours a date in the late 1470s, perhaps 1478, the date on a later copy, which is plausible, and may have been on the lost original frame. The Donne coat of arms appears on small escutcheons in the capital of the column behind Sir John, rather roughly represented, and impaled with that of Hastings on the capital behind Lady Donne. The Donne arms also appear in a glass roundel in the window in the right side panel.

The portrait of Lady Donne was first painted with a younger, more generalized face, then overpainted, also by Memling, with the present thinner face. This may suggest Memling only saw her when the painting was well underway, and changed his picture to her actual features.

==Illuminated manuscripts==

Apart from the Memling, there are two surviving Flemish illuminated manuscripts commissioned by Donne in the British Library, plus a second-hand one (BL MS Royal 15 D iv) that was a gift from the two Duchesses of Burgundy (the widowed Margaret and her stepdaughter Mary) with the inscriptions: &quot;For yet not har that ys on of yor treu frendes Margarete of Yorke&quot; (&quot;Forget not her that is one of your true friends, Margarete of York), and &quot;Prenez moy ajames pour vre bonne amie Marie D. de bourg.ne&quot; (&quot;Take me forever for your good friend, Mary, Duchess of Burgundy&quot;). This was formerly in the Old Royal Library, probably having been presented to Henry VIII by one of Donne&#x27;s sons. He commissioned an important Book of Hours of about 1480, now known as the &quot;Donne Hours&quot;, previously called the &quot;Louthe Hours&quot; due to an incorrect identification of the commissioner of the work, now in Louvain, which has a miniature of him kneeling in armour with his guardian angel with on the same folio a representation of his arms: &quot;Azure, a wolf salient argent&quot; (as shown on escutcheons on the capitals of the columns in the Donne Triptych by Hans Memling), with crest: &quot;A knot of five snakes&quot;.

Several of Donne&#x27;s close associates: Edward, Hastings, the two Duchesses of Burgundy and others, were important patrons of Flemish art in various forms, and there a number of indications that Donne supervised the progress of the triptych carefully, and requested changes.

==Diplomacy==
His formal diplomatic career seems to have begun in February 1477, when he and John Morton, the future Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, were ambassadors to the French court. In May of the same year, he and two others were ambassadors to the other side, the Imperial ambassadors in Burgundy. He was sent on several such missions, and may have been an important figure in diplomacy with Burgundy. The history of Yorkist diplomacy has not been fully explored, and Donne&#x27;s position in it is currently hard to assess.

==Later life==
He acquired estates at Horsenden, Buckinghamshire in 1480, which then became his primary British residence. He managed to avoid getting caught in the fall of Hastings in 1483, and was appointed High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire for 1485 under King Richard III. After the change of dynasty in 1485, he must have made an accommodation with his fellow Welshman, Henry VII, at which point he would have reached an age to retire in any case. Both he and his wife are buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle, next to Edward IV and Hastings, which is in itself indicative of royal favour.

His two sons worked for Henry VIII. His descendants include the Earls of Oxford, Cumberland, Burlington, and the Dukes of Devonshire. The Memling passed through these last three families.

<text>The R142 is the first mass-produced model class of the newest generation or new technology (NTT) A Division cars for the New York City Subway. It was built by Bombardier Transportation in La Pocatière, Quebec, Canada and Barre, Vermont, U.S. with final assembly performed at Plattsburgh, New York, from 1999 to 2003. There are 880 cars numbered 6301–7180 and another 150 cars numbered 1101–1250, for a total of 1,030 cars, all arranged as five-car sets. Together with the R142As, they replaced the Redbird trains, including the R26, R28, R29, R33, R33S, and R36.

The R142s and R142As are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. The first R142s were delivered on November 16, 1999, though they initially experienced minor issues that were reported while undergoing testing. Following the completion of non-revenue service testing, the R142s were placed into revenue service on July 10, 2000 as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test. After successful completion, it entered revenue service on October 20, 2000. The last R142s were delivered by mid-2003. In January 2019, the MTA proposed mid-life upgrades to the R142 fleet.

==Description==
880 of the R142s are numbered 6301–7180, and the remaining 150 cars are numbered 1101–1250.

There are two types of cars: &quot;A&quot; (cab at one end) and &quot;B&quot; (no cabs). &quot;A&quot; cars are powered with four traction motors each, with the passenger doors opposite each other. The &quot;B&quot; cars are powered by two traction motors at the number-two end, and the passenger doors are staggered (car ends are numbered on the lower body just above the truck). The trains are linked up in 5-car, A-B-B-B-A sets, but also can be linked in sets of 4 cars (A-B-B-A), 6 cars (A-B-B-B-B-A), 9 cars (one 5-car set and one 4-car set), 10 cars (two 5-car sets), or 11 cars (one 5-car set and one 6-car set).

Currently, most R142s are maintained at the 239th Street Yard and East 180th Street Yard and assigned on the and , with the remaining sets maintained at the Jerome Yard and assigned to the .

==Features==

The R142s feature Alstom ONIX AC propulsion systems, electronic braking, automatic climate control, electronic strip maps, and an on-board intercom system; the traction motors of the R142s were later used on the majority of the R160 subway cars when they were first delivered. The R142 and the R142A were partly designed by Antenna Design.

Like the R110As, the R142s feature wider doors than past A-Division equipment, with side doors (about narrower than the R110As&#x27; doors, but wider than the R62/As&#x27; doors). All car ends have windows, allowing passengers to see through to the next car, except cab ends, where the cab walls prevent such visibility. The R142 car bodies are constructed from stainless steel.

The R142s and R142As are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. All passenger cars built after them also use this feature. Newer, shorter announcements have been tested on some sets on the 2 and 5 since 2015 in an effort to reduce dwell times and subsequently reduce the likelihood of delays, but were later replaced with the standard announcements. The R142s are visually very similar to the R142As and R188s, but due to electrical incompatibilities, the three types are not interoperable.
==History==
On April 30, 1997, the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved the purchase of 680 cars from Bombardier (the R142s) and 400 cars from Kawasaki (the R142As). The original purchase order was for 740 cars, but because of the intense competition between the firms, the MTA was able to purchase 340 additional cars at the same price. The entire cost of the purchase was $1.45 billion. The new subway cars were based on the results of the tests from the R110A and R110B test trains. The historic deal came after round-the-clock negotiations, and the contract was the largest subway car purchase in the history of the New York City Subway up to this point.

The first ten R142s, 6301–6310, were delivered on November 16, 1999. Minor issues were reported to be found and were corrected during troubleshooting during the testing phase. After several months of non-revenue service testing and troubleshooting of all bugs, the R142s were placed into revenue service on the on July 10, 2000 as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test. After successful completion, it entered revenue service on October 20, 2000. The last R142s were delivered by March 2003.

Between 2016 and 2018, the MTA replaced the individual strip maps for cars assigned to the 2 and 5 with combined strip maps showing both services, due to the two services having large amounts of route overlap on the IRT White Plains Road, Eastern Parkway, and Nostrand Avenue lines, and because the R142s assigned to the East 180th Street and 239th Street yards are shared between the two routes.

In January 2019, the MTA proposed mid-life upgrades to several train subsystems in the R142 and R142A fleets. These included changes to the HVAC, propulsion, and door systems; the addition of Ethernet on the R142 fleet; and conversion of the fleet to be compatible with communications-based train control (CBTC), in conjunction with subway signal upgrades along the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IRT Seventh Avenue Line. The R142 fleet would also be retrofitted with a &quot;monitoring and diagnostics system&quot;.

In March 2021, the route and destination signs on car 7021 were upgraded to LEDs. The route portion of the sign also received a green circle/red diamond LED for the route display, similar to those on the R62A sets currently used on the 6 service. Car 7171 received the same modifications in mid-2021. The upgrades were implemented on more cars in 2024.

===Incidents===
On March 27, 2020, a northbound 2 train with operating lead consist 6346–6350 and trailing consist 6366–6370 was set on fire while traveling from 96th Street to Central Park North–110th Street. While the trailing consist was relatively unscathed and eventually returned to service in November 2020, the lead consist suffered extensive damage and was retired. The fire erupted on board car 6347, damaging that car, as well as additional fire and smoke damage to the rest of the set, along with some moderate fire damage to the station as well. As a result, the whole set was taken out of service and stripped for parts. The train operator was killed, and 16 people were injured. A man accused of setting the fire was arrested and charged with murder in December 2020.

<text>The Howard family is an English noble family founded by John Howard, who was created Duke of Norfolk (third creation) by King Richard III of England in 1483. However, John was also the eldest grandson (although maternal) of the 1st Duke of the first creation. The Howards have been part of the peerage since the 15th century and remain both the Premier Dukes and Earls of the Realm in the Peerage of England, acting as Earl Marshal of England. After the English Reformation, many Howards remained steadfast in their Catholic faith as the most high-profile recusant family; two members, Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel, and William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, are regarded as martyrs: a saint and a blessed respectively.

The senior line of the house, as well as holding the title of Duke of Norfolk, is also Earl of Arundel, Earl of Surrey and Earl of Norfolk, as well as holding six baronies. The Arundel title was inherited in 1580, when the Howards became the genealogical successors to the paternally extinct FitzAlans, ancient kin to the House of Stuart, dating back to when the family first arrived in Great Britain from Brittany (see Alan fitz Flaad).

Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, married as his first wife Mary FitzAlan, who, after the death of her brother Henry in 1556, became heiress to the Arundel estates of her father Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel. Her son was the above-mentioned Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel. It is from this marriage that the present Duke of Norfolk takes his surname of FitzAlan-Howard and why his seat is Arundel Castle. There have also been several notable cadet branches; those existing to this day include the Howards of Effingham, Howards of Carlisle, Howards of Suffolk and Howards of Penrith. The former three are earldoms, and the latter a barony.

Throughout much of English and later British history, the Howards have played an important role. Claiming descent from Hereward the Wake, the resister of the Norman conquest who has been much celebrated in folklore, John Howard fought to the death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in defence of the cause for the House of York. The Howards regained favour with the new Tudor dynasty after leading a defence of England from Scottish invasion at the Battle of Flodden, and Catherine Howard subsequently became the fifth wife and Queen consort to King Henry VIII. Her uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, played a significant role in Henrician politics. Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, served as Lord High Admiral of the English fleet which defeated the invading Spanish Armada.

Arundel Castle has been in the family of the Duke of Norfolk for over 400 years, and it is still the principal seat of the Norfolk family. As cultural heritage, it is a Grade I listed building.

==Origins==
See: Howarth
The later Howards would claim legendary descent from Hereward the Wake, but a pedigree compiled and signed by Sir William Dugdale, Norroy King of Arms of the College of Arms, and dated 8 April 1665, stated that the Howard family are descended from the Howarth [&quot;sic&quot;, Howard] family of Great Howarth Hall, Rochdale. According to Dugdale, &quot;it is clear from above seventy deeds, without date, that the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk, do derive from the Howards Howarth of Great Howarth and that William Howard of Wigenhall… was a direct decedent of Osbert Howard de Howarth.&quot; Osbert, Dugdale wrote, had been given lands in Rochdale in return for his service as Master of King Henry I&#x27;s Buckhounds. 

The scroll states, in clear terms, that William Howard de Howard (born 1237) was the second son of Robert Howarth of Howarth, son of William, who was himself the son of Peter de Howard. Dugdale states that William Howard de Howard was the progenitor of the subsequently noble Howard family. William Howard was knighted in c. 1278 and that he was appointed (Chief) Justice of the Common Pleas in 1297. William Howard married firstly Alice de Ufford, the daughter of the Justiciar and Suffolk landowner Sir Robert de Ufford. If Dugdale was correct a young William Howard left Lancashire to settle in Norfolk and practise as a lawyer perhaps at the behest of his father-in-law.

Later in 1636 the Rev. Richard James separately wrote the &quot;Iter Lancastrense&quot;, a poem on the history of Lancashire in which he mentions &quot;Robin Howorrth, from whose familie Great Noble peers derive their progenie&quot;.

Alternatively it is sometimes stated that William Howard is son of a John (Howard) de Wiggenhale, who with other family members appears to have held land in or near Wiggenhall in Norfolk.

Sir William Howard settled in East Winch and Wiggenhall. He was a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and was summoned as a justice to the House of Commons in the Model Parliament of 1295. Sir William&#x27;s son, Sir John Howard I, became Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk and married Joan de Cornwall, an illegitimate granddaughter of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, the second son of King John. He died in 1308.

==History==


Sir William&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson, Sir Robert Howard, married Lady Margaret Mowbray, elder daughter of Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1366–1399). The Mowbray line of Dukes died out in 1476 and the heiress of the last Duke, Anne Mowbray, died at the age of nine in 1481; after declaring her widower King Edward IV&#x27;s son Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, illegitimate, Richard III of England created the son of Sir Robert and Lady Margaret, John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, of a new creation on 28 June 1483, the 200th anniversary of the Barony of Mowbray to which he was also senior co-heir. John had previously been summoned to Parliament as Lord Howard by Edward IV. He was also created hereditary Earl Marshal. John&#x27;s son and heir, Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, was the grandfather of two English queens, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both wives of Henry VIII.

The Howard family became one of the foremost recusant families due to their continued adherence to Roman Catholicism throughout the English Reformation and its aftermath. Four members of the family in a row fell from grace or were convicted and imprisoned because of their Catholic beliefs: Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and his son Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey were imprisoned in late 1546. , accused of being involved in a plot to usurp the crown from Henry VIII&#x27;s son, Prince Edward (future Edward VI) and thus reverse the Reformation and return the English Church to papal jurisdiction. Both the 3rd Duke and his son were tried for treason and sentenced to death; Surrey was only executed in January 1547 while his father was saved from the same fate by the death of Henry VIII, although he remained imprisoned in the Tower of London throughout the reign of Edward VI. The elderly 3rd Duke was freed early in the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I in 1553 but died the following year and the Dukedom was inherited by her grandson and son of Surrey, Thomas, who became the 4th Duke. The 4th Duke, who despite having received a Protestant education as a child, was Catholic, fell from grace and was executed in June 1572 after having conspired against Queen Elizabeth I to replace her with Mary I Stewart, Queen of Scots, marry her and then restore Catholicism in England. Norfolk&#x27;s son, Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his Catholicism in 1585, remaining there for over ten years until he fell ill with dysentery and he died in October 1595. It became a tradition among the Howards to suffer for being Catholics.

Both the Duchy and Earl Marshalship have been the subject of repeated attainders and restorations in the 15th to 17th centuries. Before Charles II restored the titles for good, the Howards had inherited the ancient title of Earl of Arundel through an heiress, and formed additional branches that have continued to this day.

A branch of the Howard family has been seated at Castle Howard, one of England&#x27;s most magnificent country houses, for over 300 years.

In order of genealogical seniority:

*the Barons Howard of Penrith descend from a younger brother of the 12th Duke;
*the Earls of Suffolk and Berkshire descend from the 2nd son of the 4th Duke;
*the Earls of Carlisle descend from the third son of the 4th Duke;
*the Earls of Effingham descend from the fourth son of the 2nd Duke, who was Lord High Admiral and whose son was commander in chief against the Spanish Armada. (Curiously, this line was excluded from eligibility to inherit on the restoration of the Dukedom).

==Howard family tree==
==Arms of the Howard family==
See: Gallery of Howard Arms

The Howard family&#x27;s original arms were the white bend on red with the crosslets. On marrying the heiress of the dukes of Norfolk, the first Howard duke of Norfolk quartered his arms with those of Thomas of Brotherton 1st Earl of Norfolk, son of King Edward I Longshanks as well as the Mowbray arms. Starting with the 2nd Duke of Norfolk, the Howards added in the 3rd quarter the checkered blue and gold of the Warren Earls of Surrey, whom they became heirs of. Philip Howard was deprived of the dukedom of Norfolk, which was under attainer, but inherited the earldom of Arundel. His descendants used the gold lion on red of the Fitzalan Earls of Arundel in the 4th quarter.

Earl Marshal is a hereditary royal officeholder and chivalric title under the sovereign of the United Kingdom used in England (then, following the Act of Union 1800, in the United Kingdom). It is the eighth of the Great Officers of State in the United Kingdom, ranking beneath the Lord High Constable and above the Lord High Admiral. The Earl Marshal has responsibility for the organisation of State funerals and the monarch&#x27;s coronation in Westminster Abbey. He is also a leading officer of arms. The office is hereditary in the Howard Family in their position as Dukes of Norfolk, the senior dukedom in the United Kingdom.

<text>Shadowman is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by Valiant Comics. The character debuted in &quot;Shadowman&quot; #1 (May 1992), created by writers Jim Shooter and Steve Englehart, and artist David Lapham. Shadowman appears in his own series and video games, as well as numerous other Valiant comics. 

Shadowman is a lineage and four characters have taken up the mantle thus far in the comics and video games. The series protagonist is Jack Boniface.

Since his introduction, Shadowman has been a key character in the Valiant Universe and has sold over 5.3 million copies to date, with 80 issues published. Shadowman comics have been translated into a number of languages, including German, Italian, Spanish, Norwegian, Filipino and Chinese, among others. New Orleans mayor Sidney Barthelemy officially proclaimed January 17, 1993 as “Shadowman Day.”

==Publication history==
===Original Valiant continuity===
&quot;Shadowman&quot; debuted in 1992 as a flagship title in the Valiant Universe. After one year in publication, &quot;Shadowman&quot; was selling over 100,000 comics books a month. Shadowman would go on to guest star in a number of Valiant comics, fighting alongside other heroes in the Valiant Universe, most notably &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Unity 2000&quot;. 

===Acclaim continuity===
&quot;Shadowman&quot; eventually sold more than 5 million copies in total before Acclaim Entertainment bought Valiant for $65 million in 1994. Acclaim Comics subsequently started a new &quot;Shadowman&quot; series in 1996. Acclaim also published &quot;Shadowman&quot; video games. In preparation for the leap to video games a new action-oriented Shadowman took up the mask in comics. The second series of comics (spelled &quot;Shadow Man&quot;) featured the iteration of Shadowman that would gain huge popularity in the successful Shadow Man video game franchise. In a similar manner to the original iteration, the hero fought alongside other characters in the Acclaim Comics Universe, notably Unity 2000.

People who have worked on &quot;Shadowman&quot; characters and storylines include Marvel Comics Editor-in Chief Joe Quesada, former Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, Frank Miller, Garth Ennis, Rob Liefeld, Barry Windsor-Smith, Jamie Delano, Steve Ditko, David Lapham, Rags Morales, Fabian Nicieza, Jim Starlin, Bob Layton, Jimmy Palmiotti, Walt Simonson and Ashley Wood. With issue seven Bob Hall took over writing chores and continued as the primary writer on the book until the first &quot;Shadowman&quot; run ended with issue 43.

Acclaim shut down all comic book publishing in 2002, in anticipation of a bankruptcy filing of its parent company after suffering heavy losses from its licensed sports video games. &quot;Shadowman&quot; and all other Valiant properties were sold to Valiant Entertainment.

==Powers==
===Valiant Comics===
As Shadowman, Jack possesses paranormal strength, endurance, agility, and reflexes, night vision, regenerative healing, gliding capabilities, depleted fear, and other voodoo powers.

===Valiant Entertainment===
Possessee&#x27;s hosted to the Shadow Loa have a great many expanded upon abilities. The natural physical enhancements &amp; psychological reinforcements that come with being Busou Kobalamin&#x27;s host remain paramount, but are also complemented by a host of other powers which accommodate them. Such as necromancy, afterlife traversal, shadow &amp; darkness manipulation on top of mastery over the deadside and it&#x27;s monstrous denizens.

==In other media==
===Film===
In 1999, Acclaim Entertainment was approached by rapper/actor Ice Cube with a pitch to make a feature film. Acclaim declined this offer, as they were focused on the success of the video game franchise. In June 2017, it was reported that Valiant Entertainment had hired Reginald Hudlin to direct a film adaptation, and also co-write the screenplay with Adam Simon.

===Web series===
Shadowman appears in the web series &quot;Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe&quot;, portrayed by Damion Poitier.

===Video games===

In 1999, &quot;Shadow Man&quot; was released on the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and PC.

In 2002, its sequel, &quot;Shadow Man: 2econd Coming,&quot; was released in 2002 as a PlayStation 2 exclusive.

In all, the &quot;Shadow Man&quot; franchise has sold over 2 million copies and grossed close to 100 million dollars in revenue. Both games before 2023 focus on Michael LeRoi, the Acclaim Comics version of Shadow Man.

In May 2023, a new game, that features Jack Boniface was announced that is slated for release in 2026.

===Music===

In 2015, heavy metal band A Sound of Thunder released a concept album entitled &quot;Tales from the Deadside&quot; based on Shadowman. The album was released on compact disc, vinyl, and digital formats. The album features original artwork by Bob Hall and Roberto de la Torre. A limited 7 inch vinyl picture disc for album tracks &quot;Tower of Souls&quot; and &quot;Punk Mambo&quot; was also released in 2015.

<doc id="588441" wikidata="Q7845286" url="?curid=588441" title="Trolling motor">
<text>A trolling motor is a self-contained marine propulsion unit that includes an electric motor, propeller and control system, and is affixed to an angler&#x27;s boat, either at the bow or stern. A gasoline-powered outboard used in trolling, if it is not the vessel&#x27;s primary source of propulsion, may also be referred to as a &quot;trolling motor.&quot; The main function of trolling motors was once to keep the boat running at a consistent, low speed suitable for trolling, but that function has been augmented by GPS-tracking trolling motors that function as &quot;virtual anchors&quot; to automatically maintain a boat&#x27;s position relative to a desired location, such as a favorite fishing spot. Trolling motors are often lifted from the water to reduce drag when the boat&#x27;s primary engine is in operation.

==Uses==
* Trolling for game fish; a motor used for this purpose is usually a secondary means of propulsion, and mounted on the transom alongside the primary outboard motor or on a bracket made for the purpose.
* Auxiliary power for precision maneuvering of the boat, to enable the angler to cast his bait to where the fish are located. Trolling motors designed for this application are typically mounted in the bow.

==History==
An 1895 article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; entitled &quot;A Portable Electric Propeller for Boats&quot; stated: &quot;Briefly described, it consists of a movable tube which is hinged at the stern of the boat, much as an oar is used in sculling. The tube contains a flexible shaft formed of three coils of phosphor bronze. This tube extends down and out into the water, where it carries a propeller, and at the inboard end an electric Motor is attached, which is itself driven by batteries.&quot; It was invented and sold by the Electric Boat company.

The electric trolling motor was invented by O.G. Schmidt in 1934 in Fargo, North Dakota, when he took a starter motor from a Ford Model A, added a flexible shaft, and a propeller. Because his manufacturing company was near the Minnesota/North Dakota border, he decided to call the new company Minn Kota. The company still is a major manufacturer of trolling motors.

==Design==

===Electric trolling motors===
* Modern electric trolling motors are designed around a 12-volt, 24-volt or 36-volt brushed DC electric motor, to take advantage of the availability of 12-volt deep cycle batteries designed specifically for marine use. 
* The motor itself is sealed inside a watertight compartment at the end of the shaft. It is submerged during operation, which prevents overheating.
* The propeller is fitted directly on to the propshaft.
* Hand-control: tiller for steering, with speed control either built into the tiller or a control knob on top of the unit. Hand controlled trolling motors are attached to the boat with a clamp.
* Foot-control: on/off and speed controls are foot-operated, and built into a pedal that also controls the steering mechanism. Steering may be via electronically controlled servo motors, or in early-model (and late-model low-end units), a push-pull cable. Foot controlled trolling motors require a specialized mounting bracket that bolts horizontally to the deck. Main advantage of foot controls is that fisherman has both hands free for fishing and landing the hooked fish. On the other hand, it is sometimes hard to coordinate foot work with hands, especially in wavy and windy conditions. 
* Wireless remote: available on high-end late-model trolling motors. Servo-controlled steering and speed control both respond to a wireless device, either in a foot pedal or a key-fob transmitter (similar to an automotive remote keyless system).

===Gasoline-powered trolling motors===
* Small outboard motors are frequently used as trolling motors on boats with much larger engines that do not operate as efficiently or quietly at trolling speeds. These typically are designed with a manual pull start system, throttle and gearshift controls mounted on the body of the motor, and a tiller for steering, but in a trolling application, will be connected to the steering mechanism at the helm.

<text>Star Wreck is a series of Finnish &quot;Star Trek&quot; parody movies started by Samuli Torssonen in 1992. The first movie, simply named &quot;Star Wreck&quot;, was a simple &quot;Star Control&quot;-like animation with three ships shooting at each other, but later movies featured CGI-animated characters and, in the latest films, live actors. Often &quot;Star Wreck&quot; is used to refer to the latest and most popular film &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot;.

&quot;Star Wreck&quot; relates the adventures of James B. Pirk (named after the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character James T. Kirk), Captain of the starship C.P.P. &quot;Potkustartti&quot; (English C.P.P. &quot;Kickstart&quot;). Other characters include Mr. Fukov, Mr. Spook &quot;(Finnish: Mr. Spökö)&quot;, Mr. Dwarf &quot;(Wuf)&quot;, Ensign Shitty and Mr. Info (loosely based, respectively, on Star Trek&#x27;s Pavel Chekov, Mr. Spock, Worf, Scotty, and Data). The characters speak Finnish; subtitles in various languages, including Klingon, are available.

In 2015, it was announced that two new films were going to be released. The first one will be a short film titled &quot;Star Wreck: Timecrash&quot;, set in future Soviet Union, and the second, currently untitled one will be a feature-length film.

==Films==
All &quot;Star Wreck&quot; films are available online under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND licence.

* &quot;Star Wreck&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Star Wreck II: The Old Shit&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Star Wreck III: The Wrath of the Romuclans&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Star Wreck IV: The Kilpailu&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Star Wreck V: Lost Contact&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Star Wreck 4.5: Weak Performance&quot; (2000; takes place between IV and V)
* &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Star Wreck 2π: Full Twist, now!&quot; (2012)

The first five &quot;Star Wreck&quot; films were re-released on &quot;Star Wreck: Legacy&quot; DVD in 2006, with original score replacing the &quot;Star Trek&quot; score, and other changes. &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot; was re-released on an &quot;Imperial Edition&quot; DVD in 2006, with updated models and effects.

==Popularity==
&quot;Star Wreck&quot; has enjoyed a relatively large niche following among sci-fi fans, but it was only the 2005 movie that really pushed it into the limelight. &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot; was downloaded over 700,000 times during the first week after its release and the current estimates by the hosting service, Magenta sites, are between 3.5 and 4 million downloads, including mirror sites. This has been claimed to make &quot;In the Pirkinning&quot; the most popular Finnish film of all time, topping the movie theatre viewings for &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (approx. 2.8 million viewers); the comparison, however, may not be particularly meaningful. Numerous TV and magazine interviews of the film&#x27;s authors have been published, both in Finland and abroad.

&quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot; has also been shown on Finnish national television, YLE TV2, on the Belgian national television channel Canvas, and Italian TV-channel Jimmy.

A new Imperial Edition DVD has also been released by Universal Pictures in Scandinavia. With the Imperial Edition release, all the space scenes with &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Babylon 5&quot; ship models were removed and completely remade.

In September 2007, a 1-DVD version of &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning – Imperial Edition&quot; was released also in Japan by AMG &amp; Medallion Media. The version includes a professional dub for Japanese, as well as new sleeve design and a poster/cue card inside the DVD case.

In 2012, a spin-off called &quot;Star Wreck 2π: Full Twist, now!&quot; was released. It is made by Swiss film makers, but Samuli Torssonen and Timo Vuorensola have a guest appearance in their respective roles.

There is also a spin-off animated &quot;Star Wreck&quot;, created by a different author who has no relation to Torssonen&#x27;s team, called &quot;Star Wreck Asskicker&quot; which tells the story of the &quot;C.P.P. Asskicker&quot;.

==Role-playing game==
The Star Wreck Roleplaying Game is an English-language role-playing game (RPG) published in Finland by Energia Productions that is set in the Star Wreck universe. It was first released at Ropecon in 2006.
The game is a parody of the numerous Star Trek roleplaying games, but is also playable on its own. Its rule mechanics are built to emulate the setting of the films, with experienced characters becoming more heroically incompetent instead of getting better at their tasks, as is the case in most mainstream games.

In August 2007 the game was licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license and made available for free download.

<text>Neil Hosler McElroy (October 30, 1904 – November 30, 1972) was United States Secretary of Defense from 1957 to 1959 under President Eisenhower. He had been president of Procter &amp; Gamble.

==Early life and education==

Born in Berea, Ohio, to school-teacher parents, McElroy grew up in the Cincinnati area. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from Harvard in 1925.

==Procter &amp; Gamble==
McElroy returned to Cincinnati to work in the advertising department of the Procter &amp; Gamble Company. In 1931, as a junior executive managing the advertising campaign for P&amp;G&#x27;s Camay brand of soap, McElroy wrote what became a famous three-page company memo that laid out the principles of modern brand management. In the memo, McElroy argued that companies should assign a separate marketing team to each individual product brand, as if it were a separate business. This innovative system of brand management would eventually be adopted by consumer product companies all throughout the U.S. He advanced rapidly up the managerial ladder, subsequently becoming company president in 1948.

==Secretary of Defense==
On October 4, 1957, just four days before Defense Secretary Charles E. Wilson left office, the Soviet Union launched into orbit the world&#x27;s first satellite (Sputnik I), suggesting that the Soviets were ahead of the United States in missile development. This event, which raised important questions about the U.S. defense program, served as a backdrop to the swearing in, on October 9, 1957, of McElroy as Secretary of Defense. Although a well-known businessman, McElroy&#x27;s only experience in the federal government prior to 1957 had been as chairman of the White House Conference on Education in 1955–56. Given his background in the industry, and given President Eisenhower&#x27;s predominance in defense matters, McElroy&#x27;s appointment was not unusual. He spelled out his mandate the day he assumed office: &quot;I conceive the role of the Secretary of Defense to be that of captain of President Eisenhower&#x27;s defense team.&quot;

The launching of Sputnik I and a second Soviet satellite a month later prevented McElroy from easing into his duties at a deliberate pace. To meet the concern generated by the sputniks, McElroy attempted both to clarify the relative positions of the United States and the Soviet Union in missile development and to speed up the U.S. effort. Placing considerable emphasis on the intermediate-range ballistic missiles the United States then had under development, McElroy argued that with proper deployment in overseas locations they would serve as effectively as Soviet intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Without waiting for completion of final tests and evaluations, McElroy ordered the Air Force Thor and Army Jupiter IRBMs into production and planned to begin their deployment in the United Kingdom before the end of 1958 and on the European continent shortly thereafter. McElroy also ordered accelerated development of the Navy solid-fuel Polaris IRBM and the Air Force liquid-fuel Atlas and Titan ICBMs.
In February 1958, he authorized the Air Force to begin development of the Minuteman, a solid-fuel ICBM to be deployed in hardened underground silos, with operational status expected in the early 1960s.

McElroy did not believe that the Sputnik success represented a major change in the world&#x27;s military balance, but he acknowledged that it had a significant impact on world public opinion. The launching of the Sputniks indicated that &quot;the Soviet Union is farther advanced scientifically than many had realized&quot; and that &quot;the weapons of the future may be a great deal closer upon us than we had thought, and therefore the ultimate survival of the Nation depends more than ever before on the speed and skill with which we can pursue the development of advanced weapons.&quot; McElroy had to spend much time explaining the missile programs and trying to allay congressional anxiety about a so-called &quot;missile gap&quot; between the United States and the Soviet Union.

McElroy shared some responsibility for the missile gap controversy. When asked whether the United States was behind the Russians in the satellite and missile fields, he responded affirmatively. Later he qualified his statement by noting that while the Soviet Union was ahead in satellites, it was not necessarily ahead in missiles, and he repeatedly pointed out that U.S. IRBMs deployed overseas were just as much a threat to the Soviet Union as Soviet ICBMs deployed in Russia were to the United States. But charges of a missile gap persisted. When he left office in December 1959 McElroy stated that the two nations had about the same number of ICBMs, but that if the USSR built missiles up to its capacity and the United States built those it planned to build, the Soviet Union would probably have more missiles than the United States during the 1961-63 period. The missile gap debate lasted throughout the rest of Eisenhower&#x27;s term and became a prominent issue in the presidential campaign of 1960.
In some measure the Soviet sputniks may have hastened the landmark Defense Reorganization Act of 1958. Although President Eisenhower provided strong leadership in achieving the necessary legislation, McElroy was instrumental in seeing it through. The Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 significantly influenced the evolution of DoD organization and the role of the secretary. McElroy considered the most important aspects of the 1958 reorganization to be the replacement of service executive agents by the JCS in directing the unified commands and the creation of a strong director of defense research and engineering including the Advanced Research Projects Agency headed by Roy Johnson, a vice-president of General Electric.

As always, the budget greatly influenced the shaping of Department of Defense plans and programs. Although the Eisenhower administration maintained a determined interest in controlling expenditures and balancing the budget, McElroy did not place economy above preparedness. A strong supporter of military assistance, he argued effectively for continued congressional and public support for the program. &quot;Military Assistance,&quot; he said, &quot;is to the defense of our Country as fire prevention is to fire fighting. You can have the best, most modern sprinkling system in your factory but it will be useless if you don&#x27;t take steps to prevent fires from getting out of control before they reach your plant.&quot; Nonetheless, he presided over a budget that remained stringent. In spite of public concern about preparedness in the wake of the Russian Sputnik and pressures from Democratic critics to spend more money, the Eisenhower administration did not panic. While it shifted some expenditure priorities, especially toward missile development, production, and deployment, it did not support a drastic increase in the defense budget. The president and Secretary McElroy contended that the budget was adequate to insure the nation&#x27;s security. For the McElroy period, the Defense Department&#x27;s total obligational authority by fiscal year was as follows: 1958, $41.1 billion; 1959, $42.1 billion; and 1960, $40.2 billion.

When McElroy acceded to Eisenhower&#x27;s request in 1957 that he become secretary of defense, he limited his availability to about two years. Although there was criticism that the secretary was leaving just as he had learned the job, McElroy confirmed early in 1959 that he would resign before the end of the year. Speculation that Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles would succeed him ended with Quarles&#x27;s death in May 1959. Secretary of the Navy Thomas S. Gates, Jr., succeeded Quarles, and when McElroy&#x27;s resignation became effective on December 1, 1959, Gates replaced him. Actually, McElroy served longer as secretary of defense than any of his predecessors except Wilson. That same day, President Eisenhower presented McElroy with the Medal of Freedom. After leaving the Pentagon, he returned to Procter &amp; Gamble and became chairman of the board.

==Death==
McElroy died of cancer on November 30, 1972, in Cincinnati at the age of 68. He was survived by his wife Camilla; children Nancy, Barbara, and Malcolm; and nine grandchildren.

<doc id="588451" wikidata="Q7274402" url="?curid=588451" title="R142A (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R142A is the second order of new technology cars (NTTs) for the A Division of the New York City Subway. These cars were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe, Hyōgo, Japan and Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S. with final assembly performed at Yonkers, New York. Together with the R142s, they replaced the Redbird trains, including the R26, R28, R29, R33, R33S, and R36. The R142A fleet initially comprised 600 cars, arranged as five-car units.

The first R142As were delivered on December 20, 1999. The cars initially experienced minor issues while undergoing testing, but entered service on July 10, 2000, as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test. After successful completion, the cars entered revenue service by November 2, 2000. The fleet initially ran on the and services of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. The R142As, along with the R142s, are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. 

In 2010–2016, 380 cars (7211–7590) were retrofitted with communications-based train control (CBTC) for the automation of the Flushing Line and became part of the R188 fleet, leaving 220 cars (7591–7810) in the R142A fleet. In January 2019, the MTA has proposed mid-life upgrades to the remainder of the R142As.

==Description==
The R142As are numbered 7591–7810. They were originally numbered 7211–7810 when built, but cars 7211–7590 were converted into R188s.

The R142A contract was divided into three sub-orders: 400 main order cars (7211–7610), 120 option order cars (7611–7730), and 80 cars built under a supplemental contract (R142S) in 2004–2005 to supplement the R142As (7731–7810). Regardless of sub-order differences, all R142As are mechanically and physically identical to each other.

Currently, all R142As are maintained at the Jerome Yard and assigned to the . 

==Features==

The R142As feature Bombardier MITRAC propulsion, (originally ADtranz) systems, electronic braking, automatic climate control, electronic strip maps, interior and exterior electronic displays, and an on-board intercom system. The traction motors that are present on the R142As were later used for the R143 and R188 fleets; the same traction motors would also be used for the Type 8 light rail vehicles on the Green Line of the MBTA and the CQ31x rail fleet of the MARTA rail system. The R142 and the R142A were partly designed by Antenna Design.

The R142As are divided up into five-car sets, in the A-B-B-B-A configuration, with the two A cars (cab cars) on the ends, and three B cars (non-cab cars) in the middle. Trains consist of two five-car sets coupled together, making up a ten-car train. Like all other A-Division cars, each car has three sets of doors per side. Like the R110As, the R142As feature wider doors than past A-Division equipment, with 54-inch side doors (about 9 inches narrower than the R110As&#x27; 63-inch doors, but 4 inches wider than the R62/As&#x27; 50-inch doors). All car ends have windows, allowing passengers to see through to the next car, except cab ends, where the cab walls prevent such visibility. The R142A car bodies are constructed from stainless steel.

The R142As and R142s are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. All passenger cars built after them also use this feature. The R142As are visually very similar to the R142s and R188s, but due to electrical incompatibilities, the three types are not interoperable; only converted R142As that feature CBTC can interoperate with the R188s.

===Experimental features===
From late 2017 to late 2018, the interiors of the electronic sign boxes on cars 7691–7692 were retrofitted with LCD screens, replacing the MTA Arts for Transit cards usually located there. Several R160s were previously retrofitted with this feature. The screens were similar to the interior LED screens on the R143s, except that the R142As&#x27; screens had the capabilities to display multiple colors instead of only red, orange, and green.

==History==
===Delivery===
The first ten R142As, 7211–7220, were delivered on December 20, 1999. The cars were placed into service on the on July 10, 2000, as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test, after several months of non-revenue service testing and the resolving of all issues. After successful completion, it entered revenue service on November 2, 2000. The R142A fleet originally only ran on the ; the first R142As assigned to the started running on July 25, 2002.

During delivery, there were minor issues reported with the R142s and the R142As.

By October 29, 2002, all R142As would have entered passenger service.

In mid-2003, the MTA purchased a supplemental order of 80 additional R142As (7731–7810) for service increases. These cars were constructed and delivered in 2004–2005, and by June 2005, all were in service.

===Post-delivery===
Cars 7211–7590 (a total of 380 cars) have been retrofitted with CBTC for the Flushing Line CBTC service and were converted to R188s. The first R142As (7211–7220) were sent out to the Kawasaki Rail Car plant in Yonkers in 2011 for conversion to R188s. The last R142As (7581–7590) to be sent to the Kawasaki Rail Car plant were removed from service on March 18, 2016, and by the next month had also been sent to the plant.

Cars 7591–7810 (the remaining 220 cars) are still part of the R142A fleet and will be retrofitted with CBTC hardware in the future. To prepare for the arrival of the R62As for use on the 6 train, 65 unconverted R142As (7591–7595 &amp; 7611–7670) were transferred from the to the in November 2017, and the last 15 R142As (7596–7610) were transferred from the to the on May 22, 2018.

In January 2019, the MTA proposed mid-life upgrades to several train subsystems in the R142 and R142A fleets. These included changes to the HVAC, propulsion, and door systems, based on installations of these systems in the R188 fleet. Upgrades also included the conversion of the remaining R142A fleet to be compatible with communications-based train control, in conjunction with subway signal upgrades along the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

<text>Wawatam (&quot;little goose&quot;) (&quot;fl.&quot; 1762 – 1764) was an 18th-century Odawa chief who lived in the northern region of present-day Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula in an area along the Lake Michigan shoreline known by the Odawa as Waganawkezee (&quot;it is bent&quot;).

==Life==
Wawatam was likely born near the Odawa Middle Village, Anamiewatigoing, now Cross Village. He is known through his rescue of and friendship with British fur trader Alexander Henry the elder from the Ojibwas following the capture of Fort Michilimackinac in June 1763 during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. Wawatam, the leader and patriarch of an extended family of Odawa, rescued Henry after he had initially become an Ojibwe possession as a spoil of war, and soon thereafter, again came to Henry&#x27;s rescue by hiding him in a Cave on nearby Mackinac Island. For nearly a year after this second rescue (1763-1764), he lived as part of Wawatam&#x27;s family, following them on their seasonal moves to hunting and fishing areas inland from Lake Michigan. Henry&#x27;s observations of Odawa hunting and living practices became a significant contribution to Algonquian anthropology.

Henry later returned to &quot;civilization.&quot; Successful as a fur trader in later life, he always credited Wawatam with saving his life. The 18th century fort, scene of Wawatam&#x27;s rescue of Henry, has been reconstructed and is now an active living history museum. The site is located just west of downtown Mackinaw City at the Lower Peninsula&#x27;s headland.

==Legacy==
On the dock at St. Ignace and within shadow distance from the Wawatam Lighthouse is a tall wooden statue honoring Chief Wawatam which was erected in 2012 by the City of St. Ignace, Michigan. It was designed and carved by Tom Paquin and Sally Paquin, local artists.

*Wawatam Township, Emmet County, Michigan, the northernmost township of Emmet County where Fort Michilimackinac is located, is named after Wawatam.
*&quot;SS Chief Wawatam&quot;, a coal-fired train ferry and icebreaker that operated in the Straits of Mackinac between 1911–1984 was named in his honor.

<text>Thomas Sovereign Gates Jr. (April 10, 1906March 25, 1983) was an American politician and diplomat who served as Secretary of Defense from 1959 to 1961 and Secretary of the Navy from 1957 to 1959, both under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. During his tenure as Secretary of Defense, he established a task force to set nuclear target priorities. He also authorized U-2 reconnaissance flights, including the flight of Francis Gary Powers.

Later in his career, he served as the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, appointed by President Gerald Ford.

==Early life and career==
Born in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Gates was the son of Thomas S. Gates Sr., an investment banker and lawyer who was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 1944, and his wife, Marie (&quot;née&quot; Rogers) Gates. Gates graduated from Chestnut Hill Academy, an all-male private preparatory school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1924. He was then accepted into the University of Pennsylvania, where his father was serving on the university&#x27;s board of trustees. At Penn, Gates managed the Penn Quakers football team and was a member of the school&#x27;s basketball team, where in March 1928, he was arrested along with 16 other students with charges of inciting a riot after Penn defeated Princeton to become Intercollegiate League champions. A member of Zeta Psi fraternity, and Phi Beta Kappa society, Gates graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in English in 1928.

Gates married the former Millicent Anne Brengle on September 29, 1928. They had one son and three daughters. After graduating, he joined his father&#x27;s Philadelphia-based investment banking firm, Drexel and Company. In the early to mid-1930s he worked as a bond salesman at Drexel, and later moved to New York City for two years where he was an apprentice for J.P. Morgan &amp; Company. Gates became a full partner at Drexel and Company in 1940.

During World War II he served in the Navy, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander, and participated in campaigns in the Pacific and Mediterranean areas. He was released from active duty in October 1945.

==Political career==
President Eisenhower appointed Gates Under Secretary of the Navy in October 1953 and Secretary on 1 April 1957, positions in which he earned the president&#x27;s approval. It was a foregone conclusion when Gates became Defense Secretary Neil McElroy&#x27;s deputy on 8 June 1959 that he would succeed him. He entered office with an impressive background of active military experience and more than six years in the Department of Defense.

As a top-level DoD official since 1953, Gates was familiar with the 1953 and 1958 Defense Department reorganizations. Believing that the Secretary of Defense had all the authority he needed and that time should be allowed for evaluation of the long range effects of the 1958 amendments, he discouraged efforts to further revamp the department. As a former Secretary of the Navy who had observed the gradual downgrading of service secretary positions, he felt that the service secretaries should play a more important role, and he encouraged them to do so.

===Relationship with the Joint Chiefs===
Gates cultivated a good working relationship with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Less than a month after becoming secretary, he reminded the chiefs of their responsibility to apprise him of disputes and proposed to meet with them in order to expedite settlement or bring the issue to the president&#x27;s attention for final resolution. Soon Gates and the JCS met on a regular basis, not just in instances when the Chiefs disagreed. Congressional and other sources applauded Gates for taking the initiative in improving both the JCS organization and the secretary&#x27;s relations with it.

Another important Gates initiative was the creation in August 1960 of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS). Previously, inadequate coordination of targeting plans between the Strategic Air Command and the Navy led to redundancy and disputed priorities. These differences became especially significant with the advent of the Navy&#x27;s sea-based Polaris ballistic missiles. Acting on a proposal by SAC Commander in Chief General Thomas S. Power that SAC control strategic weapons targeting, Gates set up the JSTPS. The SAC commander, supported by an integrated joint staff, assumed separate duties as director of strategic target planning, to be, as Gates indicated, &quot;the planning agent for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in developing and keeping up to date the detailed plans which are necessary.&quot;

When Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh A. Burke objected to the new arrangement, Gates encouraged him to argue his case with President Eisenhower, who ultimately upheld Gates&#x27;s decision. Thereafter Burke supported the JSTPS and assigned to it highly qualified naval officers.

By December 1960 the JSTPS had prepared the first Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), which specified for various attack options the timing, weapons, delivery systems, and targets to be used by U.S. strategic forces.

===Role in defense policy===
Gates devoted more time than his predecessors Charles E. Wilson and Neil H. McElroy to the development of basic defense policy, a sphere in which the president remained dominant. While he instituted no radical departure from the New Look approach, the changing nature of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, the related assumed need for continental defense systems, and the pressing question of how to respond to local or &quot;limited&quot; wars, dictated a gradual shift in defense policy.

As Gates pointed out at a congressional hearing in January 1960, the two principal U.S. defense objectives were &quot;to deter the outbreak of general war by maintaining and improving our present capability to retaliate with devastating effectiveness in case of a major attack upon us or our allies&quot; and &quot;to maintain, together with our allies, a capability to apply to local situations the degree of force necessary to deter local wars, or to win or contain them promptly if they do break out.&quot;

Gates saw no clear distinction between general war and limited war forces. As he put it, &quot;All forces are a deterrent to and would be employed in a general war. Most of our forces could be employed in a limited war, if required.&quot; He noted as an example that aircraft carriers &quot;are probably the country&#x27;s best limited war capability initially because they are deployed in the world&#x27;s trouble zones and they have on-the-spot ability to react&quot;; yet, he added, they could contribute to the strategic offensive forces during general war.

===Views on strategic weapons===
During Gates&#x27;s tenure, two missile elements—the ICBM and the submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) -- joined the manned bomber to form a &quot;triad&quot; of strategic nuclear delivery systems. Also during this period, there occurred movement toward greater emphasis on counterforce targeting a potential enemy&#x27;s military installations and forces. Not only was the United States developing or beginning to deploy a variety of missile systems during this period-Atlas, Titan, Minuteman, and Polaris-but so was the Soviet Union.

The USSR&#x27;s emphasis on the land-based ICBM rather than the manned bomber as its primary strategic delivery system presaged a threat of such magnitude to the United States that, together with the Sputnik shock, it forced an acceleration in the pace of U.S. missile development.

Gates, like McElroy, had to contend with the &quot;missile gap&quot; controversy. He regarded it as a false issue, based on the failure of missile gap believers to distinguish between space and military programs. When the U.S. long-range ballistic missile program began in the early 1950s, Gates observed, the development of small, lightweight nuclear warheads by American scientists made it possible for smaller ballistic missiles to carry them.

The Russians, on the other hand, concentrated on very large boosters that they used to launch space satellites earlier than the United States. Gates told a House committee, &quot;We are not behind the Russians in our military effort overall . . . . It is one thing to admit you are behind in the ability to put big payloads in space for which we have at the moment no military requirement, and another thing to admit that we are behind in our total military posture.&quot;

Gates conceded that the Soviets might have more strategic missiles than the United States for a few years, perhaps peaking in 1962, but he denied that there was a real missile or deterrent gap; the Soviets would not &quot;gain a strategic posture which might tempt them to initiate a surprise attack.&quot; Gates based his thinking in part on a debatable approach to intelligence estimates, which took account of Soviet intentions as well as capabilities, leading to the conclusion that the disparity between the number of Soviet and U.S. missiles by 1962 or 1963 would not be as great as estimated during the McElroy period.

===Views on collective security===
Like all of his predecessors, Gates supported U.S. participation in collective security pacts and military assistance programs. He identified NATO as the nucleus of the U.S. &quot;forward strategy.&quot; As he put it, &quot;Should we ever abandon our forward strategy in favor of the so-called &#x27;Fortress America&#x27; concept, we would retreat forever.&quot; He urged Congress to continue adequate funding for military assistance, which had brought very high returns for the money spent.

===The U-2 controversy===
Perhaps the most spectacular event of Gates&#x27;s administration occurred on 1 May 1960 when the Soviet Union shot down over its territory a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft piloted by Francis Gary Powers. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced the incident four days later and accused the United States of spying, the Eisenhower administration initially suggested that the plane might have strayed into Soviet airspace.

On the recommendation of representatives from the State and Defense departments, including Gates, President Eisenhower later admitted that the U-2 was on an intelligence-gathering mission (actually under CIA control) and assumed responsibility for the flight. In mid-May Gates accompanied Eisenhower to Paris for a summit meeting that had been scheduled prior to the U-2 affair. There Khrushchev demanded termination of all U.S. flights over the Soviet Union, an apology, and punishment of those responsible.

Eisenhower indicated that the flights would not be resumed but rejected the other demands, whereupon Khrushchev refused to proceed with the summit meeting. Gates suggested later that the Russian leader used the U-2 crisis to abort a meeting that he had determined in advance would not result in gains for the Soviet Union.

On the eve of the summit conference, Gates ordered a worldwide alert of U.S. military communications facilities a decision criticized by some as provocative. Stoutly defending his action, Gates later explained that he decided, with the concurrence of Eisenhower and Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, to call the alert when he became aware of the belligerent position Khrushchev intended to take when the summit convened the next day. &quot;Under the circumstances,&quot; Gates said, &quot;it seemed most prudent to me to increase the awareness of our unified commanders. Moreover, since the command and individuals concerned in the decision process, including the President, the Secretary of State, and myself, were overseas, it was important to check out our military communications.&quot;

Although Gates adhered to the usual budget posture and strategy of the Eisenhower administration, there was 8.2 percent real growth in DoD&#x27;s fiscal year 1961 budget after Congress completed its work. Total obligational authority amounted to $44.6 billion, almost $4.4 billion over the previous year. The bulk of the increase went to the Navy and the Air Force. Gates pressed for an appropriation of $2 billion for military assistance, most of which Congress provided. To criticism of the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s continuing efforts to hold down the DoD budget, Gates replied that the department was spending enough money to meet the nation&#x27;s vital security needs.

===Summary of Gates&#x27; tenure as defense secretary===

In a lengthy statement entitled &quot;Department of Defense, 1953-1960,&quot; prepared at the close of Gates&#x27;s tenure, the Department of Defense summarized its accomplishments during the Eisenhower years, concluding that &quot;today our armed forces have the greatest striking power in our history, many times greater than in 1953.&quot;

Among other accomplishments, it cited development of medium- and long-range bombers (including the B-52s put into service during the 1950s) and ICBMs; installation of a continental defense system the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW) Line, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), and Nike surface-to-air missile systems; production of several nuclear submarines, beginning with the Nautilus in 1954, and &quot;Forrestal&quot;-type carriers; and creation of the Defense Communications Agency.

Gates retired from office on 20 January 1961. There were those who regarded him as the first of a new breed of secretaries of defense who would take a more active management approach evidenced by his regular meetings with the JCS and establishment of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff. Gates, of course, had the advantages of long prior service in DoD and the expanded authority of the office resulting from the 1953 and 1958 reorganizations.

Although President Eisenhower continued to be, as during the Wilson and McElroy periods, the chief author of defense policy and the ultimate decision-maker, Gates appeared to operate with more authority and independence than his immediate predecessors, especially in areas such as strategic policy and planning.

After John F. Kennedy&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1960, the press speculated that he might include a Republican in his cabinet and that Gates would be high on the list of possible appointees.

==Later career and honors==
On January 18, 1961, Gates was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. After he left at The Pentagon, Gates joined Morgan and Company in New York, later the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, which eventually became the J.P Morgan Bank, becoming president in 1962 and chairman and chief executive officer in 1965. President Richard M. Nixon appointed him chairman of the Advisory Commission on an All-Volunteer Force, which presented its recommendations to end the draft on February 21, 1970. From 1976 to 1977 he served, with the rank of ambassador, as chief of the United States Liaison Office in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Gates served as a Trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1948 to 1983 and received an honorary degree of an LL.D. from Penn, his alma mater, in 1956. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the College of the Atlantic during the periods 1972–1976 and 1978–1983. The community center at College of the Atlantic is named in his honor.

Gates died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 25, 1983, at the age of 76.

==Namesake==
The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; (CG-51) is named after the late Secretary of Defense. It is the only such cruiser named after a person.

<doc id="588472" wikidata="Q116737" url="?curid=588472" title="The Curragh">
<text>The Curragh ( ; ) is a flat open plain in County Kildare, Ireland. This area is well known for horse breeding and training. The Irish National Stud is on the edge of Kildare town, beside the Japanese Gardens. Pollardstown Fen, the largest fen in Ireland, is of particular interest to botanists and ecologists because of the numerous bird species that nest and visit there. There are also many rare plants that grow there.

It is composed of a sandy soil, formed after an esker deposited a sand load, and as a result has excellent drainage characteristics.

== History ==

Used as a meeting site during Pre-Christian societies, the Curragh is shrouded in mythology. The hill to the north of the Curragh is called the Hill of Allen (Almhain) and is the purported meeting place of the mythical Fianna. Legend has it that in about 480 AD, when St Brigid became intent on founding a monastery in Kildare, she asked the High King of Leinster for the land on which to build it. When he granted her as much land as her cloak would cover, she then placed her cloak on the ground to cover the entire Curragh plain.

On 1 April 1234, The 3rd Earl of Pembroke lost a battle at the Curragh against a group of men loyal to Henry III of England. Lord Pembroke was wounded in the battle and died at his castle at Kilkenny on 16 April.
It was a common site for mustering the armies of the Pale (see Essex in Ireland). During the 1798 Rebellion there was a massacre in the Curragh at Gibbet Rath. The Curragh Camp is now located there, where the Irish Defence Forces undergo training.

At a natural bowl-shaped amphitheatre on the Curragh known locally as Donnelly&#x27;s Hollow the Irish champion boxer Dan Donnelly defeated the English champion George Cooper in 1815, before a large crowd. Donnelly had a famed reach and the remains of his arm were on show until recently in the Hideout Pub in the nearby town of Kilcullen.

In 1866, a commission was appointed by the British Treasury to report into the use made of the Curragh and make recommendations on legislation. It reported in 1868, and led to the Curragh of Kildare Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 60).

On 2 January 1941 the Curragh was bombed by the Luftwaffe, the air force of the Third Reich, causing slight damage. One SC250 bomb remains unaccounted for.

== Legal recognition ==
The earliest mention of the Curragh in legal documents was 1299, when an act was passed, to prevent swine from feeding on the Curragh plains to the detriment of the sward.

In 1865 Parliament set up a commission to examine the Curragh. The findings of this led to the enactment of the (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 60). This created the honorary position of a Ranger tasked with the care, management and preservation of the Curragh for the purpose of horseracing and training of horses.

The 1868 act also provided for a second commission to report on the use of the Curragh for common pasture. This report is detailed in the (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 74). This act specifies sheep grazing rights for the Curragh.

On the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the lands of the Curragh passed from the Crown to the Minister for Finance of the Irish State.

The Curragh of Kildare Act 1961 repealed the 1868 Act and sections of the 1870 Act. It also abolished the office of the Ranger and transferred its duties to the Department of Defence.

== Military ==
There has been a permanent military presence in the Curragh since 1856. The Curragh Camp is now home to the Defence Forces Training Centre of the Irish Defence Forces.

=== Wrens of the Curragh ===

Records of women, known as Wrens of the Curragh, who were paid for sex work by soldiers at the camp, go back to the 1840s. They lived in &#x27;nests&#x27; half-hollowed out of banks and ditches, which were covered in furze bushes; their lifestyle was communal – money and resources were shared amongst the (up to 60) women who lived there. Whilst many women were sex workers, others had common-law marriages to soldiers but were barred from living within the camp itself. The women&#x27;s presence is no longer reported after the 1880s.

==Sport==

===Horse racing===
The Curragh Racecourse on the plain is Ireland&#x27;s Premier Flat Racecourse. Every year, it hosts all five classic races in the racing calendar: the Irish Derby Stakes, the Irish Oaks, the Irish 1,000 Guineas, the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Irish St. Leger.

===Motor racing===
On 2 July 1903, the Gordon Bennett Cup ran through the Curragh. It was the first international motor race to be held in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the United Kingdom (as it existed then), and Ireland was suggested as the venue because racing was illegal on British public roads. Following a lobbying campaign, local laws were adjusted, and Kildare was chosen on the basis of the straightness of its roads. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which later became known as British racing green. The route consisted of several loops of a circuit that passed-through Kilcullen, the Curragh, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally, Castledermot, Carlow, and Athy. The race was won by the Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes.

After The Emergency both motor cars and motorcycle racing took place on occasions drawing crowds up to 30,000. For eight years from 1947 until 1954 cars competed, while motorcycle racing continued until 1967. The first race was run by the Leinster Motor Club on 12 July 1947 over a course known as the &quot;Short circuit&quot; but eight years later the death of Don Beauman during at a different Irish venue plus other fatal racing accidents in 1955 brought an end to motor car racing at the Curragh. The 1951 Wakefield Trophy was won by the then 22-year-old Stirling Moss.

==Education==
The Curragh Camp has one primary school which is a mixed school called St Catherine of Sienna. It has one secondary school which is scheduled to close in 2024 formally named the Curragh Post Primary School (PPS), which has been situated beside the parade ground since 1933. With the closure of the secondary school on the Curragh Camp the Curragh will no longer have a secondary school.

<text>Compact car is a vehicle size class—predominantly used in North America—that sits between subcompact cars and mid-size cars. &quot;Small family car&quot; is a British term and a part of the C-segment in the European car classification. However, before the downsizing of the United States car industry in the 1970s and 1980s, larger vehicles with wheelbases up to were considered &quot;compact cars&quot; in the United States.

In Japan, small size passenger vehicle is a registration category that sits between kei cars and regular cars, based on overall size and engine displacement limits.

== United States ==
=== Current definition ===
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &quot;Fuel Economy Regulations for 1977 and Later Model Year&quot; (dated July 1996) includes definitions for classes of automobiles. Based on the combined passenger and cargo volume, compact cars are defined as having an &quot;interior volume index&quot; of .

=== 1930s to 1950s ===
The beginnings of U.S. production of compact cars were the late 1940s prototypes of economy cars, including the Chevrolet Cadet and the Ford Light Car. Neither car reached production in the U.S., however Ford SAF in France bought the plans of the &quot;small Ford&quot; and produced the Ford Vedette.

The first U.S.-produced postwar compact car was the 1950 Nash Rambler. It was built on a wheelbase, which was nonetheless still a large car by contemporary European standards. The term &quot;compact&quot; was coined by a Nash executive as a euphemism for small cars with a wheelbase of or less. It established a new market segment and the U.S. automobile industry soon adopted the &quot;compact&quot; term.

Several competitors to the Nash Rambler arose from the ranks of America&#x27;s other independent automakers, although none enjoyed the long-term success of the Rambler. Other early compact cars included the Kaiser-Frazer Henry J (also re-badged as the Allstate), the Willys Aero and the Hudson Jet.

In 1954, 64,500 cars sold in the U.S. were imports or small American cars, out of a total market of five million cars. Market research indicated that five percent of those surveyed said they would consider a small car, suggesting a potential market size of 275,000 cars. By 1955, the Nash Rambler that began as a convertible model became a success and was now available in station wagon, hardtop, and sedan body styles. During the Recession of 1958, the only exception to the sales decline was American Motors with its compact, economy-oriented Ramblers that saw high demand among cautious consumers.

By 1959, sales of small imported cars also increased to 14% of the U.S. passenger car market, as consumers turned to compact cars. By this time, smaller cars appealed to people with a college education and a higher income whose families were buying more than one car. Customers expected compact cars to provide improved fuel economy compared to full-sized cars while maintaining headroom, legroom, and plenty of trunk space.

Between 1958 and 1960, the major U.S. car manufacturers made a push toward compact cars, resulting in the introduction of the Studebaker Lark, Chevrolet Corvair, Ford Falcon, and Plymouth Valiant. These models also gave rise to compact vans built on the compact car platforms, such as the Studebaker Zip Van, Chevrolet Corvair Greenbrier, Ford Econoline, and Dodge A100.

=== 1960s ===
During the 1960s, compacts were the smallest class of North American cars, but they had evolved into only slightly smaller versions of the 6-cylinder or V8-powered six-passenger sedan. They were much larger than compacts (and sometimes even mid-sizers) by European manufacturers, which were typically five-passenger four-cylinder engine cars. Nevertheless, advertising and road tests for the Ford Maverick and the Rambler American made comparisons with the popular Volkswagen Beetle.

Compact cars were also the basis for a new small car segment that became known as the pony car, named after the Ford Mustang, which was built on the Falcon chassis. At that time, there was a distinct difference in size between compact and full-size models. Early definitions of vehicle size class were based on wheelbase, with models under 111 inches as compact, 111 to 118 inches intermediate, and over 118 inches as full size, at least until EPA classes based on interior volume of the passenger and cargo compartments were introduced in the late 1970s.
=== 1970s ===

In the early 1970s, the domestic automakers introduced even smaller subcompact cars that included the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto.

In 1973, the Energy Crisis started, which made small fuel-efficient cars more desirable, and the North American driver began exchanging their large cars for the smaller, imported compacts that cost less to fill up and were inexpensive to maintain.

The 1977 model year marked the beginning of a downsizing of all vehicles so that cars such as the AMC Concord and the Ford Fairmont that replaced the compacts were re-classified as mid-size, while cars inheriting the size of the Ford Pinto and Chevrolet Vega (such as the Ford Escort and Chevrolet Cavalier) became classified as compact cars. Even after the reclassification, mid-size American cars were still far larger than mid-size cars from other countries and were more similar in size to cars classified as &quot;large cars&quot; in Europe. It would not be until the 1980s that American cars were being downsized to truly international dimensions.

=== 1980s to present ===


In the 1985 model year, compact cars classified by the EPA included Ford&#x27;s Escort and Tempo as well as the Chevrolet Cavalier. For the 2019 model year, the best sellers were the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic.
== Japan ==

=== Definition ===
In Japan, vehicles that are larger than kei cars, but with dimensions smaller than long, wide, high and with engines at or under are classified as &quot;small size&quot; cars.

Small-size cars are identified by a license plate number beginning with &quot;5&quot;. In the past, the small size category has received tax benefits stipulated by the Japanese government regulations, such as those in the 1951 Road Vehicle Act. 

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
In 1955, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set forth a goal to all Japanese makers at that time to create what was called a &quot;national car&quot;. The concept stipulated that the vehicle be able to maintain a maximum speed over 100 km/h (62 mph), weigh below 400 kg (882 lbs), fuel consumption at or more, at an average speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) on a level road, and not require maintenance or significant service for at least . This established a &quot;compact car&quot; target that was larger than what has become known as the &quot;light car&quot; or the kei car. 

One of the first compact cars that met those requirements was the Toyota Publica with an air-cooled two-cylinder opposed engine, the Datsun 110 series, and the Mitsubishi 500. The Publica and the Mitsubishi 500 were essentially &quot;kei cars&quot; with engines larger than regulations permitted at the time, while the Datsun was an all-new vehicle. These vehicles were followed by the Hino Contessa in 1961, the Isuzu Bellett, Daihatsu Compagno and Mazda Familia in 1963, the Mitsubishi Colt in 1965, and the Nissan Sunny, Subaru 1000, and Toyota Corolla in 1966. Honda introduced its first four-door sedan in 1969, called the Honda 1300. In North America, these cars were classified as subcompact cars.

=== 1970s to present ===
By 1970, Nissan released its first front-wheel-drive car which was originally developed by Prince Motor Company which had merged with Nissan in 1966. This was introduced in 1970 as the Nissan Cherry. In 1972, the Honda Civic appeared with the CVCC engine that was able to meet California emission standards without the use of a catalytic converter.

== Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, the concept of compact cars is significant. The most common cars tend to be Kei cars.

Popular compact cars in recent times are the Honda City, Toyota Yaris, Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6, and the Changan Alsvin.

<doc id="588478" wikidata="Q7274769" url="?curid=588478" title="R46 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R46 is a New York City Subway car model that was built by the Pullman Standard Company from 1975 to 1978 for the IND/BMT B Division. They replaced all remaining R1–9 fleet cars and General Electric-powered R16s, and some R10s. The R46 order initially consisted of 754 single cars, each long, and was the largest single order of passenger cars in United States railroad history at the point of the fleet&#x27;s completion. The R46 was the second order of 75-foot cars to be ordered for the New York City Subway, after the R44s.

The first R46s ran in passenger service on July 14, 1975. The fleet was initially slated to be delivered between 1973 and 1975, but a strike at Pullman&#x27;s factory delayed final deliveries until 1978. Several hundred cracks were found in the R46 trucks during their first few years of service, leading them to be referred to as &quot;the most troubled cars ever purchased&quot;. Morrison–Knudsen rebuilt the R46s in 1990–1992. The R211 order is replacing the entire fleet of R46s, and as such are expected to remain in service until the mid-2020s.

==Description==

The R46s are numbered 5482–6207 and 6208–6258 (even numbers only). 5482–6207 were originally numbered 500–1227 (except numbers 941 &amp; 1054, as those two cars were scrapped prior to overhaul), and 6208–6258 were originally numbered 1228–1278 (even numbers only). The R46 order consisted of 754 single cars, originally planned to be 745, that were numbered from 500 to 1278. Even cars with cabs are A cars; odd cars without cabs are B cars. The cars cost about $285,000 each. Like the previous R44s, the R46s are long. Like the R44s, due to their length, they cannot safely run on particular segments of the BMT Eastern Division (the , , and ).

The R46s were constructed with sheet rubber floors, plastic seats, fluorescent lighting, spaces for ceiling advertisements, and the use of air springs instead of heavy metal springs. The change in springs reduced noisy and bumpy rides. The cars were not equipped with straphangers like previous models. Instead, horizontal bars that passengers could hold on to were installed. The cars were built with air-conditioning.

Currently, the cars maintained at Pitkin Yard run on the , , and Rockaway Park Shuttle, while those maintained at Coney Island Yard run on the , , and .

==History==
===Delivery===

On April 7, 1972, Pullman Standard bid on the contract for 900 subway cars, and it was the highest bidder. It put in a bid of $273,000 per car, or $246 million for the entire contract. Other bidders included General Electric, Rohr Industries, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The cars were to be constructed almost identically to the R44s. Once the order was awarded to Pullman Standard, the cars were constructed at the company&#x27;s shops on the South Side of Chicago. The subway car order was the largest single order of passenger cars in United States railroad history at the point of the fleet&#x27;s completion.

Once the order was reduced to 754 cars, the entire cost of the order was reduced to $210.5 million. The first cars were expected to be tested in the NYC Subway by October 1973, and all of the cars were expected to be delivered by October 15, 1975. However, the first two trains of R46s were placed in service on the and on July 14, 1975, with a brief ceremony at 34th Street–Herald Square, attended by Mayor Abraham Beame and MTA Chairman David Yunich. Due to a strike at the Pullman Company on October 1, 1977, along with other problems, the final R46s entered service in December 1978, three years behind schedule.

====Manufacturing problems and incidents====
In March 1977, there was a crack found in the frame of one of the lightweight trucks built by Rockwell International, which resulted in a motor breaking loose from the truck&#x27;s transom arms, striking an axle. By 1978, cracks were found in 264 R46 trucks. Because of these problems, all R46s had to be checked three times per week for truck cracks. In February 1978, 889 cracks were found in 547 of the trucks. The cracking was such a bad problem that on June 14, 1979, New York City Mayor Koch ordered R46s with trucks that had two or more cracks out of service. Then, more than 1,200 cracks had been found by that day, and they were classified into seven types. There was an account that called the R46s &quot;the most troubled cars ever purchased&quot;. By this time, the number of cracks had almost doubled, from 889 cracks found in February 1979 to 1,700 in March 1980. In order to keep track of the R46s&#x27; structural issues, they were inspected several times a week. In September 1980, two types of cracks that were not seen before were found on the trucks. As a result of the R46 fleet&#x27;s mechanical issues, the NYCTA sought to minimize their usage – limiting them to rush-hour service – until their defective parts could be replaced.

In July 1979, Pullman Standard informed the MTA that the hand brake assemblies for the R46 were problematic. In late July 1979, inspections revealed that the steel where the car body was joined to the truck was wearing away, a severe safety issue. At the end of 1979, many other flaws were discovered in the R46 fleet, and the Transit Authority filed another US$80 million charge against Pullman Standard and a number of other subcontractors. These lawsuits invalidated an agreement made with Pullman by executive director John G. DeRoos for US$1.5 million in spare parts to remedy the defects.

In 1983, organizations for the blind stated that the gaps in between R44 and R46 cars were dangerous, since the blind could mistake the spaces for doorways.

On April 26, 1986, cars 1054 and 941 were heavily damaged when an E train hit the tunnel wall near Jamaica–179th Street. The accident occurred because the 54-year-old motorman, Alick Williams of Saint Albans, had a heart attack; he died at the scene. The two damaged cars were scrapped on June 4, 1987.

===General Overhaul Program===
From 1990 to 1992, Morrison–Knudsen of Hornell, New York, rebuilt the remaining 752 R46s through the NYCTA&#x27;s General Overhaul Program (GOH). During the GOH, the fleet received the same LCD destination signs as the R44s, replacing the older rollsigns. The blue stripes on the side of the cars were removed, resulting in the appearance of an entirely unpainted car body (the fiberglass ends remain painted silver to match the stainless sides). Other improvements included the rebuilding of all mechanical systems and making the R46 more compatible with other car types. Also, their trouble-prone WABCO RT-5 or P-Wire braking system was removed and replaced with a more reliable NYAB Newtran SMEE braking/control system.

After their overhaul, the R46s were renumbered 5482–6258 in the mid-1990s. Cars 5482–6205 were linked in sets of four, cars 6208–6258 (even only) were linked up as A-A pairs, and cars 6206–6207 were configured as one A-B married pair. Due to the overhaul, the fleet&#x27;s reliability has vastly improved, and the R46 is no longer considered to be the lemon that it once was.

===Post-overhaul and mishaps===
Since the late 2000s, the R46s have undergone intermittent rounds of scheduled maintenance as their parts age over time to extend their usefulness until their retirement. As of January 2024, the R46s are the oldest active subway cars, and the second oldest active rolling stock within the NYCT system, at years old, behind the R44s still in operation on the Staten Island Railway.

On May 2, 2014, set 5742–5745 was involved in a derailment due to track defects while running on the F. The whole set was pulled from service, but was repaired and returned to service in February 2016.

On June 27, 2017, set 6150–6153 was involved in a derailment north of 125th Street while running on the A. The whole set was pulled from service. Cars 6150–6151 suffered body damage as they collided with tunnel columns and were retired. Car 6151 was briefly retained and fitted with strip maps, colored wraps, and had some seats removed to serve as a non-operational mockup for future retrofits, all as a part of the 2017 action plan. Meanwhile, cars 6152–6153 were linked with cars 6206–6207 to create a new four-car set and re-entered service.

On September 20, 2020, set 6062–6065 was involved in a derailment at 14th Street while running on the A when a man placed track tie plates onto the main rails, causing the train to derail. The whole set was taken out of service. Car 6062 suffered body damage as it collided with track-side columns and was retired. Meanwhile, cars 6063–6065 were linked with car 6212 to create a new four-car set and re-entered service. Car 6214, no longer paired with a mate, was subsequently taken out of service and remains in storage.

Set 5550–5553 was involved in a shooting in April 2022 and has been out of service ever since the incident. The car in which the shooting occurred was separated from the rest of the set.

===Retirement===
In 1981, the New York Transit Authority&#x27;s car replacement program estimated that the R46s would be replaced in 2011. However, the MTA now estimates the cars to remain in service until the mid-2020s, when they will be replaced by the R211s. With the R211A fleet now entering service, the R46 fleet is being gradually phased out starting from spring 2024, and at least 48 cars were retired by that July.

<text>Ernest Bloch (; ; July 24, 1880 – July 15, 1959) was a Swiss-born American composer. Bloch was a preeminent artist in his day, and left a lasting legacy. He is recognized as one of the greatest Swiss composers in history. Several of his most notable compositions reflect his Jewish heritage. As well as producing musical scores, Bloch had an academic career that culminated in his recognition as Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley in 1952.

==Biography==
Bloch was born in Geneva on July 24, 1880, to Jewish parents. He began playing the violin at age 9, and began composing soon after. He studied music at the conservatory in Brussels, where his teachers included the celebrated Belgian violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. He then traveled around Europe, moving to Germany (where he studied composition from 1900 to 1901 with Iwan Knorr at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt), on to Paris in 1903 and back to Geneva before settling in the United States in 1916, taking US citizenship in 1924. He held several teaching appointments in the US, where his pupils included George Antheil, Frederick Jacobi, Quincy Porter, Bernard Rogers, and Roger Sessions. 

In 1917, Bloch became the first teacher of composition at Mannes School of Music, a post he held for three years. In December 1920 he was appointed the first Musical Director of the newly formed Cleveland Institute of Music, a post he held until 1925. In 1919 the San Francisco Symphony gave two of the earliest performances of his &quot;Schelomo&quot;, receiving high praise from multiple critics. Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead of the newly named San Francisco Conservatory of Music visited Bloch in Cleveland in 1923 and invited him to teach at the Conservatory the following summer. He had previously been encouraged to come to San Francisco by Alfred Hertz and Temple Emanu El cantor Reuben Rinder. In 1925 Bloch resigned from the Cleveland Institute, where he had not been happy, and relocated to San Francisco. He was named the director of the Conservatory and remained in that position until 1930, when the school was running low on funds. He returned to Switzerland, where he composed his &quot;Avodath Hakodesh&quot; (&quot;Sacred Service&quot;) before returning to the US in 1939.
Bloch joined the music faculty at Berkeley in 1941 and taught there one semester each year until his retirement in 1952. He and his wife lived primarily in the small coastal community of Agate Beach, Oregon (now Newport). In 1947 he was among the founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory.

In 1952 he was named a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, even though he had not been a full-time faculty member. He composed &quot;In Memoriam&quot; that year after the death of Ada Clement.

He died on July 15, 1959, in Portland, Oregon, of cancer at the age of 78. In keeping with a special tradition, his daughter, Lucienne Bloch, and her husband, Steve Dimitroff, prepared several death masks of Ernest Bloch. This once-common practice was usually undertaken to create a memento or portrait of the deceased, but it is unusual for an immediate family member to make the death mask. The Center for Creative Photography and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music each have a copy of Bloch&#x27;s death mask.

==Music==
Bloch&#x27;s compositions - in particular the &quot;Suite hébraïque&quot; for viola and orchestra, &quot;Baal Shem&quot; for violin and piano (later orchestrated) and &quot;Schelomo&quot; for cello and orchestra - often reflect his Jewish heritage. Bloch&#x27;s father had at one stage intended to become a rabbi, and the young Ernest had a strong religious upbringing; as an adult he felt that to write music that expressed his Jewish identity was &quot;the only way in which I can produce music of vitality and significance&quot;. Perhaps what is at the heart of the question is his genius for evocative color in music. If some of his works evoke the atmosphere of the Old Testament, they also operate elsewhere with equally telling and totally different effect; the Gauguinesque South Seas in the slow movement of the first Quintet, and China [in the last of the] &quot;Four Episodes&quot; are examples. Beside Israel stand &quot;Helvetia&quot; and &quot;America&quot;; beside &quot;Scenes from Jewish Life&quot; stands &quot;Nirvana&quot;.&quot;

Yet there are many other sources of inspiration, such as the neo-classical influences evident in the 
Concerto Grosso No. 1. His music uses a variety of contemporary harmonic devices. Some are enumerated in Vincent Persichetti&#x27;s book &quot;Twentieth Century Harmony&quot;. According to Persichetti, these include the use of the Dorian mode and of harmony with extensive alterations in the first Concerto Grosso, tone clusters in his Piano Sonata, the percussive use of harmony, as well as serial harmony, in his Piano Quintet No. 1.

==Family==

Ernest Bloch and his wife Marguerite Schneider had three children: Ivan, Suzanne and Lucienne.

Ivan, born in 1905, became an engineer with the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Oregon.

Suzanne Bloch, born in 1907, was a musician particularly interested in Renaissance music who taught harpsichord, lute and composition at the Juilliard School in New York.

Lucienne Bloch, born in 1909, worked as Diego Rivera&#x27;s chief photographer on the Rockefeller Center mural project, became friends with Rivera&#x27;s wife, the artist Frida Kahlo, and took some key photos of Kahlo and the only photographs of Rivera&#x27;s mural (which was destroyed because Lenin was depicted in it).

==Photography==
The Western Jewish History Center, of the Judah L. Magnes Museum, in Berkeley, California, has a small collection of photographs taken by Ernest Bloch which document his interest in photography.

Bloch&#x27;s photography was discovered by Eric B. Johnson in 1970. With the encouragement of Bloch&#x27;s children, Johnson edited and printed hundreds of his photographs.

Many of the photographs Bloch took—over 6,000 negatives and 2,000 prints, many printed by Eric Johnson from the original negatives—are in the Ernest Bloch Archive at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson along with photographs by the likes of Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and Richard Avedon.

Some of the pictures that Bloch took in his Swiss residence are visible online. The snapshots have been donated to the Archivio audiovisivo di Capriasca e Val Colla by the Associazione ricerche musicali nella Svizzera italiana.

==Legacy==

Ernest Bloch&#x27;s home in Agate Beach was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 2009. The Bloch Memorial, which was dedicated by Oregon Governor Bob Straub with Ernest Bloch&#x27;s three children at his side on April 10, 1976, was moved from near his house in Agate Beach to a more prominent location in front of the Newport Performing Arts Center in nearby Newport, Oregon. In 2009, the City of Newport City Council designated the intersection of NW 49th Street, Woody Way and Gilbert Way as Ernest Bloch Place. In 2016, the Oregon Department of Transportation Board of Commissioners officially designated the Ernest Bloch Memorial Wayside in the area of Agate Beach where the original Ernest Bloch Memorial was dedicated in 1976. The Ernest Bloch Memorial Wayside, the 1976 monument and a new Monument were formally dedicated in 2018. The informal Ernest Bloch Legacy Project was created by Dr. Frank Jo Maitland Geltner in 2003. The Ernest Bloch Legacy Project affiliated with the Lincoln County Historical Society in 2021.

<doc id="588506" wikidata="Q532013" url="?curid=588506" title="Craig Nicholls">
<text>Craig Robert Nicholls (born 31 August 1977) is an Australian musician, best known as the lead singer, songwriter, and guitarist of the Australian alternative rock band The Vines, of which he is the sole continuous member.

==Early life==
Nicholls was born in Sydney. Terry Nicholls, his father, was the guitarist and vocalist in a 1960s group named The Vynes. He later worked as an accountant for Sony Music Australia. Nicholls has an older brother, Matt, an older sister, Tara, who is a solicitor, and a younger sister, Jessica. Nicholls&#x27; father taught him to play guitar during childhood. He spent his free time listening to The Beatles, painting artworks, and skateboarding. He stated, &quot;I grew up a loner... I never socialised. I stayed at home and listened to music all day. Music became a mystical world.&quot;

Nicholls attended Marist College Penshurst until he dropped out of high school in year 10. He then enrolled in an art school for six months to study painting. He supported his ambition to become a musician by working at a McDonald&#x27;s in Hurstville. There, he met future bandmates, bass guitarist Patrick Matthews and drummer David Olliffe. To form a quartet named Rishikesh, Nicholls also invited his schoolmate Ryan Griffiths to join as a guitarist. Nicholls chose the band&#x27;s name, Rishikesh, which originally referred to a city in India where The Beatles had attended an ashram. Reviewing early gigs, newspapers would misprint the name as &quot;Rishi Chasms&quot;, so Nicholls decided to change it to The Vines, as a reference to his father&#x27;s group.

==Music career==

Nicholls commenced his song writing career at the time when The Vines began live performances. Initial shows included performances at backyard parties and a presence on a local radio station. Gaining popularity in Sydney, the band attracted the attention of Capitol Records. Nicholls continued to compose songs, writing &quot;Factory&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single, which became &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s Single of the Week in November 2001. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, The Vines won Best Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Get Free&quot;, which was also written by Nicholls. At the APRA Music Awards of 2003 he won the Breakthrough Songwriter Award.

Griffiths, Heald and Rosser eventually left the band, and Nicholls returned with new band members for the release of The Vines&#x27; independently-released sixth album &quot;Wicked Nature&quot;, described as a &quot;comeback&quot; by Darren Levin of the &quot;Faster Louder&quot; online music publication. Nicholls also produced the album that was recorded with Tim John (bass) and Lachy West (drums) of the band The Griswolds. Regarding the departure of his former bandmates, Nicholls explained in August 2014, &quot;It&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing [to talk about... it&#x27;s just a shame that it didn&#x27;t work out.&quot;

Several of Nicholls&#x27; paintings are used for The Vines&#x27; releases, including for the albums &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, &quot;Winning Days&quot; (self portrait only), and singles &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, and &quot;Outtathaway!&quot;. Nicholls&#x27; work on &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; was nominated for Best Cover Art at the 2002 ARIA Awards.

==Personal life==

By 2002, Nicholls had gained a reputation as an erratic performer. In August, The Vines performed &quot;Get Free&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, with Nicholls destroying Hamish Rosser&#x27;s drum kit. In December, they were prevented from performing on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; after Nicholls damaged the set during a rehearsal. His behaviour was seen as &quot;a sign of stress and mental exhaustion&quot;.

In May 2004, The Vines appeared at a promotional show for radio station Triple M, where Nicholls bleated at the audience and demanded they not talk during the band&#x27;s performance. As a result of this and other aggressive behaviour by Nicholls, Matthews left the stage and quit the band with immediate effect. He later joined the band Youth Group and did not perform with The Vines again for another 14 years. Triple M subsequently banned the group&#x27;s music from being broadcast by their station. Further performances on their Australian, United States, and European tours to promote their second album, &quot;Winning Days&quot;, were cancelled.

In November 2004, accompanied by his brother Matt and his manager and friend Andy Kelly, Nicholls faced assault and malicious damage charges at Balmain Local Court in Sydney. During the hearing it was revealed that Nicholls has autism spectrum disorder. His condition had been suspected by road crew veteran Tony Bateman, and was confirmed by Professor Tony Attwood, an autism spectrum disorder specialist, in August 2004. The judge dropped all charges against Nicholls on the condition that he seek immediate treatment. He was under medical treatment and therapy for six months, and stopped his intake of fast food and cannabis. He spoke about his condition in subsequent interviews.

In November 2008, The Vines cancelled shows in Australia and Japan, as Nicholls&#x27; mental health had deteriorated over the previous month. Nicholls was arrested on 13 October 2012 at his Sydney home on allegations he had assaulted his parents, and injured a responding police officer as he resisted arrest. He appeared before a judge at Sutherland Local Court on 17 October 2012, where a trial date of 14 November was set. The charges include &quot;two counts of domestic assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalking and resisting arrest&quot;.

In a 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; article, Nicholls revealed that he had moved back into the family home in 2013 after receiving medical intervention. On the subject of his mental health, he said:

In an August 2014 interview with the &quot;DIY&quot; publication, Nicholls explained that he manages his condition by rarely socialising, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m just following my instincts so... that&#x27;s alright.&quot; During the same interview, he also revealed that he shuns 21st-century technology, such as smartphones and computers, as he prefers to minimise his responsibilities and live &quot;like a kid&quot;. Nicholls maintained that music has &quot;really been the thing that saved me&quot;.

<text>Alain Tanner (6 December 1929 – 11 September 2022) was a Swiss film director.

==Early years and education==
Tanner was born in Geneva, and studied economics at the University of Geneva. In 1951, he joined the film club which Claude Goretta had recently established at the university. After his graduation and a short time working for international shipping companies in London, he continued feeling drawn to film.

==Film career==
Tanner found work at the British Film Institute in 1955, subtitling, translating, and organizing the archive. His first film, &quot;Nice Time&quot; (1957), a short documentary film about Piccadilly Circus during weekend evenings, was made with Claude Goretta. Produced by the British Film Institute Experimental Film Fund, it was first shown as part of the third Free Cinema programme at the National Film Theatre in May 1957. The debut film won a prize at the film festival in Venice and much critical praise.

Tanner went to France for a while where he assisted with several commercial films. There, he met some of the most important directors of the French New Wave in Paris as well as Henri Langlois, the director of the Cinémathèque Française. But the atmosphere in the film circles of Paris displeased him; he described it as &quot;cutthroat.&quot;

Between 1960 and 1968, Tanner returned to Switzerland, and he made more than 40 films as well as documentaries for French-language television there. In 1962, he became the co-founder of the Swiss young filmmakers&#x27; &quot;Groupe Cinque.&quot;

His first feature film, &quot;Charles, Dead or Alive&quot; (1969), won the first prize at the international film festival in Locarno. His next two films, &quot;La Salamandre&quot; (1971) and &quot;Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000&quot; (1976), were made in close collaboration with the art critic and novelist John Berger, who had also worked with him, to a lesser degree and without a credit, on the writing of &quot;Charles&quot;.

Influenced by his involvement with the British Free Cinema movement in London and with the French New Wave during his years in Paris, Tanner is best known for his movies &quot;Jonas qui aura 25 ans en l&#x27;an 2000&quot; (&quot;Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000&quot;), &quot;Messidor&quot; and &quot;Dans la ville blanche&quot; (&quot;In the White City&quot;). &quot;Dans la ville blanche&quot;, starring Bruno Ganz and shot in Lisbon, was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival.

&quot;Light Years Away&quot;, his only English language film shot in Ireland, won the Grand Prix Prize at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.

==Personal life and death==
Tanner and his wife, Janine, had two children. He died at a hospital in Geneva on 11 September 2022, aged 92.

<text>The Four Tunes (also referred to as The 4 Tunes) were a leading black pop vocal quartet during the 1950s. The members at the peak of their fame were Pat Best, Jimmy Gordon, Jimmie Nabbie, and Danny Owens.

==Career==
The group originated from The Brown Dots, a quartet started in New York City by Ivory &quot;Deek&quot; Watson (born July 18, 1909, Mounds, Illinois – died November 4, 1969, Washington, DC) after he split from the Ink Spots in late 1944. The other original members were William Henry &quot;Pat&quot; Best (baritone and guitar) (born June 6, 1923, Wilmington, North Carolina – died October 14, 2004, Roseville, California), Joe King (tenor), and Jimmy Gordon (bass).

Best and Watson were co-credited with the song &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;, which became The Brown Dots&#x27; first single. Later it became a 1946 hit for Nat King Cole and was recorded by many other artists. Soon afterwards, King was replaced by Jimmie Nabbie (tenor) and, in late 1946, Nabbie, Best, and Gordon recruited Danny Owens to replace Watson. They called themselves The Sentimentalists (after &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;) and started recording for Manor, backing Savannah Churchill on her 1947 No. 1 US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart hit, &quot;I Want to Be Loved (But Only by You)&quot;, and also on her 1948 releases &quot;Time Out for Tears&quot; and &quot;I Want to Cry&quot;.

After bandleader Tommy Dorsey asked them to stop calling themselves the Sentimentalists, also the name of his vocal group, they changed their name to The Four Tunes. Nabbie later stated that the name was derived from the fact that all they had left were four tunes that they had not yet recorded. Manor reissued all their Sentimentalists recordings as by the Four Tunes.

They continued recording for Manor until early in 1949, when they switched over to RCA Victor, where they had 18 records released between May 1949 and November 1953. They then switched to Jerry Blaine&#x27;s Jubilee label, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording, &quot;Marie&quot; was released in September, and reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart (No. 13 Pop). It sold one million copies. This Irving Berlin tune had been a No. 1 hit for Tommy Dorsey (with Jack Leonard on vocal) in 1937, and was later a hit for Irish group The Bachelors.

The Four Tunes&#x27; next Jubilee release, &quot;I Understand (Just How You Feel)&quot; was a bigger hit, climbing to No. 7 R&amp;B, and No. 6 on the pop chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. By this time, the group which had leaned closer to rhythm &amp; blues, had began to develop more of a pop style of sound. The group played the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with pop singer Joni James, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result, &quot;You Are My Love&quot;, was her big hit of 1955 (which the Four Tunes covered). In late 1959, there were two releases on Crosby (a Las Vegas label that Jimmie Nabbie partly owned). Then, there was a single release on Robin&#x27;s Nest (as the &quot;Four Tunes And One&quot;) in 1962.

After 18 years with the group, Nabbie left in 1963, to become a soloist (in 1965, he joined an Ink Spots group to come full circle; he would remain with them until his death); Danny Owens left about the same time. Billy Wells was tapped to fill Nabbie&#x27;s place and tenor Gaines Steele was brought in to replace Owens. In the mid 1960s, Frank Dawes (tenor and piano) was also brought on board, as a utility singer. The recording career of the 4 Tunes wound down with an LP on the ARA label in 1969 (which contained versions of &quot;I Love You For Sentimental Reasons,&quot; but also &quot;Whole Lot Of Shaking Going On&quot;). The personnel were: Pat Best, Jimmy Gordon, Billy Wells, Frank Dawes, and Chuck Hampton (drums and vocals).

The group kept going throughout subsequent decades, although Wells left in the 1980s for medical reasons and was replaced by Andre Williams, who in turn made way for Rufus McKay. Pat Best and Jimmy Gordon finally wound the group up in the late 1990s.

Jimmie Nabbie died after double bypass surgery on September 15, 1992, and Pat Best died on October 14, 2004, at the age of 81.

==Awards and recognition==
The Four Tunes were inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.

<doc id="588527" wikidata="Q7720396" url="?curid=588527" title="The Brown Dots">
<text>The Brown Dots were an American vocal group initially formed in late 1944, when second tenor Ivory &quot;Deek&quot; Watson (b. 18 July 1909, Mounds, Illinois - d. 4 November 1969, Washington, DC) left the Ink Spots. He immediately put together a competing Ink Spots group consisting of lead tenor Joe King, bass Jimmy Gordon, and an unknown baritone. By late January 1945, a lawsuit brought by the Ink Spots caused Deek Watson to claim that he would form a new group based on a &quot;completely new idea&quot;. This new idea was simply to change their name to the Brown Dots and to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible (although the Brown Dots employed more extensive harmonies). At this time, the unknown baritone left, to be replaced by baritone/guitarist William &quot;Pat&quot; Best.

== Overview ==

By March 1945, they were recording for Newark, New Jersey–based Manor records. At their first session, they recorded four songs, including &quot;Sentimental Reasons&quot; (written by Pat Best and led by Joe King). This song would become more popular through the years as &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot; or &quot;(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons&quot;.

There were hit versions of the song in 1946 for Nat King Cole and Charlie Spivak. 1947 saw charters by Eddy Howard, Dinah Shore, Ella Fitzgerald, and Art Kassel. Over the years, it&#x27;s also been done by (among others) Smiley Lewis (1954), the Rivileers (1954), Sam Cooke (1958), Jesse Belvin (1959), the Voices Five (1959), Donnie Elbert (1960), the Cleftones (1961), the Spaniels (1961), Marvin Gaye &amp; Mary Wells (1964), Rufus Thomas (1971), James Brown (1976) and Rod Stewart (2004).

By late summer or early fall, Joe King left, to be replaced by Jimmie Nabbie, who had originally wanted to be an operatic tenor.

Deek Watson always seemed to be in the middle of personality clashes. He had left the Ink Spots because of multiple clashes with Bill Kenny and Joe King had left the Brown Dots when he and Watson started fighting. By late 1946, Watson and the rest of the Brown Dots weren&#x27;t getting along.

Rather than break up the group, Nabbie, Best, and Gordon recruited tenor Danny Owens. Originally calling themselves the Sentimentalists, they began recording for Manor behind Deek&#x27;s back (just to see if they could make it on their own). When Deek finally found out, he left them and formed another Brown Dots group, about which next to nothing is known. (Some later Brown Dots records have a vocal group and some do not.)

The Sentimentalists started recording in earnest, including some backups to Savannah Churchill. However, bandleader Tommy Dorsey contacted them and asked them (politely) to cease using the &quot;Sentimentalists&quot; name (since he&#x27;d recently had a vocal group by that name, although they&#x27;d since changed their name to the Clark Sisters). However, since Dorsey was nice about it, they complied, changing their name to the 4 Tunes. Under this name, they would become the leading black Pop vocal group of the 1950s.

==Film appearance==
The group appeared in films made for African American audiences, such as &quot;Boy! What a Girl!&quot; (1947), where they performed &quot;Just in Case You Change Your Mind,&quot; and &quot;Sepia Cinderella&quot;, (1947) where they contributed the songs &quot;Long Legged Lizzie&quot; and &quot;Is It Right&quot;.

<text>The R44 is a New York City Subway car model built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1971 to 1973 for the B Division and the Staten Island Railway (SIR). The cars replaced many R1–9 series cars, and all remaining 1925 Standard Steel built SIRTOA ME-1 trains, providing Staten Island with a new fleet of railcars. The R44 fleet originally consisted of 352 cars, of which 56 remain in service, all on the Staten Island Railway.

The first R44 cars entered service on the subway on April 19, 1972, and on the Staten Island Railway on February 28, 1973. Various modifications were made over the years to the R44 fleet. The R44s set the world speed record for a subway car in 1972, reaching a top speed of . In the early 1990s, the R44 cars were rebuilt by Morrison–Knudsen for the New York City Transit Authority. Though the R160 order replaced all New York City Subway-operated R44s from December 18, 2009 to September 16, 2010, because of structural integrity issues found on them, the Staten Island Railway fleet remains in operation and is to be replaced by the R211 order by 2024–2025. As of 2024, the R44s are the oldest active rolling stock within the NYCT system, following the retirement of the R32s.

==Description==
A total of 352 R44 cars were ordered; 300 cars for the New York City Subway (numbered 100–399, with 278 of the cars later renumbered 5202–5479) and 52 cars for the Staten Island Railway (also known as ME-2, MU-2, or MUE-2 cars, numbered 400–435 and even numbers between 436 and 466). They were the last subway cars built by the St. Louis Car Company prior to shutting down in 1974.

The R44s originally came in singles, but needed each other to run, much like the &quot;married pairs&quot; of subway cars before them (R26 to R42, except R33S). The NYCT cars were reassembled after overhaul into ABBA sets of four; A cars are evenly numbered with a full-width operator cabs at the number 1 end, while the B cars have odd numbers and no cabs at either end. The SIR cars were not reassembled after overhaul and remain as single units.

The R44s were also factory equipped with automatic train operation (ATO) equipment, in anticipation of their use on the new Second Avenue Subway Line that was being built at the time.

Since September 16, 2010, all NYCT R44 cars have been retired and replaced by the R160s due to structural integrity issues found on those cars, leaving the SIR as the sole operator of the R44. The R44 cars in service on SIR are maintained at Clifton Yard, with heavier maintenance being performed at Coney Island Yard.

===Firsts===
The R44 was the first car for the New York City Subway. The cars were introduced under the idea that a train of eight cars would be more efficient than one of ten cars. Despite the increase in length, the R44s had eight pairs of doors per car (four on each side) like previous B Division cars. As a result, eight cars have only 64 (32 per side) pairs, whereas ten cars have 80 (40 per side).

The interior design was very different from previous models. The R44s had orange and yellow plastic bucket seats—a feature that would be incorporated into the other B-division cars and the A-division R62s and R62As. The seats were protected from the doorways by faux wood and glass panels. They were also the first car class delivered with crosswise seating since the R16 order from 1954. The walls were tan with &quot;wallpaper&quot; featuring the seals of New York State and New York City made from graffiti-resistant Formica plastics. The new interior decor was carried over to the R46 fleet.

The R44 was the first car since the BMT Green Hornet to incorporate a two-note warning tone, the first two notes of Westminster Quarters, that sounds before the doors begin to close as the train prepares to leave the station. When the cars were built, the chime was sounded four seconds before the doors closed, but the time delay was later removed. This has become the signature sound of the subway and is used with all subsequent cars.

The R44s were also the first NYCT subway cars to feature a newly designed WABCO-RT5 electronically and pneumatically controlled braking system also known as the P-Wire system, which did not fare well with this fleet of cars (similar systems also plagued the R46s), since most of the shop personnel were not adequately trained to deal with the P-Wire braking system&#x27;s sophisticated fail/safe design for automatic train operation. The system would sometimes trigger the train&#x27;s emergency braking system unexpectedly, which caused a situation known as stuck brakes. This P-Wire system, along with all of the automation systems (ATO) installed when these cars were built in 1972, was removed from the R44s beginning in 1984, and was replaced by a more conventional Westcode SMEE type braking system which made these cars much more reliable than with the originally installed system. The SIR cars had the same system, but fared much better than the NYCT cars.

The rollsigns from eight R44s were removed and replaced by experimental flip-dot signs starting in 1988, the same year the New Technology Program began. These experimental flip-dots signs were replaced by electronic LCD signs on the sides and rollsigns on the front during the General Overhaul Program from 1991 to 1993.

The R44s were designed to be automated and had a high design top speed of in anticipation of operation on new subway lines to be built, such as the Second Avenue Subway, which never opened while the cars were in subway service. On January 31, 1972, the R44s set the world speed record for a subway car, when a consist reached a speed of on the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s main line between Woodside and Jamaica. With two motors per car disabled, the cars still reached . The cars were capable of attaining even higher speeds, but the length of the test track was insufficient to allow further acceleration.

==History==
===Pre-introduction===
To ensure the subway could accommodate cars, three retired R1 cars (numbered 165, 192, and 211; renumbered XC675, XC575, and XC775 respectively) were repurposed and sent to various places around the subway and the Staten Island Railway. Cars XC675 and XC575 were cut in half and lengthened to .

As a result of the tests, it was determined that only minor changes to tunnels were needed to fit the 75-foot cars, and that particular segments on the BMT Eastern Division (the , , and ) would be too difficult to convert to allow cars to operate safely. As such, the R44s were not delivered to those lines. 

At the end of 1969, bids were received and a contract was awarded for an order of 240 75-foot R44 subway cars, with an option for 60 additional cars at the end of 1969.

===Delivery and early mishaps===

After many months of exhaustive testing on the , , , and (one week on each service, starting December 16, 1971), as well as on the LIRR to test the cars&#x27; state-of-the-art electrical and mechanical systems, the first set of R44s was placed in service on the New York City Subway on the on April 19, 1972, following a brief introductory ceremony attended by the Mayor of New York City John V. Lindsay, along with MTA Chairman William J. Ronan at Jamaica–179th Street station. The Staten Island R44s were delivered between January and April 1973. The first six Staten Island R44s went into service on February 28, 1973. With the completion of the R44 order and the similar State of the Art Car, the St. Louis Car Company shut down operations.

An eight-car train (328–335) was tested in 1973 with carpeting, and another (380–387) was tested with hydraulic brakes that were incompatible with the rest of the R44s&#x27; braking systems. In 1979, seven of the eight cars had these systems removed and replaced with conventional air brakes, while the last car (car 385) was permanently removed from service.

GE cars 388–399 were not converted to Westcode SMEE braking system in 1984, and were eventually sent to the Staten Island Railway in 1985 to provide SIRTOA with some extra cars since ridership increased significantly in 1985, so their existing 52-car fleet would not be overly taxed. These 12 R44 cars were built identical to the SIRTOA&#x27;s specification with GE propulsion instead of Westinghouse. 

In 1983, organizations for the blind stated that the gaps in between R44 and R46 cars were dangerous, since the blind could mistake the spaces for doorways.

Nine NYCT R44s were involved in various listed incidents that led to their premature retirements before the General Overhaul Program (GOH) program for the R44s commenced. These cars, along with car 385, were not overhauled during the GOH program; they were instead stored on the system and stripped of parts until March 2001, when they were shipped off property and scrapped.

===General Overhaul Program and post-overhaul===
During the General Overhaul Program, from 1991 to 1993, 342 R44s were rebuilt by the NYCT either at the 207th Street Yard in Manhattan or the Coney Island Complex in Brooklyn (cars 5342–5479 and all SIR cars) and by Morrison–Knudsen off NYCT premises (cars 5202–5341). Some improvements included the repainting of the carbon steel blue stripes into silver gray stripes (most NYCT cars) or the replacement of the stripes with stainless steel panels (NYCT cars 5228–5229 and all SIR cars). The rollsigns on the sides were replaced with electronic LCD signs on the NYCT cars and were completely removed on the SIR cars. The SIR R44s, however, retained their original two-note warning tones from their entry into service, unlike their NYCT counterparts, which had their warning tones replaced with the same ones that are found on the R46s, R62s, R62As, R68s, and R68As.

Even after the GOH program, several NYCT R44s were retired due to various mishaps. Cars 5319 and 5402 were damaged in separate fire-related incidents. Cars 5282–5285 were involved in a derailment north of 135th Street, resulting in the whole set being placed out of service. Car 5248 was taken out of service in 2004 due to cracked truck bolsters. Cars 5282 and 5319 were completely destroyed and subsequently scrapped in the late 1990s, car 5284 was eventually repaired and returned to service, and the other damaged cars were stored out of service for parts until they were scrapped with the rest of the NYCT cars.

All SIR cars were overhauled for a second time between 2007 and 2010 as a part of scheduled maintenance program. Several improvements included the repainting of the bulkheads, rebuilt trucks, new dark floors, newly repainted periwinkle bucket seats, and updated logos; unlike the NYCT cars, the SIR cars retained their original blue &quot;M&quot; MTA decals during their first overhaul. The cars have been undergoing further intermittent rounds of scheduled maintenance as their parts age over time.

Even after their second overhaul, several SIR R44s were retired due to various mishaps. On December 26, 2008, car 402 was pulled from service after being badly damaged from accidentally hitting a bumper block at the Tottenville station. It was stored at 207th Street Yard and stripped of parts for other SIR cars; by 2013, it was scrapped. In May 2013, cars 399 and 466 were taken out of service after being damaged in a sideswipe. Both cars were also stripped of parts for other SIR cars.

===Retirement===
====NYCT cars====
On December 18, 2009, two 4-car sets of New York City Transit R44s, one set being a contract Morrison-Knudsen rebuild and the other being an in-house Coney Island Overhaul Shop rebuild, were brought in to the 207th Street Overhaul Shop for inspection; the inspection resulted in various structural integrity issues being discovered on all eight cars. As the R44s were originally planned to be retired by the R179 order, the decision was made in March 2010 to retire the R44s with the remaining R160 order in place of the R32 and R42 fleet, which were being replaced with the R160 order at the time; that same month, withdrawal of the NYCT R44 fleet from revenue service began, and retirement of the R32 and R42 fleet paused indefinitely.

Initially the retired NYCT R44s were expected to be stripped and sunk as artificial reefs. Car 5344, part of one of the sets brought in for inspection, was the first to be completely stripped in preparation for disposal as an artificial reef. However, the car presented a serious contamination hazard that was dangerous to the aquatic life in the ocean, would have proven too costly for artificial reef preparation for the NYCT R44s, and was not prepared in time when the artificial reef program as a whole ended in April 2010. As such, the plan to reef the NYCT R44s was ultimately cancelled in favor of simply scrapping the cars.

The NYCT R44s were gradually phased out until September 16, 2010, when the last train made its final trips on the and . After retirement, the NYCT R44s were mothballed and placed into storage system-wide. From May 2012 until summer 2013, most of the NYCT R44s were scrapped at Sims Metal Management. Four cars, 5286–5289, were not scrapped and remain stored at Coney Island Yard. The only car not slated for disposal is car 5240 (originally 172), which has since been preserved and set aside for on-and-off display at the New York Transit Museum.

====Staten Island Railway cars====
Since January 2022, the remaining R44s have been the oldest active rolling stock within the NYCT system at years old, following the retirement of the R32s.

Like the NYCT cars, the SIR R44s were originally planned to be retired by the R179 order; however, this plan was dropped. Proposals to overhaul and operate some R46s on the SIR to replace the R44s there surfaced instead; however, this plan was also dropped. As such, the SIR R44s not written off received intermittent rounds of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until retirement.

Ultimately, 75 R211S cars have been ordered to replace the SIR R44s; these started entering service on October 8, 2024. The SIR R44s are being gradually phased out from mid-2023, with a handful of cars being retired and cannibalized for parts to keep other cars running. The remainder of the active cars are expected to be phased out between 2024 and 2026.

<doc id="588531" wikidata="Q1224570" url="?curid=588531" title="Différance">
<text> is a French term coined by Jacques Derrida. It is central to Derrida&#x27;s concept of deconstruction, a critical outlook concerned with the relationship between text and meaning. Roughly speaking, the method of &quot;différance&quot; is a way to analyze how signs (words, symbols, metaphors, etc) come to have meanings. It suggests that meaning is not inherent in a sign but arises from its relationships with other signs, a continual process of contrasting with what comes before and later. That is, a sign acquires meaning by being different from other signs. The meaning of a sign changes over time, as new signs keep appearing and old signs keep disappearing.

However, the meaning of a sign is not just determined by the system of signs present currently. Past meanings leave &quot;traces&quot;, and possible future meanings &quot;haunt&quot;. The meaning of a sign is determined by the interaction between past traces, future haunts, and the system of signs present right now.

==Overview==
Derrida first uses the term in his 1963 paper &quot;&quot;. The term then played a key role in Derrida&#x27;s engagement with the philosophy of Edmund Husserl in &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;. It was further elaborated in various other works, notably in his essay &quot;&quot; and in the interviews collected in &quot;Positions&quot;.

The of is a deliberate misspelling of , though the two are pronounced identically, ( plays on the fact that the French verb means both &quot;to defer&quot; and &quot;to differ&quot;). This misspelling highlights the fact that its written form is not heard, and serves to further subvert the traditional privileging of speech over writing (see arche-writing and logocentrism), as well as the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible. The difference articulated by the in is not apparent to the senses via sound, &quot;but neither can it belong to intelligibility, to the ideality which is not fortuitously associated with the objectivity of &quot;theorein&quot; or understanding.&quot; This is because the language of understanding is already caught up in sensible metaphors—for example, () means &quot;to see&quot; in Ancient Greek.

In the essay &quot;&quot; Derrida indicates that gestures at a number of heterogeneous features that govern the production of textual meaning. Words and signs are not identical with what they signify, and only acquire meaning through their differences from other words and signs; meaning arises from the differentiation of words from one another, and the consequential engendering of binary oppositions and hierarchies. Thus, meaning is forever &quot;deferred&quot; or postponed through an endless chain of signifiers. Derrida refers to this process as &quot;espacement&quot; or &quot;spacing&quot; and &quot;temporisation&quot; or &quot;temporising&quot;.

Derrida developed the concept of deeper in the course of an argument against the phenomenology of Husserl, who sought a rigorous analysis of the role of memory and perception in our understanding of sequential items such as music or language. Derrida&#x27;s approach argues that because the perceiver&#x27;s mental state is constantly in flux and differs from one re-reading to the next, a general theory describing this phenomenon is unachievable.

A term related to the idea of in Derrida&#x27;s thought is the &quot;supplement&quot;, &quot;itself bound up in a supplementary play of meaning which defies semantic reduction.&quot;

== Between structure and genesis ==
Derrida approaches texts as constructed around oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in non-essentialist terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of differences inside a &quot;system of distinct signs&quot;. This approach to text, in a broad sense, emerges from semiology advanced by Ferdinand de Saussure.

Derrida&#x27;s position might broadly be stated as being that language is fluid rather than ideally static. His notorious comment that &quot;il n&#x27;y a pas de hors-texte&quot; (&quot;there is no outside-the-text&quot;, sometimes incorrectly translated as &quot;there is nothing outside the text&quot;) has given rise to the allegation that he believes that nothing exists but words. Derrida is concerned to distinguish his procedure from Hegel&#x27;s, because Hegelianism&#x27;s notion of binary oppositions whose continual supersession (&quot;relève&quot;) by new higher-level binary oppositions rests on a system of elemental differences, whereas in language there are no fundamental self-sufficient units of meaning.

Saussure, considered one of the fathers of structuralism, explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:
Saussure explicitly suggests that linguistics is a branch of a more general semiology, of a science of signs in general, human codes being only one among others. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida points out, he makes of linguistics &quot;the regulatory model&quot;, and &quot;for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to &quot;phoné&quot;&quot;: Derrida prefers to follow the more &quot;fruitful paths (formalization)&quot; of a general semiotics without falling into what he considers to be &quot;a hierarchizing teleology&quot; privileging linguistics, and to speak of &#x27;mark&#x27; rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.

Derrida sees these differences as working in all languages, systems of distinct signs, and codes, where terms do not have absolute meanings but instead draw meaning from reciprocal determination with other terms. Derrida will take this structural differentiation into account when articulating the meaning of , a mark he felt the need to create and will become a fundamental tool in his lifelong work: deconstruction:

But structural difference cannot be taken as absolutely basic; it must also be deconstructed, by destabilizing its static, synchronic, taxonomic, hierarchical, ahistoric elements, bearing in mind that all structure already refers to the generative movement in the play of differences.

 also involves deferring, the recognition that meaning is not only synchronous differentiation from other terms inside a structure of marks or traces, but also diachronous referral back to the origins and development of the mark or trace and its meanings - difference as structure and deferring as genesis:
One consequence of this approach is that the subject is not present to itself, but is constituted in the spacing and temporising process of : 
Questioning the myth of the presence of meaning in itself (&quot;objective&quot;) and/or for itself (&quot;subjective&quot;), Derrida&#x27;s approach is to deconstruct texts in order to show where conceptual oppositions are put to work in the construction of meaning and values:
These relations with other terms express not only meaning but also values. Such oppositions are put to work in texts in both theoretical and practical ways.
The first task of deconstruction is to reveal their operation in philosophical, literary, juridical etc. texts:
It is not that the final task of deconstruction is to surpass all oppositions, for they are structurally necessary to produce sense; they cannot simply be suspended once and for all. But this does not obviate their need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations, by showing the way logical and axiological oppositions are at work in all discourse in order for it to be able to produce meaning and values.

=== Illustration ===
For example, the word &quot;house&quot; derives its meaning more from the way it differs from &quot;shed&quot;, &quot;mansion&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;building&quot;, etc. than from the way it is tied to a certain image of a traditional house. The relationship between signifier and signified depends on each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms rather than on an ostensive description or definition.

When can we talk about a &quot;house&quot; or a &quot;mansion&quot; or a &quot;shed&quot;? The same can be said about verbs, in all the world languages: when should we stop saying &quot;walk&quot; and start saying &quot;run&quot;? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying &quot;yellow&quot; and start saying &quot;orange&quot;, or stop defining as &quot;black&quot; and start saying &quot;white&quot;, or &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;entrepreneur&quot; and &quot;worker&quot;, &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot;, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;, &quot;beast&quot; and &quot;sovereign&quot;, &quot;christian&quot; and &quot;pagan&quot;, or &quot;beautiful&quot; and start saying &quot;ugly&quot;, or &quot;bad&quot; and start saying &quot;good&quot;, or &quot;truth&quot; and start saying &quot;false&quot;, &quot;determined&quot; and &quot;free&quot;? Or &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;, &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot;, &quot;now&quot; and &quot;then&quot;, &quot;past&quot; and &quot;present&quot; and &quot;future&quot; and &quot;eternal&quot;? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance. Deferral also comes into play, as the words that occur following &quot;house&quot; or &quot;white&quot; in any expression will revise the meaning of that word, sometimes dramatically so. This is true not only with syntagmatic succession in relation with paradigmatic simultaneity, but also, in a broader sense, between diachronic succession in History related with synchronic simultaneity inside a &quot;system of distinct signs&quot;.

Thus, complete meaning is always &quot;differential&quot; and postponed in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word&#x27;s definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries from different periods in time, and such a process would never end.

This is also true with all ontological oppositions and its many declensions, not only in philosophy as in human sciences in general, cultural studies, theory of Law, et cetera. For example: the intelligible and the sensible, the spontaneous and the receptive, autonomy and heteronomy, the empirical and the transcendental, immanent and transcendent, as the interior and exterior, or the founded and the founder, normal and abnormal, phonetic and writing, analysis and synthesis, the literal sense and figurative meaning in language, reason and madness in psychiatry, the masculine and feminine in gender theory, man and animal in ecology, the beast and the sovereign in the political field, theory and practice as distinct dominions of thought itself. In all discourses in fact (and by right) we can make clear how they were dramatized, how the cleavages were made during the centuries, each author giving it different centers and establishing different hierarchies between the terms in the opposition.

=== Paradox ===
It may seem paradoxical to suggest that , a word invented by Derrida, is not a concept (i.e. does not have a definition), but this is indicative of his broad general approach. Derrida introduces a number of new words and reinterprets others (&quot;deconstruction&quot; itself being the best-known example), but he vigorously resists attempts to pin them down to precise conceptual definitions. He does not seek simply to replace existing conceptual vocabularies with a new &quot;deconstructive&quot; one, whose terms would themselves silently embody precisely the same kinds of systems and structures of meaning, belief and value that he was questioning. 

Derrida&#x27;s focus is on the process by which language secretly embodies, replicates and enforces certain ways of thinking, certain beliefs and values - a process which on occasion he describes as &quot;violence&quot; - and his method, using the tools and techniques of his invented vocabulary, is to shake it up so that their silences and secrets are brought out into the open. (It is not irrelevant that for Heidegger the Ancient Greek word for &quot;truth&quot; - &quot;aletheia&quot; - means &quot;unconcealing&quot;, i.e. bringing out of concealment into the light.) In later years, when &quot;deconstruction&quot; had come to be used as a kind of quasi-technical term in fields as diverse as literary criticism and cookery, Derrida regretted choosing that word rather than &quot;de-sedimentation&quot; as the name of his approach to critical thinking.

== The web of language ==
We reside, according to this philosophy, in a web of language, or at least one of interpretation, that has been laid down by tradition and which shifts each time we hear or read an utterance—even if it is the same utterance. and deconstruction are attempts to understand this web of language, to search, in Derrida&#x27;s words, for the &quot;other of language&quot;. This &quot;other of language&quot; is close to what Anglophone Philosophy calls the Reference of a word. There is a &quot;deferment&quot; of meaning with each act of re-reading. There is a &quot;difference&quot; of readings with each re-reading. In Derrida&#x27;s words, &quot;there is nothing outside the [con]text&quot; of a word&#x27;s use and its place in the lexicon. Text, in Derrida&#x27;s parlance, refers to context and includes all about the &quot;real-life&quot; situation of the speech/text (cf. speech act theory).

=== Temporal delay ===
For Derrida, the relationship between the signifier and the signified is not understood exactly as Saussure described it. For Derrida there is a deferral, a continual and indefinite postponement, which means that the signified can never be reached. The formation of the linguistic sign is not static, but is marked by movement in time. The easiest way to understand this is to imagine Saussure&#x27;s model as a two-dimensional plane, where each signified is separated from others by the differences in its sound image. (If two sound-images are exactly alike, one would not be able to distinguish between them - cf. &quot;différence&quot; and &quot;différance&quot;.) Each signifier is then a particular point on that plane. Derrida, however, adds a third dimension - time - to account for the temporal act of forming the sign. This is not to say that there is no relationship between the two. However, Derrida felt that the old model focused too heavily on the signifier, rather than on utterance and occurrence. From the point of view of the temporal formation of the sign, the signifier and the signified are severed completely and irrevocably.

=== Example of word introduction ===
An example of this effect occurred in England during the Renaissance, when oranges began to be imported from the Mediterranean. Yellow and red came to be differentiated from a new colour term, &quot;orange&quot;. What was the meaning of these words before 1600? – What is their meaning afterwards? Such effects often occur in language and frequently this effect forms the basis of language/meaning. Such changes of meaning are also often centres of political violence, as is apparent in the differences invested in male/female, master/slave, citizen/foreigner etc. Derrida seeks to modulate and question these &quot;violent hierarchies&quot; through deconstruction.

Perhaps it is a misconception that seeks contradictory meanings. It does not necessarily do so. It can, but what it usually describes is the re-experience, the re-arrival of the moment of reading. Roland Barthes remarked that &quot;those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere&quot;. This wry comment summarizes the phenomenon of different experience for each iteration.

In discussing just one text we are discussing every text. No distinction is necessarily made between texts in this &quot;basic&quot; level. The difference/deferral can be between one text and itself, or between two texts; this is the crucial distinction between traditional perspectives and deconstruction.

==Deconstruction and the history of philosophy==
Derrida&#x27;s neographism (rather than neologism because &quot;neologism&quot; would propose a &quot;logos&quot;, a metaphysical category; and (more simply) because, when uttered in French, &quot;&quot; is indistinguishable from &quot;difference&quot;—it is thus only a graphical modification, having nothing to do with a spoken &quot;logos&quot;) is, of course, not just an attempt at linguistics or to discuss written texts and how they are read. It is, most importantly, an attempt to escape the history of metaphysics; a history that has always prioritised certain concepts, e.g., those of substance, essence, soul, spirit (idealism), matter (realism), becoming, freedom, sense-experience, language, science etc. All such ideas imply self-presence and totality. Différance, instead, focuses on the play of presence and absence, and, in effecting a concentration of certain thinking, Derrida takes on board the thought of Freud&#x27;s unconscious (the trace), Heidegger&#x27;s destruction of ontotheology, Nietzsche&#x27;s play of forces, and Bataille&#x27;s notion of sacrifice in contrast to Hegel&#x27;s .

Yet he does not approach this absence and loss with the nostalgia that marks Heidegger&#x27;s attempt to uncover some original truths beneath the accretions of a false metaphysics that have accumulated since Socrates. Rather it is with the moods of play and affirmation that Derrida approaches the issue.

However, Derrida himself never claimed to have escaped from the metaphysics with what he has done. To the contrary, he criticises others for claiming to have demolished metaphysics thoroughly.

=== Negative theology ===

Derrida&#x27;s non-concept of différance, resembles, but is not, negative theology, an attempt to present a tacit metaphysics without pointing to any existent essence as the first cause or transcendental signified. Following his presentation of his paper &quot;&quot; in 1968, Derrida was faced with an annoyed participant who said, &quot;It [différance] is the source of everything and one cannot know it: it is the God of negative theology.&quot; Derrida&#x27;s answer was, &quot;It is and it is not.&quot;

In contrast to negative theology, which posits something supereminent and yet concealed and ineffable, is not quite transcendental, never quite &quot;real&quot;, as it is always and already deferred from being made present. As John Caputo writes, &quot; is but a quasi-transcendental anteriority, not a supereminent, transcendental ulteriority.&quot; The differences and deferrings of différance, Derrida points out, are not merely ideal, they are not inscribed in the contours of the brain nor do they fall from the sky, the closest approximation would be to consider them as historical, that is, if the word history itself did not mean what it does, the airbrushing speech of the victor/vanquished.

Derrida has shown an interest in negative or apophatic theology, one of his most important works on the topic being his essay &quot;Sauf le nom&quot;.

== Life and technics ==
In &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;, Derrida states that grammatology is not a &quot;science of man&quot; because it is concerned with the question of &quot;the name of man.&quot; This leads Derrida into a consideration of the work of André Leroi-Gourhan, and in particular his concepts of &quot;program,&quot; &quot;exteriorisation,&quot; and &quot;liberation of memory.&quot; Derrida writes: &quot;Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human adventure thus by the simple possibility of the in general; rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life—of what I have called —as the history of the .&quot; Derrida thus explicitly refers the term to life, and in particular to life as the history of inscription and retention, whether this is genetic or technological (from writing to &quot;electronic card indexes&quot;). And thus grammatology is not a science of man because it deconstructs any anthropocentrism, in the sense that the inscription in question falls on both sides of the divide human/non-human.

Yet, in the article &quot;&quot;, Derrida refers not to &quot;physis&quot;, that is, &quot;life&quot;, but to &quot;all the others of &quot;physis&quot;—&quot;tekhnè&quot;, &quot;nomos&quot;, &quot;thesis&quot;, society, freedom, history, mind, etc.—as &quot;physis&quot; differed and deferred, or as &quot;physis&quot; differing and deferring.&quot; Bernard Stiegler argues in his book, &quot;Technics and Time, 1&quot;, that this represents a hesitation in Derrida: &quot;Now phusis as life was already . There is an indecision, a passage remaining to be thought. At issue is the specificity of the temporality of life in which life is inscription in the nonliving, spacing, temporalisation, differentiation, and deferral by, of and in the nonliving, in the dead.&quot; What this suggests to Stiegler is that grammatology—a logic of the —must be supplemented with a history of grammatisation, a history of all the forms and techniques of inscription, from genetics to technics, each stage of which will be found to possess its own logic. Only in this way can be thought as the differing and deferral &quot;of&quot; life (life as the emergence of a difference from non-life, specifically as the deferral of entropy), &quot;and&quot; as the difference &quot;from&quot; &quot;physis&quot; through which the human must inevitably be defined (the human as the inauguration of &quot;another&quot; memory, neither the memory of genetics nor that of the individual, but rather a memory consisting in &quot;inscription in the nonliving,&quot; that is, &quot;technical&quot; memory).

<text>Elizabeth Blount (// – 1540), commonly known during her lifetime as Bessie Blount, was a mistress of Henry VIII of England.

==Early life==
Blount was the daughter of Sir John Blount and Katherine Peshall, of Kinlet, Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Sir John Blount was a loyal, if unremarkable, servant to the English royal family, who accompanied King Henry to France in 1513 when he waged war against Louis XII of France. The Blount family was of landed gentry status but had no real national input until Blount gave birth to Henry Fitzroy, the only acknowledged illegitimate child of Henry VIII.

Her parents were married in childhood in 1491, as stated in post-mortem inquisition of Sir Thomas Blount of Kinlet. Her father, John Blount, out of a family of some twenty children, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Thomas Blount of Kinlet, who had been knighted by Henry VII at the battle of Stoke in 1487, on the occasion of the defeat of Lambert Simnel. Her mother was Katherine, heiress of Knightley, in Staffordshire, and of many other manors in that county, the only (legitimate) child of Sir Hugh Peshall, or Persall, a soldier of the highest distinction, who, as Knight of the Body to Henry VII, was in constant attendance on that King.

Sir Hugh is mentioned in the &quot;Ballad of Bosworth Field&quot;, with his brother-in-law, Sir Humphrey Stanley, among &quot; four good knights &quot; whom the Lord Stanley gives to Henry of Richmond at his request on the eve of the fight. The outline of the story bears the stamp of truth, but in strict accuracy he was of course not knighted by Henry of Richmond until, after the battle, the crown had been placed on Henry&#x27;s head. During the three succeeding years to this memorable year of 1485, the name of Sir Hugh Peshall frequently occurs in the State records as being the recipient of large sums of money from Henry VII &quot; by way of reward.&quot; He died as a young man in 1488, when his daughter Katherine was a little child. John Blount at the time of his marriage to Katherine Peshall appears to have been not more than seven years old; he is stated to have been &quot; forty years old and more&quot; in 1524.

Childe-Pemberton writes:It is interesting to note that, at the dawn of the Tudor epoch, with the exception of a few such as the Talbots, the Howards, and the Stanleys, many of our great families had as yet not come to the front, and the stars of the Russells, the Cavendishes, and the Cecils had not risen. The parents of Elizabeth Blount, however—the boy-bridegroom and the girl-heiress—were each through their ancestral alliances representatives of the ancient aristocracy of England, and were equally matched in lineage and estate. The marriage took place on August 1, 1491—not, we may observe, at the bride&#x27;s home, but at Kinlet, the home of the bridegroom. Little change has there been in the external features of Kinlet Church since the two children, marshalled by their elders, passed with procession from hall to church to plight their troth. The old manor-house at Kinlet, demolished in the early part of the eighteenth century, was situated even nearer to the church than is the present mansion; now, as then, both church and house being wholly surrounded by park and woodland of wide extent, and remote from any village or hamlet. The old cross in the churchyard near the southern entrance must have been of great elevation; its quadrilateral base, unique in design, lofty and gabled, is still in its place, though time has wrought some ruin, and the niche in its wall has long been emptied of the saint&#x27;s image it once held. The Norman doorway, the round massive arches and columns of the nave, stand firm as ever; while the spacious chancel and transepts,1 added by pious ancestors in Early English or Decorated style, still speak to us of mediaeval times, and were already venerable when that bridal procession paused before the high altar. Still in the mullioned windows, amid traces of antique glass of colour unsurpassed by modern imitations, there remains the stained-glass figure of a kneeling knight, helmeted and clad in coat embroidered with the armorial bearings of the Cornwalls, and asking of your charity prayers for his soul, as on the day when his descendant little John knelt with Katherine at the nuptial mass, four hundred and twenty years ago.
While Elizabeth was a baby, her parents and relatives were brought into association with Katherine of Aragon, when as a girl-bride that princess resided at Ludlow Castle during her brief marriage with Arthur, Prince of Wales. Of those who hastened to pay their respects to the young Princess of Wales the Blounts of Kinlet were surely among the first. Ludlow, that great border stronghold, a town of the utmost importance in Tudor times, was within the distance of a three hours&#x27; ride from the seat of the Blounts—the road thence to Ludlow winding by slopes and valleys along the eastern side of the Clee Hills. &quot;No more romantic scenery is perhaps to be found in all England,&quot; writes William S. Childe-Pemberton, &quot;than that which keeps the Clee Hills in view; and Kinlet, still noted for the size and age of its oaks—the same oaks under which the little Elizabeth played in childhood—is situated in the heart of that country of which an old rhymester sings:

&quot;Thrice happy he&quot; 

&quot;Twixt Severn and Clee.&quot;&quot;

Elizabeth&#x27;s grandfather, Sir Thomas Blount of Kinlet, frequented the Court of the Prince of Wales, both at Ludlow Castle—where as Lord President of the Marches of Wales the boy resided on the outskirts of his principality—and at Ticknell, or Tickenall (Bewdley), which his father, Henry VII, had built for him near the banks of the Severn on the edge of the forest which borders the counties of Worcester and Salop.1 Sir Thomas Blount was Steward of the Royal Park and Manor of Bewdley, of which Ticknell was an appurtenance, and Kinlet is but a few miles distant from Bewdley on the Shropshire side. The Royal residence of Ticknell had a great court and garden and several outhouses which extended on the sides. It was in the chapel of Bewdle that Prince Arthur plighted his troth to the proxy of Katherine of Arragon on May 19, 1499.

Eleanor Croft (born Cornwall of Burford), a kinswoman and her husband were also long connected with the Court. She is described in the early Cornwall pedigrees as &quot; Lady Governess to the young Princes at Ludlow Castle &quot; (probably the Yorkist princes Edward and Edmund), and also as &quot; Lady Governess to Prince Arthur at Ludlow&quot;.

When Prince Arthur died, ff the four &quot;banner-holders&quot; at the lying-instate Sir Thomas Blount was &quot;at the Corner of the Canopy,&quot; bearing the &quot; Banner of the Patible,&quot; and among the knights who conveyed the body from Ludlow to Bewdley on its way to its final resting-place in Worcester Cathedral was Sir Thomas Blount—&quot;on the foulest cold windy and rainy day,&quot; says the chronicler, &quot;and the worst day I have ever seen—yea, and in many places they were fain to take oxen to draw the chair, so ill was the way.&quot; The funeral procession stopped the night at Bewdley on the road, the bier being &quot;set in the quire&quot; of the royal chapel there. Next day, from Bewdley, Sir Richard Croft and Sir William Uvedale rode before to Worcester and &quot;suffered no man to enter the gate of the city till the tyme the corpse was come.&quot;

Meanwhile the parents of little Bess Blount quitted the neighbourhood of Ludlow soon after the death of Prince Arthur. Madam Blount&#x27;s grandfather, Humphrey Peshall, having died in May 1502, she succeeded in ousting her half-uncle Richard, and in establishing her rights to her ancestral estates. The family now removed to her manor of Knightley, in Staffordshire.

William S. Childe-Pemberton writes:Camden, in his Britannia, says, &quot;The name of the Blounts was very famous in these parts, denoting their golden locks. This is a very ancient and honourable family and hath spread its branches far.&quot;Little is known of Elizabeth Blount&#x27;s early years, except for her reputation as a beauty, and for her famous affair with King Henry VIII (born 1491; he was about seven years older than Bessie). There is no known portrait of her in existence but there is a stylised brass with her likeness. As a young girl, she came to the King&#x27;s Court as a maid-of-honour to now the King&#x27;s wife, Katherine of Aragon. Bessie was a talented dancer and singer, excelling everybody &#x27;in all goodly pastimes&#x27;, high spirits and energy. In her twenties and thirties, she is described as having had &#x27;very good cheer&#x27; and became the King&#x27;s preferred dancing partner.

She had arrived at Court by the spring of 1512. In the list of &quot;the King&#x27;s Year-book &quot; for the following year an entry dated from the Court at Greenwich, Sunday, May 8, 1513, stating that a hundred shillings is due to Elizabeth Blount &quot;upon a warrant signed for hir last yere&#x27;s wages ended at thanuncacon of Our Lady last passed.&quot;

It was there at court that the young woman caught the eye of the King and became his mistress during 1514 or 1515, a relationship which continued for about eight years, after the suggestion of an affair was brought to light.
==Royal mistress==
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, wrote from France, &quot;Beauvais, October 25, 1514&quot;, to King Henry VIII, and in a postscript the Duke sends him the following message: &quot;And I beseech your Grace to [tell] Mistress Blount and Mistress Carru the next time that I write unto them or send them tokens they shall either write to me or send me tokens again.&quot;

Blount&#x27;s relationship with Henry VIII lasted for some time, compared to his other affairs, which were generally short-lived and unacknowledged. 

The names of the two Elizabeths are again associated in the annals of 1514, both appearing in a list of performers in the Christmas mummery that year, held at Greenwich, where the Court was then residing. &quot;Maysteres Elisabeth Blont&quot; and &quot;Maysteres Karew the yong wyff&quot; both are on a list left by the King&#x27;s Master of the Revels, Richard Gibson, in own his handwriting his bill to the King for the costumes supplied by him, and with it the names of the players.

The four ladies were dressed alike in gowns of white satin &quot; savoysin,&quot; in hoops of white satin lined with blue, with mantles &quot; savoysin&quot; of blue velvet. They wore bonnets of blue velvet, and coifs of damask gold piped, and fillets of damask gold.

William S. Childe-Pemberton writes:We may imagine that the blond beauty of the girl Elizabeth Blount, set off to perfection by her blue and white costume, was the theme of general admiration at these Christmas festivities, she being, as we suppose, not more than fourteen years old at this time. The Queen herself may not have been present at this particular scene, for she had rather recently been confined of a &quot;still-born male child to the very great grief of the whole Court.&quot; l But on many similar occasions we may be sure that the Queen enthroned among the audience, and surrounded by her ladies, would deign to express her approval and would compliment her Chamberlain, Lord Mountjoy, on his young kinswoman&#x27;s looks and deportment. We turn again to the Chronicles of Hall, and find that this &quot;damosel in singing, dancing, and all goodly pastimes exceeded all other.&quot; How seductive these accomplishments eventually provedWhile Henry and his first wife were unsuccessful at producing a male heir to the throne, Henry had a healthy son by Blount, her first pregnancy and her only child by the king. On 15 June 1519, Blount bore the King an illegitimate son who was named Henry FitzRoy, later created Duke of Richmond and Somerset and Earl of Nottingham. He was the only illegitimate son of Henry VIII whom the King acknowledged as his own. After the child&#x27;s birth, the affair ended for unknown reasons although it is thought that the resulting child was more of a happy accident than an attempted career move. For proving that King Henry was capable of fathering healthy sons, Elizabeth Blount prompted a popular saying, &quot;Bless &#x27;ee, Bessie Blount&quot;, often heard during and after this period.

Soon after the birth of his son, the King began an affair with Mary Boleyn, who may have been partly the reason for Blount&#x27;s dismissal. Like Blount, Boleyn was never formally recognised as the King&#x27;s mistress and the position of public &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; was never offered by Henry to anyone but Anne Boleyn, who rejected it.

==Later life==
In 1522, Blount entered an arranged marriage with Gilbert Tailboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme (sometimes spelled &quot;Talboys&quot;), whose family was said by some to have a history of insanity. The couple settled in Lincolnshire and later had three children. After her marriage, Blount does not figure much in the day-to-day affairs of the Tudor monarchy or in the official records. Her role in the life of her royal son is less documented, although a letter of 1529 to her from John Palsgrave, Henry FitzRoy&#x27;s tutor, suggests that her involvement in the duke&#x27;s upbringing was greater than previously believed. The King&#x27;s involvement with his son&#x27;s upbringing was also noted as &quot;doting&quot;.

On 23 July 1536, Blount&#x27;s son Henry FitzRoy died, probably of tuberculosis (&quot;consumption&quot;). Her husband, Gilbert, Lord Tailboys, also predeceased her, dying in 1530 but leaving her a widow of comfortable means. By her marriage to Tailboys, she had three further children, two sons, George and Robert, and one daughter, Elizabeth.

After the death of Tailboys, Blount was wooed unsuccessfully by Lord Leonard Grey. She subsequently married a younger man whose Lincolnshire lands adjoined hers, Edward Clinton or Fiennes, 9th Baron Clinton, thus becoming Elizabeth Fiennes. 

William S. Childe-Pemberton writes:The approximate date of this romantic event is confirmed by the prosaic record of a grant from the King, dated February 12, in the twenty-sixth year of his reign (1534-1535) &quot;of three tuns of Gascon wine yearly of the prizes of the port of Boston, Lincoln, to Elizabeth, late Lady Taylbois, now wife of the Lord Clinton.&quot;They were married some time between 1533 and 1535, and this union produced three daughters. 

For a short while, she was a lady-in-waiting to Henry&#x27;s fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. According to Agnes Strickland, she was a Great Lady of the Queen&#x27;s Household to Katherine Howard. Blount returned to her husband&#x27;s estates, where she died shortly after July 1540. It has traditionally been asserted that the cause of her death was consumption. She was not buried with either husband.

== Importance ==
Compared with Henry&#x27;s first two wives, Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, Blount&#x27;s importance to history is arguably negligible. Nevertheless, her status as Henry Fitzroy&#x27;s mother endows her with notable significance amongst Henry VIII&#x27;s mistresses. Blount was the mother of Henry&#x27;s only acknowledged illegitimate child, and at one point in the 1520s it was suggested that her son should be named the King&#x27;s legal heir. Although nothing came of these plans, that she was the mother of such an important child made her an object of interest to many of her contemporaries.

The fact that Henry fathered a healthy son with Elizabeth would later prove to be important during the king&#x27;s Great Matter. Katherine experienced at least seven pregnancies during her marriage to Henry. Katherine gave birth to a son, Henry, Duke of Cornwall, in 1511, but the prince died of unknown causes just seven weeks later. After the birth of Katherine and Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary—their only child to survive infancy—all of Katherine&#x27;s subsequent pregnancies ended in miscarriages or stillbirths. Many have suggested that Henry FitzRoy&#x27;s birth further affirmed Henry&#x27;s desires to end his marriage to Katherine. The birth of FitzRoy served as evidence of Henry&#x27;s ability to sire a living, albeit illegitimate, son, further stirring Henry&#x27;s skepticism and apprehensions about the validity of his marriage to Katherine.

== Children ==
From King Henry VIII:

# Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, 1st Earl of Nottingham, born 1519, died 1536. Married Lady Mary Howard. No children.

From a first marriage to Gilbert Talboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme:

# Elizabeth Tailboys, 4th Baroness Tailboys of Kyme, born c. 1520, died 1563, who at the death of her brother, the 3rd baron, became the 4th Baroness Tailboys of Kyme. Married firstly Thomas Wymbish, of Nocton (died 1553), who claimed the title in his wife&#x27;s right. It was, however, ruled that a husband could not so bear his wife&#x27;s title unless he had a child by her; this ruling was the final decision on the point. Married secondly, c.1552, as his second wife, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick (c. 1530–1590). She died in 1563, and, as she had no children, the barony became extinct.
# George Tailboys, 2nd Baron Tailboys of Kyme, born c. 1523, who succeeded as 2nd Baron Tailboys of Kyme, and died on 6 September 1540. Married Margaret Skipwith in 1539. No children.
# Robert Tailboys, 3rd Baron Tailboys of Kyme, de jure Lord Kyme, born c. 1523, died 1541.

From a second marriage to Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln:

# Lady Bridget Clinton (born c. 1536). She married Robert Dymoke (1531–1580), of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire, some time around 1556 and had ten children. Dymoke (sometimes spelt Dymock or Dymocke) was a devout Catholic and named a martyr after his death.
# Lady Katherine Clinton (b. c. 1538 – d. 14 August 1621). She married William Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh of Gainsborough (c. 1522 – 10 October 1584), son of Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh. Had three sons and three daughters, one of them being Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh.
# Lady Margaret Clinton (b. c. 1539). She married Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham (died 1603), and had five children.

<doc id="588543" wikidata="Q7274741" url="?curid=588543" title="R42 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R42 was a New York City Subway car model built by the St. Louis Car Company between 1969 and 1970 for the IND/BMT B Division. There were 400 cars in the R42 fleet, numbered 4550–4949. It was the last B Division car built for the New York City Subway until the R143 in 2001, and the last car model class to be built in married pairs.

The first R42 cars entered service on May 9, 1969. Various modifications were made over the years to the R42 fleet. In the late 1980s, the R42 cars were rebuilt by Morrison–Knudsen and the Coney Island Rapid Transit Car Overhaul Shop. 

The R160 order was to replace all R42s in the late 2000s, but 50 cars of the original fleet remained, when it was decided to retire the NYCT R44s instead. The R179 order replaced the remainder of the R42s in the late 2010s. The R42s temporarily resumed service from January 8 through 24 in 2020 when the R179s were pulled from service. The final train of R42s ran in passenger service on February 12, 2020. After retirement, most of the R42s were sunk as artificial reefs, scrapped, or placed into storage, but a handful have been preserved and others retained for various purposes.

==Description==
The R42s were numbered 4550–4949. They were the first fleet of New York City Subway cars to be fully equipped with Stone-Safety 10 ton air conditioning systems/units. Such units were similarly found on the last ten R38s (4140–4149) and all two-hundred R40As (4350–4549).

The R42s were also the first cars to use solid-state converters in place of the motor-generators as standard equipment and were also the last cars to be equipped with the tried-and-true, and extremely reliable WABCO RT-2 or SMEE braking system temporarily, until returning in 1983 with the R62s for the IRT division, after disastrous results with the newer WABCO RT-5 or P-Wire braking systems used on their R44 and R46 cars of the 1970s. They were also the last cars to not have the two-note warning chime that was present on the R44 and all of the train models following it.

As the R42s and the straight-ended R40As were nearly identical, they were often operated together in mixed-consists.

==History==
On May 9, 1969, cars 4554–4555 entered service on the as part of a mixed consist with straight-ended R40As. By January 5, 1970, all cars were in service.

===Post-delivery, overhaul, and mishaps===
Initially, the R42s suffered from air conditioning and brake malfunctions, frequently injuring crew members.

In 1973, cars 4764–4765 were sent to Garrett AiResearch&#x27;s facilities in Los Angeles, California, to test out an experimental flywheel energy storage and energy-saving system and equipment. Car 4764 received this energy storage, conservation equipment, and machinery with batteries and amber-type digital readouts indicating the amount of energy used by the equipment, while 4765 remained untouched. These cars were later tested at the UMTA and the USDOT testing facility in Pueblo, Colorado for evaluation, before being returned to the MTA in 1976 for in-service testing on all BMT/IND lines to check the effectiveness of the technology.

In 1977, pantograph gates, salvaged from retired R1 through R9 cars, were modified and installed on the front ends of the R42s. Baloney coiled spring type inter car safety barriers were also installed on the blind ends of the married pairs.

Between 1988 and 1989, the R42s underwent overhaul as a result of deferred maintenance in the New York City Subway during the 1970s and the 1980s. 282 cars (most cars from 4550 to 4839) were overhauled by Morrison–Knudsen, while the last 110 cars (4840–4949) were rebuilt in-house by the Coney Island Rapid Transit Car Overhaul Shop in Brooklyn. Notable changes from the overhaul included the replacement of the original doors by stainless steel doors with smaller windows. Morrison–Knudsen also removed the blue door indicator lights at the ends of the cars, but kept the original Westinghouse XM829 master controllers in their cabs. The Coney Island rebuilds retained their blue indicator lights. The eight cars that were not rebuilt were 4680–4681, 4685, 4714–4715, 4726, and 4766–4767, which were prematurely scrapped due to damage sustained in various accidents during the 1970s and 1980s. As cars 4684 and 4727 lost their mates in separate incidents, the two cars were paired with each other and subsequently overhauled.

On June 6, 1995, cars 4664–4665 were involved in a collision on the Williamsburg Bridge with straight-ended R40A cars 4460–4461. Car 4664 was scrapped in 2000 (along with cars 4685 and 4726, which were not involved in the accident) and R40A 4461 was taken out of service, leaving 4665 to be mated with R40A 4460. This pair today survives as part of the museum fleet.

On November 6, 2007, an train of R42s was involved in an accident when the motorman attempted to relay it south of the Chambers Street station. As the R42 fleet was being retired at the time, the entire consist was hauled to the 207th Street Yard for reefing instead of being repaired, even though only the first two cars suffered major damage.

===Retirement===
The R160s replaced the vast majority of the R42s in the late 2000s. All of the Coney Island-rebuilt cars were retired first from July 2007 to May 2008 due to various structural and braking issues that plagued them throughout their rebuilt lifespan. Subsequently, with the exception of the eight cars involved in the November 6, 2007 accident, most Morrison–Knudsen-rebuilt cars followed from December 2008 until December 2009, when it was decided to retire the NYCT R44s instead. 50 cars (4788–4817 and 4820–4839) remained and were assigned to East New York Yard, operating on the J and Z. These 50 cars periodically underwent SMS (Scheduled Maintenance Service, a life extension program) cycles.

The R179s replaced the remainder of the R42s in the late 2010s. Since the delivery of the four-car R179 sets, demand for the R42s drastically lowered. By late April 2019, they were no longer formally assigned for revenue service, becoming a contingency fleet. With the R179 delivery completed, the R42s were gradually phased out until the last train made its final trip on the J on December 30, 2019. However, from January 8 through January 24, 2020, the R42s were restored to revenue service due to the R179 being pulled from service. Finally, on February 12, 2020, the R42s were officially retired when the last train made its final trip on the A as part of a ceremonial farewell excursion sponsored by the New York Transit Museum.

Following retirement, nearly all cars retired by the R160s were stripped of parts and sunk as artificial reefs. After the reefing program ended in April 2010, leftover retired R42s were trucked to Sims Metal Management&#x27;s Newark facility to be scrapped and processed in mid-2013. Meanwhile, the then-50 remaining cars retired by the R179s were gradually reassigned to work service starting in summer 2020; they handle such tasks as providing traction for B Division rail adhesion trains and refuse collection trains. Of the 50 cars in work service, car 4816 was damaged in an accident at Coney Island Yard in October 2022; it was removed off property along with its mate 4817 in April 2023.

Other R42 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system. The full list includes:
* 4572–4573 – preserved by the New York Transit Museum. This pair was used in the famous chase scene in the film &quot;The French Connection&quot;. The cars have been used on several recent NYTM fan trips, specifically as a part of the &quot;Train of Many Metals&quot; (&quot;TOMM&quot;).
* 4665 (and its R40A mate 4460) – preserved by the Railway Preservation Corp.
* 4736–4737 – donated to East New York&#x27;s Transit Tech High School on April 14, 2009, replacing R30 car 8337, which was reefed a few months later.

==In popular culture==
An R42 is featured in film &quot;The French Connection&quot;. The cars have been used as a chase scene and crashes into an R32.

<doc id="588546" wikidata="Q171989" url="?curid=588546" title="James R. Schlesinger">
<text>James Rodney Schlesinger (February 15, 1929 – March 27, 2014) was an American economist and public servant who was best known for serving as Secretary of Defense from 1973 to 1975 under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Prior to becoming Secretary of Defense, he served as Chair of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1971 to 1973, and as CIA Director for a few months in 1973. He became America&#x27;s first Secretary of Energy under Jimmy Carter in 1977, serving until 1979.

While Secretary of Defense, he opposed amnesty for draft resisters and pressed for development of more sophisticated nuclear weapon systems. Additionally, his support for the A-10 and the lightweight fighter program (later the F-16) helped ensure that they were carried to completion.

==Early life and career==
James Rodney Schlesinger was born in New York City, the son of Jewish parents, Rhea Lillian (née Rogen) and Julius Schlesinger. His mother was a Lithuanian emigrant from what was then part of the Russian Empire and his father&#x27;s family was from Austria. He converted to Lutheranism in his early twenties. Schlesinger was educated at the Horace Mann School and Harvard University, where he earned a B.A. (1950), M.A. (1952), and Ph.D. (1956) in economics. Between 1955 and 1963 he taught economics at the University of Virginia and in 1960 published &quot;The Political Economy of National Security.&quot; In 1963, he moved to the RAND Corporation, where he worked until 1969, in the later years as director of strategic studies.

===Nixon Administration===
In 1969, Schlesinger joined the Nixon administration as assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, devoting most of his time to Defense matters. In 1971, President Nixon appointed Schlesinger a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and designated him as chairman. Serving in this position for about a year and a half, Schlesinger instituted extensive organizational and management changes in an effort to improve the AEC&#x27;s regulatory performance.

==== CIA Director ====
Schlesinger was CIA Director from February 2, 1973, to July 2, 1973. He was succeeded by William Colby.

Schlesinger was extremely unpopular with CIA staff, as he reduced CIA staff by 7%, and was considered a Nixon loyalist seeking to make the agency more obedient to Nixon. He had a CCTV camera installed near his official portrait at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., as it was believed that vandalism of the portrait by disgruntled staff was likely.

==Secretary of Defense (1973–1975)==
Schlesinger left the CIA to become Secretary of Defense on July 2, aged 44. As a university professor, researcher at Rand, and government official in three agencies, he had acquired an impressive resume in national security affairs.

===Nuclear strategy===

Shortly after assuming office, Schlesinger outlined the basic objectives that would guide his administration: maintain a &quot;strong defense establishment&quot;; &quot;assure the military balance so necessary to deterrence and a more enduring peace&quot;; obtain for members of the military &quot;the respect, dignity and support that are their due&quot;; assume &quot;an . . . obligation to use our citizens&#x27; resources wisely&quot;; and &quot;become increasingly competitive with potential adversaries... [W]e must not be forced out of the market on land, at sea, or in the air. Eli Whitney belongs to us, not to our competitors.&quot; In particular, Schlesinger saw a need in the post-Vietnam era to restore the morale and prestige of the military services; modernize strategic doctrine and programs; step up research and development; and shore up a DoD budget that had been declining since 1968.

Analyzing strategy, Schlesinger maintained that the theory and practice of the 1950s and 1960s had been overtaken by events, particularly the rise of the Soviet Union to virtual nuclear parity with the United States and the effect this development had on the concept of deterrence. Schlesinger believed that &quot;deterrence is not a substitute for defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective counteraction, are the essential condition of deterrence.&quot; He had grave doubts about the assured destruction strategy, which relied on massive nuclear attacks against an enemy&#x27;s urban-industrial areas. Credible strategic nuclear deterrence, the secretary felt, depended on fulfilling several conditions: maintaining essential equivalence with the Soviet Union in force effectiveness; maintaining a highly survivable force that could be withheld or targeted against an enemy&#x27;s economic base in order to deter coercive or desperation attacks against U.S. population or economic targets; establishing a fast-response force that could act to deter additional enemy attacks; and establishing a range of capabilities sufficient to convince all nations that the United States was equal to its strongest competitors.

To meet these needs, Schlesinger built on existing ideas in developing a flexible response nuclear strategy, which, with the President&#x27;s approval, he made public by early 1974. The United States, Schlesinger said, needed the ability, in the event of a nuclear attack, to respond so as to &quot;limit the chances of uncontrolled escalation&quot; and &quot;hit meaningful targets&quot; without causing widespread collateral damage. The nation&#x27;s assured destruction force would be withheld in the hope that the enemy would not attack U.S. cities. In rejecting assured destruction, Schlesinger quoted President Nixon: &quot;Should a President, in the event of a nuclear attack, be left with the single option of ordering the mass destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?&quot;

With this approach, Schlesinger moved to a partial counterforce policy, emphasizing Soviet military targets such as ICBM missile installations, avoiding initial attacks on population centers, and minimizing unintended collateral damage. He explicitly disavowed any intention to acquire a destabilizing first-strike capability against the USSR. But he wanted &quot;an offensive capability of such size and composition that all will perceive it as in overall balance with the strategic forces of any potential opponent.&quot;

Schlesinger devoted much attention to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, citing the need to strengthen its conventional capabilities. He rejected the old assumption that NATO did not need a direct counter to Warsaw Pact conventional forces because it could rely on tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, noting that the approximate nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviets in the 1970s made this stand inappropriate. He rejected the argument that NATO could not afford a conventional counterweight to Warsaw Pact forces. In his discussions with NATO leaders, Schlesinger promoted the concept of burden-sharing, stressing the troubles that the United States faced in the mid-1970s because of an unfavorable balance of international payments. He urged qualitative improvements in NATO forces, including equipment standardization, and an increase in defense spending by NATO governments of up to five percent of their gross national product.

===Yom Kippur War and Cyprus crisis===

Schlesinger had an abiding interest in strategic theory, but he also had to deal with a succession of immediate crises that tested his administrative and political skills. In October 1973, three months after he took office, Arab countries launched a surprise attack on Israel and started the Yom Kippur War. A few days after the war started, with Israel not faring as well as expected militarily, the Soviets resupplying some Arab countries and the Israeli government having authorized the use and assembly of nuclear weapons, the United States began an overt operation to airlift materiel to Israel. As Schlesinger explained, the initial U.S. policy to avoid direct involvement rested on the assumption that Israel would win quickly. But when it became clear that the Israelis faced more formidable military forces than anticipated, and could not meet their own resupply arrangements, the United States took up the burden. According to Henry Kissinger, with the president&#x27;s authority, the directive was made to resupply Israel with the needed equipment and eliminate State Department delay. &quot;It was alleged that the airlift was deliberately delayed as a maneuver to pressure Israel.&quot; Schlesinger rejected charges that the Defense Department delayed the resupply effort to avoid irritating the Arab states and that he had had a serious disagreement over this matter with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Eventually the combatants agreed to a cease-fire, but not before the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Arab side and the United States declared a higher level worldwide alert of its forces.

Another crisis flared in July 1974 within the NATO alliance when Turkish forces, concerned about the long-term lack of safety for the minority Turkish community, invaded Cyprus after the Cypriot National Guard, supported by the government of Greece, overthrew President Archbishop Makarios. When the fighting stopped, the Turks held the northern portion of country and about 40 percent of the island. Turkey&#x27;s military action caused controversy in the United States, because of protests and lobbying by supporters of the Greek Cypriot side and, officially, because Turkish forces used some U.S.-supplied military equipment intended solely for NATO purposes.

He felt the Turks had overstepped the bounds of legitimate NATO interests in Cyprus and suggested that the United States might have to reexamine its military aid program to Turkey. During this time, President Gerald R. Ford had succeeded Nixon after his resignation; eventually Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made it clear with two presidential vetoes that they favored continued military assistance to Turkey as a valued NATO ally, but Congress overrode both vetoes and in December 1974 prohibited such aid, which instituted an arms embargo that lasted five years.

===Indochina===

The last phase of the Vietnam War occurred during Schlesinger&#x27;s tenure. Although all U.S. combat forces had left South Vietnam in the spring of 1973, the United States continued to maintain a military presence in other areas of Southeast Asia. Some senators criticized Schlesinger and questioned him sharply during his confirmation hearings in June 1973 after he stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam and Laos if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. However, when the North Vietnamese began their 1975 Spring Offensive, the United States could do little to help the South Vietnamese, who collapsed completely as the North Vietnamese captured Saigon in late April. Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from Saigon by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military and civilian personnel.

Only one other notable event remained in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces boarded and captured the crew of the &quot;Mayaguez&quot;, an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the majority of the American people seemed to approve of the administration&#x27;s decisive action.

===Defense budget===

Unsurprisingly, given his determination to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, Schlesinger devoted much time and effort to the Defense budget. Even before becoming secretary, in a speech in San Francisco in September 1972, he warned that it was time &quot;to call a halt to the self-defeating game of cutting defense outlays, this process, that seems to have become addictive, of chopping away year after year.&quot; Shortly after he took office, he complained about &quot;the post-war follies&quot; of Defense budget-cutting. Later he outlined the facts about the DoD budget: In real terms it had been reduced by one-third since FY 1968; it was one-eighth below the pre-Vietnam War FY 1964 budget; purchases of equipment, consumables, and R&amp;D were down 45 percent from the wartime peak and about $10 billion in constant dollars below the prewar level; Defense now absorbed about 6 percent of the gross national product, the lowest percentage since before the Korean War; military manpower was at the lowest point since before the Korean War; and Defense spending amounted to about 17 percent of total national expenditures, the lowest since before the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Armed with these statistics, and alarmed by continuing Soviet weapon advances, Schlesinger became a vigorous advocate of larger DoD budgets. But he had little success. For FY 1975, Congress provided TOA of $86.1 billion, compared with $81.6 billion in FY 1974; for FY 1976, the amount was $95.6 billion, an increase of 3.4 percent, but in real terms slightly less than it had been in FY 1955.

===Dismissal as Secretary of Defense===

Schlesinger&#x27;s insistence on higher defense budgets, his disagreements within the administration and with Congress on this issue, and his differences with Secretary of State Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal by President Ford in November 1975. Schlesinger&#x27;s legacy included the development of the close-air support aircraft the A-10 and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would not put the United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary&#x27;s harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed President Ford, who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as Secretary of State. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.

The main reason behind Schlesinger&#x27;s dismissal, though at the time unreported, was his insubordination toward President Ford. During the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident, Ford ordered several retaliatory strikes against Cambodia. Schlesinger told Ford the first strike was carried out, but Ford later learned that Schlesinger, who disagreed with the order, had none of them carried out. According to Bob Woodward&#x27;s 1999 book, &quot;Shadow&quot;, Ford let the incident go, but when Schlesinger committed further insubordination on other matters, Ford fired him. Woodward observes, &quot;The United States had just lost a war for the first time. That the president and the secretary of defense could not agree on who was in charge was appalling. [This] unpublicized breakdown in the military chain of command was perhaps the most significant scandal of the Ford presidency.&quot; Schlesinger had also disobeyed Ford when told to send as many military aircraft as possible to evacuate South Vietnam. Schlesinger disagreed with doing so and did not send the aircraft. Woodward says that an elected president, which Ford was not, would never have tolerated the insubordination.

In spite of the controversy surrounding both his tenure and dismissal, Schlesinger was by most accounts an able secretary of defense. A serious and perceptive thinker on nuclear strategy, he was determined that the United States not fall seriously behind the Soviet Union in conventional and nuclear forces and devoted himself to modernization of defense policies and programs. He got along well with the military leadership because he proposed to give them more resources, consulted with them regularly, and shared many of their views. Because he was a forthright speaker who could be blunt in his opinions and did not enjoy the personal rapport with legislators that prior Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird had, his relations with Congress were often strained. A majority of its members may have approved Schlesinger&#x27;s strategic plans, but they kept a tight rein on the money for his programs.

==Secretary of Energy (1977–1979)==

After leaving the Pentagon, Schlesinger wrote and spoke forcefully about national security issues, especially the Soviet threat and the need for the United States to maintain adequate defenses. When Jimmy Carter became president in January 1977 he appointed Schlesinger, a Republican, as his special adviser on energy and subsequently as the first Secretary of Energy in October 1977. According to one account, &quot;Schlesinger impressed candidate Jimmy Carter with his brains, his high-level experience... and with secrets regarding the defense spending vacillations of his old boss, Ford, just in time for the presidential debates.&quot;

As Energy Secretary, Schlesinger launched the Department&#x27;s Carbon Dioxide Effects and Assessment Program shortly after the creation of that department in 1977. Secretary Schlesinger also oversaw the integration of the energy powers of more than 50 agencies, such as the Federal Energy Administration and the Federal Power Commission. In July 1979, Carter replaced him as part of a broader Cabinet shakeup. According to journalist Paul Glastris, &quot;Carter fired Schlesinger in 1979 in part for the same reason Gerald Ford had—he was unbearably arrogant and impatient with lesser minds who disagreed with him, and hence inept at dealing with Congress.&quot;

===Climate change memo===
On July 7, 1977 Schlesinger read and attached a note to a memo about the catastrophic effects of climate change entitled &quot;Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change&quot;, his note read:

My view is that the policy implications of this issue are still too uncertain to warrant Presidential involvement and policy initiatives.
The note encouraged then President Carter to dismiss the issue, and therefore contributed to the long-held dismissal of climate-related discourse and action within the US government.

==Post-government activities==

After leaving the Energy Department, Schlesinger resumed his writing and speaking career, including the 1994 lecture at the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University. He was employed as a senior adviser to Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., of New York City. He advised Congressman and presidential candidate Richard Gephardt in 1988.

In 1995, he was the Chairman of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). They wrote a report in conjunction with the National Research Council called &quot;The Global Positioning System: Charting the Future&quot; The report advocated for the opening GPS up to the private sector.

On February 8, 2002, he appeared at a hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in support of the creation of a commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks.

On June 11, 2002, he was appointed by U.S. President George W. Bush to the Homeland Security Advisory Council. He also served as a consultant to the United States Department of Defense, and was a member of the Defense Policy Board.

In 2004, he served as chairman to the Independent Panel to Review DoD Detention Operations.

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. On January 31, 2006, he was appointed by the Secretary of State to be a member of the Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board. On May 2, 2006, he was named to be a co-chairman of a Defense Science Board study on DOD Energy Strategy. He was an honorary chairman of The OSS Society. He was also a Bilderberg Group attendee in 2008.

In 2007, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin appointed Schlesinger to be the Chairman of the National Space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Advisory Board. The &quot;PNT Board&quot; is composed of recognized Global Positioning System (GPS) experts from outside the U.S. government that advise the Deputy Secretary level PNT Executive Committee in their oversight management of the GPS constellation and its governmental augmentations. 

On June 5, 2008, Defense Secretary Robert Gates appointed Schlesinger to head a task force to ensure the &quot;highest levels&quot; of control over nuclear weapons. The purpose of the review was to prevent a repeat of recent incidents where control was lost over components of nuclear weapons, and even over nuclear weapons themselves. 

Schlesinger was chairman of the Board of Trustees of The MITRE Corporation, having served on it from 1985 until his death in 2014; on the advisory board of &quot;The National Interest&quot;; a Director of BNFL, Inc., Peabody Energy, Sandia Corporation, Seven Seas Petroleum Company, chairman of the executive committee of The Nixon Center. He was also on the advisory board of GeoSynFuels, LLC. Schlesinger penned a number of opinion pieces on global warming, expressing a strongly skeptical position. 

===Peak oil===
Schlesinger raised awareness of the peak oil issue and supports facing it. In the keynote speech at a 2007 conference hosted by the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas in Cork, Schlesinger said that oil industry executives now privately concede that the world faces an imminent oil production peak. In his 2010 ASPO-USA keynote speech, Schlesinger observed that the Peak Oil debate was over. He warned of political inaction as a major hindrance, like those in Pompeii before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

On June 5, 2008, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that he had asked Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD following the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.

==Personal life==
In 1954, Schlesinger married Rachel Line Mellinger (1930–1995); they had eight children: Cora (1955), Charles (1956), Ann (1958), William (1959), Emily (1961), Thomas (1964), Clara (1966) and James (1970).

Though raised in a Jewish household, Schlesinger converted to Lutheranism as an adult.

Rachel Schlesinger was an accomplished violinist and board member of the Arlington Symphony. In the early 1990s, she was a leader in the fundraising effort to create a premier performing arts center on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. She died from cancer before seeing the center&#x27;s completion. After her death, Dr. Schlesinger donated $1 million to have the center named in his wife&#x27;s memory. The Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center at Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus opened in September, 2001. It is an up-to-date building that features the Mary Baker Collier Theatre, the Margaret W. and Joseph L. Fisher Art Gallery, the Wachovia Forum and Seminar Room spaces. Clients of the Schlesinger Center include the Alexandria Symphony, the United States Marine Band, &quot;The President&#x27;s Own&quot;, and the U.S. Marine Chamber Orchestra, the United States Army Band, &quot;Pershing&#x27;s Own&quot;, and the U.S. Army Strings, the United States Navy Band, the New Dominion Chorale, the American Balalaika Symphony, Festivals of Music, various ethnic groups and many others.

Schlesinger worked consistently with distinction long after his government and academic experiences, serving on numerous governmental advisory boards until only weeks before his death at the age of 85.
He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Springfield, Ohio.

==In popular culture==
Schlesinger is referred to in the book &quot;Peril&quot; by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa concerning actions taken by Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Trump and Biden. According to the news outlet Slate, in 1974 &quot;Schlesinger told Brown,&quot; then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, &quot;to call him if he received any unusual orders from Nixon. Brown then told all the four-star officers in charge of the various military commands (including Strategic Air Command, which then had control of nuclear weapons) that they were not to carry out any &#x27;execute orders&#x27; from the president unless Brown and Schlesinger first verified the orders.&quot; Senator Chuck Grassley recently called these actions &quot;extralegal&quot;. According to Grassley, when President Nixon faced a crisis over impeachment and resignation, Secretary of Defense Schlesinger feared he might order an unprovoked nuclear strike,&#x27; he continued. &#x27;So he reportedly took extralegal steps to prevent it. Both author Fred Kaplan and Grassley distinguish the actions of Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense, from the actions of Mark Milley as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with Grassley saying: &quot;Pulling a Milley is a very different kettle of fish. A four-star general can&#x27;t &#x27;pull a Schlesinger&#x27;. Schlesinger was at the top of the chain of command, just below the President. He kept the President&#x27;s constitutional command [sic] authority firmly in civilian hands. Milley allegedly placed military hands—his hands—on controls that belong exclusively to the President.&quot;

<doc id="588548" wikidata="Q358863" url="?curid=588548" title="Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset">
<text>Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset (c. 15 June 1519 – 23 July 1536) was the son of Henry VIII of England and his mistress Elizabeth Blount, and the only child born out of wedlock whom Henry acknowledged. He was the younger half-brother of Mary I, as well as the older half-brother of Elizabeth I and Edward VI. Through his mother, he was the elder half-brother of Elizabeth, George, and Robert Tailboys. His surname means &quot;son of the king&quot; in Norman French.

==Birth==
Henry FitzRoy was born in June 1519. His mother was Elizabeth Blount, Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, and his father was Henry VIII. FitzRoy was conceived when Queen Catherine was approaching her last confinement with another of Henry&#x27;s children, a stillborn daughter born in November 1518. To avoid scandal, Blount was taken from Henry&#x27;s court to the Augustinian priory of St Laurence at Blackmore near Ingatestone, in Essex.

FitzRoy&#x27;s birthdate is often given as 15 June 1519, but the exact date is not known.
His birth may have been earlier than predicted. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was out of London from 9 to 18 June when he reappeared back at court in Windsor. The following day he was expected at Hampton Court, but he did not reappear at a council meeting at Westminster until 29 June. The policy of discretion worked, as the baby boy&#x27;s arrival caused no great stir, and diplomatic dispatches record nothing of Henry VIII&#x27;s illegitimate son.

==Christening==
The christening of the newborn Henry FitzRoy was not recorded even though Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was his godfather and known to have been present at the event. This puts the date of the christening possibly before 29 June when he reappeared at court. The identity of the other godfather is unknown. Although Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk took a great interest in Henry FitzRoy when he was older, in 1519 he was still the heir to the Dukedom of Norfolk, and styled the Earl of Surrey. If Henry had chosen the House of Howard, he would probably have chosen the elder Thomas Howard, who at the time was the 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Another suggestion for the second godfather could be Henry VIII himself, although it was not normal practice for a parent to stand as godparent to his own child: Henry had taken the role of godfather at the christening of his own nephew, Lord Henry Brandon (who was also the son of Henry&#x27;s closest friend) in March 1516, and his daughter Princess Mary stood godmother to her half-brother Prince Edward in 1537.

==Acknowledgement==
The infant boy was given the surname &quot;FitzRoy&quot; to make sure that all knew he was son of the King. Henry VIII openly acknowledged the boy, perhaps because he felt that his lack of a male heir was a slur upon his manhood. At one point he proudly exhibited his newborn son to the court.

==Nursery==

The boy&#x27;s upbringing until the moment when he entered Bridewell Palace in June 1525 (six years following his birth) remains shrouded in confusion. Although the boy was illegitimate, this did not mean that young Henry lived remotely from and had no contact with his father. On the contrary, it has been suggested by his biographer, Beverly Murphy, that a letter from a royal nurse implies that FitzRoy had also been part of the royal nursery, and he was often at court after 1530.

In the 16th century, royal and noble households were in a state of constant movement and transition, so it is unlikely that FitzRoy grew up in any one house. He was probably transferred from household to household around London like his royal siblings: Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward. In 1519, the only surviving legitimate child of the King was the three-year-old Princess Mary. In that year her household was reorganised, suggesting that Henry made some provisions for his only son. Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury replaced Lady Margaret Bryan as Mistress of Mary&#x27;s household. At the same time at least two of Mary&#x27;s carers appear to have left her service.

It is not impossible that Princess Mary&#x27;s household could have been reorganised some time before her former servants found posts with Henry FitzRoy.

In addition, the correspondence of the child&#x27;s first known tutor makes it clear that FitzRoy also received some rudimentary education prior to his elevation to the peerage in 1525. John Palsgrave grumbled loudly that Henry had been taught to recite his prayers in a &quot;barbarous&quot; Latin accent and dismissed the man who had instructed him as &quot;no clerk&quot;. Although he was more well known from 1525 and onwards, there is some evidence that he was already in receipt of royal favour even before his ennoblement; this comes from a surviving list of &quot;Wardrobe stuff appointed for my lord Henry&quot;. The &quot;Lord Henry&quot; in question is not identified but given that the subject was not considered to require a title and that the list has survived with further documents relating to the household established for Henry FitzRoy after his ennoblement, it would seem reasonable to assume that it is Henry FitzRoy. The familiar way in which he is described as &quot;My Lord Henry&quot; is also interesting and suggests that, amongst the officers close to the King, at least, his existence was hardly a secret. Alternatively, he may have been raised in the north with his mother and her husband Gilbert Tailboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme, and their children.

==Elevation==
By 1525, the House of Tudor had been on the throne for 40 years. However, cracks were beginning to appear. By the sixteenth year of his reign, 34-year-old Henry still lacked a male heir with his 40-year-old wife Catherine of Aragon. Their only surviving child and heiress was Princess Mary, who at the time was a girl of nine. Henry, though, had another child, an illegitimate one, a sturdy six-year-old son. Although Henry may have had other illegitimate children, Henry FitzRoy was the only one the King acknowledged. Henry VIII was also the only surviving son of Henry VII. Henry had no surviving younger brother nor any close male relations from his father&#x27;s family who could be called up to share the burden of government in the King&#x27;s name. As Henry and Catherine&#x27;s marriage remained without a son, the king&#x27;s only living son became more attractive for onlookers to observe. The King&#x27;s chief minister at the time was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, and since Henry FitzRoy&#x27;s birth, he had taken an interest in his monarch&#x27;s only son. In a letter dated June 1525, the Cardinal refers to the King&#x27;s son: &quot;Your entirely beloved sonne, the Lord Henry FitzRoy&quot;.

In 1525, FitzRoy was given his own residence in London, which he was granted by his father: Durham House on the Strand. Since his birth FitzRoy had remained in the background, although the boy had been brought up in remarkable style and comfort, almost as if he were a prince of the blood and not an acknowledged royal bastard. Such discretion over his son may not have been to the King&#x27;s taste, and he may have felt his manhood and virility should be publicly demonstrated. He fully made up for his son&#x27;s quiet birth and equally quiet christening when on 18 June 1525 the six-year-old boy was brought to Bridewell Palace on the western edge of the city of London where honours were showered upon him. That morning of the 18th, the six-year-old Lord Henry FitzRoy travelled by barge from Wolsey&#x27;s mansion of Durham Place, near Charing Cross, down the River Thames. He came in the company of a host of knights, squires, and other gentlemen. At 9am his barge pulled up at the Watergate and his party made their way through the palace to the king&#x27;s lodgings on the south side of the second floor. The rooms were richly decorated, with various members of the court and the nobility coming to see FitzRoy&#x27;s elevation. Among them were numerous bishops, as well as Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and the King&#x27;s brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. During the first ceremony, when he was created Earl of Nottingham, FitzRoy was attended by Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, who carried the sword of state, along with John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford, and William FitzAlan, 18th Earl of Arundel. Six-year-old Henry knelt before his father as Sir Thomas More read out the patents of nobility. It was the first time since the 12th century that an illegitimate son had been raised to the peerage, when Henry II, King of England had created his son William Earl of Salisbury. However, the ceremony was not yet complete. The onlookers watched as the young Lord Nottingham re-emerged into the chamber. The Earl of Northumberland carried the robes; behind him came Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, carrying the sword; the Earl of Arundel, carrying the cap of estate with a circlet; and the Earl of Oxford with a rod of gold. Once again young Henry FitzRoy knelt before his father, and as the patent was read he was invested with the trappings of a duke. This time when he rose to his feet he was Duke of Richmond and Somerset.

To be a duke was a significant honour. It was the highest rank of the peerage, and the title, originally devised by Edward III, King of England for his son Edward, Prince of Wales as the Duke of Cornwall, retained its royal aura. The former Henry FitzRoy was subsequently referred to in all formal correspondence as the &quot;right high and noble Prince Henry, Duke of Richmond and Somerset&quot;. As if to compound this sense of royal dignity and endow the child with as much respectability as possible, Henry VIII had granted his son the unprecedented honour of a double dukedom. While he is mostly known as Richmond, some pains were taken to see that he bore both titles in equal weight. The bulk of Richmond&#x27;s new lands came from Margaret Beaufort&#x27;s estate. These were lands which were the rightful inheritance of King Henry VII when he was Earl of Richmond and the lands which had belonged to John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, the father of Margaret Beaufort. The use of the Duchy of Somerset must have struck a chord among the courtiers, as it was well known that the Beauforts&#x27; eldest child was John Somerset, a royal bastard who had been legitimised following his parents&#x27; adultery and then marriage. A part of the Beaufort connection to the Somerset duchy, the title of Duke of Richmond was important as the earldom of Richmond had been held by his grandfather King Henry VII and by his great-grandfather Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. The earldom of Nottingham had been held by Richmond&#x27;s great uncle Prince Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, the second son of Edward IV. Seeing Henry&#x27;s obvious pride and affection for his son, many of those who witnessed Richmond&#x27;s elevation must have wondered if this was what the King had in mind. To support his new status, Henry granted his young son an annuity of £4,845. Following the ceremony, there were &quot;great feasts and disguising&quot;. Henry wished to celebrate his six-year-old son with customary extravagance. It is unknown if Elizabeth Blount was present, but it is certain that the new duke&#x27;s stepfather Gilbert Tailboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme was present and must have given her an eyewitness account.

It was a proud day for Henry, and for his former mistress Elizabeth; however, the ceremony did nothing to spare the Queen&#x27;s feelings. She knew she had failed to give England a prince and was anxious about her own daughter&#x27;s prospects. In a private letter, the Venetian ambassador wrote: &quot;It seems that the Queen resents the earldom and dukedom conferred on the King’s natural son and remains dissatisfied. At the instigation it is said of her three Spanish ladies her chief counsellors, so that the King has dismissed them from court, a strong measure but the Queen was obliged to submit and have patience&quot;.

Also at Richmond&#x27;s elevation was Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, his father&#x27;s cousin through Catherine of York, the younger sister of Elizabeth of York. He was raised from being merely the Earl of Devon to be the Marquess of Exeter. Sir Thomas Manners, a great nephew of Edward IV through his sister Anne of York was made the earl of Rutland. Henry Clifford was made the new Earl of Cumberland and would cement his ties to the House of Tudor by marrying his son and heir, Lord Henry Clifford, to Richmond&#x27;s cousin, lady Eleanor Brandon, the King&#x27;s niece. Richmond&#x27;s ceremony was by far the most spectacular but it was also a public relations display, since the last member of the Yorkist faction, Richard de la Pole, lost his life in February of that same year fighting for the French at the Battle of Pavia. The young Henry Brandon became the new Earl of Lincoln, a title which had once belonged to the de la Pole family.

==Crown Offices==
Arrangements for Henry&#x27;s care were initially entrusted to Thomas Wolsey and plans for his elevation were already in progress by April 1525. On 7 June that year, he was elected knight of the Garter and was installed on the 25th. On 18 June, he was made Earl of Nottingham and on the same day he received the honour of a double dukedom; those being Richmond and Somerset. As such, he was endowed with lands whose revenues amounted to £4845 in the first year. In that same year, Richmond, as he came to be known, was granted several other appointments, including Lord High Admiral of England, Lord President of the Council of the North, and Warden of the Marches towards Scotland and Governor of Carlisle, the effect of which was to place the government of the north of England in his hands. He held the offices in name only, the power was actually in the hands of a council dominated by Thomas Magnus, Archdeacon of the East Riding.

From then onwards, the Duke was raised like a prince, at Sheriff Hutton Castle in Yorkshire. His father had a particular fondness for him and took great interest in his upbringing. Sir Thomas Tempest was comptroller of his household. In February 1527, Thomas Magnus told the young Duke that King James V of Scotland, FitzRoy&#x27;s first cousin, had asked for hunting dogs. FitzRoy sent his cousin 20 hunting hounds and a huntsman.

==Kingdom of Ireland==
On 22 June 1529, Richmond was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and there was a plan to crown him king of that country, though the King&#x27;s counsellors feared that making a separate Kingdom of Ireland whose ruler was not that of England would create another threat similar to the Kingdom of Scotland. After Richmond&#x27;s death, the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 established a personal union between the English and Irish crowns, providing that whoever was King of England was to be King of Ireland as well. King Henry VIII of England was proclaimed its first holder.

== Living in France ==
In October 1532, Henry VIII travelled to Calais for a meeting with Francis I of France and took Richmond with him. As part of the negotiations, Richmond joined the French court and lived with the Dauphin Francis and his younger brother, the future King Henry II of France, until August 1533, when he was recalled to England.

==Marriage==

When Henry VIII began the process of having his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled, it was suggested that Richmond marry his own half-sister Mary in order to strengthen Richmond&#x27;s claim to the throne. Anxious to prevent the annulment and Henry&#x27;s possible break with the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope was even prepared to grant a special dispensation for their marriage.

At age 14, on 28 November 1533 the Duke instead married Lady Mary Howard, the only daughter of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. He was on excellent terms with his brother-in-law, the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. The marriage was never consummated.

==Possible heir to the throne==
At the time of Richmond&#x27;s death, an Act was going through Parliament which disinherited Henry&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth as his heir and permitted the King to designate his successor, whether legitimate or not. There is no evidence that Henry intended to proclaim Richmond his heir, but the Act would have permitted him to do so if he wished. The Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys wrote to Emperor Charles V on 8 July 1536 that Henry VIII had made a statute allowing him to nominate a successor, but thought the Duke of Richmond would not succeed to the throne by it, as he was consumptive and now diagnosed incurable.

==Death==
FitzRoy&#x27;s promising career came to an abrupt end in July 1536. According to the chronicler Charles Wriothesley, he became sickly some time before he died, although his biographer Beverley A. Murphy cites his documented public appearances and activities in April and May of that year, without exciting comment on his health. He was reported ill with &quot;consumption&quot; (usually identified as tuberculosis, but possibly another serious lung complaint) in early July, and died at St. James&#x27;s Palace on 23 July 1536.



FitzRoy&#x27;s father-in-law gave orders that the body be wrapped in lead and then taken in a closed cart for secret interment. However, his servants put the body in a straw-filled wagon. The only mourners were two attendants who followed at a distance. FitzRoy was first instance buried at Thetford Priory, the burial place and mausoleum of members of the Howard family.

In February 1540, when Thetford Priory was about to be closed, Howard petitioned the King not to close the Priory Church on the grounds that both his first wife Anne of York, FitzRoy&#x27;s great-aunt, as well as FitzRoy himself were buried there. The request had no effect; at the same time however, the King ordered that the current dissolution of the monasteries be briefly suspended, so that everyone who wished had time to rebury the remains of their relations. Howard moved his son-in-law&#x27;s grave to the Church of St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham.

FitzRoy&#x27;s tomb has a mix of royal and religious iconography, with his personal coat of arms surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Garter and the Order&#x27;s motto &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot;, and the coats of arms of the Howard family (by his marriage to Mary Howard), and friezes showing scenes from the Biblical Old Testament (mainly from the Book of Genesis and part of the Book of Exodus). On the north side are the birth of Eve; God giving the Garden of Eden into the charge of Adam and Eve; the Temptation, and the Expulsion from Paradise. On the west are the nursing of Cain and Abel, and Adam digging to return to Eden; Cain and Abel making their sacrifices (offerings) to God, and Cain killing Abel. On the south side are Noah&#x27;s Ark in the Flood; the drunkenness of Noah; the Prophet Abraham and the Angels, and Lot escaping from Sodom and Gomorrah. On the east are Abraham and his son Isaac as well as Moses and the Law tables, and the Israelites sacrificing to the Golden Calf.

One of the scenes carved on the tomb is the outline of a small door which was the private entrance of noblemen from the Castle.

His father outlived him by just over a decade, and was succeeded by his legitimate son, Edward VI, born shortly after FitzRoy&#x27;s death. It is said that Henry FitzRoy might have been made king had Henry VIII died without a legitimate son:

On her death in December 1557, his wife, Mary Howard, was buried along with FitzRoy.

<text>Cooperativa La Cruz Azul, S.C.L. is a cement company in Mexico. It was founded in 1881 by a British businessman named Henry Gibbon.

On 22 May 1927, the company&#x27;s workers organized Club Deportivo Cruz Azul football club as a company team, which has gone on to become one of the most famous association football teams in Mexico, winning several national and international titles. The football team&#x27;s association leads to the nickname of &quot;La Máquina Cementera&quot; or the cement locomotive. Along with Coca-Cola and Grupo Bimbo, Cemento Cruz Azul, the cement brand of Cooperativa La Cruz Azul, is one of the most frequently seen emblems on Mexican football jerseys.

With the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, the company enjoyed the benefits of being able to transport across North America. It is now a well known cement company internationally.

Cooperativa La Cruz Azul has faced stiff competition from Mexico&#x27;s other leading cement producer, Cemex, a company which has gone on to set foot on other countries, such as Puerto Rico (Cemex Puerto Rico), the United States and the United Kingdom.

==History==
In 1881, Englishman Henry Gibbon rented a portion of the old Hacienda City of Jasso, Hidalgo, and installed a hydraulic lime factory. By 1883, fellow Englishman Joseph (or George) Watson, heavily invested into the factory and business. Despite the efficient mining of the rich deposits of limestone minerals from the Hidalgo region, the business practically did not develop due to lack of capital and was bankrupt by 1906.

==Oaxaca attack ==
On 27 July 2021, a video surfaced where some 30 people are seen illegally entering the Cruz Azul Oaxaca plant and shooting the place. No injuries were reported in the incident.

<text>In literary theory and aesthetics, authorial intent refers to an author&#x27;s intent as it is encoded in their work. Authorial intentionalism is the hermeneutical view that an author&#x27;s intentions should constrain the ways in which a text is properly interpreted. Opponents, who dispute its hermeneutical importance, have labelled this position the intentional fallacy and count it among the informal fallacies.

There are in fact two types of Intentionalism: Actual Intentionalism and Hypothetical Intentionalism. Actual Intentionalism is the standard intentionalist view that the meaning of a work is dependent on authorial intent. Hypothetical Intentionalism is a more recent view; it views the meaning of a work as being what an ideal reader would hypothesize the writer&#x27;s intent to have been — for hypothetical intentionalism, it is ultimately the hypothesis of the reader, not the truth, that matters.

== Types of actual intentionalism ==

===Extreme intentionalism===
Extreme intentionalism, the classic and most substantial form of intentionalism, holds that the meaning of a text is determined solely by the author&#x27;s intent when he creates that work. As C.S. Lewis wrote in his book &quot;An Experiment in Criticism&quot;, &quot;The first demand any work of art makes upon us is surrender. Look. Listen. Receive. Get yourself out of the way.&quot; Lewis directed readers to sit at the feet of the author and submit to his authority to understand a work&#x27;s meaning — to comprehend a work, a reader must understand what it is that the author is trying to communicate to his audience. This position acknowledges that such can only apply when what the author intends to convey can actually be conveyed by the language that he uses. If an author uses words that cannot, by any reasonable interpretation, possibly mean what he intends, then the work is simply random noise and meaningless nonsense. 

A prominent proponent of this view is E.D. Hirsch, who in his influential book &quot;Validity in Interpretation&quot; (1967) argues for &quot;the sensible belief that a text means what its author meant&quot;. Hirsch contends that the meaning of a text is an ideal entity that exists in the author&#x27;s mind, and the task of interpretation is to reconstruct and represent that intended meaning as accurately as possible. Hirsch proposes utilizing sources like the author&#x27;s other writings, biographical information, and the historical/cultural context to discern the author&#x27;s intentions. Hirsch notes a fundamental distinction between the &quot;meaning&quot; of a text, which does not change over time, and the &quot;significance&quot; of the text, which does change over time. 

Extreme intentionalism holds that authorial intention is the only way to determine the true meaning even in the face of claims that &quot;the author often does not know what he means&quot;. Hirsch answers said objection by distinguishing &quot;authorial intent&quot; from &quot;subject matter&quot;. Hirsch argues that when a reader claims to understand an author&#x27;s meaning better than the author himself, what is really happening is that a reader understands the subject matter better than the author; so the reader might more articulately explain the author&#x27;s meaning — but what the author intended is still the meaning of the text he wrote. Hirsch further addresses the related claim that authors may have unconscious meanings come out in their creative processes by using various arguments to assert that such subconscious processes are still part of the author, and so part of the author&#x27;s intent and meaning, for &quot;How can an author mean something he did not mean?&quot;

Kathleen Stock&#x27;s book &quot;Only Imagine: Fiction, Interpretation, and Imagination&quot; (2017) takes an extreme intentionalist stance specific to fictional works. She argues that for fictional content to exist in a text, the author must have intended the reader to imagine that content. The reader recognizes this authorial intention and uses it as a constraint on what is properly imagined from the text.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism (also called moderate intentionalism) takes a more moderate stance and incorporates some insights from reader-response; it acknowledges the importance of authorial intent while also allowing for meanings derived from readers&#x27; interpretations. As articulated by Mark Bevir in &quot;The Logic of the History of Ideas&quot; (1999), weak intentionalists see meanings as necessarily intentional, but the relevant intentions can come from either authors or readers.

Bevir argues that texts do not contain intrinsic meanings separable from the minds interpreting them. Meaning arises from the intentions of the person engaging with the text — whether that is the author producing it or a reader consuming it. However, Bevir privileges the author&#x27;s intentions as the starting point for interpretation, which then opens up a space for negotiating meanings with readers&#x27; perspectives.

Other proponents of weak intentionalism include P.D. Juhl in &quot;Interpretation: An Essay in the Philosophy of Literary Criticism&quot; (1980). Juhl contends that while authorial intentions provide the central guiding principle, interpretations can legitimately go beyond those original intentions based on the text&#x27;s public meaning and critics&#x27; insights.

=== Cambridge School conventionalism ===

The Cambridge School of conventionalist hermeneutics, a position most elaborated by Quentin Skinner, might be aligned as somewhat similar to weak intentionalism. Central to Cambridge School conventionalism is the idea that to understand what a text means, one must understand the context in which a text was written; this includes political, social, linguistic, historical, and even economic contexts that would influence how a text was intended and received. While not dismissing the role of authorial intent, the Cambridge School heavily emphasizes examining how the text interacted with — and responded to — its particular contextual situation. The Cambridge School believes that meaning emerges from scrutinizing the complex interplay between the words on the page and the contextual factors surrounding its creation. 

One of the Cambridge School&#x27;s distinguishing ideas is the concept of &quot;speech acts&quot;. Drawing on the philosophy of language, particularly the work of J.L. Austin and John Searle, the Cambridge School argues that language not only communicates information but also performs actions. For instance: when a politician declares war, he is not merely stating a fact, he is also performing an action through his speech. 

Similarly, when a betrothed couple say &quot;I do&quot; they are not merely reporting their internal states of mind, they are performing an action — namely, to get married. The intended force of &quot;I do&quot; in such a circumstance can only be comprehended by an observer when he understands the meaning and complexity of the social activity of marriage. Thus, according to the Cambridge School, to understand a text, a reader must understand the linguistic and social conventions that would have been operative at the time the text was produced. 

Since speech-acts are always legible — because they are done by the speech/text itself — the Cambridge School presupposes no knowledge about the author&#x27;s mental state. For Cambridge School conventionalists, the task is: to, with as much contextual information as possible, establish which conventions a text was interacting with at the time of its creation; from there, the author&#x27;s intent may be inferred and understood. 

Mark Bevir, while praising some aspects of the Cambridge School, criticizes it for taking the importance of context too far. He acknowledges context as highly useful and a good heuristic maxim, but not as strictly necessary for understanding a text.

== Objections to actual intentionalism ==
Intentionalism is opposed by various schools of literary theory that may generally be grouped under the heading of anti-intentionalism. Anti-intentionalism maintains that a work&#x27;s meaning is entirely determined by linguistic and literary conventions and rejects the relevance of authorial intent.

Anti-intentionalism began with the work of William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley when they coauthored the seminal paper &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot; in 1946. In it, they argued that once a work was published, it had an objective status; its meanings belonged to, and were governed by, the reading public. The work existed as a stand-alone object not dependent upon authorial intent. The problem with authorial intent was that it required private knowledge about the author; to know what the author intended, a reader would have to learn contextual knowledge that existed outside of the work. Such outside knowledge might be interesting for historians, but it is irrelevant when judging the work for itself.

One of the most famous critiques of intentionalism was the 1967 essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; by Roland Barthes. In it, he argued that once a work was published, it became disconnected from the author&#x27;s intentions and open to perpetual re-interpretation by successive readers across different contexts. He stated: &quot;To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing.&quot; For Barthes, and other post-structuralists like Jacques Derrida, the author&#x27;s intentions were unknowable and irrelevant to the constantly shifting interpretations produced by readers. 

==Alternatives to actual intentionalism==
===New Criticism===
New Criticism, as espoused by Cleanth Brooks, W. K. Wimsatt, T. S. Eliot, and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature; the objective meaning is to be found in the pure text itself. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue in their essay &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot; that &quot;the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art&quot;. The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a writing — the text is the primary source of meaning, and any details of the author&#x27;s desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work&#x27;s composition or the author&#x27;s intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are &quot;private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact&quot; and are thus secondary to the trained reader&#x27;s rigorous engagement with the text itself.

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art) into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it &quot;is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture&quot;. Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence: The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes &quot;private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member.&quot; Also included are &quot;the history of words&quot; and &quot;the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him.&quot; Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence &quot;shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between&quot; the two.

Thus, a text&#x27;s internal evidence — the words themselves and their meanings — is open for literary analysis. External evidence — anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted — does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent &quot;leads away from the poem.&quot; According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather &quot;is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.&quot;

===Reader-response===
Reader-response rejects New Criticism&#x27;s attempt to find an objective meaning via the text itself; instead, it denies the stability and accessibility of meaning completely. It rejects ideological approaches to literary texts that attempt to impose a lens through which a text is to be understood. Reader-response argues that literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates his own, possibly unique, text-related performance. The approach avoids subjectivity or essentialism in descriptions produced through its recognition that reading is determined by textual and also cultural constraints. 

Reader-response critics view authorial intent in various ways. In general, they have argued that the author&#x27;s intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered. However, the author&#x27;s intent will shape the text and limit the possible interpretations of a work. The reader&#x27;s &quot;impression&quot; of the author&#x27;s intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author&#x27;s actual intent is not. Some critics in this school believe that reader-response is a transaction and that there is some form of negotiation going on between authorial intent and reader&#x27;s response. According to Michael Smith and Peter Rabinowitz, this approach is not simply about the question “What does this mean to me?” because if that were the case, the power of the text to transform is given up.

===Post-structuralism===
In post-structuralism, there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from Jacques Lacan, and in particular theories variously called &quot;écriture féminine&quot;, gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author&#x27;s conscious intent. 

=== Hypothetical intentionalism ===
Hypothetical intentionalism, in contrast to the above anti-intentionalist approaches, attempts to account for the criticisms of actual intentionalism and then draw a moderated middle path between actual intentionalism and anti-intentionalism. It is an interpretive strategy that navigates between assuming a writer&#x27;s actual intent and disregarding intent altogether, focusing instead on the best hypothesis of intent as understood by a qualified audience. This approach prioritizes the perspective of an intended or ideal audience, which employs public knowledge and context to infer the author&#x27;s intentions. Hypothetical intentionalism holds that, because the reader&#x27;s reasonable hypothesis of the authorial intent is paramount, even if new evidence were to come out that revealed a reader&#x27;s (previously reasonable) hypothesis was factually incorrect, the reader&#x27;s hypothesis would still be considered correct; if a hypothetical reading is warranted and reasonable, it is valid regardless of the actual truth of the author&#x27;s intent. 

Terry Barrett espouses a somewhat similar concept when he says that, &quot;the meaning of a work of art is not limited to the meaning the artist had in mind when making the work; it can mean more or less or something different than the artist intended the work to mean.&quot; Barrett states that to rely on the artist&#x27;s intent for an interpretation of an artwork is to put oneself in a passive role as a viewer. Reliance on the artists’ intent unwisely removes the responsibility of interpretation from the viewer; it also robs the viewer of the joy of interpretive thinking and the rewards of the new insights it yields into the art and the world. 

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some textual critics. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author&#x27;s intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by Fredson Bowers and G. Thomas Tanselle will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author&#x27;s final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the documents for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no &#x27;authorized editions&#x27; (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been D. F. McKenzie and Jerome McGann, proponents of a model that accounts for the &quot;social text,&quot; tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

<doc id="588566" wikidata="Q552916" url="?curid=588566" title="Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)">
<text>Harold Brown (September 19, 1927 – January 4, 2019) was an American nuclear physicist who served as United States Secretary of Defense from 1977 to 1981, under President Jimmy Carter. Previously, in the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations, he held the posts of Director of Defense Research and Engineering (1961–1965) and United States Secretary of the Air Force (1965–1969).

A child prodigy, Brown graduated from the Bronx High School of Science at age 15, and earned a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia University at age 21. As Secretary of Defense, he set the groundwork for the Camp David Accords, took part in strategic arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, and supported, unsuccessfully, ratification of the SALT II treaty.

== Early life and career ==
Brown was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Abraham, a lawyer who had fought in World War I, and Gertrude (Cohen) Brown, a diamond merchant&#x27;s bookkeeper. His parents were secular Jews and strong supporters of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. From a very young age Brown was drawn to mathematics and physics; he enrolled as a student at the Bronx High School of Science, from which he graduated at age 15 with a grade average of 99.5. He then immediately entered Columbia University, earning an A.B. summa cum laude at 17 years of age, as well as the &quot;Green Memorial Prize&quot; for the best academic record. He continued as a graduate student at Columbia, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1949 when he was 21.

After a short period of teaching and postdoctoral research, Brown became a research scientist at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, he played a role in the construction of the Polaris missile and the development of plutonium. In 1952, he joined the staff of the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore and became its director in 1960, succeeding Edward Teller, of whom he was a protégé. At Livermore, Brown led a team of six other physicists, all older than he was, who used some of the first computers, along with mathematics and engineering, to reduce the size of thermonuclear warheads for strategic military use. Brown and his team helped make Livermore&#x27;s reputation by designing nuclear warheads small and light enough to be placed on the Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). During the 1950s he served as a member of, or consultant to, several federal scientific bodies and as senior science adviser at the 1958-1959 Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests.

Brown worked under United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara as Director of Defense Research and Engineering from 1961 to 1965, and then as United States Secretary of the Air Force from October 1965 to February 1969, first under McNamara and then under Clark Clifford.

From 1969 to 1977, he was President of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

== U.S. Secretary of Defense ==
=== Appointment and initial agenda ===

Although Brown had accumulated almost eight years of prior service in the Pentagon, he was the first natural scientist to become secretary of defense. He involved himself in practically all areas of departmental activity. Consistent with the Carter administration&#x27;s objective to reorganize the federal government, Brown launched a comprehensive review of defense organization that eventually brought significant change. But he understood the limits to effective reform. In one of his first speeches after leaving office, &quot;&#x27;Managing&#x27; the Defense Department-Why It Can&#x27;t Be Done,&quot; at the University of Michigan in March 1981, he observed:With regard to strategic planning, Brown shared much the same concerns as his Republican predecessors—the need to upgrade U.S. military forces and improve collective security arrangements—but with a stronger commitment to arms control. Brown adhered to the principle of &quot;essential equivalence&quot; in the nuclear competition with the Soviet Union. This meant that &quot;Soviet strategic nuclear forces do not become usable instruments of political leverage, diplomatic coercion, or military advantage; nuclear stability, especially in a crisis, is maintained; any advantages in force characteristics enjoyed by the Soviets are offset by U.S. advantages in other characteristics; and the U.S. posture is not in fact, and is not seen as, inferior in performance to the strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet Union.&quot;

His later writings in his 2012 memoir, &quot;Star-Spangled Security&quot;, reinforced this agenda:When I became secretary of defense in 1977, the military services, most of all the army, were disrupted badly by the Vietnam War. There was general agreement that the Soviet Union outclassed the West in conventional military capability, especially in ground forces in Europe.According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, experts say in retrospect that contrary to a popular narrative which asserts that President Ronald Reagan increased defense spending to ramp up competition with (and ultimately bankrupting) the Soviet Union, it was Carter and Brown who began &quot;maintaining the strategic balance, countering Soviet aircraft and ballistic innovations by improving land-based ICBMs, by upgrading B-52 strategic bombers with low-flying cruise missiles and by deploying far more submarine-launched missiles tipped with MIRVs, or multiple warheads that split into independent trajectories to hit many targets&quot;.

=== Nuclear missiles ===
Brown considered it essential to maintain the triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic bombers; some of the administration&#x27;s most important decisions on weapon systems reflected this commitment. Although he decided not to produce the B-1 bomber, he did recommend upgrading existing B-52s and equipping them with air-launched cruise missiles, and gave the go-ahead for development of a &quot;stealth&quot; technology, fostered by William J. Perry, under-secretary of defense for research and engineering, that would make it possible to produce planes (bombers as well as other aircraft) with very low radar profiles, presumably able to elude enemy defenses and deliver weapons on targets. The administration backed development of the MX missile, intended to replace in the 1980s the increasingly vulnerable Minuteman and Titan intercontinental missiles. To insure MX survivability, Brown recommended deploying the missiles in &quot;multiple protective shelters&quot;; 200 MX missiles would be placed in Utah and Nevada, with each missile to be shuttled among 23 different shelters of its own located along roadways-meaning a total of 4,600 such shelters. Although this plan was expensive and environmentally controversial, Brown argued that it was the most viable scheme to protect the missiles from enemy attack. For the sea leg of the triad, Brown accelerated development of the larger Trident nuclear submarine and carried forward the conversion of Poseidon submarines to a fully MIRVed missile capability.

By early 1979, Brown and his staff had developed a &quot;countervailing strategy&quot;, an approach to nuclear targeting that past secretaries of defense Robert McNamara and James R. Schlesinger had both earlier found attractive, but never formally codified. As Brown put it, &quot;we must have forces and plans for the use of our strategic nuclear forces such that in considering aggression against our interests, our adversary would recognize that no plausible outcome would represent a success-on any rational definition of success. The prospect of such a failure would then deter an adversary&#x27;s attack on the United States or our vital interests.&quot; Although Brown did not rule out the assured destruction approach, which stressed attacks on urban and industrial targets, he believed that &quot;such destruction must not be automatic, our only choice, or independent of any enemy&#x27;s attack. Indeed, it is at least conceivable that the mission of assured destruction would not have to be executed at all in the event that deterrence failed.&quot;

Official adoption of the countervailing strategy came with President Carter&#x27;s approval of Presidential Directive 59 (PD 59) on July 25, 1980. In explaining PD 59 Brown argued that it was not a new strategic doctrine, but rather a refinement, a codification of previous explanations of our strategic policy. The heart of PD 59, as Brown described it, was as follows:

Because the almost simultaneous disclosures of PD 59 and the stealth technology came in the midst of the 1980 United States presidential election campaign; some critics asserted that the Carter administration leaked them to counter charges of weakness and boost its re-election chances. Others charged that PD 59 made it more likely that the United States would initiate a nuclear conflict, based on the assumption that a nuclear war could somehow be limited. Brown insisted that the countervailing strategy was not a first strike strategy. As he put it, &quot;Nothing in the policy contemplates that nuclear war can be a deliberate instrument of achieving our national security goals. ... But we cannot afford the risk that the Soviet leadership might entertain the illusion that nuclear war could be an option – or its threat a means of coercion – for them.&quot;

=== NATO ===

Brown regarded the strengthening of NATO as a key national security objective and worked hard to invigorate the alliance. With the assistance of Robert W. Komer, at first his special adviser on NATO affairs and subsequently under-secretary of defense for policy, Brown launched a series of NATO initiatives shortly after taking office. In May 1978 the NATO heads of government endorsed a long term defense program which included 10 priority categories: enhanced readiness; rapid reinforcement; stronger European reserve forces; improvements in maritime capabilities; integrated air defenses; effective command, control, and communications; electronic warfare; rationalized procedures for armaments collaboration; logistics co-ordination and increased war reserves; and theater nuclear modernization. To implement the last item, NATO defense and foreign ministers decided in December 1979, to respond to the Soviet deployment of new theater nuclear weapons—the SS-20 missile and the Backfire bomber—by placing 108 Pershing II missiles and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) in several Western European countries beginning in December 1983. The NATO leaders indicated that the new missile deployment would be scaled down if satisfactory progress occurred in arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union.

At Brown&#x27;s urging, NATO members pledged in 1977 to increase their individual defense spending three percent per year in real terms for the 1979-86 period. The objective, Brown explained, was to ensure that alliance resources and capabilities-both conventional and nuclear-would balance those of the Soviet bloc. Although some NATO members hesitated to confirm the agreement to accept new missiles and did not always attain the three percent target, Brown was pleased with NATO&#x27;s progress. Midway in his term he told an interviewer that he thought his most important achievement thus far had been the revitalization of NATO.

Brown also tried to strengthen the defense contributions of U.S. allies outside of NATO, particularly Japan and South Korea. He repeatedly urged the Japanese government to increase its defense budget so that it could shoulder a larger share of the Western allies&#x27; Pacific security burden. Although the Carter administration decided in 1977 on a phased withdrawal of United States ground forces from South Korea, it pledged to continue military and other assistance to that country. Later, because of a substantial buildup of North Korean military forces and opposition to the troop withdrawal in the United States, the president shelved the plan, leaving approximately 40,000 U.S. troops in Korea. In establishing diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC almost 30 years after its establishment. A year later Brown visited the PRC, talked with its political and military leaders, and helped lay the groundwork for limited collaboration on security issues.

=== Arms control ===
Arms control formed an integral part of Brown&#x27;s national security policy. He staunchly supported the June 1979 SALT II treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union and was the administration&#x27;s leading spokesman in urging the Senate to approve it. SALT II limited both sides to 2,250 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (bombers, ICBMs, SLBMs, and air-to-surface ballistic missiles), including a sublimit of 1,200 launchers of MIRVed ballistic missiles, of which only 820 could be launchers of MIRVed ICBMs. It also placed restrictions on the number of warheads on each missile and on deployment of new land-based ballistic missile systems, except for one new type of light ICBM for each side. There was also a provision for verification by each side using its own national technical means.

Brown explained that SALT II would reduce the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic forces, bring enhanced predictability and stability to Soviet-U.S. nuclear relationships, reduce the cost of maintaining a strategic balance, help the United States to monitor Soviet forces, and reduce the risk of nuclear war. He rebutted charges by SALT II critics that the United States had underestimated the Soviet military buildup, that the treaty would weaken the Western alliance, that the Soviet Union could not be trusted to obey the treaty, and that its terms could not really be verified. Partly to placate Senate opponents of the treaty, the Carter administration agreed in the fall of 1979 to support higher increases in the defense budget. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 ensured that the Senate would not accept the treaty at that time, forcing the president to withdraw it from consideration. When his term ended in 1981, Brown said that failure to secure ratification of SALT II was his greatest regret. The U.S. and the Soviet Union still followed the terms of the pact, even though it was non-binding, until 1986, when President Ronald Reagan accused the Soviet Union of violating the terms and withdrew from the pact.

=== Regional matters ===
==== Panama Canal ====
Besides broad national security policy matters, Brown had to deal with several more immediate questions, among them the Panama Canal issue. Control of the Panama Canal Zone had been a source of contention ever since Panama achieved its independence from Colombia in 1903 and granted the United States a concession &quot;in perpetuity&quot;.
In the mid-1960s, after serious disturbances in the zone, the United States and Panama began negotiations that went on intermittently until September 7, 1977, when the countries signed two treaties, one providing for full Panamanian control of the canal by the year 2000 and the other guaranteeing the canal&#x27;s neutrality. The Defense Department played a major role in the Panama negotiations. Brown championed the treaties through a difficult fight to gain Senate approval (secured in March and April 1978), insisting that they were both advantageous to the United States and essential to the canal&#x27;s future operation and security.

==== Middle East ====
In Middle East affairs, Brown supported President Carter&#x27;s efforts as an intermediary in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations leading to the Camp David Accords of September 1978 and the signing by the two nations of a peace treaty in March 1979. Elsewhere, the fall of the Shah from power in Iran in January 1979 eliminated a major U.S. ally and triggered a chain of events that played havoc with American policy in the region. In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 hostages. Brown participated closely in planning for a rescue operation that ended in failure and the loss of eight U.S. servicemen on April 24–25, 1980. Not until the last day of his administration, on January 20, 1981, could President Carter make final arrangements for the release of the hostages.

==== Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ====
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 to bolster a pro-Soviet Communist government further complicated the role of the United States in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. In response to the events in Iran and Afghanistan and in anticipation of others, Brown activated the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, on March 1, 1980. Although normally a planning headquarters without operational units, the RDJTF could obtain such forces from the several services and command them in crisis situations. Brown explained that the RDJTF was responsible for developing plans for contingency operations, particularly in Southwest Asia, and maintaining adequate capabilities and readiness for such missions.

=== Budget ===
As with all of his predecessors, budget matters occupied a major portion of Brown&#x27;s time. During the 1976 campaign, President Carter criticized the defense spending levels of the Ford administration and promised cuts in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion. Shortly after he became secretary, Brown suggested a series of amendments to Ford&#x27;s proposed fiscal year 1978 budget, having the effect of cutting it by almost $3 billion, but still allowing a Total Obligational Authority (TOA) increase of more than $8 billion over the fiscal year 1977 budget. Subsequent budgets under Brown moved generally upward, reflecting high prevailing rates of inflation, the need to strengthen and modernize conventional forces neglected somewhat since the end of the Vietnam War, and serious challenges in the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.

The Brown Defense budgets by fiscal year, in TOA, were as follows: 1978, $116.1 billion; 1979, $124.7 billion; 1980, $141.9 billion; and 1981, $175.5 billion. In terms of real growth, there were slight negative percentages in 1978 and 1979, and increases in 1980 and 1981. Part of the increase for fiscal year 1981 resulted from supplemental appropriations obtained by the Reagan administration; but the Carter administration by this time had departed substantially from its early emphasis on curtailing the department of defense budget. Its proposals for fiscal year 1982, submitted in January 1981, called for significant real growth over the TOA for fiscal year 1981.

In his 2012 memoir, &quot;Star-Spangled Security&quot;, Brown boasted that &quot;the Defense Department budget in real terms was 10 to 12 percent more when we left than when we came in&quot;, which he opined was not an easy accomplishment, especially considering Carter&#x27;s campaign promise to cut defense spending, and pressure to that effect from congressional Democrats. With the increased budget, Brown oversaw the development of &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft, and the acceleration of &quot;the Trident submarine program and the conversion of older Poseidon submarines to carry MIRVs&quot;.

=== Departure ===
Brown left office on January 20, 1981, following President Carter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for re-election. During the 1980 campaign, Brown actively defended the Carter administration&#x27;s policies, speaking frequently on national issues in public.

Brown received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Carter in 1981 and the Enrico Fermi Award from President Bill Clinton in 1993.

== Later life ==

After leaving the Pentagon, Brown remained in Washington, D.C., joining the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies as a visiting professor and later the university&#x27;s Foreign Policy Institute as chairman. He continued to speak and write widely on national security issues, and in 1983 published &quot;Thinking About National Security: Defense and Foreign Policy in a Dangerous World&quot;/ In later years, Brown was affiliated with research organizations and served on the boards of a number of corporations, like Altria (previously Philip Morris).

Brown was honored with Columbia College’s John Jay Award for distinguished professional achievement in 1980 and Alexander Hamilton Medal in 1990.

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials.

In July 2011, Brown became a member of the United States Energy Security Council, which seeks to diminish oil&#x27;s monopoly over the U.S. transportation sector and is sponsored by the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS).

Brown died of pancreatic cancer on January 4, 2019, at the age of 91.

<text>John Winthrop (December 19, 1714 – May 3, 1779) was an American mathematician, physicist and astronomer. He was the 2nd Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Harvard College.

==Early life==
John Winthrop was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His great-great-grandfather, also named John Winthrop, was founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He graduated in 1732 from Harvard, where, from 1738 until his death, he served as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy.

==Career==
Professor Winthrop was one of the foremost men of science in America during the 18th century, and his impact on its early advance in New England was particularly significant. Both Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) probably owed much of their early interest in scientific research to his influence. He also had a decisive influence in the early philosophical education of John Adams during the latter&#x27;s time at Harvard. He corresponded regularly with the Royal Society in London—as such, he was one of the first American intellectuals to be taken seriously in Europe. He was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1768. He was noted for attempting to explain the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 as a scientific—rather than religious—phenomenon, and his application of mathematical computations to earthquake activity following the great quake formed the basis of the claim made on his behalf as the founder of the science of seismology. Additionally, he observed the transits of Mercury in 1740 and 1761 and journeyed to Newfoundland to observe a transit of Venus. He traveled in a ship provided by the Province of Massachusetts—probably the first scientific expedition ever sent out by any incipient American state.

He began taking daily meterological observations in 1742, at first using whatever instruments were available in Boston, but in 1759 switching to two Fahrenheit thermometers which were compared against each other, a standard which has allowed for useful understanding of the climate of Boston in this time. Winthrop&#x27;s data predates the first Canadian temperature measurements in 1765, and later American measurements which began in the 1770s.

He served as acting president of Harvard in 1769 and again in 1773, but each time declined the offer of the full presidency on the grounds of old age. During the nine months in 1775–1776 when Harvard moved to Concord, Massachusetts, Winthrop occupied the house that would become famous as The Wayside, home to Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Additionally, he was actively interested in public affairs, was for several years a judge of probate in Middlesex County, was a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council in 1773–74, and subsequently offered the weight of his influence to the patriotic cause in the Revolution. He published:
* &quot;Lecture on Earthquakes&quot; (1755)
* &quot;Answer to Mr. Prince&#x27;s Letter on Earthquakes&quot; (1756)
* &quot;Account of Some Fiery Meteors&quot; (1755)
* &quot;Two Lectures on the Parallax&quot; (1769)

==Personal life==

In 1756, he married Hannah Fayerweather (1727–1790), the daughter of Thomas and Hannah Waldo Fayerweather. She was baptized at the First Church in Boston on February 12, 1727, and had been previously married in 1745 to Parr Tolman. Together, they raised Winthrop&#x27;s son from his previous marriage, James Winthrop, who continued his father&#x27;s political work.

Winthrop was recorded as owning two enslaved men, George and Scipio, in 1759 and 1761 respectively.

<text>The Finnish Declaration of Independence (; ) was adopted by the Parliament of Finland on . It declared Finland to be independent from Russia, with reference to a bill simultaneously delivered to the Parliament to make Finland an independent republic instead.

Declaring independence was only part of the long process leading to the independence of Finland. The declaration is celebrated as Independence Day in Finland.

==History==

===Revolution in Russia===

After the February Revolution and the abdication of &quot;Tsar&quot; Nicholas II, Grand Prince of Finland, on 2 March (15 March N.S.) 1917, the personal union between Russia and Finland lost its legal base – at least according to the view in Helsinki. There were negotiations between the Russian Provisional Government and Finnish authorities.

The resulting proposal, approved by the Provisional Government, was heavily rewritten in the &quot;Eduskunta&quot; (Finnish Parliament) and transformed into the so-called Power Act (Finnish: &quot;Valtalaki&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Maktlagen&quot;), whereby the Parliament declared itself to now hold all powers of legislation, except with respect to foreign policy and military issues, and also that it could be dissolved only by itself. At the time of the vote, it was believed that the Provisional Government would be quickly defeated by the rebellion in Saint Petersburg. The Provisional Government survived, however, disapproved of the Power Act and dissolved the Parliament.

After new elections and the ultimate defeat of the Provisional Government in the October Revolution, the Finnish Parliament decided to set a three-man regency council, based on Finland&#x27;s Constitution, and more precisely on clause §38 of the old Instrument of Government of 1772, which had been enacted by the Estates after Gustav III&#x27;s bloodless coup. This paragraph provided for the election of a new monarch in case of the extinction of the royal line and was interpreted in Finland as vesting sovereignty in the estates, later the Parliament, in such an interregnum. The regency council was never elected, because of the strong opposition of Finnish socialists and their general strike which demanded for more radical action.

On 2 November (15 November N.S.) 1917, the Bolsheviks declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, &quot;for the Peoples of Russia&quot;. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it assumed, &quot;pro tempore&quot;, all powers of the Sovereign in Finland.

The old Instrument of Government was however no longer deemed suitable. Leading circles had long held monarchism and hereditary nobility to be antiquated, and advocated a republican constitution for Finland.

===Independence===

The Senate of Finland, the government that the Parliament had appointed in November, drafted a Declaration of Independence and a proposal for a new republican Instrument of Government. Chairman of the Senate ( Prime minister) Pehr Evind Svinhufvud read the Declaration to the Parliament on 4 December. The Declaration of Independence was technically given the form of a preamble of the proposition, and was intended to be agreed by the Parliament, which adopted the Declaration on 6 December.

On 18 December (31 December N. S.) shortly after the head of Finnish government Svinhufvud declared his nation&#x27;s full independence the Soviet Russian government became the first government outside of Finland to recognize Finnish independence. It issued a Decree recognising Finland&#x27;s independence, and on 22 December (4 January 1918 N. S.) it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK).

==The Declaration and 15 November==

With reference to the declaration of 15 November, the declaration says:
The people of Finland have by this step taken their fate in their own hands; a step both justified and demanded by present conditions. The people of Finland feel deeply that they cannot fulfil their national and international duty without complete sovereignty. The century-old desire for freedom awaits fulfilment now; Finland&#x27;s people step forward as a free nation among the other nations in the world.

(...) The people of Finland dare to confidently await how other nations in the world recognize that with their full independence and freedom, the people of Finland can do their best in fulfilment of those purposes that will win them a place amongst civilized peoples.

===Context===
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared their independence from Russia during the same period. See Estonian War of Independence, Latvian Independence and Lithuanian Wars of Independence.

These three countries were occupied by, and annexed into, the Soviet Union (1940–1941, 1944–1991). See Occupation of the Baltic states.

<text>The Ostend Manifesto, also known as the Ostend Circular, was a document written in 1854 that described the rationale for the United States to purchase Cuba from Spain while implying that the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused. Cuba&#x27;s annexation had long been a goal of U.S. slaveholding expansionists. At the national level, American leaders had been satisfied to have the island remain in weak Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France. The Ostend Manifesto proposed a shift in foreign policy, justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security. It resulted from debates over slavery in the United States, manifest destiny, and the Monroe Doctrine, as slaveholders sought new territory for the expansion of slavery.

During the administration of President Franklin Pierce, a pro-Southern Democrat, Southern expansionists called for acquiring Cuba as a slave state, but the outbreak of violence following the Kansas–Nebraska Act left the administration unsure of how to proceed. At the suggestion of Secretary of State William L. Marcy, American ministers in Europe—Pierre Soulé for Spain, James Buchanan for Britain, and John Y. Mason for France—met to discuss strategy related to an acquisition of Cuba. They met secretly at Ostend, Belgium, and drafted a dispatch at Aachen, Prussia. The document was sent to Washington in October 1854, outlining why a purchase of Cuba would be beneficial to each of the nations and declaring that the U.S. would be &quot;justified in wresting&quot; the island from Spanish hands if Spain refused to sell. To Marcy&#x27;s chagrin, Soulé made no secret of the meetings, causing unwanted publicity in both Europe and the U.S.

The dispatch was published as demanded by the House of Representatives. Dubbed the &quot;Ostend Manifesto&quot;, it was immediately denounced in both the Northern states and Europe. The Pierce administration suffered a significant setback, and the manifesto became a rallying cry for anti-slavery Northerners. The question of Cuba&#x27;s annexation was effectively set aside until the late 19th century, when support grew for Cuban independence from Spain.

==Historical context==
Located off the coast of Florida, Cuba had been discussed as a subject for annexation in several presidential administrations. Presidents John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson expressed great interest in Cuba, with Adams observing during his Secretary of State tenure that it had &quot;become an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union&quot;. He later described Cuba and Puerto Rico as &quot;natural appendages to the North American continent&quot;—the former&#x27;s annexation was &quot;indispensable to the continuance and integrity of the Union itself&quot;. As the Spanish Empire had lost much of its power, a no-transfer policy began with Jefferson whereby the U.S. respected Spanish sovereignty, considering the island&#x27;s eventual absorption inevitable. The U.S. simply wanted to ensure that control did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France.

Cuba was of special importance to Southern Democrats, who believed their economic and political interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island&#x27;s plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose economic position was under threat from abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the balance of power in the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island at the time would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.

In the Democratic Party, the debate over the continued expansion of the United States centered on how quickly, rather than whether, to expand. Radical expansionists and the Young America movement were quickly gaining traction by 1848, and a debate about whether to annex the Yucatán portion of Mexico that year included significant discussion of Cuba. Even John C. Calhoun, described as a reluctant expansionist who strongly disagreed with intervention on the basis of the Monroe Doctrine, concurred that &quot;it is indispensable to the safety of the United States that this island should not be in certain hands&quot;, likely referring to Britain.

In light of a Cuban uprising, President James K. Polk refused solicitations from filibuster backer John L. O&#x27;Sullivan and stated his belief that any acquisition of the island must be an &quot;amicable purchase&quot;. Under orders from Polk, Secretary of State James Buchanan prepared an offer of $100 million, but &quot;sooner than see [Cuba] transferred to any power, [Spanish officials] would prefer seeing it sunk into the ocean&quot;. The Whig administrations of presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore did not pursue the matter and took a harsher stand against filibusters such as Venezuelan Narciso López, with federal troops intercepting several expeditions bound for Cuba. When Franklin Pierce took office in 1853, however, he was committed to Cuba&#x27;s annexation.

==The Pierce administration==
At Pierce&#x27;s presidential inauguration, he stated, &quot;The policy of my Administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.&quot; While slavery was not the stated goal nor Cuba mentioned by name, the antebellum makeup of his party required the Northerner to appeal to Southern interests, so he favored the annexation of Cuba as a slave state. To this end, he appointed expansionists to diplomatic posts throughout Europe, notably sending Pierre Soulé, an outspoken proponent of Cuban annexation, as United States Minister to Spain. The Northerners in his cabinet were fellow doughfaces (Northerners with Southern sympathies) such as Buchanan, who was made Minister to Great Britain after a failed bid for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, and Secretary of State William L. Marcy, whose appointment was also an attempt to placate the &quot;Old Fogies.&quot; This was the term for the wing of the party that favored slow, cautious expansion.

In March 1854, the steamer &quot;Black Warrior&quot; stopped at the Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban officials seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called &quot;Black Warrior&quot; Affair was viewed by Congress as a violation of American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba&#x27;s acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.

Meanwhile, the doctrine of manifest destiny had become increasingly sectionalized as the decade progressed. While there were still Northerners who believed the United States should dominate the continent, most were opposed to Cuba&#x27;s annexation, particularly as a slave state. Southern-backed filibusters, including Narciso López, had failed repeatedly since 1849 to 1851 to overthrow the colonial government despite considerable support among the Cuban people for independence, and a series of reforms on the island made Southerners apprehensive that slavery would be abolished. They believed that Cuba would be &quot;Africanized,&quot; as the majority of the population were slaves, and they had seen the Republic of Haiti established by former slaves. The notion of a pro-slavery invasion by the U.S. was rejected in light of the controversy over the Kansas–Nebraska Act. During internal discussions, supporters of gaining Cuba decided that a purchase or intervention in the name of national security was the most acceptable method of acquisition.

==Writing the Manifesto==
Marcy suggested Soulé confer with Buchanan and John Y. Mason, Minister to France, on U.S. policy toward Cuba. He had previously written to Soulé that, if Cuba&#x27;s purchase could not be negotiated, &quot;you will then direct your effort to the next desirable object, which is to detach that island from the Spanish dominion and from all dependence on any European power&quot;—words Soulé may have adapted to fit his own agenda. Authors David Potter and Lars Schoultz both note the considerable ambiguity in Marcy&#x27;s cryptic words, and Samuel Bemis suggests he may have referred to Cuban independence, but acknowledges it is impossible to know Marcy&#x27;s true intent. In any case, Marcy had also written in June that the administration had abandoned thoughts of declaring war over Cuba. But Robert May writes, &quot;the instructions for the conference had been so vague, and so many of Marcy&#x27;s letters to Soulé since the &quot;Black Warrior&quot; incident had been bellicose, that the ministers misread the administration&#x27;s intent.&quot;

After a minor disagreement about their meeting site, the three American diplomats met in Ostend, Belgium from October 9–11, 1854, then adjourned to Aachen, Prussia, for a week to prepare a report of the proceedings. The resulting dispatch, which would come to be known as the Ostend Manifesto, declared that &quot;Cuba is as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present members, and that it belongs naturally to that great family of states of which the Union is the Providential Nursery&quot;.

Prominent among the reasons for annexation outlined in the manifesto were fears of a possible slave revolt in Cuba parallel to the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) in the absence of U.S. intervention. The Manifesto urged against inaction on the Cuban question, warning,

We should, however, be recreant to our duty, be unworthy of our gallant forefathers, and commit base treason against our posterity, should we permit Cuba to be Africanized and become a second St. Domingo (Haiti), with all its attendant horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to our own neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union.

Racial fears raised tension and anxiety in the U.S. over a potential black uprising on the island that could &quot;spread like wildfire&quot; to the southern U.S. The Manifesto stated that the U.S. would be &quot;justified in wresting&quot; Cuba from Spain if the colonial power refused to sell it.

Soulé was a former U.S. Senator from Louisiana and member of the Young America movement, who sought a realization of American influence in the Caribbean and Central America. He is credited as the primary architect of the policy expressed in the Ostend Manifesto. The experienced and cautious Buchanan is believed to have written the document and moderated Soulé&#x27;s aggressive tone. Soulé highly favored expansion of Southern influence outside the current Union of States. His belief in Manifest Destiny led him to prophesy &quot;absorption of the entire continent and its island appendages&quot; by the U.S. Mason&#x27;s Virginian roots predisposed him to the sentiments expressed in the document, but he later regretted his actions. Buchanan&#x27;s exact motivations remain unclear despite his expansionist tendencies, but it has been suggested that he was seduced by visions of the presidency, which he would go on to win in 1856. One historian concluded in 1893, &quot;When we take into account the characteristics of the three men we can hardly resist the conclusion that Soulé, as he afterwards intimated, twisted his colleagues round his finger.&quot;

To Marcy&#x27;s chagrin, the flamboyant Soulé made no secret of the meetings. The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome, but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections. In the latter case, the Democratic Party became a minority in the United States Congress, and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy. At least one newspaper, the &quot;New York Herald,&quot; published what Brown calls &quot;reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks, as indeed they may have been&quot;. Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors, and he did not acknowledge them in his State of the Union address at the end of 1854. The administration&#x27;s opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document&#x27;s release, and it was published in full four months after being written.

==Fallout==

When the document was published, Northerners were outraged by what they considered a Southern attempt to extend slavery. American free-soilers, recently angered by the strengthened Fugitive Slave Law (passed as part of the Compromise of 1850 and requiring officials of free states to cooperate in the return of slaves), decried as unconstitutional what Horace Greeley of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; labeled &quot;The Manifesto of the Brigands.&quot; During the period of Bleeding Kansas, as anti- and pro-slavery supporters fought for control of the state, the Ostend Manifesto served as a rallying cry for the opponents of the Slave Power. The incident was one of many factors that gave rise to the Republican Party, and the manifesto was criticized in the Party&#x27;s first platform in 1856 as following a &quot;highwayman&#x27;s&quot; philosophy of &quot;might makes right.&quot; But, the movement to annex Cuba did not fully end until after the American Civil War.

The Pierce Administration was irreparably damaged by the incident. Pierce had been highly sympathetic to the Southern cause, and the controversy over the Ostend Manifesto contributed to the splintering of the Democratic Party. Internationally, it was seen as a threat to Spain and to imperial power across Europe. It was quickly denounced by national governments in Madrid, London, and Paris. To preserve what favorable relations the administration had left, Soulé was ordered to cease discussion of Cuba; he promptly resigned. The backlash from the Ostend Manifesto caused Pierce to abandon expansionist plans. It has been described as part of a series of &quot;gratuitous conflicts ... that cost more than they were worth&quot; for Southern interests intent on maintaining the institution of slavery.

Though officially repudiated by Marcy, the declaration ended any negotiations with Spain over the issue. In 1855 Spain shored up the defenses of Cuba and replaced all Criollo garrisons with Peninsulares likelier to fight an American invasion. Spain also tried to revive a defensive alliance in the Caribbean that was proposed by Great Britain in the 1840s -- and rejected then by Spain -- but the British turned it down this time. Finally, the long-neglected Spanish Navy was improved and expanded considerably, acquiring 170 new vessels between 1856 and 1868 (almost all steamships), and became the fourth most powerful in terms of total firepower and displacement after the British, French, and Italian navies by 1860. The US Navy and Imperial Russian Navy had more ships total, but were mostly small vessels for coastal defense.

James Buchanan was easily elected president in 1856. Although he remained committed to Cuban annexation, he was hindered by popular opposition and the growing sectional conflict. In 1858, a new proposal to purchase Cuba was voted down both by the United States Congress and Spain&#x27;s Cortes Generales. It was not until thirty years after the Civil War that the so-called Cuban Question again came to national prominence.

<text>Walter Rudolf Hess (17 March 1881 – 12 August 1973) was a Swiss physiologist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 for mapping the areas of the brain involved in the control of internal organs. He shared the prize with Egas Moniz.

== Life ==
Hess was born in Frauenfeld as the second of three children to Clemens Hess and Gertrud Hess (née Fischer). His father encouraged him to pursue a scientific career and with him he conducted experiments in his physics laboratory. He started to study medicine in Lausanne in 1899 and then in Berlin, Kiel and Zürich. He received his medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1906 and trained as surgeon in Münsterlingen (in the same canton as his birthplace Frauenfeld) under Conrad Brunner (1859–1927). He developed a viscosimeter to measure blood viscosity and published his dissertation in 1906 titled &quot;Zum Thema Viskosität des Blutes und Herzarbeit&quot;. In 1907, he went to the University of Zurich to study under Otto Haab to be trained as an
ophthalmologist and opened his own private practice in Rapperswil SG. In these years, he developed the &quot;Hess screen&quot;, married Louise Sandmeier and in 1910 their daughter Gertrud Hess was born. In 1913 his son Rudolf Max Hess was born.

In 1912, he left his lucrative private practice as an ophthalmologist and went into research under Justus Gaule (1849–1939), habilitating in 1913 to become Privatdozent. His primary interests were the regulation of blood flow and respiration. During the First World War he spent a year at the Physiological Institute of the University of Bonn under Max Verworn. In 1916, Gaule retired and Hess first became interim director of the Department of the Physiological Institute at the University of Zurich. Hess served as full professor and director of the institute from 1917 until his retirement in 1951.

In the 1930s, he began mapping the parts of the diencephalon that control the internal organs using cats. This research won him the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine 1949. Hess also helped to found the meteorological research foundation &quot;International Foundation for the High Alpine Research Station Jungfraujoch&quot; in 1930 and served as its director until 1937. Furthermore, he politically campaigned against the &quot;anti-vivisectionists&quot; that wanted to forbid animal experimentation.

Hess retired in 1951 but continued working at the university in an office. In 1967, he moved to Ascona and died of heart failure in 1973 at the age of 92 in Locarno, Switzerland. His widow died in 1987.

== Research ==
Hess used brain stimulation techniques developed in the late 1920s. Using electrodes, Hess stimulated the brain at well-defined anatomical regions. This allowed him to map regions of the brain to specific physiological responses. He developed a special technique he called &quot;interrupted direct-current (DC) stimulation&quot; which used stimuli of long duration (typically 12.5 or 25 ms) with ramp-like upward and downward slopes. Also, the stimuli were rather weak (around 0.5–1.5 V) and of low frequency (2–12 Hz, usually 8 Hz) and he used very fine electrodes with a diameter of 0.25 mm.

By stimulating the hypothalamus, he could induce behaviors from excitement to apathy; depending on the region of stimulation. He found that he could induce different responses when stimulating the anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared to stimulating the posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When stimulating the anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of respiration and responses such as hunger, thirst, micturition (urination) and defecation. Stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defense-like behavior.

Hess also found that he could induce sleep in cats – a finding that was highly controversial at the time but later confirmed by other researchers, including his son Rudolf Max Hess.

<text>Jack Klugman (April 27, 1922 – December 24, 2012) was an American actor of stage, film, and television.

He began his career in 1949 and started television and film work with roles in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957) and &quot;Cry Terror!&quot; (1958). During the 1960s, he guest-starred on numerous television series. Klugman won his first Primetime Emmy Award for his guest-starring role on &quot;The Defenders&quot; in 1964. He also made a total of four appearances on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; from 1960 to 1963. In 1965, Klugman replaced Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison in the Broadway play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Five years later, he reprised that role in the television adaptation of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; opposite Tony Randall. The series aired from 1970 to 1975. Klugman won his second and third Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his work on the series. From 1976 to 1983, he starred in the title role in &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, for which he earned four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

==Early life and education==
Klugman was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of six children born to Rose, a milliner, and Max Klugman, a house painter. His parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants. Klugman served in the United States Army during World War II. 

He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh. While there, his drama teacher told him, &quot;Young man, you are not suited to be an actor. You are suited to be a truck driver.&quot; After the war, he pursued acting roles in New York City while sharing an apartment with friend, and fellow ex-GI turned actor, Charles Bronson.

==Career==
===Late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s===
Klugman was active in numerous stage, television, and film productions during this period. In early 1949 he took an unpaid role in an Equity Library Theatre production of the mid-1930s play Stevedore, in which Rod Steiger and Ossie Davis also appeared. In 1950, he had a small role in the &quot;Mr. Roberts&quot; road company production at the Colonial Theatre in Boston. Later that same year, he made his television debut in an episode of &quot;Actors Studio.&quot; In March 1952, Klugman made his Broadway debut in &quot;Golden Boy&quot; as Frank Bonaparte.

In 1954, he played Jim Hanson on the soap opera &quot;The Greatest Gift.&quot; The following year, he appeared in the live television broadcast of &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; in the episode &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; with Humphrey Bogart and Henry Fonda. Klugman later said the experience was the greatest thrill of his career. He went on to appear in several classic films, including as juror number five in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), of which he was the last surviving cast member. In 1959, he returned to Broadway in the original production of &quot;.&quot; In 1960, Klugman was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor (Musical) for his role in the show but lost to Tom Bosley in &quot;Fiorello!.&quot; He remained with &quot;Gypsy&quot; until it closed in March 1961.

From 1960 to 1963, Klugman appeared in four episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; series: &quot;A Passage for Trumpet&quot; (1960), &quot;A Game of Pool&quot; (1961), &quot;Death Ship&quot; (1963), and &quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; (1963), tying Burgess Meredith for the most appearances in a starring role on the series. In 1964, he won his first Primetime Emmy Award for his guest-starring role on &quot;The Defenders.&quot; The same year, Klugman was cast in the starring role in the situation comedy &quot;Harris Against the World.&quot; The series was a part of an experimental block of sitcoms that aired on NBC entitled &quot;90 Bristol Court.&quot; &quot;Harris Against the World,&quot; along with the other sitcoms that aired in the block, were cancelled the following year due to low ratings.

Klugman continued the decade with multiple guest roles on television, including appearances on &quot;The F.B.I.,&quot; &quot;Ben Casey,&quot; &quot;The Name of the Game,&quot; &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; and &quot;Insight.&quot; He also appeared on Broadway in &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot; from October 1962 to May 1963. From 1960 to 1963, Klugman appeared in two episodes of the series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;: &quot;Loophole&quot; (1961) and &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot; (1963).

===&quot;The Odd Couple&quot;===

In 1965, Klugman replaced Walter Matthau in the lead role of Oscar Madison in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; He reprised the role when the play was adapted as a television series, which was broadcast on ABC from 1970 to 1975. Over the course of the show&#x27;s five-year, 114-episode run, Klugman won two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the series. In 1973, during the run of the series, Klugman and &quot;Odd Couple&quot; co-star Randall recorded an album titled &quot;The Odd Couple Sings&quot; for London Records. Roland Shaw and The London Festival Orchestra and Chorus provided the music and additional vocals.

===1970s and 1980s===
After the cancellation of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in 1975, Klugman returned to television in 1976 in &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, initially broadcast as part of the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; umbrella series, before becoming a weekly program. Klugman portrayed Dr. Quincy, a forensic pathologist who worked for the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office and solved crimes. He was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the series and also wrote four episodes. A total of 148 episodes of &quot;Quincy&quot; aired over eight seasons, ending in 1983. In 1984, Klugman starred in &quot;Lyndon&quot;, a one-man show based on Prideaux&#x27;s script, inspired in part by Merle Miller&#x27;s taped conversations and directed by George Schaefer. In 1986, Klugman starred in the sitcom &quot;You Again?&quot; co-starring John Stamos as Klugman&#x27;s character&#x27;s son. The series was broadcast on NBC for two seasons before being cancelled. During the show&#x27;s run, Klugman also appeared on Broadway in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot;. The show closed in 1988. The following year, he co-starred in the television miniseries &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

===1990s to 2010s===
In 1989, Klugman&#x27;s throat cancer (with which he was first diagnosed in 1974) returned. His illness sidelined his career for the next four years. He returned to acting in a 1993 Broadway revival of &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot;, with Tony Randall. That same year, he again reunited with Tony Randall in the television film &quot;The Odd Couple: Together Again.&quot; The next year, Klugman co-starred in the television film &quot;Parallel Lives.&quot;

In 1993, he appeared on a special &quot;celebrity versus regulars&quot; version of the British quiz show &quot;Going for Gold&quot;, emerging as the series winner.

In 1996, he co-starred in &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot; and the comedy film &quot;Dear God.&quot; He resumed his television career with guest appearances on &quot;.&quot; He also starred in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Glitch&quot; and appeared in an episode of the TV series &quot;Crossing Jordan.&quot; Klugman starred in both the 1997 Broadway revival and the 2007 off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;.

In 2005, Klugman co-starred in the comedy film &quot;When Do We Eat?.&quot; That same year, he published &quot;Tony and Me: A Story of Friendship,&quot; a book about his long friendship with his &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; co-star Tony Randall. Klugman gave the eulogy at Randall&#x27;s memorial service in 2004. A fan of the New York Mets (whose cap he wore as Oscar Madison), Klugman started an MLB.com PRO Blog called Klugman&#x27;s Korner to talk about baseball and Randall.
In 2008, he sued NBC Television over missing profits from his show &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot; The lawsuit was filed in California state court, with Klugman requesting NBC to show him the original contract. Klugman argued that his production company, Sweater Productions, should have received 25% of the show&#x27;s net profits. NBC Universal and Klugman settled the lawsuit on undisclosed terms in August 2010.

His last on-screen role was in the 2010 horror film &quot;Camera Obscura.&quot; Klugman was originally supposed to play Juror #9 in a stage production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at the George Street Playhouse that was set to open on March 13, 2012. However, he had to withdraw from the production because of illness.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===

Klugman married actress Brett Somers in 1953. The couple had two children, Adam (who had a cameo as Oscar Madison as a child in two flashbacks on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;) and David. He had a stepdaughter, Leslie Klein, from Somers&#x27;s first marriage. (Klein was married to Jim Fyfe, an actor and theater director.) The couple separated in 1974 and divorced in August 1977; they did not make their divorce public. In 2007, Somers died from cancer at age 83. Because Klugman did not remarry until after Somers died (nor did Somers ever remarry), it was erroneously reported that the two had remained married but separated for the rest of Somers&#x27;s life.

Klugman&#x27;s 18-year relationship with actress Barbara Neugass ended in 1992 and led to a palimony suit that Neugass ultimately lost.

Klugman began living with Peggy Crosby in 1988. They married in February 2008, shortly after Somers&#x27;s death.

===Business interests===
Klugman was an avid Thoroughbred racing fan. He owned Jaklin Klugman, who finished third in the 1980 Kentucky Derby behind the great filly Genuine Risk and Grade 1 stakes winner Akinemod. Klugman said Jaklin Klugman&#x27;s success was the biggest thrill of his life. His farm where he kept up to 100 horses was called El Rancho De Jaklin named after his horse.

In the 1980s, Klugman licensed his name for use by a popcorn franchise named &quot;Jack&#x27;s Corn Crib&quot;.

===Health===
Klugman was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1974. In 1988, he lost a vocal cord to throat cancer surgery but continued to act on stage and television, though he was left with a quiet, raspy voice. In later years subsequent to his operation, he regained limited strength in his voice.

==Death==
Klugman died from prostate cancer at his home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles on December 24, 2012, aged 90. A &quot;New York Times&quot; profile described him as an &quot;extraordinary actor ennobling the ordinary.&quot; His obituary in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; referred to him as a &quot;character actor titan.&quot; Klugman&#x27;s ashes were interred in a columbarium at Westwood Memorial Park cemetery in Los Angeles.

<text>mozDex was a project to build an Internet-scale search engine with free and open source software (FOSS) technologies like Nutch. Since its search algorithms and code were open, it was hoped that no search results could be manipulated by either mozDex as a company or anyone else. As such, instead of having to trust mozDex to be fair, it puts the trust on the community of users through the same &quot;peer review&quot; process that is believed to enhance security of free software like Linux.

mozDex aimed to make it easy and encourage building upon this open search technology to extend it with various additional potentially useful search related features. Some of the latest features added or announced by mozDex included social bookmarking via free skimpy service, &quot;did you mean&quot; spell checking, anti-spam technology and instant crawl.

As an open search engine, mozDex relied heavily on community feedback and actively solicited user opinions as well as encouraged discussions about various aspects of mozDex&#x27;s growth.

In 2006, mozDex aimed to add around 15 million pages a day in order to reach the goal of more than 4 billion pages indexed at the end of 2006.

<doc id="588603" wikidata="Q3795400" url="?curid=588603" title="The Reeve's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; is the third story told in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The reeve, named Oswald in the text, is the manager of a large estate who reaped incredible profits for his master and himself. He is described in the &quot;Tales&quot; as skinny, bad-tempered, and old; his hair is closely cropped reflecting his social status as a serf. His sword is rusty while he rides a fine gray horse called Scot. The Reeve is a skilled carpenter, a profession mocked in the previous &quot;Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Oswald responds with a tale that mocks the Miller&#x27;s profession.

The tale is based on a popular fabliau (also the source of the Sixth Story of the Ninth Day of &quot;The Decameron&quot;) of the period with many different versions, the &quot;cradle-trick&quot;. Chaucer improves on his sources with his detailed characterisation and sly humour linking the act of grinding corn with sex. The northeastern accent of the two clerks is also the earliest surviving attempt in English to record a dialect from an area other than that of the main writer. Chaucer&#x27;s works are written with traces of the southern English or London accent of himself and his scribes, but he extracts comedy from imitating accents.

==Summary==

Symkyn is a miller who lives in Trumpington near Cambridge and who takes wheat and meal brought to him for grinding. Symkyn is also a bully who cheats his customers with the help of his &quot;golden thumb&quot; (i.e. using his thumb to tip the scale in his favour and overcharge) and claims to be a Master with a sword and dagger and knives (cf. the in &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot;). Symkyn and his arrogant and snobbish wife are extremely proud that she is the daughter of the town clergyman (which is peculiar because her parentage means she is illegitimate, as priests in later medieval England could not marry). They have a twenty-year-old daughter Malyne and a six-month-old son. At the time the story was written it was customary for young women to marry as soon as they reached puberty; Malyne is kept as a virgin by her selfish and social climbing parents so that she can be married off with a dowry of copper dishes to a wealthy husband of higher social status.

When Symkyn overcharged for his latest work grinding corn for Soler Hall, a University of Cambridge college also known as King&#x27;s Hall (which later became part of Trinity College), the college steward was too ill to face him. Two clerical students there, John and Aleyn, originally from Strother in North East England, are outraged at this latest theft and vow to beat the miller at his own game. John and Aleyn hold an even larger amount of wheat than usual and say they will watch Symkyn while he grinds it into flour, pretending that they are interested in the process because they have limited knowledge about milling. Symkyn sees through the clerks&#x27; story and vows to take even more of their grain than he had planned, to prove that scholars are not always the wisest or cleverest of people. He unties their horse, and the two students are unable to catch it until nightfall. While they are away chasing their horse, Symkyn steals the clerks&#x27; flour and gives it to his wife to bake a loaf of bread.

Returning to the miller&#x27;s house, John and Aleyn offer to pay him for a night&#x27;s sleeping there. He challenges them to use their rhetorical training to make his single bedroom into a grand house. After much rearranging, Symkyn and his wife sleep in one bed, John and Aleyn in another, and Malyne in the third. The baby boy&#x27;s cradle sits at the foot of the miller&#x27;s bed.

After a long night of drinking wine, Symkyn and his family fall fast asleep while Aleyn and John lie awake, plotting to take revenge through the rape of Malyne and rape by deception of her mother. First Aleyn creeps over to Malyne in her bed while she remains fast asleep. He leaps on her and then, the narrating Reeve announces, &quot;it had been too late for to crye&quot; (line 4196). When the miller&#x27;s wife leaves her bed to relieve herself of the wine she has drunk, John moves the baby&#x27;s cradle to the foot of his own bed. Upon returning to the darkened room, the miller&#x27;s wife feels for the cradle to identify her bed. She mistakenly assumes that John&#x27;s bed is her own. When she crawls into the bed she thinks is her own, John leaps upon her and begins having sexual intercourse with her.

Dawn comes and Aleyn says goodbye to Malyne. She tells him to look behind the main door to find the bread she had helped make with the flour her father had stolen. Seeing the cradle in front of what he assumes is Symkyn&#x27;s bed (but is in fact John&#x27;s), he goes to the other bed, shakes the miller—who he thinks is John—awake and recounts that he had &quot;thries in this shorte nyght / Swyved the milleres doghter&quot;, Malyne (lines 4265–6). Hearing this, Symkyn rises from his bed in a rage, which wakes his wife in John&#x27;s bed. She takes a club and hits her raging husband by mistake, thinking him one of the students. John and Aleyn beat up the miller and flee, taking with them their horse and the bread made from their stolen grain. Both students ride off and get a good laugh of their revenge with the beating of the cheating Miller and the double humiliation on his wife and daughter; despite their tearful farewells Aleyn has no thought of either Malyne or whether she is now pregnant with a child which may ruin her parents&#x27; plans to make an advantageous marriage for her (although such a child could be passed off as a third child born to her parents, as was not unusual with illegitimate births). The Reeve goes on to say that the story demonstrates the proverb &quot;Hym thar nat wene wil that yvele dooth&quot; (One who does evil fares badly) and concludes &quot;A gylour shal hymself bigyled be&quot; (a deceiver will himself be deceived)(lines 4320–22).

==Sources==
Although some scholars are reluctant to say that Chaucer ever read &quot;The Decameron&quot;, Chaucer&#x27;s story bears a strong resemblance to Tale 6 of Day IX which tells of two clerks lodging with an innkeeper for the night. One of the clerks, who has long been an admirer of the innkeeper&#x27;s daughter, slips into her bed while she is asleep and, after her fears are overcome, they both enjoy sex together. Later, a cat wakes up the innkeeper&#x27;s wife and she gets up to investigate. The second clerk gets up to go to the bathroom and moves the cradle in front of the innkeeper&#x27;s bed because it is in the way. After he returns to his bed, the innkeeper&#x27;s wife returns and feels her way to the bed with the cradle in front of it, which is actually the clerk&#x27;s bed. She slips in beside him and both are surprised and have sex together. The wife later explains to the suspecting innkeeper that she was in her daughter&#x27;s bed all night. The story has several differences from Chaucer&#x27;s in that the clerks do not plot against the innkeeper but are only there to get to his daughter. No mill is even mentioned in the story.

More broadly, &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; is known as a &quot;cradle-trick&quot; story, where a wife gets into the wrong bed because the cradle has been moved. &quot;Cradle-trick&quot; tales were popular all over Europe in the Middle Ages. One such story is the 13th-century French &quot;Le meunier et les II clers&quot;. In &quot;Le meunier et les II clers&quot;, the clerks are new to the area and looking for jobs as bakers. The miller has his wife send them into the woods to look for him while he steals their goods. They come back and end up spending a night with the family, and find that the miller&#x27;s daughter spends every night locked in a bin to protect her chastity. During the night, the miller&#x27;s wife has sex with one of the clerks in exchange for a ring which will restore her virginity. She then gives the clerk the key to her daughter&#x27;s bin and invites him to have sex with her. The miller later finds out and accuses his wife, only to have her reveal that he is a robber. Other &quot;cradle-trick&quot; tales include the French &quot;De Gombert et des deux clers&quot;, a Flemish tale: &quot;Ein bispel van ij clerken&quot;, and two German tales: &quot;Das Studentenabenteuer&quot; and &quot;Irregang und Girregar&quot;.

==Analysis==

===Malyne===
There is ongoing debate about the nature of the sex that Malyne has with Aleyn. Some argue that, although she is surprised at the beginning, by the end of the night she seems to be in love with Aleyn. Evidence for this reading includes the fact that she calls him her &quot;lemman&quot; after the fact, says a genuine fond farewell to him and tells where the cake made out of his stolen flour is hidden. Others emphasize that Aleyn, by surprising Malyne and entering her before she has the chance to consent or not, prevents her from consenting, which makes the sex rape. Nicole Nolan Sidhu takes a different angle and argues that this scene stages tensions between Christian doctrine and social practices over women&#x27;s free will in marriage. Malyne&#x27;s parallel in &quot;The Decameron&quot; also finds the night enjoyable after some initial fear and is eager for future meetings with the clerk. By removing this from his version of the tale, Chaucer creates a more ambiguous and unsettling ending. However, Aleyn has a university course to complete so will be remaining in Cambridge for some time, leaving the possibility of a lasting relationship open.

Malyne is called &quot;this wench&quot; at line 3973, which has been sometimes used to suggest that she is &quot;immoral&quot; or &quot;wanton&quot;, and perhaps therefore enjoys her night. However, definitions for &quot;wench&quot; in the Middle English Dictionary primarily suggest a woman&#x27;s youth and lower class status (although they secondarily can also suggest sexual servitude).

===Satiric aube===
As morning approaches, Aleyn and Malyne have an exchange of feelings which scholars have described as a mock aube or dawn-song, where two lovers express their sorrow at parting in the morning after a night together. Chaucer himself used aube elsewhere, for example in his &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. This type of love poem was usually written in a very high, courtly style and the characters in them were usually knights and ladies, but in this tale Chaucer brings it down to the level of a fabliau, which gives it a strong satire. For example, Aleyn, instead of saying to Malyne, &quot;I am thyn own knight&quot;, says &quot;I am thyn own &quot;clerk&quot;&quot; (emph. added), and Malyne, between emotional words of parting, tells Aleyn about a bread in the mill—an odd fixture in any love poem. (This may be a slang term for pregnancy, similar to the modern &quot;bun in the oven&quot;, a further humiliation to the Miller.)

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; is one of eight of Chaucer&#x27;s stories adapted by Pasolini in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Patrick Duffett portrays Alan, Eamann Howell portrays John, the Italian producer/actor Tiziano Longo portrays Simkin the Miller, Eileen King portrays his wife and Heather Johnson portrays Molly.

<doc id="588606" wikidata="Q3875012" url="?curid=588606" title="Law of demand">
<text>In microeconomics, the law of demand is a fundamental principle which states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. In other words, &quot;conditional on all else being equal, as the price of a good increases (↑), quantity demanded will decrease (↓); conversely, as the price of a good decreases (↓), quantity demanded will increase (↑)&quot;. Alfred Marshall worded this as: &quot;When we say that a person&#x27;s demand for anything increases, we mean that he will buy more of it than he would before at the same price, and that he will buy as much of it as before at a higher price&quot;. The law of demand, however, only makes a qualitative statement in the sense that it describes the direction of change in the amount of quantity demanded but not the magnitude of change. 

The law of demand is represented by a graph called the demand curve, with quantity demanded on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. Demand curves are downward sloping by definition of the law of demand. The law of demand also works together with the law of supply to determine the efficient allocation of resources in an economy through the equilibrium price and quantity. 

The relationship between price and quantity demanded holds true so long as it is complied with the &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; condition &quot;all else remain equal&quot; quantity demanded varies inversely with price when income and the prices of other goods remain constant. If all else are not held equal, the law of demand may not necessarily hold. In the real world, there are many determinants of demand other than price, such as the prices of other goods, the consumer&#x27;s income, preferences etc. There are also exceptions to the law of demand such as Giffen goods and perfectly inelastic goods.

== Overview ==
Economist Alfred Marshall provided the graphical illustration of the law of demand. This graphical illustration is still used today to define and explain a variety of other concepts and theories in economics. A simple explanation of the law of demand is that all else equal, at a higher price, consumer will demand less quantity of a good and vice versa. The law of demand applies to a variety of organisational and business situations. Price determination, government policy formation etc are examples. Together with the law of supply, the law of demand provides to us the equilibrium price and quantity. Moreover, the law of demand and supply explains why goods are priced at the level that they are. They also help us identify opportunities to buy what are perceived to be underpriced (or sell overpriced) goods or assets.

Law of Demand is relied heavily upon by managerial economics, which is a branch of economics that applies microeconomic analysis to managerial decision-making, to make informed decisions on pricing, production, and marketing strategies. In this context, understanding the alternative factors that influence the Law of Demand becomes crucial for managers and decision-makers.

# Income effect: The income effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good or service as a result of changes in consumers&#x27; purchasing power. When prices increase, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, leading to a decline in the quantity demanded. Conversely, a decrease in prices will increase purchasing power and lead to an increase in the quantity demanded.
# Substitution effect: The substitution effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good or service due to a change in the relative prices of substitute goods. When the price of a good increases, consumers may shift their consumption to relatively cheaper substitute goods, causing the demand for the original good to decrease.
# Price expectations: Consumer expectations about future prices can influence their current demand for goods or services. If consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they may increase their current consumption to avoid higher prices later. Conversely, if they expect prices to fall, they may delay consumption, causing a decline in the quantity demanded.
# Market size and demographics: The size of the market and its demographics can also influence the Law of Demand. Changes in population size, age distribution, and income levels can affect the overall demand for goods or services, thus impacting the relationship between price and quantity demanded.

Demand refers to the demand curve. A change in demand is indicated by a shift in the demand curve. Quantity demanded, on the other hand refers to a specific point on the demand curve which corresponds to a specific price. A change in quantity demanded therefore refers to a movement along the existing demand curve. However, there are some exceptions to the law of demand. For instance, if the price of cigarettes goes up, its demand does not decrease. The exceptions to the law of demand typically suit the Giffen commodities and Veblen goods which is further explained below.

The four main types of elasticity of demand are price elasticity of demand, cross elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and advertising elasticity of demand.

== History ==
The famous law of demand was first stated by Charles Davenant (1656-1714) in his essay, &quot;Probable Methods of Making People Gainers in the Balance of Trade (1699)&quot;. However, there were instances of its understanding and use much earlier when Gregory King (1648-1712) made a demonstration of the law of demand. He represented a relationship between the price of wheat and the harvest where the results suggested that if the harvest falls by 50%, the price would rise by 500%. This demonstration illustrated the law of demand as well as its elasticity.

Skipping forward to 1890, economist Alfred Marshall documented the graphical illustration of the law of demand. In &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890), Alfred Marshall reconciled the demand and supply into a single analytical framework. The formulation of the demand curve was provided by the utility theory while supply curve was determined by the cost. This idea of demand and supply curve is what we still use today to develop the market equilibrium and to support a variety of other economic theories and concepts. Due to general agreement with the observation, economists have come to accept the validity of the law under most situations. Economist also see Alfred Marshall as the pioneer of the standard demand and supply diagrams and their use in economic analysis including welfare applications and consumer surplus.

== Mathematical description ==
Consider the function formula_1, where formula_2 is the quantity demanded of good &quot;formula_3&quot;, formula_4 is the demand function, formula_5 is the price of the good and formula_6 is the list of parameters other than the price.

The law of demand states that formula_7. Here formula_8 is the partial derivative operator.

The above equation, when plotted with quantity demanded (formula_2) on the &quot;formula_3&quot;-axis and price (formula_5) on the formula_12-axis, gives the demand curve, which is also known as the demand schedule. The demand curve is downward sloping illustrating the inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price. Therefore, a downward sloping demand curve embeds the law of demand.

In a more specific manner:

:formula_13

Which is a functional relationship where the quantity demanded by the consumer formula_14 depends on the price of the good formula_5, the monetary income of the consumer formula_16, the prices of other goods formula_17, and the taste of the consumer formula_18.

Another common way to express the law of demand without imposing a functional form is the following:

:formula_19

This formula states that, for all possible prices p&#x27; and p, and corresponding demands x&#x27; and x, prices and demand must move in opposite directions, i.e. as price increases, demand must decrease and vice versa. Note that demands are demand &quot;bundles&quot;, not individual demands. Demand for a single good can still increase even though its price also increased, if there is another good whose price increased and which is sufficiently substituted away from. If good i is a Giffen good whose price increases while other goods&#x27; prices are held fixed (so that formula_20), the law of demand is clearly violated, as we have both formula_21 (as price increased) and formula_22 (as we consider a Giffen good), so that formula_23.

== Demand versus supply ==

On the one hand, demand refers to the demand curve. Changes in supply are depicted graphically by a shift in the supply curve to the left or right. Changes in the demand curve are usually caused by 5 major factors, namely: number of buyers, consumer income, tastes or preferences, price of related goods and future expectations. 
On the other hand, quantity demanded refers to a specific point located on the demand curve which corresponds to a specific price. Therefore, quantity demanded represents the exact quantity of a good or service demanded by a consumer at a particular price, conditional on the other determinants. A change in quantity demanded can be indicated by a movement along the existing demand curve that is caused only by a change in price. 

For instance, let&#x27;s take the example of a housing market. An increase or decrease in price of housing will not shift the demand curve rather it will cause a movement along the demand curve for housing i.e. change in quantity demanded. But if we look at mortgage rates (a factor other than price), even if housing prices remain unchanged, an increased mortgage rate leads to a lower willingness to buy at all prices, shifting the demand curve to the left. Consumers will buy less, even though the price is the same. On the other hand, lower mortgage rate leads to a higher willingness to buy at all prices, and eventually shifting the demand curve to the right. Consumers will now buy more, even though the price has not changed at all. Such variation in demand can be explained by demand elasticity.

== Demand elasticity ==
The elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of a goods demand as compared to the fluctuation of other economic factors, such as price, income, etc. The law of demand explains that the relationship between Demand and Price is directly inverse. However, the demand for some goods are more receptive to a change in price than others. There are four major elasticities of demand, these being the price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, cross elasticity of demand, and advertising elasticity of demand.

===Price elasticity of demand===
The variation in demand with regards to a change in price is known as the price elasticity of demand. The formula to solve for the coefficient of price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in Price.

:formula_24

Price elasticity of demand can be classified as elastic, inelastic, or unitary. An elastic demand occurs when the percentage change in the quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price, meaning that a small change in price results in a large change in quantity demanded. Inelastic demand occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price. Unitary elasticity occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.

Factors affecting price elasticity of demand include the availability of substitute goods, the proportion of income spent on the good, the nature of the good (whether it&#x27;s a necessity or a luxury), and the time horizon under consideration.

===Cross elasticity of demand===
The cross elasticity of demand is an economic concept that measures the relative change in demand of a good when another good varies in price. The formula to solve for the coefficient of cross elasticity of demand is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded of good A by the percentage change in price of good B. 

:formula_25

The Cross elasticity of demand, also commonly referred to as the Cross-price elasticity of demand, allows companies to establish competitive prices against substitute goods and complementary goods. The metric figure produced by the equation thus determines the strength of both the relationship and competition between the two goods. 

===Income elasticity of demand===
Income elasticity of demand is an economic measurement tool developed to measure the sensitivity of a goods quantity demanded when there is a change in the real income of a consumer. To calculate the income elasticity of demand, the percentage change in quantity demanded is divided by the percentage change in the consumers income. 

:formula_26

The Income elasticity of demand allows businesses to analyse and further predict the impact of business cycles on total sales. The Income elastitcty of demand thus allows goods to be broadly categorised as Normal goods and Inferior goods. A positive measurement suggests that the good is a normal good, and a negative measurement suggests an inferior good. The Income elasticity of demand effectively represents a consumers idea as to whether a good is a luxury or a necessity. 

===Advertising elasticity of demand===
Advertising elasticity of demand measures the effectiveness of an advertising campaign as to generate new sales. To calculate the Advertising elasticity of demand, the percentage change in quantity demanded is divided by the percentage change in advertising expenditures.

:formula_27

A business utilises the advertising elasticity of demand to measure the effectiveness of advertising on generating new sales. A positive elasticity indicates success for the advertisement as demand for the goods has increased. However, this measurement is also subject to the availability of substitutes, consumer behaviours and price points of the good being advertised. 

== Exceptions to the law of demand ==
The elasticity of demand follows the law of demand and its definition. However, there are goods and specific situations that defy the law of demand. Generally, the amount demanded of a good increases with a decrease in price of the good and vice versa. In some cases this may not be true. There are certain goods which do not follow the law of demand. These include Giffen goods, Veblen goods, basic or necessary goods and expectations of future price changes. Further exception and details are given in the sections below:

===Giffen goods===

Initially proposed by Sir Robert Giffen, economists disagree on the existence of Giffen goods in the market. A Giffen good describes an inferior good that, as the price increases, demand for the product increases. As an example, during the Great Famine of Ireland of the 19th century, potatoes were considered a Giffen good. Potatoes were the largest staple in the Irish diet, so as the price rose it had a large impact on income. People responded by cutting out on luxury goods such as meat and vegetables, and instead bought more potatoes. Therefore, as the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded. This results in an upward sloping demand curve contrary to the fundamental law of demand.

Giffen goods violate the law of demand due to the income effect dominating the substitution effect. This can be illustrated with the Slutsky equation for a change in a good&#x27;s own price:

:formula_28

The first term on the right-hand side is the substitution effect, which is always negative. The second term on the right side is the income effect, which can be positive or negative. For inferior goods, this is negative, so subtracting this means adding its positive absolute value. The non-derivative component of the income effect is a measure of a consumer&#x27;s existing demand for the good, meaning that if a consumer spends a large amount of his income on an inferior good, then a price increase could cause the income effect to dominate the substitution effect. This leads to a positive partial derivative of the good&#x27;s demand with regards to its price, which violates the law of demand.

===Expectation of change in the price of commodity===
If an increase in the price of a commodity causes households to expect the price of a commodity to increase further, they may start purchasing a greater amount of the commodity even at the presently increased price. Similarly, if the household expects the price of the commodity to decrease, it may postpone its purchases. Thus, some argue that the law of demand is violated in such cases. In this case, the demand curve does not slope down from left to right; instead, it presents a backward slope from the top right to down left. This curve is known as an exceptional demand curve. 

===Basic or necessary goods===
The goods which people need no matter how high the price is are basic or necessary goods. Medicines covered by insurance are a good example. An increase or decrease in the price of such a good does not affect its quantity demanded.

===Certain scenarios in stock trading===
Stock buyers acting in accord with the hot-hand fallacy will increase buying when stock prices are trending upward. Other rationales for buying a high-priced stock are that previous buyers who bid up the price are proof of the issue&#x27;s quality, or conversely, that an issue&#x27;s low price may be evidence of viability problems. Likewise, demand among short traders during a short squeeze can increase as price increases.

=== Veblen goods ===
Unlike Giffen goods, which are inferior items, Veblen goods are generally high quality goods. The demand for Veblen goods increases with the increase in price. Examples of Veblen goods are mostly luxurious items such as diamond, gold, precious stones, world-famous paintings, antiques etc. Veblen goods appear to go against the law of demand because of their exclusivity appeal, in the sense that if a price of a luxurious and expensive product is increased, it may attract the status-conscious group more, since it will be further out of reach for an average consumer. Thorstein Veblen referred to this sort of consumption as the purchase of goods that do not exhibit additional utility or functionality but offer status and reveal socioeconomic position. In simple words, these goods are not bought for their satisfaction but for their &quot;snob appeal&quot; or &quot;ostentation&quot;. Accordingly, all these factors also lead to an upward sloping demand curve for Veblen goods along a certain price range.

Gary S. Becker and Kevin M. Murphy analysed Veblen goods. Their analysis of the demand for paintings by masters and for other objects proves Veblen by relying heavily on the allocative role of prices in markets with social interactions.

<text>This is a complete list of works by H. P. Lovecraft. Dates for the fiction, collaborations and juvenilia are in the format: composition date / first publication date, taken from &quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; by S. T. Joshi and D. E. Schultz, Hippocampus Press, New York, 2001. For other sections, dates are the time of composition, not publication. Many of these works can be .

==Fiction==
==Collaborations, revisions, and ghost writing==
===Works by August Derleth related to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s works and notes===
While put forward as posthumous collaborations while Derleth was alive, the status of these works as collaborations with Lovecraft was swiftly disputed after Derleth’s death. Subsequent critics consider them part of the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, but often split this into the original &quot;Lovecraft Mythos&quot; and the later and lesser &quot;Derleth Mythos&quot;.

===Unknown authorship===
* &quot;The Inevitable Conflict&quot;. This was published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (December 1930 and January 1931) under the name Paul H. Lovering. A variety of evidence, including statistical analysis of the writing structure, has been put forward to suggest that Lovecraft was not the author.

==Juvenilia==
==Poetry==
Lovecraft&#x27;s complete poetry is collected in S.T. Joshi (ed), &quot;The Ancient Track: Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft&quot; (NY: Hippocampus Press, 2013. (An earlier, less complete version was published by Night Shade Books in 2001).

<text>Paradise Regained is a poem by English poet John Milton, first published in 1671. The volume in which it appeared also contained the poet&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;. &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is connected by name to his earlier and more famous epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, with which it shares similar theological themes; indeed, its title, its use of blank verse, and its progression through Christian history recall the earlier work. However, this effort deals primarily with the temptation of Christ as recounted in the Gospel of Luke.

Milton composed &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; at his cottage in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is four books long and comprises 2,065 lines; in contrast, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is twelve books long and comprises 10,565 lines. As such, Barbara K. Lewalski has labelled the work a &quot;brief epic&quot;.

==Plot==
===Book 1===
Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist. Satan schemes with the demons against Jesus after witnessing the baptism. 

In Heaven, God tells the angels of Satan&#x27;s arrogance, and He is praised. 

Jesus then fasts in the wilderness for 40 days. Satan tempts Jesus with bread but is rebuked. Jesus allows Satan to linger with limitations, staying vigilant. Night falls.

===Book 2===
Simon and Andrew witness Jesus&#x27; baptism, recognizing Him as the Messiah. They lose sight of Him, prompting a frantic search. Jesus&#x27; mother, Mother Mary, shares their concern, recalling a time when she lost Jesus at 12 years old.

Satan tells his demons of the challenging temptation ahead, dismissing Belial&#x27;s honey trapping suggestion due to his belief in pride&#x27;s strength.

Jesus dreams of Elijah fed by ravens, then resists temptations of Satan: a banquet is offered and rejected; He is tempted with money, and reminds Satan of King David&#x27;s humble beginnings.

===Book 3===
Satan flatters Christ&#x27;s wisdom but taunts his lack of achievement compared to Alexander the Great at 30. Jesus rejects violence, seeing suffering as his path. Satan suggests alliances and freeing the Ten Tribes, but Christ chooses divine providence.

===Book 4===
Satan tempts Christ with Ancient Rome, offering all kingdoms in exchange for His allegiance. Christ declines, rebuking Satan by referencing the Book of Exodus.

Satan tries to tempt Christ with Ancient Greek wisdom, but Jesus prefers the Psalms. 

Satan then subjects Christ to a perilous night before attempting to lure Him to Jerusalem&#x27;s temple. Jesus resists, quoting Scripture. Satan fails, and angels aid Christ and return Him to Mary, celebrating His triumph.

==Analysis==

Whereas &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is ornate in style and decorative in its verse, &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is carried out in a fairly plain style. Specifically, Milton reduces his use of simile and deploys a simpler syntax in &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; than he does in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and this is consistent with Biblical descriptions of Jesus&#x27;s plainness in his life and teachings (in the epic, he prefers Hebrew Psalms to Greek poetry). Modern editors believe the simpler style of &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; evinces Milton&#x27;s poetic maturity. This is not to say that the poem bears no affinities with Milton&#x27;s earlier work, but scholars continue to agree with Northrop Frye&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is &quot;practically &quot;sui generis&quot;&quot; in its poetic execution.

One major concept emphasized throughout &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is the idea of reversals. As implied by its title, Milton sets out to reverse the &quot;loss&quot; of Paradise. Thus, antonyms are often found next to each other, reinforcing the idea that everything that was lost in the first epic will be regained by the end of this &quot;brief epic&quot;. Additionally, the work focuses on the idea of &quot;hunger&quot;, both in a literal and in a spiritual sense. After wandering in the wilderness for forty days, Jesus is starving for food. Satan, too blind to see any non-literal meanings of the term, offers Christ food and various other temptations, but Jesus continually denies him. Although Milton&#x27;s Jesus is remarkably human, an exclusive focus on this dimension of his character obscures the divine stakes of Jesus&#x27;s confrontation with Satan; Jesus emerges victorious, and Satan falls, amazed.

An anecdote recounted by a Quaker named Thomas Ellwood provides some insight into &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;″s development. After studying Latin with Milton and reading the poet&#x27;s epic &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Ellwood remarked, &quot;Thou hast said much here of Paradise lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?&quot; Hearing this, Milton at first &quot;sat some time in a muse&quot; before changing the subject; however, sometime thereafter he showed to Ellwood a new manuscript entitled &quot;Paradise Regained.&quot; Some maintain that although he seemed to express gratitude to Ellwood in a letter, Milton in truth &quot;passed on a friendly if impish fabrication&quot; that made Ellwood feel like the inspiration for the poem.
