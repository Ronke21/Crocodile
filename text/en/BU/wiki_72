<text>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, often shortened to Sky Captain, is a 2004 science fiction action-adventure film written and directed by Kerry Conran in his directorial debut, and produced by Jon Avnet, Sadie Frost, Jude Law and Marsha Oglesby. It stars Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie. It is an example of &quot;Ottensian&quot; (pre-WWII) &quot;dieselpunk&quot;.

Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser using a bluescreen set up in his living room and a Macintosh IIci. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so impressed that Avnet spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance &quot;Sky Captain&quot; without a distribution deal (a worldwide distribution deal would later happen with Paramount Pictures).

Almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators, and compositors created the multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live-action footage, while the entire film was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then recreated as CGI animatics. Ten months prior to shooting the live-action scenes, Conran first shot them with stand-ins in Los Angeles, then converted that footage to animatics so the actors could accurately envision the film.

&quot;Sky Captain&quot; received positive reviews, particularly for the style of filming that was used; some criticism was directed at the plot and characterization. Despite being a box office flop, generating only $58 million on a $70 million budget, the film has since gained a following and is regarded as a cult classic. It was one of the first major films, along with &quot;Casshern&quot;, &quot;Immortal&quot; (both 2004) and &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), to be shot entirely on a &quot;digital backlot&quot;, blending actors with CG surroundings.

==Plot==
In a technologically advanced 1939, the zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg III&quot; moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. Afterwards, Dr. Vargas vanishes.

Polly Perkins, a reporter for &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, mysterious giant robots attack the city. The authorities call for &quot;Sky Captain&quot; Joe Sullivan, the city&#x27;s hero, Perkins&#x27; former lover, and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her safety. He disables one robot; the rest leave. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion&#x27;s air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and persuades Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation.

She discovers Dr. Totenkopf was a former child prodigy and Germany&#x27;s most brilliant scientist who ran a mysterious lab outside of Berlin where he and the missing scientists were working on a project dubbed the &quot;World of Tomorrow&quot;. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf&#x27;s plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion&#x27;s base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture.

Joe and Polly find Dex&#x27;s map and fly to Nepal and then Tibet, where they meet Joe&#x27;s old friend Kaji. He helps them locate an abandoned mining outpost in the Himalayas. Two guides working for Totenkopf force Polly to turn over the vials, locking the duo in a room full of dynamite. Joe and Polly escape just before the room explodes, knocking them unconscious and destroying most of Polly&#x27;s film. They wake up together in the mythical Shangri-La. The Tibetan-speaking monks there tell of Totenkopf&#x27;s enslavement of their people, forcing them to work in the uranium mines. Most were killed by the radiation, but the final survivor provides a clue to where Dr. Totenkopf is hiding.

With insufficient fuel to make it there, they run into a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier commanded by another of Joe&#x27;s former flames, Commander Franky Cook. Franky leads the attack on Totenkopf&#x27;s island lair while Joe and Polly enter through an underwater inlet. Joe and Polly find themselves on an island with dinosaur-like creatures, which Polly hesitates to photograph as she has only two shots left. They find a secret subterranean facility in a mountain, where robots are loading animals, as well as the mysterious vials, onto a large &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; rocket. Joe and Polly are detected but Dex, piloting a flying barge, arrives with three of the missing scientists. They explain that Totenkopf has given up on humanity and seeks to start the world over again: the &quot;World of Tomorrow&quot;. The vials are genetic material from humanity&#x27;s greatest individuals which will produce the perfect Adam and Eve. If the rocket reaches space, the afterburners will ignite the atmosphere and kill everything on Earth, before the rocket repopulates the planet in Totenkopf&#x27;s image.

As the group attempts to enter Dr. Totenkopf&#x27;s lair, one scientist is electrocuted by the defense system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking of his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the lair&#x27;s defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf&#x27;s mummified corpse inside with a scrap of paper clutched in his hand: &quot;forgive me&quot;. He died 20 years previously, but his machines have continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and saving him from Dr. Jennings&#x27; assassin, a female android. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100 km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same assassin robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. Joe and Polly use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket explodes. Joe and Polly watch the animal pods splash down around their escape pod, while Commander Cook leads a group of flying aircraft carriers towards them. Polly then uses the last shot on her camera to take a picture of Joe rather than the animal pods. Joe notes that she had forgotten to take the lens cap off.

==Cast==
* Jude Law as Joseph Sullivan/Sky Captain: He commands a private air force known as the &quot;Flying Legion&quot;. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, &quot;All I got at that early stage was that he&#x27;d used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look.&quot; Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law said &quot;What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [relationship]. I always like to call it &quot;The African Queen&quot; meets &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;.&quot; Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had &quot;worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn&#x27;t hit yet as a major action star.&quot; Law had just finished filming &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003) and was intrigued by switching from on-location filming to filming completely on a soundstage. &quot;Sky Captain&quot; would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of &quot;Alfie&quot; (2004) and &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.
* Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, reporter for the &quot;New York Chronicle&quot;. Law believed so much in Conran&#x27;s movie that he became one of the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she was suggested for the role, Law did not remember &quot;any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.&quot; Paltrow said in an interview, &quot;I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it&#x27;s kind of breaking into new territory and it&#x27;s not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.&quot;
* Angelina Jolie as Commander Francesca &quot;Franky&quot; Cook, commander of a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier. Jolie had just arrived from the set of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot; (2003) and agreed to work on the movie for three days. Despite her small role, she reportedly had conducted hours of interviews with fighter pilots to absorb their jargon and get a feel for the role.
* Giovanni Ribisi as Dexter &quot;Dex&quot; Dearborn, ace mechanic of the Flying Legion. Ribisi met with Avnet and was not sure he wanted to do the movie; however, after seeing the teaser trailer, he signed on without hesitation.
* Michael Gambon as Mr. Paley, editor of the &quot;New York Chronicle&quot; newspaper
* Omid Djalili as Kaji, former comrade-in-arms from the Flying Legion
* Bai Ling as The Mysterious Woman, Totenkopf&#x27;s henchwoman, who is also a gynoid
* Julian Curry as Dr. Jorge Vargas, a missing scientist
* Trevor Baxter as Dr. Walter Jennings, a scientist
* Peter Law as Dr. Kessler, a missing scientist. Peter Law is the father of Jude Law.
* Khan Bonfils as one of the double-agent guides working for Totenkopf (identified in the credits as &quot;Creepy&quot;; the other guide is &quot;Scary&quot;)

Laurence Olivier had been deceased for nearly 13 years at the time of filming and was depicted in the film for the role of Dr. Totenkopf, the mysterious mad scientist and supervillain via computer manipulation of video and audio from when he was a young actor. The novelization written by Kevin J. Anderson gives the full names for Dex and Editor Paley as Dexter Dearborn and Morris Paley.

==Production==
===Background===
Kerry Conran grew up on films and comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. His parents encouraged him and his brother Kevin to develop their creative sides. He studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he realized it was possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Two years later, it seemed apparent to him that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.

===Influences===
Conran was influenced by the designs of Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer who did work for the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair and designed exhibits for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Geddes also designed an Airliner Number 4 that was to fly from Chicago to London.

Another key influence was Hugh Ferriss, one of the designers for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair who designed bridges and huge housing complexes. He was an American delineator (one who creates perspective drawings of buildings) and architect. In 1922, skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett commissioned to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the 1916 Zoning Resolution. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book &quot;The Metropolis of Tomorrow&quot; (Dover Publications, 2005, ).

Regarding the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair itself and its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: &quot;... obviously the title refers to the World Expo and the spirit of that was looking at the future with a sense of optimism and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we&#x27;ve lost a lot in our fantasies. We&#x27;re more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we&#x27;re fixated upon today.&quot;

Conran acknowledged his debt to German Expressionism, which was particularly evident in the opening scenes in New York City: &quot;Early German cinema was born of just a completely different aesthetic than what we see nowadays. One of the last things I watched before starting this project was the &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; series that Lang had doneterribly inspirational, the use of art and propaganda even.&quot;

Conran summarized his influences: &quot;We tried to approach it almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists trying to make a work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we&#x27;re a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that&#x27;d be enough, that&#x27;d be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we&#x27;d have done enough.&quot;

&quot;Sky Captain&quot; has a number of commonalities with Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s anime movie &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986). The sky pirates&#x27; focus on primitive mechanics, large airships, and military cultures is similar. Both stories center on an evil madman controlling an island of high technology, and the search for that island. &quot;Laputa&quot; has the evil madman searching for the island, but &quot;Sky Captain&quot; has the island as the madman&#x27;s base from the beginning. &quot;Sky Captain&quot;″s message is largely about the film genre, but &quot;Laputa&quot; has strong anti-war and anti-technology themes, found in most of Miyazaki&#x27;s work. Both pay homage to the 1941 &quot;Superman&quot; animated short &quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot;.

===Teaser trailer===
In 1994, Conran began assembling moviemaking tools, including a bluescreen in his living room. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than &quot;just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and all the stuff we liked.&quot; Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother&#x27;s wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.

===Pre-production===
Avnet and Conran spent two years working on the screenplay, which included numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran&#x27;s vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently with a lot of his own money. The producer realized that &quot;the very thing that made this film potentially so exciting for me, and I think for an audience, was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, which would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio.&quot;

Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance the film without a distribution deal (Paramount Pictures would later acquire worldwide distribution rights to the film). Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet the actors and begin rehearsals in an attempt to get the shy filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in Van Nuys, California. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators, and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed.

The entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics with all of the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.

Ten months before Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in animatics so that the actors had an idea of what the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944) for Paltrow&#x27;s performance and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.

===Principal photography and post-production===
Conran and Avnet were able to cut costs considerably by shooting the entire movie in 26 days — far less than the three-to-four month schedules usually allotted to blockbuster films — on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working on three blue screens, mainly on Stage 2 (George Lucas Stage) at Elstree Studios in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because there was no time to shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how we would have made this movie. It&#x27;s really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there.&quot; After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in Los Angeles who added CG and sent it back.

After filming ended, they put together a 24-minute presentation and took it to every studio in June 2003. There was a lot of interest and Avnet selected the studio that gave Conran the most creative control. They needed studio backing to finish the film&#x27;s ambitious visuals. At one point, the producer remembers that Conran was &quot;working 18 to 20 hours a day for a long period of time. It&#x27;s 2,000 some odd CG shots done in one year, and we literally had to write code to figure out how to do this stuff!&quot; Most of the post-production work was done on Mac workstations using After Effects for compositing and Final Cut Pro for editing (seven workstations were dedicated to visual effects and production editing). The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in.

Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and mad scientist Dr. Totenkopf. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival BBC footage of the actor and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar technique was used two years later in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006) with Marlon Brando.

Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from mid-2004, one week before &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, to September. He courted the Internet press and finally made an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con with key cast members in an attempt to generate some advance buzz.

==Soundtrack==

The composer Edward Shearmur wrote the film&#x27;s orchestral score in the style of Hollywood&#x27;s golden-age composers, and the film&#x27;s end-title sequence featured a new recording of the song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; sung by the American jazz singer Jane Monheit, which were all featured on Sony Classical&#x27;s original motion picture soundtrack recording. La-La Land Records released a limited edition 2-disc set in 2017 with the complete score.

==Release==
&quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; had high box office expectations, opening in first place on its September 17, 2004 release date and grossing on its opening weekend. However, the film only grossed $37.7 million in North America, below its estimated $70 million budget. It grossed $20.1 million in the rest of the world, making its final worldwide tally $57.9 million. The film is considered a box office flop.

Production designer Kevin Conran, brother of director Kerry Conran, disputed this budget figure in a 2015 interview: &quot;I take great issue with that [budget figure] personally and I&#x27;d like someone to show me where all that money went ... I don&#x27;t support those numbers and I never have. We walked into Jon Avnet&#x27;s office that first day and he said, &#x27;What do you want for the production?&#x27; and we said $3 million. We could have done a version of this film for $3 million. It would have been black-and-white and sans name actors ...&quot;

&quot;But even still, this whole thing was going to be under $20 million. How it went from 20 to 70, you tell me.&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; is slim on plot and characterization, but the visuals more than make up for it&quot;.
On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B− on scale of A to F.

The Canadian network Space awarded it the 2005 Spacey Award for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Film.
Roger Ebert was among those who strongly supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for &quot;its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of how I felt the first time I saw &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. It&#x27;s like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way&quot;.
The film is also one of few to be awarded five out of five stars by IGN FilmForce.
In his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, J.R. Jones wrote, &quot;This debut feature by Kerry Conran is a triumph not only for its technical mastery but for its good taste&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating, saying, &quot;The investment is optimistic and wise; &quot;Sky Captain&quot; is a gorgeous, funny, and welcome novelty&quot;.

Other critics&#x27; enthusiasm was somewhat tempered. For instance, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded its visuals and its evocation of a bygone era but said that &quot;the monochromatic variations on sepia keep the actors and their adventures at a refined aesthetic distance ... At times the film is hard to see. And as the action accelerates, the wonder of its visual concept starts giving way to sci-fi clichés&quot;.
&quot;USA Today&quot; said that the film was &quot;all style over substance, a clever parlor trick but a dull movie&quot;.
Stephen Hunter, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called it &quot;a $70 million novelty item&quot;.

==Homages==
First-time director Conran incorporated many references to classic genre films into his own movie: 
The army of giant robots seen in the film – both flying over the city and later various models in Sky Captain&#x27;s massive warehouse, particularly one designated as number &quot;5&quot; – are a homage to the Paramount Pictures &quot;Superman&quot; cartoon &quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot; (1941), produced by Fleischer Studios. The radio signal tower calling for Sky Captain is a stylized version of the color RKO logo (the film was released after RKO&#x27;s successor, RKO General, sold off their TV stations as a result of corporate misconduct). The giant robots heat rays use the same sound effects as the Martian flying machines from the 1953 version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

When early in the film newspaper clippings from around the globe are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla is clearly visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the Empire State Building in the background.
During the underwater dogfight sequence, a light momentarily displays the wreckage of a ship with the name &quot;Venture&quot; – the tramp steamer that sailed to Skull Island in the 1933 version of &quot;King Kong&quot;. The same scene shows what appears to be the wreckage of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, and an ancient underwater city which seems to be a nod to the legend of Atlantis.

The villain&#x27;s main logo bears striking similarities to the logo for &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, a game universe that some critics noted bears stylistic and plot similarities to the film.

===Pulp magazines and comic books===
The Flying Legion is a homage to pulp magazine and comic book heroes such as G-8 and his Battle Aces, Captain Midnight, and the Blackhawk squadron. Production designer Kevin Conran, the brother of director Kerry Conran, based the design of the flying humanoid robots, in part, on the helmet worn by the DC Comics superhero Adam Strange and the flight controls for Commando Cody&#x27;s rocket-pack.

<doc id="602967" wikidata="Q505038" url="?curid=602967" title="Bread and Roses">
<text>&quot;Bread and Roses&quot; is a political slogan as well as the name of an associated poem and song. It originated in a speech given by American women&#x27;s suffrage activist Helen Todd; a line in that speech about &quot;bread for all, and roses too&quot; inspired the title of the poem &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; by James Oppenheim. The poem was first published in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in December 1911, with the attribution line &quot;Bread for all, and Roses, too&#x27;—a slogan of the women in the West.&quot; The poem has been translated into other languages and has been set to music by at least three composers.

The phrase is commonly associated with the textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, between January and March 1912, now often referred to as the &quot;Bread and Roses strike&quot;. The slogan pairing bread and roses, appealing for both fair wages and dignified conditions, found resonance as transcending &quot;the sometimes tedious struggles for marginal economic advances&quot; in the &quot;light of labor struggles as based on striving for dignity and respect&quot;, as Robert J. S. Ross wrote in 2013.

==History==

=== Traditional background ===

The background of the motif &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; is the miracle of the roses in the legend of Elisabeth of Hungary. She is the saint mostly related to charity and care for the poor. The legend tells the story of Elisabeth smuggling bread to the poor, against the will of her husband. When she was caught in the act, she had to uncover her basket - but only roses were found in it. A very similar legend is associated with Elizabeth of Portugal, who smuggled bread under her cloak to offer the poor.
While the legend has either bread or roses for the poor, the political claim demands both. The bread represents the basic needs, the rose the dignity, appreciation and human rights.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage ===
The first mention of the phrase and its meaning appears in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in September 1911. In an article by Helen Todd, she describes how a group of women from the Chicago Women&#x27;s Club, after listening to advice from Senator Robert La Follette, decided to initiate an automobile campaign around the state of Illinois for the right of women to vote in June 1910. The women who made up the first automobile campaign were Catherine McCulloch, a lawyer and justice of the peace; Anna Blount, a physician and surgeon; Kate Hughes, a minister; Helen Todd, a state factory inspector; and Jennie Johnson, a singer. Each of the speakers was assigned a subject in which they were an expert. McCulloch gave a record of the votes of the representatives and senators to their home constituents. Blount&#x27;s subject was taxation without representation as concerns women. Hughes gave her speech on the history of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Johnson opened up the speeches with a set of suffrage songs which was intended to focus and quiet the audience for the subsequent speeches. Helen Todd, as a factory inspector, represented the working women and discussed the need for laws concerning wages, work conditions, and hours.

It is in Todd&#x27;s speech on the condition of the working women that the phrase is first mentioned. A young hired girl expressed to Todd, who was staying with the hired girl&#x27;s family overnight during the campaign, what she had liked the most about the speeches the night before: &quot;It was that about the women votin&#x27; so&#x27;s everybody would have bread and flowers too.&quot; Todd then goes on to explain how the phrase &quot;Bread for all, and Roses too&quot; expresses the soul of the women&#x27;s movement and explains the meaning of the phrase in her speech.

=== Women&#x27;s Trade Union League ===
Helen Todd became involved in the fall of 1910 with the Chicago garment workers&#x27; strike, which was led by the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of Chicago. The Women&#x27;s Trade Union League worked closely with the Chicago Women&#x27;s Club in organizing the strike, picket lines, speeches, and worker relief activities. Helen Todd and the president of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League Margaret Robins made a number of speeches during the strike and manned with the thousands of striking garment workers the picket lines. During the strike, it was later reported that a sign was seen with the slogan &quot;We want bread – and roses, too&quot;.

In 1911 Helen Todd went out to California to help lead the suffrage movement in the state and campaign in the state&#x27;s fall election for proposition 4, which sought women&#x27;s suffrage. The women&#x27;s suffrage campaign proved successful, and the right for women to vote passed in the state in November 1911. During the California campaign, the suffragettes carried banners with several slogans; one was &quot;Bread for all, and Roses, too!&quot;—the same phrase that Helen Todd used in her speech the previous summer.

=== Oppenheim&#x27;s poem ===
The phrase was subsequently picked up by James Oppenheim and incorporated into his poem &#x27;Bread and Roses&#x27;, which was published in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in December 1911, with the attribution line &quot;Bread for all, and Roses, too&#x27; – a slogan of the women in the West.&quot; After the poem’s publication in 1911, the poem was published again in July 1912 in &quot;The Survey&quot; with the same attribution as in December 1911. It was published again on October 4, 1912, in &quot;The Public&quot;, a weekly led by Louis F. Post in Chicago, this time with the slogan being attributed to the &quot;Chicago Women Trade Unionists&quot;.

=== Lawrence textile strike ===

The first publication of Oppenheim&#x27;s poem in book form was in the 1915 labor anthology &quot;The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest&quot; by Upton Sinclair. This time the poem had the new attribution and rephrased slogan: &quot;In a parade of strikers of Lawrence, Mass., some young girls carried a banner inscribed, &#x27;We want Bread, and Roses too!. The Lawrence textile strike, which lasted from January to March 1912, united dozens of immigrant communities under the leadership of the Industrial Workers of the World, and was led to a large extent by women. The Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of Boston also became partially involved in the strike, and set up a relief station, which provided food.

The Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of Boston had, however, only limited involvement in the strike, since it was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which did not endorse the strike. This restraint on involvement in the strike caused a number of Boston League members to resign. One critic of the AFL&#x27;s failure to endorse the strike stated: &quot;To me, many of the people in the AFL seem to be selfish, reactionary and remote from the struggle for bread and liberty of the unskilled workers...&quot; Although popular telling of the strike includes signs being carried by women reading &quot;We want bread, but we want roses, too!&quot;, a number of historians are of the opinion that this account is ahistorical.

=== Schneiderman&#x27;s speech ===

In May 1912, Merle Bosworth gave a speech in Plymouth, Indiana, on women suffrage in which she repeated the discussion of taxation without representation and the meaning of the phrase &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; that Helen Todd and her companions gave in 1910 during their automobile campaign for the women&#x27;s suffrage. A month later in June 1912 Rose Schneiderman of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of New York discussed the phrase in a speech she gave in Cleveland in support of the Ohio women&#x27;s campaign for equal suffrage. In her speech, which was partially published in the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League journal &quot;Life and Labor,&quot; she stated:

Schneiderman, subsequently, gave a number of speeches in which she repeated her quote about the worker desiring bread and roses. Due to these speeches, Schneiderman&#x27;s name became intertwined with the phrase bread and roses. A year after the publication of Oppenheim&#x27;s poem, the Lawrence textile strike, and Schneiderman&#x27;s speech, the phrase had spread throughout the country. In July 1913, for instance, during a suffrage parade in Maryland, a float with the theme &quot;Bread for all, and roses, too&quot; participated. The float &quot;bore ... a boat with three children, a boy with a basket of bread and two girls with a basket of roses.&quot;

=== Galen of Pergamon ===

The source of Helen Todd&#x27;s inspiration for the phrase &quot;bread and roses&quot; is unknown. However, there is a quote by the Roman physician and philosopher Galen of Pergamon which closely parallels the sentiment and wording of the phrase. Edward Lane, in the notes of his 1838 translation of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, states that, according to 15th-century writer Shems-ed-Deen Moḥammad en-Nowwájee, Galen said, &quot;He who has two cakes of bread, let him dispose of one of them for some flowers of narcissus; for bread is the food of the body, and the narcissus is the food of the soul.&quot; The sentiment that the poor were not only lacking in food for the body, but also flowers for the soul was a theme among reformers of the period. In April 1907, Mary MacArthur of the British Women&#x27;s Trade Union League visited the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of Chicago and gave a speech addressing this theme. Alice Henry of the Chicago League reported that McArthur&#x27;s message could be summed up by Galen&#x27;s quote, which she had mentioned more than once, and that although the quote warns against the materialist nature of the industrial situation, it also points in the direction in which the reformers hopes may go. McArthur&#x27;s version of Galen&#x27;s quote is:

== Song ==

=== Kohlsaat original ===
The poem &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; has been set to music several times. The earliest version was set to music by Caroline Kohlsaat in 1917. The first performance of Kohlsaat&#x27;s song was at the River Forest Women&#x27;s Club where she was the chorus director. Kohlsaat&#x27;s song eventually drifted to the picket line. By the 1930s, the song was being extensively used by women, while they fed and supported the strikers on the picket line at the manufacturing plants. The song also migrated to the college campus. At some women&#x27;s colleges, the song became part of their traditional song set.

=== Women&#x27;s colleges ===

Since 1932, the song has been sung by graduating seniors at Mount Holyoke College during the Laurel Parade ceremony, part of the college&#x27;s graduation tradition. It is also one of the central songs at Bryn Mawr College, traditionally sung at the College&#x27;s &quot;Step-Sings&quot;. The use of the song at Bryn Mawr College evolved out of the school&#x27;s first-of-its-kind summer labor education program. In 1921, the school started the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers; each year, one hundred largely unschooled workers from factories, mills and sweatshops were brought to the school for an eight-week study in humanities and labor solidarity. The program served as a model for others in the labor education movement in the 1920s and 1930s.

=== Fariña rediscovery ===
The song gained a larger audience after World War II with its publication in January 1952 in &quot;Sing Out!&quot;. In 1974 the poem was set a second time to music by Mimi Fariña. This version has been recorded by various artists, including Judy Collins, Ani DiFranco, Utah Phillips, and Josh Lucker, and was performed by a slowly-growing crowd of workers in a moving/critical turning point scene in the 2014 movie &quot;Pride&quot;. 
John Denver also set it to music in 1988, using a melody different from the more common Mimi Fariña version. 

It was again set to music in Germany by Renate Fresow, using a translation by the &quot;Hannoveraner Weiberquartett&quot;, but is since most often sung with the German translation by Peter Maiwald. Composer Christian Wolff wrote a piano piece entitled &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; (1976) based on the strike song. In 1989/91, Si Kahn wrote a song the refrain of which starts with the song&#x27;s title: &quot;They all sang &#x27;Bread and Roses.

=== Translations ===
The poem has been translated into Russian by Russian poet Kirill Felixovich Medvedev, set to the original Kohlsaat music, and performed by the Moscow-based political activist punk collective Arkadiy Kots (Аркадий Коц), appearing on their 2016 album &quot;Music for the working class.&quot;

==Legacy==
Mimi Fariña created the Bread and Roses Benefit Agency in 1974.

The logo for the Democratic Socialists of America, formed in 1982, was inspired by the slogan. &quot;Bread &amp; Roses&quot; is also a name of a national caucus within the organization. They have 3 (out of 16) members of the DSA&#x27;s National Political Committee.

A quarterly journal produced by the UK section of the Industrial Workers of the World (&#x27;Wobblies&#x27;) is called &quot;Bread and Roses&quot;.

The 2014 film &quot;Pride&quot; depicts the members of a Welsh mining community singing &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; at a National Union of Mineworkers lodge during the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985).

In 2018, the song was used in a video produced by London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign to promote the #HomeToVote movement, which encouraged young Irish people living abroad to return home to vote in the Referendum on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Irish Constitution.

In 2022 the TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot; depicted families of construction workers singing &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; to the workers to lift a spell their boss had put on them to break a strike.

The international socialist feminist organization Pan y Rosas is named after the slogan.

Miriam Schneir included it in her anthology, &quot;&quot;, labelling it as one of the essential works of feminism.

The 2023 documentary &quot;Bread and Roses&quot;, directed by Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani and co-produced by Jennifer Lawrence and Malala Yousafzai, is about the women in Afghanistan and the role of the Taliban following the United States&#x27; withdrawal from Afghanistan. The film&#x27;s title is a reference to the slogan.

<doc id="602970" wikidata="Q726198" url="?curid=602970" title="Walter Q. Gresham">
<text>Walter Quintin Gresham (March 17, 1832 – May 28, 1895) was an American attorney, jurist, statesman, and politician who served in the cabinets of presidents Chester A. Arthur and Grover Cleveland.

Gresham was the 31st postmaster general of the United States under Arthur from 1883 to 1884 and briefly the 35th U.S. secretary of the treasury from September to October 1884 before resigning to become a federal judge. He was twice a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 1884 and 1888 before leaving the party to support Cleveland in the 1892 election. He joined Cleveland&#x27;s second cabinet as the 33rd U.S. secretary of state from 1893 until his death in 1895.

Gresham served as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the U.S. Circuit Courts for the Seventh Circuit, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Indiana.

==Early life and education==
Walter Quintin Gresham was born on March 17, 1832, in Lanesville, Indiana, to William Gresham and Sarah Davis.

William Gresham was a former colonel in the Indiana militia, a cabinet maker, and a member of the Whig Party. He was elected sheriff of Harrison County, and on January 26, 1834, he was fatally stabbed while assisting in the arrest of Levi Sipes, a so-called &quot;desperado&quot;. After William&#x27;s death, Walter and his brothers were raised by a stepfather, Noah Remley. His grandmother&#x27;s brother, Dennis Pennington, was also influential on his childhood. Pennington secured him a position in the office of the Harrison County auditor.

After attending the local schools in Harrison County, Gresham attended Corydon Seminary from 1849 to 1851. Montgomery Schuyler Jr. later attributed Greshman&#x27;s foreign policy to his devout religiosity.

Gresham attended Indiana University Bloomington for a year beginning in September 1851, then returned to Corydon to read law with judge William A. Porter. He was admitted to the bar on April 1, 1854, and entered private practice with Thomas C. Slaughter.

Gresham quickly became involved in politics as an opponent of slavery, advocating for gradual, peaceful abolition. He ran unsuccessfully for Harrison County clerk in 1853. He joined the nativist American Party in 1855 before quickly joining the new Republican Party in 1856 and actively campaigning for the party&#x27;s ticket. In 1860, he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives as a Republican in a strongly Democratic district. Though Stephen A. Douglas carried Harrison County in the presidential election, Gresham won by sixty votes.

Gresham&#x27;s first act in the House was to introduce a resolution declaring armed resistance to constitutional laws by Congress as treason; though the word &quot;treason&quot; was ultimately removed, Gresham&#x27;s resolution passed. He was also a strong critic of the spoils system.

Gresham received a commission as a colonel on the staff of Oliver P. Morton, but their relationship was strained. As chair of the House Committee on Military Affairs, he was the author of a bill transferring power to commission militia officers to the governor; their office had previously been elected. Gresham asked Morton for such a commission but was refused.

==Civil War service==
At the end of his term in the House, Gresham organized a military company at Corydon and enlisted as a private; he was elected captain but, following his friends&#x27; lobbying of Governor Morton, was quickly commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 38th Indiana Volunteer Infantry on September 18, 1861. In December, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 53rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry, which subsequently took part in Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Tennessee campaign of 1862, including the Sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg, during which Colonel Gresham commanded a brigade. On August 11, 1863, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and was placed in command of the Federal forces at Natchez, Mississippi.

In 1864, he commanded a division of the XVII Corps in William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta campaign, and before the Battle of Atlanta, on July 20, he received a gunshot wound to his knee that forced him to retire from active service and left him lame for life. In 1865, he was appointed a brevet major general of volunteers.

==Political and judicial career==
In November 1865, Gresham returned to private practice in New Albany, Indiana in partnership with judge John Butler, but shortly began a solo practice. Though Gresham&#x27;s popularity with his party declined over his opposition to black suffrage, he was nominated for United States House of Representatives in 1866. He was defeated by Michael C. Kerr. Instead, the legislature elected him to handle Indiana state finances in New York City.

While serving in that office, Gresham was a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention. He was nominated for House against Kerr again but was defeated by a larger margin.

===Judge for the U.S. District Court of Indiana===
On September 1, 1869, after declining appointments from President Grant as collector of the Port of New Orleans and U.S. attorney for the District of Indiana, Gresham received a recess appointment without consent to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Indiana vacated by judge David McDonald; he accepted. He was nominated by President Grant on December 6, 1869, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 21, 1869, the same day he received his commission.

Gresham&#x27;s career as a district judge was marked by the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, during which he organized volunteer companies to preserve order and protect property. He repeatedly declined to run for public office, including governor of Indiana and the U.S. Senate.

===Cabinet of Chester A. Arthur, Court of Appeals, and presidential campaigns===
On April 9, 1883, Gresham resigned from the bench to accept an appointment as U.S. postmaster general in president Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s cabinet. He supervised the reduction of the postal rate from three cents to two, the increase in the weight allowance from half an ounce to a full ounce, and the reduction in the cost of postage of mail to Canada. He also participated in the suppression of the Louisiana lottery by banning it from federal mails. He also oversaw reforms designed to improve the foreign postal service and restore faster mail delivery.

In September 1884, Arthur appointed Gresham to succeed Charles J. Folger, who died in office, as U.S. secretary of the treasury. After one month in office, he resigned to accept a recess appointment from President Arthur to a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court for the Seventh Circuit vacated by judge Thomas Drummond. He was nominated to the same position by President Arthur on December 3, 1884, was confirmed on December 9, and received his commission the same day. Gresham was assigned by operation of law to additional and concurrent service on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on June 16, 1891, to a new seat authorized by the Evarts Act. He resigned on March 3, 1893.

Gresham was a candidate for the 1884 and 1888 Republican presidential nominations. His 1888 candidacy was supported by several notable agrarian unions, including the Agricultural Wheel, the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, and the Farmers&#x27; Alliance. On the first ballot, Gresham finished second behind John Sherman and carried the states of Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois, Colorado, and Missouri. He did not, however, carry Indiana, which backed his rival Benjamin Harrison. On the eighth ballot, Harrison secured the nomination; he went on to defeat incumbent Democratic president Grover Cleveland in the general election.

Once in office, Harrison signed the McKinley Tariff. As a leading critic of protective tariffs and personal rival to Harrison, Gresham grew increasingly estranged from the Republican Party.

===Secretary of State===
In 1892, Gresham was offered the presidential nomination of the Populist Party, but declined and supported the Democratic candidate, Cleveland; privately, he emphasized that his support was due to Cleveland&#x27;s position on the tariff and not his personal rivalry with Harrison.

On January 25, 1893, Cleveland offered Gresham the position of secretary of state. On the advice of his family, who suggested joining Cleveland&#x27;s administration would appear to be a quid pro quo and risk his personal popularity, Gresham first declined the offer on February 3. On the advice of friends, especially Henry Watterson, and an urgent telegram from Cleveland to accept the offer, he reversed his position days later. Despite some opposition from Democratic Party regulars, the appointment was generally received with approval.

Gresham was Cleveland&#x27;s secretary of state from 1893 to 1895. As secretary, Gresham led a moderate diplomatic application of the Monroe Doctrine in Central America and served as an international arbitrator between imperial powers in Central America and Asia. He negotiated the withdrawal of British troops during the Nicaragua Crisis of 1894–1895 and helped settle the Venezuelan crisis of 1895. He also served as an arbitrator in the First Sino-Japanese War and participated in the Bering Sea Arbitration. During the Hawaiian crisis following the 1893 Overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani, Gresham and President Grover Cleveland opposed the annexation of Hawaii. Cleveland&#x27;s predecessor, Benjamin Harrison had supported annexation, however left office before any decisive action could be undertaken. When Cleveland came to power, he withdrew the annexation treaty from Senate, and attempted to restore the Queen.

Gresham died on May 28, 1895, in Washington, D.C. He is interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Gresham married Matilda McGrain on March 11, 1858. They had two children, Kate and Otto.

One of Gresham&#x27;s grandsons was U.S. representative Walter G. Andrews of New York.

==Legacy==

Gresham received an honorary doctorate from Indiana University in 1883.

An 800-page biography of Gresham by his son and widow was published in 1919.

Gresham, Oregon; Gresham, Nebraska; Gresham, Wisconsin; and the ship USRC Gresham are named in his honor.

<text>Pokémon Puzzle League is a puzzle video game in the &quot;Puzzle League&quot; series developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. Released in North America on September 25, 2000, and in Europe on March 2, 2001, its &quot;Puzzle League&quot;-based gameplay has a focus on puzzle-based strategy in the game&#x27;s grid-based format. To advance to new levels, players are required to combat the game&#x27;s trainers and gym leaders, similar to the ones featured in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;. One of several games based on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, it features lead protagonist Ash Ketchum, his Pikachu, his companions Brock and Misty, the Kanto Gym Leaders, and other characters from the series.

As the development process of video games as a whole changed drastically from the 2D era of the fourth generation of video game consoles to the 3D era of the fifth generation, so did the development of &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;. The increased capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI) compelled the developers to create multiple levels of difficulty for the game, and it was implemented successfully in all but the 3D modes of the game, in which the AI becomes erratic at times. Local multiplayer capabilities are also available for one-on-one &quot;Puzzle League&quot; battles.

&quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot;, a companion puzzle game, was released for the Game Boy Color in 2000. Re-releases of the game followed in 2008 for the Wii via Virtual Console, and in 2022 on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; features the same gameplay as in &quot;Panel de Pon&quot;. The objective is to clear blocks from the playfield by arranging them in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. A continuous stream of new blocks pushes up from the bottom of the playfield, causing the entire playfield to rise continuously. If the blocks reach the top of the playfield, the player loses. The player can temporarily stop the progression of blocks by scoring combos and chains, and in two-player battles, these actions also cause garbage blocks to stack on top of the opponent&#x27;s playfield.

Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; features a 3D mode in addition to the traditional 2D mode. In this mode, gameplay takes place on a cylinder with an effective width of 18 blocks, compared to the six-block width of the flat 2D field. It also features the original block design from &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; and &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;, as well as a Pokémon-oriented design (selected by default). The game features the ability to battle against AI opponents, though their abilities are limited when using the 3D gameplay style.

The game includes several modes of play. In &quot;1P Stadium&quot;, players control Ash Ketchum as they compete to defeat a series of increasingly difficult opponents and become the Puzzle Master. &quot;2P Stadium&quot; allows two players to choose one of 15 Pokémon trainers to play as, and battle one another using different gameplay rulesets. Other game types include &quot;Marathon&quot;, which challenges players to continue playing as long as possible before the blocks fill the screen; &quot;Time Zone&quot;, in which players attempt to achieve the highest score possible within a two minute time limit; &quot;Spa Service&quot;, a stage-based mode where the player must clear a target number of lines to advance to the next stage; and &quot;Puzzle University&quot;, a puzzle mode where players must clear predetermined block configurations within a limited number of moves. The game also includes modes designed to teach newer players, including &quot;Professor Oak&#x27;s Lab&quot;, in which Professor Oak provides several tutorials on how to play; and &quot;Mimic Mansion&quot;, a training arena hosted by Tracey Sketchit that demonstrates techniques and allows players to practice.

===Characters===

The 16 playable characters in &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; are directly taken from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, including characters that originally debuted in previous &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, such as Misty, Brock, and Giovanni. Ash Ketchum is the only playable character in the 1P Stadium mode, whereas other characters are available in the 2P Stadium mode. Ash&#x27;s rival Gary Oak&#x27;s Pokémon, a Nidoran♀, Growlithe, and Krabby, appear fully evolved into Nidoqueen, Arcanine, and Kingler when playing 1P Stadium on Hard difficulty or higher, although these evolved forms are not available when playing as Gary in 2P Stadium. The game&#x27;s difficulty setting determines who the player faces as the final opponent: Giovanni in Easy mode, Bruno in Normal mode, Gary in Hard mode, and Mewtwo in Very Hard and Super Hard modes, which upon his defeat rewards the player with a different ending scene.

In addition to Ash, characters playable in the 2P Stadium mode include the eight Kanto Gym Leaders; Orange Islands companion Tracey Sketchit; perpetual villains Jessie, James, and Meowth of Team Rocket; rivals Gary Oak and Ritchie; Elite Four trainers Lorelei and Bruno; and Mewtwo, who uses cloned Pokémon. Each character has a unique set of three Pokémon to battle with and a specific theme music; these differences are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay. Non-playable characters include Professor Oak, who provides tutorial information to the player; Nurse Joy, who hosts the game&#x27;s &quot;Pokemon Center&quot; options menu; and less-seen Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy, who appear as special opponents in the Spa Service mode.

==Plot==
Ash and Pikachu are on vacation when they are called on the phone by Professor Oak, who tells Ash he has been selected as one of the challengers for the official Puzzle League Tournament. Ash races off excitedly with Pikachu to the nearby Pokémon Puzzle League Village.

During the tournament, Ash challenges Gary, his first rival, before defeating seven of the eight of the Kanto region gym leaders and earning their badges, learning from them of a legendary undefeated competitor known as the Puzzle Master. After battling Tracey and Team Rocket, Ash challenges the supposed Puzzle Master, Giovanni, and defeats him to win the last badge. Soon after, he defeats the Elite Four, including the current Puzzle League Champion, Gary.

Upon Gary&#x27;s defeat, Ash is named the new champion and presented with a trophy, which immediately warps him into a final challenge with the true Puzzle Master, Mewtwo. After defeating Mewtwo, Ash is warped back to his vacation spot. Ash initially believes the experience to be a dream, until he discovers a Pokémon Puzzle Master trophy awarded to him by Mewtwo.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s engine was originally built for an unpublished &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; title for Nintendo 64; this version was ultimately released as part of the &quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&quot; compilation for GameCube.

The in-game soundtrack is primarily composed of instrumental arrangements of tracks from the 1999 soundtrack album &quot;Pokémon 2.B.A. Master&quot;. Other featured tracks include an arrangement of &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; from &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;&#x27;s short feature &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, and other instrumental tracks from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime. The game also features animated full-motion video cutscenes, along with voice acting by the cast of the anime series.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; received &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Fran Mirabella III of &quot;IGN&quot; said, &quot;I&#x27;m totally addicted and thrilled with &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;.&quot; Blake Fischer of &quot;NextGen&quot; called it &quot;a surprisingly fun experience, if a little on the cute side. It may not be up to &quot;Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo&quot; standards, but it&#x27;s one of the best puzzlers on N64.&quot; Miss Spell of &quot;GamePro&quot; said the game &quot;is designed for young gamers, encouraging creative puzzle-solving—something parents will love. Older puzzle fans who have a high Jigglypuff tolerance will also enjoy this well-structured offering.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Human Tornado said, &quot;Even though it&#x27;s yet another take on &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Pokemon Puzzle League&quot; has enough game modes to give it extra depth, and learning the art of advanced chains and combos will take a long time. &quot;Pokemon&quot; and puzzle game fans will appreciate this fun and challenging N64 game.&quot;

The game was nominated for the &quot;Best Console Puzzle Game&quot; award at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister Awards 2000, which went to &quot;Mr. Driller&quot;.

<text>The Tablet is a Catholic international weekly review published in London. Brendan Walsh, previously literary editor and then acting editor, was appointed editor in July 2017.

==History==
&quot;The Tablet&quot; was launched in 1840 by a Quaker convert to Catholicism, Frederick Lucas, 10 years before the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales. It is the second-oldest surviving weekly journal in Britain.

For the first 28 years of its life, &quot;The Tablet&quot; was owned by lay Catholics. Following the death of Lucas in 1855, it was purchased by John Edward Wallis, a Catholic barrister of the Inner Temple. Wallis continued as owner and editor until resigning and putting the newspaper up for sale in 1868.

In 1868, the Rev. Herbert Vaughan (who was later made a cardinal), who had founded the only British Catholic missionary society, the Mill Hill Missionaries, purchased the journal just before the First Vatican Council, which defined papal infallibility. At his death he bequeathed the journal to the Archbishops of Westminster, the profits to be divided between Westminster Cathedral and the Mill Hill Missionaries. &quot;The Tablet&quot; was owned by successive Archbishops of Westminster for 67 years. In 1935, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Arthur Hinsley sold the journal to a group of Catholic laymen. In 1976 ownership passed to the Tablet Trust, a registered charity.

From 1936 to 1967, the review was edited by Douglas Woodruff, formerly of &quot;The Times&quot;, a historian and reputed wit whose hero was Hilaire Belloc. His wide range of contacts and his knowledge of international affairs made the paper, it was said, essential reading in embassies around the world. He restored the fortunes of &quot;The Tablet&quot;, which had declined steeply. For many years (1938–1961) he was assisted by Michael Derrick, who after the Second World War was often acting editor. Woodruff was followed as editor by the publisher and, like Woodruff, part-owner Tom Burns, who served from 1967 to 1982. Burns, a conservative in his political views, was a progressive on church matters, firmly in favour of the Vatican II church reforms. A watershed came in 1968, when &quot;The Tablet&quot; took an editorial stance at odds with Pope Paul VI&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;, which restated the traditional teaching against artificial contraception. Burns was followed by the BBC producer John Wilkins, who had been Burns&#x27;s assistant from 1967 to 1971. Under his editorship the journal&#x27;s political stance was seen as centre-left. The paper continued to have a distinctive voice, consistently advocating further changes in the church&#x27;s post-Vatican II life and doctrine. Circulation climbed steadily throughout Wilkins&#x27;s 21-year tenure. He retired at the end of 2003. Catherine Pepinster, formerly executive editor of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, became the first female editor of &quot;The Tablet&quot; in 2004. She said that &quot;the journal will continue to provide a forum for &#x27;progressive, but responsible Catholic thinking, a place where orthodoxy is at home but ideas are welcome&#x27;.&quot; In 2012 ITV journalist Julie Etchingham became the review&#x27;s first guest editor, leading a special issue on the CAFOD charity. On succeeding Catherine Pepinster as editor on 12 July 2017, Brendan Walsh said: &#x27;I will do all I can to cherish and protect its values and the quality of its journalism.&#x27;

Contributors to &quot;The Tablet&quot; have included Popes Benedict XVI and Paul VI (while cardinals), the novelists Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, Mark Lawson, Francine Stock, Peter Hennessy, Henry Wansbrough and Bernard Green.

<text>Max Trax was a Canadian pay television audio service that broadcast continuous streaming music on multiple channel feeds. The service was owned by Stingray Digital.

Originally known as Digital Music Express in 1997, the channel later closed in 2009 as Max Trax once assets related to the service were sold to Stingray Digital, owners of a similar service, then known as Galaxie and eventually as Stingray Music.

==Programming==
At the time of its closing, Max Trax offered 22 commercial-free music based audio channels, each devoted to a particular musical genre or theme, distributed through digital television platforms. Each channel consisted of a continuous stream of music or audio, using no live, on-air disc jockeys. The majority of channels broadcast English music, however, French and instrumental channels were also available.

===Channels===
==History==
In December 1995, DMX Canada (1995) Ltd., a joint venture between Shaw Cablesystems (80%) and International Cablecasting Technologies Inc. (ICT) (20%), an American company associated with the similar American service, DMX, was granted a broadcasting licence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). At the time of this decision, it was proposed that the service would consist of a mixture of Canadian-produced channels, along with channels directly from the American service. 

The service launched in the summer of 1997 as Digital Music Express, often referred to as simply DMX, with 30 channels.

In early 1999, Digital Music Express launched a new logo, officially referring itself as DMX in all consumer media. 

In September 1999, Shaw&#x27;s broadcasting assets were spun-off into a separately traded company to comply with CRTC regulations, creating Corus Entertainment, DMX&#x27;s new owners.

In February 2002, Corus announced that it would be purchasing all remaining shares of the DMX television service from DMX MUSIC, Inc. (formerly ICT), while also selling all remaining shares of the DMX business unit, a provider of licensed music for commercial use in stores, restaurants, and other commercial setting, to DMX MUSIC, Inc. The service would be rebranded Max Trax just 3 months later on May 1, 2002.

Because of service duplication, in 2002, Galaxie (a similar television service) and Max Trax agreed to provide a joint 40-channel audio distribution service to satellite and digital cable television providers called Galaxie Max Trax. The package consisted of 20 Max Trax and 20 Galaxie channels. The package was discontinued upon merger with Galaxie in late 2009.

On February 13, 2009, Corus Entertainment announced it had entered into an agreement to sell certain assets associated with Max Trax to Stingray Digital, including hardware, software, websites, domain names, among other assets including trademarks that includes the Max Trax name. Previous to the sale to Stingray, in December 2008, Stingray received a category 2 digital licence to operate a national pay TV audio service, similar to Max Trax, from the CRTC. The agreement was structured so that Corus would discontinue the Max Trax service, keeping the service on the air until Stingray launched its own service under its own licence using the Max Trax brand, resulting in a seamless transition and no interruption in services. The Stingray service never launched; instead the Galaxie licence was continued to be used.

On October 1, 2009 the Max Trax brand was discontinued by owners Stingray Digital, who merged it with Galaxie under one brand, which eventually became Stingray Music. Stingray Digital, who had been operating as the exclusive sales and development agent for Galaxie since late 2007 on behalf of its owners, the CBC, officially took over as managing partner in the service upon completion of merger. Stingray would later purchase Galaxie from the CBC in May 2011.

The original licence for Max Trax that was owned by Corus, was revoked by the CRTC on September 23, 2011.

<doc id="602984" wikidata="Q709167" url="?curid=602984" title="William M. Evarts">
<text>William Maxwell Evarts (February 6, 1818February 28, 1901) was an American lawyer and statesman from New York who served as U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator from New York. He was renowned for his skills as a litigator and was involved in three of the most important causes of American political jurisprudence in his day: the impeachment of a president, the Geneva arbitration and the contests before the electoral commission to settle the presidential election of 1876.

During the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, the reform-minded Evarts was an active member among the &quot;Half-Breed&quot; faction of the Republican Party, which emphasized support for civil service reform, bolstering opposition towards conservative &quot;Stalwarts&quot; who defended the spoils system and advocated on behalf of Southern blacks.

==Family, education and marriage==
William M. Evarts was born on February 6, 1818, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the son of Jeremiah Evarts and Mehitabel Barnes Sherman. Evarts&#x27;s father, a native of Vermont, a &quot;lawyer of fair practice and good ability,&quot; 
and later the editor of &quot;The Panoplist&quot;, a religious journal, and corresponding secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (during a time of &quot;fervor in mission propagandism&quot;) who led the fight against Indian removals, died when William was thirteen. William&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Roger Sherman, Connecticut founding father, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.

Evarts attended Boston Latin School, then Yale College. In his college class were Morrison Waite, later Chief Justice of the United States, Samuel J. Tilden, future New York Governor and Democratic presidential nominee and one of the contestants in the electoral commissions controversy in which Evarts acted as counsel for the Republicans, chemist Benjamin Silliman, Jr., and Edwards Pierrepont, later United States Attorney General. While at Yale he became a member of two secret societies, the literary and debate oriented Linonian Society and Skull and Bones; he later extolled the former and much later denounced all such secret societies. Evarts was one of the founders of &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot; in 1836. He graduated third in his class in 1837.

After college he moved to Windsor, Vermont, where he studied law in the office of Horace Everett and taught school to save money for law school. He attended Harvard Law School for a year, where he &quot;won the respect of Professors Joseph Story and Simon Greenleaf.&quot; Evarts completed his legal studies under attorney Daniel Lord of New York City and was admitted to the bar in 1841.

He married Helen Minerva Bingham Wardner in 1843. She was the daughter of Allen Wardner, a prominent businessman and banker who served as Vermont State Treasurer. They had 12 children between 1845 and 1862, all born in New York City.

==Private practice==
After admission to the bar Evarts joined the law office of Daniel Lord. One of his first cases involved the trial of the infamous forger Monroe Edwards. Evarts served as a junior counsel for the defense, which was headed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky. Edwards was convicted, but Evarts&#x27;s handling of his duties earned him notice as a promising lawyer.

In 1851, Evarts began his partnership with Charles F. Southmayd (the firm was then named Butler, Evarts &amp; Southmayd), a partnership that would last for the rest of his professional career in one form or another. In 1859 Evarts invited Joseph Hodges Choate to join the firm (which then became Evarts, Southmayd &amp; Choate), and the firm then had a trial litigator in many ways as talented as Evarts. But it was Southmayd that Evarts depended on to prepare the case, because Southmayd, it was said, &quot;was a lawyer of remarkable knowledge and capacity and dexterity in working up a case.&quot; In court, &quot;especially before a jury,&quot; however, it was Evarts who shined.

In 1855, the State of Virginia hired attorneys (including the eminent Charles O&#x27;Conor) to contest the decision of the New York Superior Court releasing eight black slaves in the famous Lemmon Slave Case. When Ogden Hoffman, the New York Attorney General, died, the New York legislature appointed Evarts to replace him, and he argued to uphold the decision. The Appellate Division affirmed the ruling, and Virginia again appealed. Evarts again represented the state in the New York Court of Appeals and again prevailed. The case generated widespread interest in both New York and the Southern states, and Evarts&#x27;s arguments were reported in the daily press, as was nearly every step in the case. Thurlow Weed said that the quality of Evarts&#x27;s arguments &quot;placed beyond doubt his right to be ranked among the foremost lawyers of the country.&quot;

In 1856 Evarts represented the widow of Henry Parish, who was the proponent of his will and codicils in probate. His brothers contested the will on the grounds of incapacity and undue influence. (The brothers had been the decedent&#x27;s executor in the will but, by a codicil executed after he was struck with paralysis that rendered him nearly speechless, they were removed.) The proceedings took on a &quot;Bleak House&quot;-like life of its own (the Dickens novel having been published only three years before) with eminent counsel on all sides. The estate was worth over $1.5 million at the beginning of the trial. There were 111 days of testimony before the Surrogate and two weeks of oral argument before the case closed on November 23, 1857. The Surrogate admitted the will and the first codicil (removing the brothers as executors and bequeathing them the residue of the estate) but rejected the second and third (providing for $50,000 in charitable bequests). After four-and-a half years of appeal, involving two arguments before the Court of appeals the judgment was affirmed. The &quot;Times&quot; concluded: &quot;The three volumes of evidence reveal a web of fact, experience and motive, rarely matched in works of fiction, and the three remaining volumes of briefs and arguments exhibit an array of learning, ingenuity and sustained ability, that will always place this suit in the front rank of the &quot;causes célèbres&quot; of American jurisprudence.&quot; As a result of this case his firm would be entrusted with many large estates, including that of the Astors.

The most fame Evarts ever received for a case, however, came in 1875 when he represented nationally famous clergyman Henry Ward Beecher in a suit for &quot;criminal conversation&quot; (adultery) by Beecher with the wife of plaintiff Theodore Tilton and the alienation of his wife&#x27;s affections. The case was a national sensation, but despite what appeared to be clear evidence, Evarts obtained a hung jury for his client; in fact only three of the twelve jurors voted in favor of Tilton.

Evarts&#x27;s courtroom style was summarized as follows: &quot;[H]is long sentences, which, in the period when he was most conspicuous in the public mind, were often marveled over, never seemed to impair the clarity of his arguments; the vein of humor he could infuse in the driest case, the logic and vigor of his utterances, the soundness of his information, the great thoroughness of his preparation, were all factors in his success. But, of course, these do not account altogether for his triumph as an advocate, which was largely due to his positive genius for that kind of work.&quot; Another observer described his style:

==Early political career==
Evarts early associated himself with the city&#x27;s Whig interests dominated by Thurlow Weed. In 1849 he received the appointment of assistant United States attorney for the district of New York. He served until 1853. In 1851 he was also made a commissioner of the Almshouse (later known as the Commissioners of Charity and Correction). The most famous case Evarts was involved in while district attorney was against the famous journalist John L. O&#x27;Sullivan and his fellow filibusters, who had fitted out the &quot;Cleopatra&quot; to aid an insurrection in Cuba. After a month-long trial, the jury was unable to come to a verdict.

Unlike other Northern Whigs, Evarts was not an abolitionist and defended the Compromise of 1850 drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas. He was not involved in the antislavery crusade except for his involvement in the Lemmon Slave Case.

Evarts never showed the talent or inclination for electoral politics, but he early became relied on by party leaders to perform oratorical or public ceremonial functions. In early 1852 he made two major addresses at large meetings for Daniel Webster&#x27;s candidacy: one in March at the Metropolitan Hall and the other in June at Constitution Hall right before the Whig National Convention. Evarts&#x27;s allegiance was out of touch not only with both the Northern and Southern factions of the Whigs but also with William H. Seward, who supported General Winfield Scott.

Although most former Webster supporters belonged to the Whiggish-aligned, moderate wing of the Republican Party and Senator William H. Seward on the staunchly abolitionist end, Evarts became an enthusiastic supporter of Seward. In 1860, he was chairman of the New York delegation to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, where his oratory was at the disposal of the Senator, who most observers believed was a strong favorite for the nomination. James G. Blaine described the effects of those efforts on his audience:
Evarts placed Seward&#x27;s name in nomination, and when it became apparent that Seward would not attain it, Evarts, on behalf of Seward, graciously moved the unanimous nomination of Abraham Lincoln.

In 1861 he ran against Horace Greeley for the Senate seat vacated by Seward (who had become Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State), but when neither could attain the requisite votes, the legislature settled on Ira Harris as a compromise.

In 1862, he was one of the lawyers who argued the Prize Cases for the United States before the U.S. Supreme Court.

He served on New York&#x27;s Union Defense Committee during the Civil War. He was a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention of 1867. At the constitutional convention he was a member of the standing committee on the preamble and bill of rights and the committee on the judiciary.

==Service in the Johnson, Grant, and Hayes administrations==
From 1865 to 1868, Evarts was on the team of lawyers prosecuting Jefferson Davis for treason. In 1868, he became counsel for U.S. President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment trial. He delivered the closing argument for Johnson, and Johnson was acquitted, an event that seemed unlikely when the trial began.

Afterward, Evarts was appointed United States Attorney General following the Senate&#x27;s refusal to reconfirm Henry Stanbery to the office, from which Stanbery had resigned in order to participate in Johnson&#x27;s defense. Evarts served as Attorney General from July 1868 until March 1869.

In 1872 he was counsel for the United States before the tribunal of arbitration on the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims in Geneva, Switzerland. His oral argument helped the United States recover on its claims for the destruction of Union military ships, commercial ships, and commercial cargo by the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and other Confederate ships which had been built in and sailed from British ports during the American Civil War.

Evarts was a founding member of the New York City Bar Association. He served as its first president from 1870 to 1879, the longest tenure of any president.
Evarts served as counsel for President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes before the Electoral Commission that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876. During President Hayes&#x27;s administration, he served as Secretary of State. Initially, Evarts did not act upon reports of corruption in the foreign service and supported actions against internal whistleblowers John Myers, Wiley Wells and later John Mosby. However, when President Grant continued to hear such complaints during his post-presidential around-the-world tour, and such were confirmed by internal troubleshooters DeB. Randolph Keim and former General turned consul to Japan Julius Stahel, Evarts began to clean house before the 1880 election. He ultimately secured the resignation of a favorite subordinate, Frederick W. Seward, for shielding rascals, and then several consuls in the Far East, including George Seward, David Bailey and David Sickels. In 1881, Evarts was a delegate to the International Monetary Conference at Paris.

==U.S. Senator==
Evarts gained the support of state legislators in 1884 for US Senator from New York, and from 1885 to 1891 he served one term. While in Congress (49th, 50th and 51st Congresses), he served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Library from 1887 to 1891. He was also a sponsor of the Judiciary Act of 1891, known as the Evarts Act, which created the United States courts of appeals. As an orator, Senator Evarts stood in the foremost rank, and some of his best speeches were published.

==Chair of the American Committee for the Statue of Liberty==
Evarts led the American fund-raising effort for the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, serving as the chairman of the American Committee. He spoke at its unveiling on October 28, 1886. His speech was entitled &quot;The United Work of the Two Republics.&quot;

Taking a breath in the middle of his address, he was understood to have completed his speech. The signal was given, and Bartholdi, together with Richard Butler and David H. King Jr., whose firm built the pedestal and erected the statue, let the veil fall from her face. A &#x27;huge shock of sound&#x27; erupted as a thunderous cacophony of salutes from steamer whistles, brass bands, and booming guns, together with clouds of smoke from the cannonade, engulfed the statue for the next half hour.

==Retirement==
Senator Evarts retired from public life in 1891 due to ill health. He was still a partner in his law practice in New York City, called Evarts, Southmoyd and Choate. He died in New York City on February 28, 1901, and was buried at Ascutney Cemetery in Windsor, Vermont.

Evarts owned numerous properties in Windsor, including Evarts Pond and a group of historic homes often referred to as Evarts Estate. The homes included 26 Main Street in Windsor. Evarts purchased this house from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000; it was passed down to his daughter, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins, who left the house to family members, including her son Maxwell Perkins, the renowned book editor. The house stayed in the family until 2005. It was later restored and reopened as Snapdragon Inn, which is open to the public and features a library displaying items related to the history of William M. Evarts and his extended family.

==Extended family==
William Evarts was a descendant of the English immigrant John Everts; the family settled in Salisbury, Connecticut, in the 17th century. Evarts was a member of the extended Baldwin, Hoar and Sherman families, which had many members in American politics.

Ebenezer R. Hoar, a first cousin of Evarts, was a U.S. Attorney General, Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and representative in Congress. The two were best friends and shared similar professional pursuits and political beliefs. Each served, in succession, as United States Attorney General. Some of Evarts&#x27;s other first cousins include U.S. Senator and Governor of Connecticut Roger Sherman Baldwin; U.S. Senator from Massachusetts (brother of Ebenezer R.) George F. Hoar; and Sherman Day, California state senator and founding trustee of the University of California.

Son Allen Wardner Evarts graduated from Yale College in 1869. He supported the founding of Wolf&#x27;s Head Society, and was first president of its alumni association. He held the position for a total of 20 years over two separate terms. He was a law partner, corporate president, and trustee of Vassar College.

Son Maxwell Evarts graduated from Yale College in 1884, where he was also a member of Skull and Bones. He served as a New York City district attorney, and later as General Counsel for E. H. Harriman, which later became the Union Pacific Railroad. He was president of two Windsor, Vermont, banks, and the chief financial backer of the Gridley Automatic Lathe &quot;(manufactured by the Windsor Machine Co.)&quot;. In politics, Maxwell served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives and was a Vermont State Fair Commissioner.

Grandson Maxwell E. Perkins became the noted editor of Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons and dealt with authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and James Jones.

Great-nephew Evarts Boutell Greene became a historian and was appointed Columbia University&#x27;s first De Witt Clinton Professor of History in 1923 and department chairman from 1926 to 1939. He was chairman of the Columbia Institute of Japanese Studies 1936–1939. He was a noted authority on the American Colonial and Revolutionary War periods.

Another relative, Henry Sherman Boutell, was a member of the Illinois State House of Representatives in 1884, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois from 1897 to 1911 (6th District 1897–1903; 9th District 1903–1911), a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Illinois in 1908 and U.S. Minister to Switzerland from 1911 to 1913.

Great-great-nephew Roger Sherman Greene II, the son of Daniel Crosby Greene and Mary Jane (Forbes) Greene, was the U.S. Vice Consul in Rio de Janeiro in 1903–1904, in Nagasaki in 1904–1905 and in Kobe in 1905; U.S. Consul in Vladivostok in 1907 and in Harbin 1909–11; and U.S. Consul General in Hankow, 1911–1914.

Great-great-nephew Jerome Davis Greene (1874–1959) was president of Lee, Higginson &amp; Company 1917–1932; secretary, Harvard University Corporation, 1905–1910 and 1934–43; general manager of the Rockefeller Institute 1910–1912; assistant and secretary to John D. Rockefeller Jr. as trustee of the Rockefeller Institute; trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation; trustee of the Rockefeller General Education Board 1910–1939; executive secretary, American Section, Allied Maritime Transport Council, in 1918; Joint Secretary of the Reparations, Paris Peace Conference, in 1919; chairman, American Council Institute of Pacific Relations, 1929–1932; trustee of the Brookings Institution of Washington, 1928–1945; and a founding member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Great-grandson Archibald Cox served as a U.S. Solicitor General and special prosecutor during President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Watergate scandal, whereas Evarts defended a U.S. President (Andrew Johnson) in his impeachment trial. In a sense, they both successfully argued their cases, which represent two of the five U.S. Presidential impeachment efforts. An impeachment trial was not held in Nixon&#x27;s case: he resigned before the House of Representatives acted on the House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s recommendation that he be impeached.

==Legacy==
A eulogist summarized his career thus:

Mr. Evarts&#x27;s most conspicuous, perhaps sole, title to fame is, that he was a great lawyer and brilliant advocate. ... his study of legal principles was profound, his acquaintance with literature was wide, his ideas of professional ethics were exalted. He held great National offices, but his title to them was rather as lawyer than statesman.

On March 6, 1943, construction began on a United States Maritime Service liberty ship in Evarts&#x27;s name. The SS &quot;William M. Evarts&quot; (hull identification number MS 1038) was launched April 22, 1943, and served during World War II in the European theater. It transported troops and supplies from its home port in Norfolk, Virginia, to various ports on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. After World War II, the ship was decommissioned and finally scrapped in 1961.

<doc id="602991" wikidata="Q628329" url="?curid=602991" title="Pinus brutia">
<text>Pinus brutia, commonly known as the Turkish pine and Calabrian pine, is a species of pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region. The bulk of its range is in Turkey, but certain varieties are naturalized as far east as Afghanistan. It is also known as East Mediterranean pine, Afghan pine, and Brutia pine. The name &quot;Calabrian pine&quot; comes from an introduced grove in the Calabria region of southern Italy; historically this region was called Bruttium, which is likely where the specific epithet &quot;brutia&quot; comes from. &quot;Pinus brutia&quot; bears many similarities with other, closely related species such as &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; and &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;. Turkish pine forms a species complex with the former.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus brutia&quot; is a medium-size tree, reaching tall with a trunk diameter of up to , exceptionally . The young bark is thin and red-orange, maturing to grey-brown to orange in color, fissured to flaky in texture. The leaves are needle-like, slender, long, dark green to yellow-green. The needles come in fascicles of two and rarely three, the latter specimens showing similarities in cone structure to the related &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;. 

The male cones are squat, long. The female cones are short, with rigid, woody scales, long, broad, maturing from green to red-orange. They most often appear in whorls of 3 to 4, and generally open within two years of fertilization. The seeds are usually wind dispersed, dropping from the cones after they open, but some trees have been observed with cones that do not open enough to facilitate wind dispersal. Frankis believes Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch assists these trees in dispersal.

=== Varieties ===
&quot;Pinus brutia&quot; is closely related to &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;, and female &quot;P. brutia&quot; cones have been shown to accept and hybridize with &quot;P. halepensis&quot; pollen. In the past it has been considered a variety or subspecies of &quot;P. halepensis&quot;. The species is now treated as distinct, and forms a species complex across the Mediterranean with &quot;P. halepensis&quot;.

* &quot;Pinus brutia&quot; var. &quot;brutia&quot;: Typical form, with longer needles, . Found across Eastern Mediterranean.
* &quot;Pinus brutia&quot; var. &quot;pityusa&quot;: Found in smaller stands along the eastern Black Sea coast, near Pitsunda. Very similar to var. &quot;brutia&quot;.
* &quot;Pinus brutia&quot; var. &quot;pendulifolia&quot;: Muğla, Turkey. Exceptionally long needles, , that hang in pendules similar to &quot;P. canariensis&quot;.
* &quot;Pinus brutia&quot; var. &quot;eldarica&quot;, Afghan Pine: native to Azerbaijan and Georgia and naturalized in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Smaller cones, . Sometimes treated as a subspecies of &quot;P. brutia&quot; or a species of its own. Due to its tolerance of drought and poor soil, it is widely planted as an ornamental in both southwestern US and Europe.

==Taxonomy==
Italian botanist Michele Tenore described the species in 1811. While Tenore did not provide an explanation for the specific epithet, Frankis believes Tenore named it after the historical region of Brutium, now Calabria, where an introduced population has become naturalized.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bulk of its range is in Turkey, but it also extends to southeasternmost Bulgaria, the East Aegean Islands of Aegean Sea, Crete, Crimea, Iran, Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Iraq, western Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus. It generally occurs at low altitudes, mostly from sea level to , up to in the south of its range.

==Ecology==
&quot;Pinus brutia&quot; is a diagnostic species of the vegetation class &quot;Pinetea halepensis&quot;.

The Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch, a rare nuthatch, is largely restricted to forests of Turkish pine and depends heavily on it for feeding; the ranges of the two species are largely coincident.

&quot;P. brutia&quot; is resistant to the Israeli pine bast scale insect &quot;Matsucoccus josephi&quot; and is a major host for &quot;Thaumetopoea&quot; caterpillars.

The species covers in Cyprus, roughly ~90% of all woodland coverage on the island. It forms ectomycorrhizal associations with numerous species of fungi, and its logs and branches are excellent substrates for many kinds of decomposing organisms.

==Uses==
===Honey===
Turkish pine is host to a sap-sucking aphid &quot;Marchalina hellenica&quot;. Under normal circumstances, this insect does no significant damage to the pine, but is of great importance for the excess sugar it secretes. This sugar, &quot;honeydew&quot;, is collected by honey bees which make it into a richly flavoured and valuable honey, &quot;pine honey&quot; (Turkish, &quot;çam balı&quot;), with reputed medicinal benefits.

===Landmark===
The &quot;Lone Pine&quot;, a prominent landmark tree at an ANZAC First World War battle at Gallipoli, was this species. Cones from the battlefield were taken home to Australia, and plants sourced from the seeds were planted as living memorials.

&quot;Lone Pine&quot; memorials, based on cones brought back from Gallipoli, may use this species or Aleppo pine. Some memorials utilise other species altogether.

===Forestry===
It is widely planted for timber, both in its native area (it is the most important tree in forestry in Turkey and Cyprus) and elsewhere in the Mediterranean region east to Pakistan.
The timber is used for many purposes including carpentry, industry, general constructions, firewood and pulp. In Israel it is sometimes preferred to the wider-used &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; (Aleppo pine) because of its resistance to &quot;Matsucoccus josephi&quot;. It is also known for being well suited to recreational sites.

===Cultivation===
&quot;Pinus brutia&quot; is a popular ornamental tree, extensively planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas (such as southern California, Utah, New Mexico and Nevada, as well as throughout Arizona and central Texas in the United States), where its considerable heat and drought tolerance is highly valued. The subspecies &quot;eldarica&quot; is the most drought tolerant form, used in Afghanistan, Iran and more recently in the Southwestern United States. In this region, &quot;P. brutia&quot; subsp. &quot;eldarica&quot; is referred to as &quot;Eldarica pine&quot;, &quot;Afghan pine&quot; or &quot;Mondell pine&quot; (after Mondell Bennett, a commercial tree grower in New Mexico who popularized the species starting in 1969).

<text>The Biographical Directory of the United States Congress (Bioguide) is a biographical dictionary of all present and former members of the United States Congress and its predecessor, the Continental Congress. Also included are Delegates from territories and the District of Columbia and Resident Commissioners from the Philippines and Puerto Rico.

The online edition has a guide to the research collections of institutions where a member&#x27;s papers, letters, correspondence, and other items are archived, as well as an extended bibliography of published works concerning the member (a shorter bibliography is included with the member&#x27;s biography). These additional resources, when available, can be accessed via links at the left side of the member&#x27;s page on the website.

==History==
Charles Lanman, author, journalist, and former secretary to Daniel Webster, gathered the first collection of biographies of former and sitting members of Congress for his &quot;Dictionary of Congress&quot;, published by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. in 1859. Lanman intended his &quot;Dictionary of the United States Congress&quot; to serve as a guide for sitting Members of Congress, similar to the modern &quot;Congressional Directory&quot;.

In 1864, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved the publication of an updated version of Lanman&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Congress&quot; by the new Government Printing Office. In the late 1860s Congress offered Benjamin Perley Poore, a journalist and clerk of the Senate Committee on Printing and Records, the job of preparing a &quot;Congressional Directory&quot; with biographical sketches and the kind of reference information found in the &quot;Dictionary of Congress&quot;.

In anticipation of the centenary of American independence and in search of a market not served by Poore&#x27;s &quot;Congressional Directory&quot;, Lanman prepared the &quot;Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States&quot;, published by James Anglim of Washington, D.C. in 1876. This volume combined the biographies of the &quot;Dictionary of Congress&quot; with entries for other governmental officials since 1776 and expanded reference tables. Poore offered a competing historical volume in 1878 with his &quot;Political Register and Congressional Directory&quot;, published by Houghton, Osgood and Company, Boston.

Joseph M. Morrison&#x27;s revision of Lanman&#x27;s &quot;Biographical Annals&quot; (New York, 1887) was the final directory of congressional biography to be prepared and published privately. In 1903 Congress authorized the publication of &quot;A Biographical Congressional Directory, 1774 to 1903&quot;. Compiled under the direction of O. M. Enyart, this was the first volume prepared by congressional staff who drew on the Lanman and Poore editions as well as biographical information printed in the &quot;Congressional Directory&quot; since the 40th United States Congress (1867). The most thorough and systematic revision of biographical entries attempted prior to the Bicentennial Edition (1989) was conducted in preparation for the &quot;Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774–1927&quot;. Ansel Wold, chief clerk of the Joint Committee on Printing, directed the compilation of this volume published in 1928.

The 1920s survey yielded more detailed and consistent biographies than those in the nineteenth-century editions or in the earlier volumes compiled by congressional staff, but its frequent reliance on family legends and personal recollections introduced dubious information. Although Congress authorized updates that were published in 1949–50, 1961, and 1971, the entries from the 1928 edition remained virtually intact in the three subsequent editions. The creation of the Senate Historical Office in 1975 and the Office for the Bicentennial in the United States House of Representatives in 1983 provided the first opportunity for professional historians to revise and update the Biographical Directory. Earlier editions of the Biographical Directory and their nineteenth century predecessors offered little information on congressional careers other than terms of service. The bicentennial edition (1989) provided a more complete record of the individual members&#x27; years in office. A 1996 edition was published by Congressional Quarterly, but did not achieve wide circulation because of its much higher price. Congress issued an updated print edition in 2005.

The development and growing use of the Internet in the 1990s led to the creation of websites for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ray Strong, House Historian and Assistant to the Clerk of the House, advocated publication of the entries from the Biographical Directory on the Internet. Through the efforts of Joe Carmel, Cindy S. Leach, and Gary Hahn of Legislative Computer Systems under the Clerk of the House, and Cheri Allen of the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, the entries of the Biographical Directory became available online during the week of November 9, 1998, at http://bioguide.congress.gov/ under the auspices of the House Legislative Resource Center and the Historian of the Senate. Internet technology offered the capability to update the Biographical Directory on a daily basis. Besides the biographies, the online database includes extensive bibliographies and a guide to all available research collections for Senate and House entries. The project was the first SGML/XML project for the House and Senate and paved the way for the drafting of legislation in XML in both chambers.

The publicly available online directory has benefited from updated information provided to the House Office of History and Preservation and the Senate Historical Office from scholars, librarians, genealogists, and family members. Senate entries are accompanied by an image of the Senator, when available. Online House entries include images for Members and Speakers with official oil portraits and members since the 109th United States Congress (2005). The records are maintained by staff in the House Office of History and Preservation and the Senate Office of the Historian.

<text>The Acharnians or Acharnians (Ancient Greek: &quot;Akharneîs&quot;; Attic: ) is the third play — and the earliest of the eleven surviving plays — by the Athenian playwright Aristophanes. It was produced in 425 BC on behalf of the young dramatist by an associate, Callistratus, and it won first place at the Lenaia festival.

&quot;The Acharnians&quot; is about an Athenian citizen, Dikaiopolis, who miraculously obtains a private peace treaty with the Spartans and enjoys the benefits of peace in spite of opposition from some of his fellow Athenians. The play is notable for its absurd humour, its imaginative appeal for an end to the Peloponnesian War, and for the author&#x27;s spirited response to condemnations of his previous play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot;, by politicians such as Cleon, who had reviled it as a slander against the Athenian polis. In &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, Aristophanes reveals his resolve not to yield to attempts at political intimidation.

Along with the other surviving plays of Aristophanes, &quot;The Acharnians&quot; is one of the few – and oldest – surviving examples of a highly satirical genre of drama known as Old Comedy.

== Plot ==
The play begins with Dikaiopolis sitting all alone on the Pnyx (the hill where the Athenian Assembly or ecclesia regularly meets to discuss matters of state). He is middle-aged, he looks bored and frustrated and soon he begins to vent his thoughts and feelings to the audience. He reveals his weariness with the Peloponnesian War, his longing to go home to his village, his impatience with the ecclesia for its failure to start on time and his resolve to heckle speakers who won&#x27;t debate an end to the war. Soon some citizens &quot;do&quot; arrive, all pushing and shoving to get the best seats, and then the day&#x27;s business begins.

A series of important speakers addresses the assembly but the subject is not peace and, true to his earlier promise, Dikaiopolis comments loudly on their appearance and probable motives. First of all there is the ambassador who has returned from the Persian court after many years, complaining of the lavish hospitality he has had to endure from his Persian hosts; then there is the Persian grandee, &quot;The Eye of the Great King&quot;, Pseudartabas, sporting a gigantic eye and mumbling gibberish, accompanied by some eunuchs who turn out to be a disreputable pair of effete Athenians in disguise; next is the ambassador recently returned from Thrace, blaming the icy conditions in the north for his long stay there at the public&#x27;s expense; and lastly there is the rabble of Odomantians who are presented as elite mercenaries willing to fight for Athens but who hungrily steal the protagonist&#x27;s lunch. Peace is not discussed. It is in the ecclesia, however, that Dikaiopolis meets Amphitheus, a man who claims to be the immortal great-great-grandson of Triptolemus and Demeter and who claims, moreover, that he can obtain peace with the Spartans &quot;privately&quot;. Dikaiopolis accepts his claims, and he pays him eight drachmas to bring him a private peace, which in fact Amphitheus manages to do.

Dikaiopolis celebrates his private peace with a private celebration of the Rural Dionysia, beginning with a small parade outside his own house. He and his household, however, are immediately set upon by a mob of aged farmers and charcoal burners from Acharnae – tough veterans of past wars who hate the Spartans for destroying their farms and who hate anyone who talks peace. They are not amenable to rational argument, so Dikaiopolis grabs a hostage and a sword and demands the old men leave him alone. The hostage is a basket of Acharnian charcoal, but the old men have a sentimental spot for anything from Acharnia (or maybe they are simply caught up in the drama of the moment), and they agree to leave Dikaiopolis in peace if only he will spare the charcoal. The importance of both the charcoal and the tool that Dikaiopolis holds hostage is that one of the primary sources of revenue for that region was the manufacturing and selling of charcoal. This is further justification for the dissenters&#x27; exaggerated response. He surrenders the hostage, but he now wants more than just to be left alone in peace: he desperately wants the old men to believe in the justice of his cause. He even says that he is willing to speak with his head on a chopping block, if only they will hear him out, and yet he knows how unpredictable his fellow citizens can be: he says he hasn&#x27;t forgotten how Cleon dragged him into court over &quot;last year&#x27;s play.&quot;

This mention of trouble with Cleon over a play indicates that Dikaiopolis represents Aristophanes (or possibly his producer, Callistratus), and maybe the author is in fact the actor behind the mask. After gaining the chorus&#x27;s permission for an anti-war speech, Dikaiopolis/Aristophanes decides he needs some special help with it, and he goes next door to the house of Euripides, an author renowned for his clever arguments. As it turns out, however, he merely goes there to borrow a costume from one of his tragedies, &quot;Telephus&quot;, in which the hero disguises himself as a beggar. Thus attired as a tragic hero disguised as a beggar, and with his head on the chopping block, Dikaiopolis/Telephus/the beggar/Aristophanes explains to the Chorus his reasons for opposing the war. The war all started, he argues, because of the abduction of three courtesans, and it is continued by profiteers for personal gain. Half the Chorus is won over by this argument, the other half isn&#x27;t.

A fight breaks out between Acharnians for and Acharnians against Dikaiopolis/Telephus/the beggar/Aristophanes, and it only ends when the Athenian general Lamachus (who also happens to live next door) emerges from his house and imposes himself vaingloriously on the fray. Order is restored, and the general is then questioned by the hero about the reason why he personally supports the war against Sparta. Is it out of his sense of duty, or because he gets paid? This time the whole Chorus is won over by the arguments of Dikaiopolis. Dikaiopolis and Lamachus retire to their separate houses, and there then follows a parabasis in which the Chorus first lavishes exaggerated praise upon the author and next laments the ill treatment that old men like themselves suffer at the hands of slick lawyers in these fast times.

Dikaiopolis returns to the stage and sets up a &quot;private&quot; market where he and the enemies of Athens can trade peacefully. Various minor characters come and go in farcical circumstances. A starving Megarian trades his famished daughters, disguised as piglets, for garlic and salt (products in which Megara had abounded in pre-war days). Then an informer or sycophant tries to confiscate the piglets as enemy contraband before he is driven off by Dikaiopolis. (Note that piglets meant also female genitals). Next, a Boeotian arrives with birds and eels for sale. Dikaiopolis has nothing to trade that the Boeotian could want, but he cleverly manages to interest him in a commodity that is rare in Boeotia – an Athenian &quot;sycophant&quot;. Another sycophant happens to arrive at that very moment, and he tries to confiscate the birds and eels, but instead he is packed in straw like a piece of pottery and carried off back home by the Boeotian.

Some other visitors come and go before two heralds arrive, one calling Lamachus to war, the other calling Dikaiopolis to a dinner party. The two men go as summoned and return soon after: Lamachus, in pain from injuries sustained in battle and with a soldier at each arm propping him up; Dikaiopolis, merrily drunk and with a dancing girl on each arm. Dikaiopolis clamors cheerfully for a wine skin – a prize awarded to him in a drinking competition – and then everyone exits in general celebrations (except Lamachus, who exits in pain).

== Historical background ==
The Peloponnesian War was already into its sixth year when &quot;The Acharnians&quot; was produced. The Spartans and their allies had been invading Attica every year, burning, looting and vandalizing farm property with unusual ferocity in order to provoke the Athenians into a land battle that they couldn&#x27;t win. The Athenians always remained behind their city walls until the enemy returned home, whereupon they would march out to wreak revenge on their pro-Spartan neighbours – Megara in particular. It was a war of attrition, it had already resulted in daily privations, in starvation and plague, and yet democratic Athens continued to be guided by the pro-war faction led by Cleon and exemplified by tough-minded militarists such as Lamachus. Meanwhile, Aristophanes had been engaged in a personal yet very public battle with Cleon. His earlier play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot;, had depicted the cities of the Athenian League as slaves grinding at a mill and it had been performed at the City Dionysia in the presence of foreigners. Cleon had subsequently prosecuted him for slandering the polis — or possibly the producer, Callistratus, was prosecuted instead. Aristophanes was already planning his revenge when &quot;The Acharnians&quot; was produced and it includes hints that he would carve Cleon up in his next play, &quot;The Knights&quot;.

Some significant events leading up to the play:
* 432 BC: The Megarian decree began a trade embargo by Athens against the neighbouring polis of Megara. The Peloponnesian War commenced soon after.
* 430 BC: The Plague of Athens resulted in the deaths of many thousands of Athenians, including leading citizens such as Pericles.
* 427 BC: &quot;The Banqueters&quot;, the first play by Aristophanes, was produced. There was a recurrence of the plague at about the same time.
* 426 BC: &quot;The Babylonians&quot; won first prize at the City Dionysia. Cleon subsequently prosecuted the young playwright for slandering the polis in the presence of foreigners.
* 425 BC: &quot;The Acharnians&quot; was produced at the Lenaia.

Old Comedy was a highly topical form of drama and the audience was expected to be familiar with the various people named or alluded to in the play. Here is a short, selective list of identities named in the play:
* Pericles: The former populist leader of Athens, he is blamed here for starting the Peloponnesian War through his implementation of the &quot;Megarian Decree&quot;. Pericles had died four years before, in the great plague that afflicted Athens as the city was being besieged by the Spartans.
* Aspasia: The mistress of Pericles and (reputedly) a brothel owner, she is implicated in the blame for starting the war.
* Thucydides (politician): The leader of the opposition to Pericles, he is mentioned here as the victim of an unfair trial motivated by Cleon. The same trial is also mentioned later in The Wasps. This is Thucydides the son of Milesias, head of the aristocratic party; &quot;not&quot; the historian Thucydides son of Olorus.
* Lamachus: A general, a fervent advocate of the war against Sparta, he is mocked throughout this play as a rabid militarist. He is mentioned also in later plays.
* Cleon: The populist leader of the pro-war faction and a frequent target in later plays, he is mentioned here in connection with four issues – 1. some political or financial loss he had suffered as a result of opposition from the class of knights (hippeis); 2. his prosecution of Thucydides (in which context he is named only by his deme) 3. his imputed foreign lineage; 4. his prosecution of the author over the previous play.
* &quot;Euthymenes&quot;: The archon eponymous for the year 437/6 BC, he is mentioned here as a means of dating the departure of the ambassador to Persia.
* Cleonymus: A supporter of Cleon, he is immortalised in later plays as the coward who threw away his shield at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC (soon after &quot;The Acharnians&quot; was produced). He is mentioned here only in relation to his gluttony.
* Hyperbolus: Another populist, he is mentioned here by The Chorus as a litigious individual best avoided but often encountered in the agora. He is frequently mentioned in later plays:
* &quot;Theorus&quot;: A supporter of Cleon, he appears here as the unreliable ambassador to Thrace. He is mentioned again in later plays.
* &quot;Euathlos&quot;: A supporter of Cleon, he was involved in the prosecution of Thucydides. He is mentioned later in The Wasps.
* &quot;Pittalus&quot;: A prominent doctor in Athens, he is twice mentioned in this play in relation to medical treatment for injuries. He receives another mention in the later play The Wasps.
* Aeschylus: The famous tragic poet, he is briefly represented here as someone whose work is generally understood to be admirable. He is mentioned also in later plays.
* Euripides: The famous tragic poet, whose mythical heroes often appear on stage in shabby dress, he is a frequent target in later plays and he appears here as a magniloquent hoarder of disreputable costumes.
* Herodotus: The historian, who had been a recent visitor to Athens (where he gave readings of his history), he is not named but his work is satirized in the play (see the next section).
* &quot;Cephisophon&quot;: A leading actor of his time, rumoured to have cuckolded Euripides and to have helped in the writing of some of his plays, he appears here as the tragedian&#x27;s servant. He is mentioned again in &quot;The Frogs &quot;.
* Theognis: A minor tragic poet, he receives two brief, unfavourable mentions here. He is mentioned again later in another play.
* &quot;Antimachus&quot;: A choregus, he is the subject of an elaborate curse by the Chorus as punishment for vile behaviour.
* Cleisthenes: A notoriously effete homosexual, often mentioned in later plays, he appears here disguised as a eunuch and represented as the son of &quot;Sibyrtius&quot;, a famous athletic trainer – an unlikely association.
* &quot;Straton&quot;: Another effete individual, he appears here alongside Cleisthenes another eunuch.
* &quot;Morychus&quot;: A notorious gourmand and possibly a tragic poet, he is mentioned here as a lover of eels. He is mentioned again in two later plays.
* &quot;Ctesiphon&quot;: A notoriously fat Athenian, he provides a convenient gauge for measuring large volumes.
* &quot;Lysistratus&quot;: A masochist, a member of high society and a practical joker, he is one of the people best avoided in the agora. He is mentioned again in later plays.
* &quot;Pauson&quot;: A starving painter, he is yet another person to avoid in the agora. He receives other mentions in later plays.
* &quot;Hieronymus&quot;: A poet, he is best known for his long hair.
* &quot;Cratinus&quot; (not the comic dramatist): An obscure lyric poet, he is twice mentioned here – as another body best avoided in the agora and as the subject of a humorous curse.
* &quot;Coesyra&quot;: A rich woman, she is mentioned with Lamachus as the sort of person who manages to get out of Athens when times are awkward. She is mentioned later in The Clouds.
* &quot;Phaÿllus&quot;: The famous athlete of an earlier generation, he is casually mentioned here as the yardstick for youthful athleticism (the base of a monument to him can still be found on the Acropolis). He is mentioned later in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
* &quot;Chairis&quot;: A Theban piper, twice mentioned here as a source of shrill noise. He is mentioned also in two other plays.
* &quot;Moschus&quot; and &quot;Dechitheus&quot;: Musicians.
* Sitalces: A Thracian king and an ally of Athens, he is here said to record his love for Athens in graffiti.
* &quot;Diocles&quot;: A Megarian hero, he is mentioned here casually in an oath.
* &quot;Simaetha&quot;: A Megarian prostitute, her abduction by some Athenian revelers is said in this play to be one of the causes of the Peloponnesian War.

== Discussion ==
The Peloponnesian War and Aristophanes&#x27; personal battle with the pro-war populist, Cleon, are the two most important issues that underlie the play.

=== Athens at war ===
The Spartans were the dominant military power on the Greek mainland, and consequently Athenians were reluctant to venture on foot far from the safety of their own city walls. Most Athenians had lived in rural settlements up until then. &quot;The Acharnians&quot; reflects this reluctant transition from rural to urban life. While sitting on the Pnyx, Dikaiopolis gazes longingly at the countryside and expresses his wish to return to his village. Similarly, the old Acharnians sing lovingly of their farms, they express hatred of the enemy for destroying their vines, and they regard the Athenian agora as a place crowded with people that are best avoided. Athens was the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean however and its citizens could travel by sea with relative ease. Thus, the ambassadors who return from Persia and Thrace are resented by Dikaiopolis because he has been living roughly as a sentry on the battlements while they have been enjoying themselves abroad. Privileged individuals such as Lamachas and Coesura are able to get out of Athens when times become difficult, and in this they are likened to slops that are emptied from an urban household. Thus, the real enemies are not the Megarian and Boeotian farmers, with whom Dikaiopolis is happy to trade, nor even the Spartans, who were simply acting to protect their Megarian allies. Instead, the real enemies are the &quot;wicked little men of a counterfeit kind&quot; who have forced Dikaiopolis into an overcrowded urban existence.

The causes of the war are explained by Dikaiopolis in a manner that is partly comic and partly serious. His criticisms of Pericles and The Megarian Decree appear to be genuine, but he seems to be satirizing the historian Herodotus when he blames the war on the kidnapping of three prostitutes (Herodotus cites the kidnappings of Io, Europa, Medea and Helen as the cause of hostilities between Greeks and Asiatics). &quot;The Acharnians&quot; in fact features two passages that allude to the work of Herodotus: Dikaiopolis&#x27; account of the kidnapping of three women, and the Athenian ambassador&#x27;s account of his travels in Persia.

=== Aristophanes versus Cleon ===
Aristophanes, or his producer Callistratus, was prosecuted by Cleon for slandering the polis with his previous play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot;. That play had been produced for the City Dionysia, a festival held early in spring when the seas were navigable and the city was crowded with foreigners. The audience of &quot;The Acharnians&quot; however is reminded that this particular play has been produced for the Lenaia, a winter festival which few foreigners attend. The author moreover assures us that the real target of this play is not the polis but rather &quot;wicked little men of a counterfeit kind&quot;. These scruples are enunciated by Dikaiopolis as if he were the author or producer. He subsequently presents the anti-war argument with his head on a chopping block, a humorous reference to the danger that the satirist puts himself in when he impugns the motives of influential men like Cleon.

== The Acharnians and Old Comedy ==
Like other plays by Aristophanes, &quot;The Acharnians&quot; generally obeys the conventions of Old Comedy. The following dramatic elements contain variations from convention:
*Agon: Agons have a predictable poetic structure, with speeches in long lines of anapests framed within a pair of symmetrical songs (&quot;strophe&quot; and &quot;antistrophe&quot;). There is no such agon in this play. There is a heated argument between the protagonist and the Chorus in couplets of long trochaic verses framed by a &quot;strophe&quot; and &quot;antistrophe&quot; (303–334) but the main arguments for and against war are conducted in ordinary dialogue of iambic trimeter, including input from Lamachus as the antagonist.
*Parabasis: Here the first parabasis follows a conventional form (lines 626–701). However, the second parabasis (lines 971-99) is unusual. It can be interpreted as a conventional symmetrical scene and yet it seems to be a hybrid parabasis/song without any clear distinction between the sung and declaimed sections. Moreover, the Chorus in those lines seems to comment on action that occurs on stage during its address to the audience and this is unusual for a parabasis. A later passage (lines 1143–73) begins with a valediction to the actors, which typically clears the stage for a parabasis and yet it has the form of a conventional song rather than a parabasis.
Other points of interest:
*A one-man parabasis: Dikaiopolis speaks about being prosecuted over &#x27;last years&#x27; play as if he were the author himself.
*Self-mockery: Old Comedy is a highly topical form of satire directed at people known to the original audience. In this play, the author himself becomes a major target for the play&#x27;s mock-heroic humour. He explicitly identifies himself with the protagonist Dikaiopolis and thus he also identifies himself with Telephus, a wounded hero who seeks help disguised as a beggar. It is in these combined roles that he adopts the voice of Herodotus, whose mythological/historical accounts of rape and counter-rape as the cause of war were considered hilarious by contemporaries. In the &quot;parabasis proper&quot;, the Chorus praises the poet as the saviour of Athens. These jokes at his own expense are best understood in the context of his real-life quarrel with Cleon to whom he remains defiant in spite of his self-mockery.
*Possible interpolated lines: Lamachus is another victim of the play&#x27;s humour but one of the jokes appears not to be by the author. There are eight lines (1181–88) that some editors omit from their translations of the play in which Lamachus is described melodramatically commenting on his own death in a ditch. Lamachus died in the Sicilian Expedition when caught by the enemy on the wrong side of a ditch, many years after the play was produced.

<doc id="603025" wikidata="Q2161853" url="?curid=603025" title="Roger the Poitevin">
<text>Roger the Poitevin or Roger de Poitou (mid-1060s – before 1140) was an Anglo-Norman aristocrat possessing large holdings both in England and through his marriage in France during the early 12th century.

He was the third son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel de Bellême. The appellation &quot;the Poitevin&quot; was for his marriage to an heiress from Poitou.

Roger acquired a great lordship in England, with lands in Salfordshire, Essex, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Hampshire, and North Yorkshire. The principal part of the lordship was in what was then called &quot;inter Mersam et Ripam&quot;, that is, &quot;between the Mersey and the Ribble&quot; and is now divided between Lancashire, Merseyside, and Greater Manchester. After 1090, he also assumed the title 1st Lord of Bowland.

Before 1086, he had married Almodis, daughter of Count Aldebert II of La Marche in Poitou, and sister and presumptive heiress of Count Boso III who was childless and unmarried.

==Roger&#x27;s lordship extends beyond the Ribble as far as Cumberland==
Around 1091, Roger&#x27;s brother-in-law Boso died, but Roger was apparently preoccupied with Norman and English affairs, and his wife&#x27;s uncle Odo became count of La Marche.

In 1092, Roger acquired a large part of what is now northern Lancashire. These grants gave Roger effective control of all the lands north of the River Ribble to the River Lune, which formed a natural border between the secure Norman lands in England and the strongly contested Scottish frontier lands in Cumberland.

Due to long established lines of communication across Morecambe Bay, Roger also assumed authority over the regions of Furness and Cartmel; these remained a part of Lancashire until as recently as 1974. The expansion of Roger&#x27;s lands followed his support of King William II Rufus&#x27;s invasion of Cumbria in 1092, where Dolfin of Carlisle ruled, possibly as a vassal of Scottish King Malcolm Canmore. Dolfin was driven out and the Anglo-Scottish border was established north of Carlisle. Roger also acquired the great honour of Eye centered in Suffolk.

==1088 and after==
In 1088, he led a military force with Alan Rufus and Odo of Champagne against William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, at the request of William Rufus when the bishop was implicated in a revolt against the king; Roger also negotiated with the bishop on the king&#x27;s behalf before the bishop went to trial.

Roger&#x27;s father Roger de Montgomery died in 1094. That same year, Rufus sent Roger to hold the castle at Argentan in Normandy, but Roger surrendered it to Philip I of France on the first day of the siege; Roger and his men were held for ransom and purchased their freedom.

Although Philip I was an ally of Robert Curthose, it is thought that this action was less a betrayal of Rufus and more a result of Roger&#x27;s dual vassalage between the King of England and the King of France. Roger did not lose his English lands as a result of this action but held no position in Rufus&#x27;s government from this point. Roger continued to be loyal to Rufus but in 1102 joined his brothers&#x27; failed rebellion against Henry I of England in favor of Robert Curthose. As a result Roger de Poitou lost his English holdings. The King put those in Craven into the governance of Robert de Romille.

Roger then went to his wife&#x27;s holdings in Poitou. Almodis&#x27;s uncle Odo was ousted as count of La Marche in 1104, and subsequently the sons of Roger and Almodis are styled as count. In 1109, Roger was permitted to briefly return to England to the court of Henry I, although he did not recover his earlier English holdings. After around 1109, Roger appears to have either lost interest in governing in La Marche, or lost the political power itself as he is only seen once in the documents of La Marche as his wife and sons held the authority in the region.

==Offspring==
The children of Roger and Almodis include:
* Aldebert IV of La Marche
* Boso IV of La Marche
* Odo II of La Marche
* Ponse of La Marche, who married Wulgrin II of Angoulême
* Avise of Lancaster, who married William &quot;the Younger&quot; Peverel

<doc id="603026" wikidata="Q1570441" url="?curid=603026" title="Parameterized complexity">
<text>In computer science, parameterized complexity is a branch of computational complexity theory that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty with respect to &quot;multiple&quot; parameters of the input or output. The complexity of a problem is then measured as a function of those parameters. This allows the classification of NP-hard problems on a finer scale than in the classical setting, where the complexity of a problem is only measured as a function of the number of bits in the input. This appears to have been first demonstrated in . The first systematic work on parameterized complexity was done by .

Under the assumption that P ≠ NP, there exist many natural problems that require super-polynomial running time when complexity is measured in terms of the input size only but that are computable in a time that is polynomial in the input size and exponential or worse in a parameter . Hence, if is fixed at a small value and the growth of the function over is relatively small then such problems can still be considered &quot;tractable&quot; despite their traditional classification as &quot;intractable&quot;.

The existence of efficient, exact, and deterministic solving algorithms for NP-complete, or otherwise NP-hard, problems is considered unlikely, if input parameters are not fixed; all known solving algorithms for these problems require time that is exponential (so in particular super-polynomial) in the total size of the input. However, some problems can be solved by algorithms that are exponential only in the size of a fixed parameter while polynomial in the size of the input. Such an algorithm is called a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm, because the problem can be solved efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) for constant values of the fixed parameter.

Problems in which some parameter is fixed are called parameterized problems. A parameterized problem that allows for such an FPT algorithm is said to be a fixed-parameter tractable problem and belongs to the class , and the early name of the theory of parameterized complexity was fixed-parameter tractability.

Many problems have the following form: given an object and a nonnegative integer , does have some property that depends on ? For instance, for the vertex cover problem, the parameter can be the number of vertices in the cover. In many applications, for example when modelling error correction, one can assume the parameter to be &quot;small&quot; compared to the total input size. Then it is challenging to find an algorithm that is exponential &quot;only&quot; in , and not in the input size.

In this way, parameterized complexity can be seen as &quot;two-dimensional&quot; complexity theory. This concept is formalized as follows:

:A &quot;parameterized problem&quot; is a language formula_1, where formula_2 is a finite alphabet. The second component is called the &quot;parameter&quot; of the problem.

:A parameterized problem is &quot;fixed-parameter tractable&quot; if the question &quot;formula_3?&quot; can be decided in running time formula_4, where is an arbitrary function depending only on . The corresponding complexity class is called FPT.

For example, there is an algorithm that solves the vertex cover problem in formula_5 time, where is the number of vertices and is the size of the vertex cover. This means that vertex cover is fixed-parameter tractable with the size of the solution as the parameter.

== Complexity classes ==

=== FPT ===
FPT contains the &quot;fixed parameter tractable&quot; problems, which are those that can be solved in time formula_6 for some computable function . Typically, this function is thought of as single exponential, such as formula_7, but the definition admits functions that grow even faster. This is essential for a large part of the early history of this class. The crucial part of the definition is to exclude functions of the form formula_8, such as formula_9. 

The class FPL (fixed parameter linear) is the class of problems solvable in time formula_10 for some computable function . FPL is thus a subclass of FPT. An example is the Boolean satisfiability problem, parameterised by the number of variables. A given formula of size with variables can be checked by brute force in time formula_11. A vertex cover of size in a graph of order can be found in time formula_12, so the vertex cover problem is also in FPL.

An example of a problem that is thought not to be in FPT is graph coloring parameterised by the number of colors. It is known that 3-coloring is NP-hard, and an algorithm for graph -coloring in time formula_13 for formula_14 would run in polynomial time in the size of the input. Thus, if graph coloring parameterised by the number of colors were in FPT, then P = NP.

There are a number of alternative definitions of FPT. For example, the running-time requirement can be replaced by formula_15. Also, a parameterised problem is in FPT if it has a so-called kernel. Kernelization is a preprocessing technique that reduces the original instance to its &quot;hard kernel&quot;, a possibly much smaller instance that is equivalent to the original instance but has a size that is bounded by a function in the parameter.

FPT is closed under a parameterised notion of reductions called fpt-reductions. Such reductions transform an instance formula_16 of some problem into an equivalent instance formula_17 of another problem (with formula_18) and can be computed in time formula_19 where formula_20 is a polynomial.

Obviously, FPT contains all polynomial-time computable problems. Moreover, it contains all optimisation problems in NP that allow an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS).

=== &quot;W&quot; hierarchy ===
The &quot;W&quot; hierarchy is a collection of computational complexity classes. A parameterized problem is in the class &quot;W&quot;[&quot;i&quot;], if every instance formula_21 can be transformed (in fpt-time) to a combinatorial circuit that has weft at most &quot;i&quot;, such that formula_22 if and only if there is a satisfying assignment to the inputs that assigns 1 to exactly &quot;k&quot; inputs. The weft is the largest number of logical units with fan-in greater than two on any path from an input to the output. The total number of logical units on the paths (known as depth) must be limited by a constant that holds for all instances of the problem.

Note that formula_23 and formula_24 for all formula_25. The classes in the &quot;W&quot; hierarchy are also closed under fpt-reduction.

A complete problem for &quot;W&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] is Weighted &quot;i&quot;-Normalized Satisfiability: given a Boolean formula written as an AND of ORs of ANDs of ... of possibly negated variables, with formula_26 layers of ANDs or ORs (and &quot;i&quot; alternations between AND and OR), can it be satisfied by setting exactly &quot;k&quot; variables to 1?

Many natural computational problems occupy the lower levels, &quot;W&quot;[1] and &quot;W&quot;[2].

==== &quot;W&quot;[1] ====
Examples of &quot;W&quot;[1]-complete problems include
* deciding if a given graph contains a clique of size &quot;k&quot;
* deciding if a given graph contains an independent set of size &quot;k&quot;
* deciding if a given nondeterministic single-tape Turing machine accepts within &quot;k&quot; steps (&quot;short Turing machine acceptance&quot; problem). This also applies to nondeterministic Turing machines with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) tapes and even &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)-dimensional tapes, but even with this extension, the restriction to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) tape alphabet size is fixed-parameter tractable. Crucially, the branching of the Turing machine at each step is allowed to depend on &quot;n&quot;, the size of the input. In this way, the Turing machine may explore &quot;n&quot;O(&quot;k&quot;) computation paths.

==== &quot;W&quot;[2] ====
Examples of &quot;W&quot;[2]-complete problems include
* deciding if a given graph contains a dominating set of size &quot;k&quot;
* deciding if a given nondeterministic multi-tape Turing machine accepts within &quot;k&quot; steps (&quot;short multi-tape Turing machine acceptance&quot; problem). Crucially, the branching is allowed to depend on &quot;n&quot; (like the W[1] variant), as is the number of tapes. An alternate &quot;W&quot;[2]-complete formulation allows only single-tape Turing machines, but the alphabet size may depend on &quot;n&quot;.

==== &quot;W&quot;[&quot;t&quot;] ====
formula_27 can be defined using the family of Weighted Weft--Depth- SAT problems for formula_28:
formula_29 is the class of parameterized problems that fpt-reduce to this problem, and formula_30.

Here, Weighted Weft--Depth- SAT is the following problem:

* Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most and weft at most , and a number . The &quot;depth&quot; is the maximal number of gates on any path from the root to a leaf, and the &quot;weft&quot; is the maximal number of gates &quot;of fan-in at least three&quot; on any path from the root to a leaf.
* Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight exactly ?

It can be shown that for formula_31 the problem Weighted -Normalize SAT is complete for formula_27 under fpt-reductions.
Here, Weighted -Normalize SAT is the following problem:

* Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most with an AND-gate on top, and a number .
* Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight exactly ?

==== &quot;W&quot;[&quot;P&quot;] ====
&quot;W&quot;[&quot;P&quot;] is the class of problems that can be decided by a nondeterministic formula_33-time Turing machine that makes at most formula_34 nondeterministic choices in the computation on formula_16 (a &quot;k&quot;-restricted Turing machine). 

It is known that FPT is contained in W[P], and the inclusion is believed to be strict. However, resolving this issue would imply a solution to the P versus NP problem.

Other connections to unparameterised computational complexity are that FPT equals &quot;W&quot;[&quot;P&quot;] if and only if circuit satisfiability can be decided in time formula_36, or if and only if there is a computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function f such that all languages recognised by a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine using nondeterministic choices are in &quot;P&quot;.

&quot;W&quot;[&quot;P&quot;] can be loosely thought of as the class of problems where we have a set of items, and we want to find a subset formula_37 of size such that a certain property holds. We can encode a choice as a list of integers, stored in binary. Since the highest any of these numbers can be is , formula_38 bits are needed for each number. Therefore formula_39 total bits are needed to encode a choice. Therefore we can select a subset formula_40 with formula_41 nondeterministic choices.

=== XP ===
XP is the class of parameterized problems that can be solved in time formula_42 for some computable function . These problems are called slicewise polynomial, in the sense that each &quot;slice&quot; of fixed k has a polynomial algorithm, although possibly with a different exponent for each k. Compare this with FPT, which merely allows a different constant prefactor for each value of k. XP contains FPT, and it is known that this containment is strict by diagonalization.

=== para-NP ===
para-NP is the class of parameterized problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic algorithm in time formula_4 for some computable function . It is known that formula_44 if and only if formula_45.

A problem is para-NP-hard if it is formula_46-hard already for a constant value of the parameter. That is, there is a &quot;slice&quot; of fixed that is formula_46-hard. A parameterized problem that is formula_48-hard cannot belong to the class formula_49, unless formula_45. A classic example of a formula_48-hard parameterized problem is graph coloring, parameterized by the number of colors, which is already formula_46-hard for formula_14 (see Graph coloring#Computational complexity).

=== A hierarchy ===
The A hierarchy is a collection of computational complexity classes similar to the W hierarchy. However, while the W hierarchy is a hierarchy contained in NP, the A hierarchy more closely mimics the polynomial-time hierarchy from classical complexity. It is known that A[1] = W[1] holds.

<doc id="603032" wikidata="Q11325297" url="?curid=603032" title="Negative option billing">
<text>Negative option billing is a business practice in which customers are given goods or services that were not previously ordered, and must either continue to pay for the service or specifically decline it in advance of billing.

This is, for example, the model on which mail order services, such as Columbia House, and other book clubs are structured.

==US law==
According to the Federal Trade Commission, unsolicited goods are considered a gift, and the recipient is not required to pay for or return them.

This is different than situations where a customer signs up for a service or club without reading fine print and agrees to purchase goods through the mail.

A notable example is the class-action lawsuit against Scholastic Corporation by consumers who felt &quot;harassed, deceived, intimidated, and threatened&quot; when they tried to cancel membership.

==Canadian law==
In Canada, Parliament attempted to outlaw the practice in 1996 after a public outcry the previous year when most cable television companies added a package of new specialty services to their lineups in this manner without customers signing up for the package. This had previously been the standard manner of adding new channels to cable television service, but had not previously attracted the type of controversy that was raised by the 1995 channel launch, in part because the 1995 launch entailed a large number of channels which launched concurrently, whereas previous additions had only involved one or two channels at a time.

MP Roger Gallaway introduced a private-member&#x27;s bill in 1996 to ban the practice which passed first reading, but died on the order paper when the House was dissolved for the 1997 elections. It was raised again in 1999, and was passed. Michael Janigan of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre stated:

The concern associated with the practice of negative option billing has its origins in the nature of a contract of purchase and sale, as recognized in common law. As every first year law student learns, such a contract consists of an offer and an acceptance. The history of consumer protection statutes is a chronicle of legislators attempting to ensure that the offer is conveyed without misrepresentation by the vendor to a purchaser who has an opportunity to make an informed choice to accept or refuse the offer. This is because a contract that is made with a consumer who is unaware of key elements of the contract such as price, quantity and quality of the goods to be delivered is subversive of the efficiency of the market as a whole.
The Ontario government also outlawed the practice in July 2005. Ontario&#x27;s regulations prohibiting negative option billing do not protect consumers from owing for goods or services that they have agreed to receive. Additionally, Alberta has outlawed negative billing in 1998.

==UK law==
In the UK the law which applies is &quot;The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000&quot; (2000 No. 2334), specifically section 24 &quot;Inertia Selling&quot;. (This effectively replaces the repealed s.1 of the &quot;Unsolicited Goods and Services Act&quot; (1971, as amended).) In summary:
(2) The recipient [of unsolicited goods] may, as between himself and the sender, use, deal with or dispose of the goods as if they were an unconditional gift to him.

(3) The rights of the sender to the goods are extinguished.

==History==
The original township of Marmora was named in 1820 for the Latin word for marble, while the adjoining Township of Lake was named for Viscount Gerard Lake. The two townships were joined to form the single municipality of Marmora and Lake in 2001. The village of Marmora separated from the township and was incorporated as a separate municipality in 1901.

Mining played an important role in the development of the area. Iron mining was particularly important in the area. Other minerals extracted from township mines include copper, lead, silver, gold and lithographic limestone. Today, talc and dolomite are processed in the municipality at the site of the former Bethlehem Steel Corporation iron ore open pit mine.

In 1998, the township expanded through an amalgamation of the Village of Deloro.

The current municipality was formed in 2001 through an amalgamation of the Village of Marmora and the existing Township of Marmora and Lake.

<doc id="603034" wikidata="Q233603" url="?curid=603034" title="Carlota Joaquina of Spain">
<text>Doña Carlota Joaquina Teresa Cayetana of Spain (25 April 1775 – 7 January 1830) was Queen of Portugal and Brazil as the wife of King Dom John VI. She was the daughter of King Don Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma.
Detested by the Portuguese court — where she was called &quot;the Shrew of Queluz&quot; () — Carlota Joaquina gradually won the antipathy of the people, who accused her of promiscuity and influencing her husband in favor of the interests of the Spanish crown. After the escape of the Portuguese court to Brazil, she began conspiring against her husband, claiming that he had no mental capacity to govern Portugal and its possessions, thus wanting to establish a regency. She also planned to usurp the Spanish crown that was in the hands of Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Bonaparte.
After the marriage in 1817 of her son Pedro with the Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and the later return of the royal family to Portugal in 1821, Carlota Joaquina supported her son Miguel in his intrigues to gain the throne, but their relationship deteriorated and she ended up being confined in the Royal Palace of Queluz, where she died alone and abandoned by her children and political allies on 7 January, 1830.

==Life==
===Childhood===

Born in the Royal Palace of Aranjuez on 25 April 1775 as the second (but eldest surviving) child of Charles, Prince of Asturias, and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma, she was baptized with the names of Carlota Joaquina Teresa Cayetana, but she was called only by her first name, Carlota, a name that honored both her father and paternal grandfather, King Charles III of Spain—Carlota was his favorite granddaughter. Despite the rigidity of her education and court etiquette, the Infanta was described as mischievous and playful.

She received a rigid and deeply Catholic education, with bases in the fields of study of religion, geography, painting, and riding (Carlota&#x27;s favorite sport). The closed and austere temperament of the Spanish monarchy imposed on the family and on the whole court rigid norms of behavior and etiquette. King Charles III, a man of reserved behavior, devoted more time to his family than to the animations of the courtesan life, where his daughter-in-law Maria Luisa took an active part. Carlota&#x27;s mother soon assumed the organization of entertainments at court, with luxurious parties, where morals were easily forgotten. Soon the Princess of Asturias&#x27; image would be linked to that of a promiscuous woman who betrayed her husband to other men. Among them, possibly, was the Prime Minister Manuel Godoy, whose alleged love affair was widely explored by the press at the time. Not even the successive pregnancies and long-hoped birth of a living male heir to the throne in 1784 saved Maria Luísa from the contempt of the population. She would go down in history as one of the most unpopular queens in Spain and her bad reputation deeply affected her children, especially Carlota, the firstborn daughter.

===Marriage===

The subject of Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s marriage was arranged by both King Charles III and his sister Mariana Victoria, Dowager Queen of Portugal, in the late 1770s when Mariana went to Spain to encourage diplomatic relations between the estranged countries. Carlota Joaquina was to marry Infante John, Duke of Beja (youngest grandson of Mariana Victoria), and Infante Gabriel of Spain (Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s paternal uncle) was to marry Infanta Mariana Vitória of Portugal (only surviving granddaughter and namesake of the Dowager Queen of Portugal).

Carlota&#x27;s apprenticeship would be tested when she underwent a series of public examinations in front of the Spanish court and Portuguese ambassadors sent on behalf of Queen Maria I of Portugal to evaluate the qualities of the princess destined to marry her second son. In October 1785, the Gazeta of Lisbon published an account of the tests:

Having proven the talent of the bride, there was therefore no impediment to the union with the Portuguese prince, so on 8 May 1785 was celebrated the proxy marriage; three days later, on 11 May, the 10-year-old Carlota Joaquina and her retinue left Spain for Lisbon. On the day she left the Spanish court, Carlota Joaquina asked her mother to make a painting of her in a red dress to place on the wall, instead of the painting of Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain (which Carlota Joaquina claimed to be more beautiful). As a part of the infanta cortege were Father Felipe Scio, famous Spanish theologian and scholar, Emília O&#x27;Dempsy, as lady-in-waiting, and Anna Miquelina, personal maid of Carlota Joaquina. The official wedding ceremony between Infante John of Portugal and Carlota Joaquina took place on 9 June 1785; she was only 10 years old while her husband was 18. Due to the bride&#x27;s young age, the consummation of the union was delayed until 9 January 1790, when Carlota Joaquina was then able to conceive and bear children.

===Life in the Portuguese court===

Nevertheless, the climate in the Bragança court differed in many respects from that of the cheerful Spanish court. While in other parts of the Europe they represented the mark of a new society based on the Age of Enlightenment principles, in Portugal the Catholic Church still imposed norms prohibiting all types of amusement. The dramatization of comedies was banned, including the performance of dances and parties. The reign of Queen Maria I was marked by the rise of a conservative group of the nobility and clergy of Portugal; an extremely &quot;boredom&quot; environment, as defined by Dowager Queen Mariana Victoria (Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s great-aunt). In this way, Carlota Joaquina found herself in the midst of a very religious and austere environment, in contrast to the extravagance and the faust to which she was accustomed. Despite this, her relationship with her mother-in-law was very tender, as the letters exchanged between them proved. The joy and vivacity of Carlota were responsible for the rare hours of relaxation of the Queen.

Her more liberal habits and customs differed in many ways from that of other women at court. Quite traditional in relation to female behavior, Portuguese men disapproved of the ease with which Carlota Joaquina transited in public space, her performance in the political field and her distemper in the family routine. Since most Portuguese women were deprived of social life, Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s offending behavior allowed some malicious rumors about her in the court. Some of them were prejudiced, like the Duchess of Abrantès, wife of the French General Junot, who later invaded Portugal. During her time in Lisbon, Madame Junot had ridiculed Carlota Joaquina both for her manner of acting and for her dressing, and she had vilified her as an extremely ugly woman.

===Princess of Brazil===

In 1788, when his eldest brother Joseph, Prince of Brazil died, Infante John became the first in line to his mother&#x27;s throne. Soon he received the titles Prince of Brazil and 15th Duke of Braganza. Between 1788 and 1816, Carlota Joaquina was known as Princess of Brazil as the wife of the heir-apparent of the Portuguese throne. Some scholars believe that her disdain for Brazil led to behaviors that alienated her from both the people and her husband.

His religious observances bored her, and their personalities were quite incompatible. Nevertheless, she gave birth to nine children during their marriage and, because they were all handsome, it was rumoured that especially the younger ones had a different father. 

After Queen Maria I was declared insane in 1792, Prince John took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799. This change in events suited Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s ambitious and sometimes malevolent nature. In the Portuguese court she would interfere frequently in matters of state, trying to influence the decisions of her husband; these attempts to meddle in politics displeased the Portuguese nobility and even the population.

Because she was often excluded from government decisions, Carlota Joaquina organized a plot with the intention to take the reins of power from the Prince Regent. She had him arrested, declaring that, like his mother, he was incapable of rule.

However, in 1805 this plot was discovered. Count of Vila Verde proposed the opening of an investigation and the arrest of all those involved, but Carlota Joaquina was saved because her husband, wishing to avoid a public scandal, opposed her arrest, preferring to confine his wife to Queluz Palace and Ramalhão Palace, while he himself moved to Mafra Palace, effectively separating from her. At that time Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s enemies claimed that she had bought a retreat where she indulged in sexual orgies.

== In Brazil ==
In 1807, the Portuguese royal family left Portugal for Brazil because of the Napoleonic invasion.

While in Brazil, Carlota Joaquina made attempts to obtain the administration of the Spanish dominions in Hispanic America, a project known as Carlotism. Spain itself was controlled by Napoleon and its kings, her father and brother Ferdinand, were held by Napoleon in France. Carlota Joaquina regarded herself as the heiress of her captured family. Allegedly among her plans was to send armies to occupy Buenos Aires and northern Argentina to style herself &quot;Queen of La Plata&quot;. The Portuguese-Brazilian forces, however, only managed to temporarily annex the eastern banks of the Rio de la Plata as Cisplatina, which were kept in the Empire of Brazil after 1822 and seceded in 1828 as the Republic of Uruguay.

== Queen ==

When the Portuguese royal family returned to Portugal in 1821 after an absence of 14 years, Carlota Joaquina met a country that had changed much since their departure. In 1807, Portugal had lived stably under absolutism. Napoleonic troops and political attitudes fostered by Spain&#x27;s Cortes of Cádiz had brought revolutionary ideas to Portugal. In 1820, a liberal revolution commenced in Porto. A constitutional Cortes Gerais had been promulgated, and in 1821 it gave Portugal its first constitution. The queen had arch-conservative positions and wanted a reactionary response in Portugal. Her husband, however, did not want to renege on his vows to uphold the constitution. Carlota Joaquina made an alliance with her youngest son Miguel, who shared his mother&#x27;s conservative views. In 1824, using Miguel&#x27;s position as army commander, they took power and held the king a virtual prisoner in the palace, where the queen tried to make him abdicate in favor of Miguel. The king received British help against his wife and son and regained power, finally compelling his son to leave the country. The queen had also to go briefly into exile.

King John VI lived in Bemposta Palace and Queen Carlota Joaquina in Queluz. Though she lived there quietly, she became decidedly eccentric in dress and behaviour. However, their eldest son Pedro, left behind as regent in Brazil, was proclaimed and crowned on 1 December 1822 as its independent Emperor. John VI refused to accept this until he was persuaded by the British to do so, signing in August 1825 the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro by which he and Carlota Joaquina were granted the honorific title of Emperors of Brasil. He died in March 1826. Claiming ill-health, Carlota Joaquina refused to visit his deathbed and started the rumour that her husband had been poisoned (which was probably true) by the Freemasons (which likely was not).

Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, now became King of Portugal as well, but knowing that carrying out the duties of both positions would be impossible, Pedro abdicated in Portugal and made his eldest daughter Maria the Queen of Portugal as well as betrothing her to Miguel, his younger brother. In the meantime, Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s daughter, the Infanta Isabel Maria was to be Regent in Portugal instead of Carlota Joaquina, who ordinarily would have held such a post as Queen Dowager. About two years later the little queen set out for Portugal, only to find upon arrival at Gibraltar that her uncle and fiancé had not only removed the regent, but declared himself King of Portugal.

Despite faithfully supporting her favourite son Miguel in his intrigues to usurp the throne, their relationship gradually deteriorated and she lost all her political influence, ending up being banished from the court again, taking up residence at the Queluz Palace, where she lived eccentrically and tried in vain to regain her lost power. Abandoned by all her family and betrayed by her friends and allies, Queen Carlota Joaquina died alone at the Queluz Royal Palace, outside of Sintra. It is speculated whether she died because of natural causes or whether she, in fact, killed herself.

==Issue==

Carlota Joaquina married King João VI of Portugal in 1785 and had nine children.
==Carlota in film and television==
After her death, Carlota Joaquina (mainly in Brazil) became part of popular culture and an important historical figure, being the subject of several books, films and other media.

* &quot;Carlota Joaquina, Princess of Brazil&quot; (1994) – Feature film directed by Carla Camurati, tells a summarized tale, mixing history with legend, of the Princess&#x27;s life, from her childhood until her (mythical) suicide. Marieta Severo plays adult Carlota, while Ludmila Dayer portrays her as a child.
* &quot;O Quinto dos Infernos&quot; (2003) – Betty Lago portrays Carlota in this television miniseries produced by Rede Globo, telling the story of how the Portuguese Royal Family escaped to Brazil.
* &quot;Liberdade, Liberdade&quot; (2016) - Susana Ribeiro portrays Carlota in this Globo telenovela that eventually features the Portuguese Royal family going to Brazil.
* &quot;Novo Mundo&quot; (2017) - Débora Olivieri portrays Carlota in this Globo telenovela set in 1817 Brazil.

<doc id="603046" wikidata="Q1139986" url="?curid=603046" title="Peugeot 309">
<text>The Peugeot 309 is a small family car that was manufactured between 1985 and 1994 in France, England and Spain by PSA Peugeot Citroën. It was originally intended to be badged as a Talbot and, as development progressed, to be called the Talbot Arizona.

It was the replacement for the Talbot Horizon, which had started life as a Chrysler in Britain and a Simca in France, and was also being built in several guises for the market in America. In 1985, the PSA Group decided to discontinue the Talbot brand, with the last passenger vehicle branded as a Talbot to be launched being the Samba of 1981, and to market the car as a Peugeot instead.

The Talbot brand was phased out completely when Talbot Express production stopped in 1994.

== History ==

The 309 had been conceived as &quot;Projet C28&quot; as a replacement for the Talbot Horizon, and as a result its development had been performed by the former Chrysler/Simca wing of PSA. Styling was the responsibility of the former Chrysler-Rootes design studios in Coventry, whilst much of the engineering was done at the Simca site at Poissy in France.

The only stipulation from PSA management was that the new car had to use as much existing architecture as possible; hence the use of a stretched Peugeot 205 floorpan and door shells, whilst the Simca engines and transmissions from the Horizon were also carried over.
The 309&#x27;s design was presaged by the 1982 Peugeot VERA Plus (followed by the VERA Profil in 1985), which were aerodynamic studies developed by Peugeot at the time. The VERA Plus claimed a Cw of only 0.22. Many of the aerodynamic features from the VERA studies found their way into later production Peugeots.

Production in France began at the former Simca plant in Poissy in the end of summer 1985, with the first French customers getting their cars in October of that year; but it was decided that RHD models would be built at the Ryton plant near Coventry, which had previously been owned by the Rootes Group and then Chrysler Europe before Peugeot took it over in 1978.

The first 309 for the British market rolled off the production line at Ryton in October 1985, and sales began the beginning of 1986, although left-hand drive sales of the Poissy built models began in France in October 1985. The only bodywork available originally was the five-door hatchback.

The 309 was not intended to replace Peugeot&#x27;s own model, the 305, but the out of step model number (the next small family car after the 305 should have been named &quot;306&quot; which eventually launched in 1993) was intended to distance it from the larger 305 in the marketplace and to reflect the car&#x27;s Simca origins. It was also the first Peugeot badged hatchback of this size. With the Talbot brand being phased out on passenger cars, the 309 would succeed the Talbot Horizon. Peugeot had been considering a new Talbot Samba based on the forthcoming Citroën AX supermini, but the success of the Peugeot 205 meant that there was little need for a third supermini within the PSA combine, and so the Samba was discontinued in 1986 with no replacement. The larger Alpine hatchback and Solara saloons were also axed in 1986, a year before Peugeot began production of the similar sized 405, successor to the 305.

The 309&#x27;s slightly awkward styling (especially when compared with the 205 and 405 of the same era) was due to the decision to reuse the door shells from the 205. The 309 was also originally intended to be differentiated from Peugeot as a Talbot, and was designed &quot;inhouse&quot;. Other Peugeot cars of the time were designed by the famed Italian design house Pininfarina, up until the introduction of the 206 in 1998. The notched hatchback design, commonly called as a liftback design, bears an unintentional similarity to the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance, which were also developed (entirely separately and cut down from a larger [Chrysler K-Car] platform rather than stretched from a smaller one) to replace the Horizon in North America.

The initial engine line up in the United Kingdom market consisted of the chain driven Simca derived 1118 cc (E1A) and 1294 cc (G1A) overhead valve petrol units from the Horizon, and Peugeot provided 1580/1905 cc petrol belt driven overhead camshaft XU units. Spanish-built cars also used the 1442 cc (Y2) and 1592 cc (J2) &quot;Poissy engine&quot;, as seen previously in the Simca 1307 and Solara as well as the Horizon, instead of the 1580 cc OHC.

In July 1986 the first diesels arrived, the 1905 cc, PSA XUD engined GLD, GRD, followed by the SRD in 1987. Certain export markets also received a 1769-cc version of this engine from the beginning. In France, the smaller diesel option only arrived in 1992. With 305 sales dropping considerably, the 309 range was expanded considerably in February 1987, when the three-door bodystyle was added. In line with Peugeot&#x27;s naming policy of the time, five-door models generally have equipment levels beginning with the letter G, while three-doors begin with the letter X. Other important new models was the XU 1905 cc-engined high performance GTi version of the 309 using the same 1905 cc XU9 engine as found in the 205 GTi. Other new versions in 1987 were the new Automatic (only with five doors) and the XA and XAD two-seater vans which arrived in February.

The 309 was also significant in that it was the first Peugeot car to be assembled in the former Rootes factory in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, which Peugeot had inherited with its buyout of Chrysler Europe in 1978. Largely due to its partially British origins, the Peugeot 309 became a popular choice in the United Kingdom, and in 1987, it was joined on the production line by the larger 405. The 309&#x27;s successor, the 306, was also built at Ryton, as was the 206, which was the last vehicle in production there when the plant closed in December 2006. As of September 2022, 41 Peugeot 309 GTis remained on the roads in the United Kingdom, with another 313 registered being kept off the road as SORN.

== Facelift (Phase 2) ==
The summer of 1989 saw the introduction of the Phase 2 Peugeot 309. It revised the design of the rear, lowering the boot lip, changing the rear lights to a more &#x27;smoked style&#x27; and making slight alterations to the front radiator grille.

Also, an updated interior was required to address severe criticisms leveled at the Phase 1&#x27;s, Talbot-designed multi-piece dashboard which was prone to developing squeaks and rattles. The GTi models received a colour-coded, one-piece rear spoiler as opposed to the Phase 1&#x27;s outdated rubber spoiler which, by then, harked back to early 1980s design practice.

Quite importantly a modified gearbox called &#x27;BE3&#x27; was introduced, a revision of the original &#x27;BE1&#x27; unit, placing reverse in the &quot;down and to the right&quot; position behind fifth gear, as opposed to the earlier &quot;up and to the left&quot; position next to first gear. Retrospectively, the &#x27;BE3&#x27; gearboxes are slightly less prone to failure than their earlier counterparts.

This was also when Peugeot gradually phased in their, all new, belt driven TU Series overhead camshaft engines, in 1,124 cc and 1,360 cc forms, eventually replacing the trusty Simca units during 1992. The GTi 16 model, featuring the XU9J4 engine from the 405 Mi16, was also introduced at this time; however, these were only sold in mainland Europe. (See Trim levels)

=== End of production ===
Towards the end of 1992, production of the 309 began to wind down in anticipation for the launch of the new Peugeot 306, returning Peugeot to their normal numbering scheme. In July 1993, the 309 lineup was severely reduced and only the two Vital (petrol or diesel) models remained on sale until December. In total, 1,635,132 Peugeot 309s were built between 1985 and 1993. 18,262 of these were the GTi model, and 5,896 were GTi 16.

As of 2018, only 481 Peugeot 309s remained on the roads in the United Kingdom, with another 1,378 registered being kept off the road as SORN.

=== India===
India&#x27;s Premier Automobiles Limited (PAL) began local assembly of the long mothballed 309 in 1995, only with five-door bodywork. Originally available only as a petrol-engined GL model powered by the TU3 engine, waitlisted buyers for the GL received the option to choose a diesel engine (GLD) instead, beginning in 1997. Rather than the XUD engines used in Europe, however, Indian-built 309 diesels received the much smaller 1527-cc TUD5 engine with ; an engine also used by Maruti Udyog. Labour and servicing issues were hindering the car in the marketplace, and after Premier formed a second joint venture with Fiat, Peugeot announced the end of their partnership with PAL in November 1997 with sales of the 309 continuing into 1998.

== Trim levels ==

* XE, GE: 1118cc E1A or 1294cc G1A OHV Simca engine, X with three doors and G with five doors. The 1118 cc engine came with a four speed gearbox, whilst the 1294 cc came with a five speed gearbox. Standard equipment was sparse, featuring a rear bench seat, heated rear window, small wheel centre wheel covers, as well as a flick wipe facility. Options included a rear wash/wipe, side bump strips on the doors, and a pop up sunroof.

Many special editions were based on the X/GE, such as the Sport model, which came with a spoiler and side decals; and also the Sunseeker model, which came with a pop up sunroof, and side decals. In some markets a diesel E model was also available, using the 1905 cc XUD engine. All diesel models carry the D suffix on the model badge (XLD, GLD).

The Special Equipment model available in the United Kingdom in 1989 also added a pop up sunroof and a rear wash/wipe to the standard equipment list. The E designation was replaced by the Style designation, which began as a special edition in 1987, but became a part of the range from 1988, to denote the base model, in line with other contemporary Peugeot models of the time (e.g. the Peugeot 205 Style and the Peugeot 405 Style). The Style was also available with the 1124 cc and 1360 cc TU and 1905 cc XUD (Style D) engines, all with five speed gearboxes, after the Simca units were phased out.

* XL, GL: 1294 cc G1A, 1580 cc XU5, and 1905 cc XUD engines (with D suffix), all with five speed gearboxes, X with three doors and G with 5. The L model was available throughout the 309&#x27;s production, varying differently from early to late cars. The early cars came with some standard features, such as better seat coverings than the E model, a clock on the dashboard, door bump strips, intermittent wipe, a glovebox door (as opposed to the X/GE&#x27;s glovebox hole), 50/50 split/fold rear seats, full size wheel covers and a rear wash/wipe.

A three speed automatic option was available with the XU5 engined GL. Later in the production run, the XL model was dropped, and a 1769 cc XUD turbo diesel engine was added to the L range, to become GLDTurbo, which featured alloy wheels (from the Peugeot 205 1.6 GTI), uprated GTI specification suspension, and a pair of front fog lights. Options on this also included central locking, electric front windows and the Peugeot vacuum operated moonroof, essentially a large glass sliding sunroof.

* GLX: 1294 cc G1A, 1360 cc TU3, and 1580 cc XU5 engines, all with five speed gearboxes and all with five doors. Standard equipment includes a digital clock, a tachometer, a sliding glass moonroof, sports style seats (similar to those fitted to the 205 XS), rear wash/wipe, door bump strips, intermittent wipe, and a small boot spoiler. The 1.6 model also added central locking and front electric windows to the list.

Post facelift 1.3 models and the 1.4 model also have central locking. Curiously, if the GLX was ordered in white, and later burgundy red, the bumpers were body coloured, with a contrasting trim strip, red with the white bumpers and silver with the burgundy ones. After the facelift the bumpers also gained a pair of fog lights. A reflective strip panel was also on the options list, that replaced the louvred panel that sits between the rear lights.

* GR Profile: 1294cc G1A, five doors. Intended as competition for such cars as the Austin Maestro HLE, the GR Profile used exactly the same G1A engine as the lower models in the range, but combined it with subtle aerodynamic improvements and lower rolling resistance tyres to reduce the drag coefficient of the car, with the brochure claiming a fuel economy improvement of three miles per gallon at a constant . The standard equipment list included an instrument lighting rheostat, a digital clock, an engine compartment undershield, a glovebox lamp, a carpeted boot and a boot light. Options included metallic paint, central locking, and electric windows. It was discontinued sometime in 1988, at about the time of the introduction of the GLX.
* XR, GR: 1580cc XU5, and 1905cc XUD engines, XR three door, GR five door. Much the same as the GR Profile in specification, with much the same standard features, and options. Was available later with the fuel injected XU5 engine, and also a detuned version, badged GRi, to address the problems Peugeot had with the XU engine and 95 octane fuels. Later in the run, a 1769 cc XUD turbo diesel model was also added, to become the GRDTurbo. This came with all the features as the GLDTurbo, and also added the features on the options list as standard. The XR was unavailable in the United Kingdom.

The 309 Automatic received equipment about on par with the GR, and was available with either the 1.6-liter XU5 or later with a lower-tuned, catalyzed 1.9-liter XU9J1 engine with . Specifications varied somewhat depending on the market.
* SR, SRD, SR Injection: 1580 cc XU5, and 1905 cc XUD engines, all with five doors. The SR model was intended to top the range, along with the GR. The SR used the tune single carb XU5, the SRD used the XUD9, and the SR Injection used the XU5 from the 205 GTI 1.6. Equipment levels as standard were much the same as the GR, with the addition of central locking, internally adjustable headlights, a map reading light, electric windows in the front, Windsor velour seat trim and fibre-optic dashboard dials.

The SR Injection, in addition, added alloy wheels, remote controlled central locking, and remote controlled heated door mirrors. The options list included metallic/black paint, front fog lights, a sliding glass sunroof, an automatic gearbox (SR only), and SR decals on the rear flanks. These were only built in Phase 1 guise and many enthusiasts say that the SR was a better balanced car to drive than the GTI. However, not many SRs remain.

* XS and SX: 1580cc XU5, three door version was designated XS and the five door version SX. Marketed as a sporty model, to complement the GTI, with the XU5 injection engine. Was a little more basic than the SR models, to enhance the sporty feel, and made do without such things as luxury seats, instead having the tweed sports seats from the Peugeot 205 XS. In some markets, such as Sweden and Switzerland, the XS was fitted with the XU9M, a lower tuned version of the GTi&#x27;s 1.9-liter engine producing .

It also came with opening rear windows (three door), a digital clock, a black spoiler (painted spoiler from the GTI after the facelift), driving lamps and a load area lamp. Options included alloy wheels, central locking/electric windows (only available as a twinned options pack), a sliding glass sunroof and front fog lights. The 309 XS is now very rare in the United Kingdom. The SX model was not available in the United Kingdom.
* GTI: 1905 cc XU9, three or five doors. Introduced in February 1987 in three-door form, the five-door variant arrived shortly thereafter. Arguably the top of the range, fitted with the 1905 cc XU9 engine, producing . In some markets a catalyzed engine producing was sold instead, to conform with 95 octane unleaded and emissions regulations. The non-catalyzed model was discontinued for all markets in 1992.

The GTI came with some features unique to the range, such as the large black boot spoiler, driving lights and fog lights in the front bumper, remote opening rear windows (three-door only), and the Speedline 1.9 GTI alloys - the 309 being the first car to be fitted with them. Also benefitted from uprated suspension, tinted glass, a deep front airdam, a leather steering wheel and internally adjustable headlights. Items on the options list included central locking/electric windows (as part of a twinned options pack), a sliding glass sunroof, and metallic/black paint.

* GTI 16, A late, July 1989 addition to the range and only produced for a limited period. It featured the , 16V 1.9-litre alloy XU9J4 engine from the 405 Mi16/Citroën BX 16V. It also included slightly uprated suspension (stiffer rear torsion bars, and wider track width both front and rear). The GTI 16 was produced in LHD only as right-hand drive would have required modifications to allow the master cylinder to clear the exhaust header. With UK sales of the eight-valve 309 GTI running at only around 1,000 per year (one tenth of 205 GTi sales), Peugeot UK chose not to import it. The very high power-to-weight ratio (160 PS / 975 kg) resulted in a highly responsive drive, even by modern standards. The catalyzed version produces ; the non-catalyzed version was no longer built for 1993.

* XA, XAD, three-door van models with minimal equipment and no rear seats. These were introduced in February 1987. The XA originally received the 1,118 or 1,294 cc Simca petrol engines with , while the XAD received the typical 1,905 cc engine with . After the 1989 &quot;Phase 2&quot; facelift, the petrol engines were replaced by the , 1,124 cc TU-series engine.

Some notable limited edition models included:

The Zest/Zest D and the Trio/Trio D editions, with 1124/1360 cc TU engines and 1905 cc XUD engines, with unique seat fabric, green seatbelts and side decals down both flanks.

The Look, available in blue, white, and very scarce black were fitted with unique seat fabric with a sunroof and coloured bumper inserts.

The Green, produced between 1987 and 1991, available in 3/5 doors versions, with the unique &quot;&quot;Blanc Meije&quot; color, white wheel hubs, sunroof, unique decals and &quot;Green&quot;&quot; logo in the back, green seatbelts and interior fabric, tinted windows, rear windshield wiper, painted bumpers with a unique green stripe.

The Goodwood, Limited Edition for the United Kingdom was a GTI with full black leather interior as standard, and no cost optional wooden steering wheel, gearknob and CD Autochanger. The 309 Goodwood was only available in limited numbers for the United Kingdom (only 398 vehicles were constructed) in metallic pinewood green with anthracite Speedline alloy wheels, with a polished metal lip on the outer rim and badging depicting the Goodwood racing circuit on the front wings, tailgate and steering wheel boss. When the Goodwood was launched, the high asking price resulted in some examples not finding homes until 1994, hence some being registered on an &#x27;L&#x27; prefix registration.

<text>Acharnes, also known as Menidi is a municipality in the East Attica regional unit in Greece. With 108,169 inhabitants (2021 census), it is the ninth most populous municipality in Greece. It lies just north of the Athens urban area.

==Geography==

The northern part of the municipality is covered by the forested Parnitha mountain. The southern part is in the plain of Athens, and is densely populated. The built-up area of Acharnes, in this southern part of the municipality, is continuous with that of the adjacent suburbs to the west, east and south. The centre of Acharnes is due north of Athens city centre. The two other settlements in the municipality, Thrakomakedones and Varympompi, are situated further north, in the foothills of Parnitha. Acharnes is crossed by several important roads and railways, including the A6 motorway, the Piraeus–Platy railway and the Athens Airport–Patras railway. The Acharnes Railway Center is the main railway junction of Attica; two other stations in the municipality are Acharnes railway station and Kato Acharnes railway station, both on the Piraeus–Platy railway. Acharnes is home to the Folk Art Museum of Acharnes.

==History==

Acharnes has historically been an Arvanite settlement.

Acharnes was named after the &quot;deme&quot; Acharnae (), a subdivision of Athens in classical antiquity. The Athenian playwright Aristophanes characterised the inhabitants of Acharnae as peasants in his play &quot;The Acharnians&quot;. Acharnes suffered significant damage from the 1999 Athens earthquake, being very close to the epicenter.

==Municipality==
The municipality Acharnes was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Acharnes (incl. Varympompi and Parnis)
*Thrakomakedones

The municipality has an area of 149.956 km2, the municipal unit 146.406 km2.

==Historical population==

==Crime==
Acharnes is considered by some to be an unsafe place to live since it has an alleged high crime rate, usually involving drugs, theft and gang activity. There is also a small population of marginalized people such as Romani living in ghettos in Acharnes (approximately 4.800 people, about 4.5% of the population), that tend to be delinquents and offenders from an early age.

==Museums==
The Folk Art Museum of Acharnes is a museum in Acharnes, a northern suburb of Athens, Greece. It was founded in 1977 by the local Greek Mountaineering Society, which also formed the Historical and Folklore Association in 1981, to which it bequeathed the museum in 1982. The archaeological part of the collection was then separated from the historical and folklore material and was given to the Hellenic Ministry of Culture. Former Minister Melina Mercouri founded for it the Archaeological Museum of Acharnes in a neoclassical building in the central square of Acharnes, which had formerly housed the local Town Hall. The same building houses the Historical and Folklore Society and its Folk Art Museum to the present time.

<doc id="603054" wikidata="Q2897028" url="?curid=603054" title="Genesis Rabbah">
<text>Genesis Rabbah () is a religious text from Judaism&#x27;s classical period, probably written between 300 and 500 CE with some later additions. It is a midrash comprising a collection of ancient rabbinical homiletical interpretations of the Book of Genesis. 
It is an expository midrash to the first book of the Torah, assigned by tradition to the amora Hoshaiah Rabbah, who flourished in the third century in Roman-ruled Syria Palaestina. The midrash forms an aggadic commentary on Genesis, in keeping with the midrashic exegesis of that age. In a continuous sequence, broken only toward the end, the Biblical text is expounded, verse for verse, often word for word. Only genealogic passages and passages that furnish no material for exposition (as the reiterated account of Abraham&#x27;s servant in 24:35-48) are omitted.

==Simplicity==
Genesis Rabbah contains many simple explanations of words and sentences, often in Middle Aramaic, suitable for instructing youth. It also includes varied aggadic expositions popular in the public lectures of the synagogues and schools. The editor of the midrash has strung together various longer or shorter explanations and aggadic interpretations of the successive passages, sometimes anonymously, sometimes citing the author. The editor adds to the running commentary longer aggadic disquisitions or narratives, connected in some way with the verse in question or with one of the explanations of it—a method not unusual in the Talmud and other midrashim.

The first chapters of Genesis, on the creation of the world and man, furnished especially rich material for this mode of exegesis. Whole sections are devoted to comments on one or two text verses. Many references to contemporary philosophical thought are made to refute the opinions of nonbelievers. References to contemporaneous conditions and historical events also occur. It is characteristic of the midrash to view the personages and conditions of the Bible in the light of the contemporary history of the time.

Though the stories embraced in Genesis furnish little occasion for comments on legal topics, Genesis Rabbah contains a few short sentences and quotations taken from the Mishnah and other sources. This midrash is rich in sublime thoughts and finely worded sentences, parables, and foreign words, especially Greek.

==Form==
This extensive and important midrash forms a complete commentary on Genesis and exemplifies all points of midrashic exegesis. It is divided into sections headed by prefaces. It is by these means distinguished from the tannaitic midrashim to the other books of the Torah, such as the &quot;Mekhilta&quot;, &quot;Sifra&quot;, and &quot;Sifre&quot;. Every chapter of the Genesis Rabbah is headed by the first verse of the passage to be explained. With few exceptions, it is introduced by one or more prefatory remarks starting from a verse taken from another Biblical passage as text, generally from the Ketuvim. Through various explanations of these texts, a transition is made to the exposition of the particular verse of Genesis heading the section. There are about 230 of these passages in the Genesis Rabbah. About 70 are cited with the name of the Rabbi with whom they originated or whose explanation of the verse in question was used to introduce the section of the Genesis Rabbah.

==Introductory passages==
Most of these passages are anonymous and may perhaps be ascribed in part to the author of Genesis Rabbah. They begin with the verse of the text, which often stands at the head of the proem without any formula of introduction. The structure of the prefatory passages varies. In some, only the introductory text is given, its application to the verse of Genesis to be expounded being self-evident or being left to a later working out. The single prefaces, of which there is a large number, contain explanations of their text which refer entirely or in its last part to the verse or passage of Genesis to be expounded in that section. The composite introductions consist of different expositions of the same Biblical verse, by different aggadists, strung together in various ways, but always arranged so that the last exposition—the last link of the introduction—leads to the exposition of the passage of Genesis, with the first verse of which the introductions often close.

For these introductions, which are often quite lengthy, the material for the several expositions was ready at hand. The original work on these passages consisted principally in the combining and grouping of the several sentences and expositions into a coordinate whole, arranged so that the last member forms the actual introduction to the exposition of the section. Definitely characterized as they are in their beginning by these introductions, the sections of Genesis Rabbah have no formal ending, although several show a transition to the Biblical passage that is expounded in the following section.

==The principle of division==
In the manuscripts, as well as in the editions, the sections are consecutively numbered. Many quotations in the Shulchan Aruch mention the passage of Genesis Rabbah by the number of the section. The total number of the sections, both in the manuscripts and in the editions, varies from 97 to 101. Nearly all the manuscripts and editions agree in counting 96 chapters. The principle of division followed in the sections of Genesis Rabbah was evidently that of the Biblical text itself as fixed at the time of the compilation of this midrash, in accordance with the open and closed paragraphs (פתוחות and סתומות) in the Hebrew text of Genesis. There are separate sections in the midrash for almost all these sections as they are still found in Genesis, with the exception of the genealogical passages. But there are sections that bear evidences of relation to the Torah portions (&quot;sedarim&quot;) of the Palestinian triennial cycle, and a careful investigation of these may lead to the discovery of an arrangement of sedarim different from that heretofore known from old registers. However, there are sections, especially in the beginning of the midrash, in which only one or a few verses at a time are expounded. The Torah portions of the customary one-year cycle are not regarded at all in the divisions of Genesis Rabba, neither are they marked in the best manuscripts or in the editio princeps of the midrash; the sections, therefore, can not be regarded as mere subdivisions of the sedarim, as which they appear in later editions of this midrash.

==Material==
Far more difficult than any question concerning the outward form of Genesis Rabbah is that of deciding how much of its present contents is original material included in it, and how much of later addition. The sections formed the framework that was to contain the exposition of a number of Biblical verses in continuous succession.

But with the loose construction of the aggadic exegesis it became easy to string together, on every verse or part of a verse, a number of comments; or to add longer or shorter aggadic passages, stories, etc., connected in some way with the exposition of the text. This process of accretion took place quite spontaneously in Genesis Rabba, as in the other works of the Talmudic and midrashic literature. Between the beginning and the completion of these works—if ever they were completed—a long period elapsed during which there was much addition and collection.

The tradition that Rabbi Hosha&#x27;iah is the author of Genesis Rabbah may be taken to mean that he began the work, in the form of the running commentary customary in tannaitic times, arranging the exposition on Genesis according to the sequence of the verses, and furnishing the necessary complement to the tannaitic midrashim on the other books of the Torah. The ascription of the Mekilta to Rabbi Ishmael and of the Jerusalem Talmud to Rabbi Johanan rests on a similar procedure. Perhaps the comments on Genesis were originally divided into sections that corresponded with the above-mentioned sections of the text, and that contained the beginnings of the simplest introductions, as the first traces of such introductions are found also in the tannaitic midrash. But the embellishment of the sections with numerous artistic introductions—which points to a combination of the form of the running commentary with the form of the finished homilies following the type of the Pesikta and Tanhuma Midrashim—was the result of the editing of Genesis Rabbah that is now extant, when the material found in collections and traditions of the aggadic exegesis of the period of the Amoraim was taken up in the midrash, and Genesis Rabbah was given its present form, if not its present bulk. Perhaps the editor made use also of different collections on the several parts of Genesis. The present Genesis Rabbah shows a singular disproportion between the length of the first Torah portion and that of the eleven others. The Torah portion Bereishit alone comprises 29 sections, being more than one-fourth of the whole work. It is possible that the present Genesis Rabbah is a combination of two midrashim of unequal proportions, and that the 29 sections of the first Torah portion—several of which expound only one or a few verses—constitute the extant or incomplete material of a Genesis Rabbah that was laid out on a much larger and more comprehensive scale than the midrash to the other Torah portions.

==Origin of name==
The work may have received its name, &quot;Genesis Rabbah&quot;, from that larger midrash at the beginning of Genesis, unless that designation was originally used to distinguish this midrash from the shorter and older one, which was ascribed to Rabbi Hoshayah. The opinion that the name of the midrash finds its explanation in the first words, &quot;Rabbi Hosha&#x27;yah rabbah began ...&quot; as if the word &quot;rabbah&quot; belonged originally to the name of the amora, and that the name of the work, &quot;Genesis Rabba&quot;, is an abbreviation of &quot;Bereshit derabbi Hoshayah rabbah&quot;, is untenable for the reason that in the best manuscripts—and in a very old quotation—the name &quot;Rabbi Hoshayah&quot; stands without the addition &quot;rabbah&quot; in the first preface at the beginning of the midrash. It would be singular if the authorial designation had been lost and yet the attribute had remained in the title of the midrash.

==Date==
It is difficult to ascertain the exact date of the editing of Genesis Rabbah. It was probably undertaken not much later than the Jerusalem Talmud (4th to 5th centuries). But even then the text was probably not finally closed, for longer or shorter passages could always be added, the number of prefatory passages to a section be increased, and those existing be enlarged by accretion. Thus, beginning with the Torah portion Vayishlach, extensive passages are found that bear the marks of the later aggadah, and have points of connection with the Tanhuma homilies. The passages were probably added at an early date, since they are not entirely missing in the older manuscripts, which are free from many other additions and glosses that are found in the present editions. In the concluding chapters, Genesis Rabbah seems to have remained defective. In the sections of the Torah portion Vayigash, the comment is no longer carried out verse by verse; the last section of this Torah portion, as well as the first of the Torah portion Vayechi, is probably drawn from Tanhuma homilies. The comment to the whole 48th chapter of Genesis is missing in all the manuscripts (with one exception), and to verses 1–14 in the editions. The remaining portion of this Torah portion, the comment on Jacob&#x27;s blessing () is found in all the manuscripts—with the above-mentioned exceptions—in a revision showing later additions, a revision that was also used by the compiler of the Tanhuma Midrash edited by Solomon Buber.

The best manuscript of Genesis Rabbah is found in the Codex Add. 27,169 of the British Museum. It was used for the critical edition issued by J. Theodor.

<text>William Learned Marcy (December 12, 1786July 4, 1857) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge who served as U.S. Senator, the 11 Governor of New York, U.S. Secretary of War and the twenty-first U.S. Secretary of State. In the latter office, he negotiated the Gadsden Purchase, the last major acquisition of land in the contiguous United States.

Born in Southbridge, Massachusetts, Marcy established a legal practice in Troy, New York, after graduating from Brown University. He fought in the War of 1812, as an ensign, first lieutenant and captain in the 155th New York Infantry Regiment. Politically, he aligned with the Bucktail faction of the Democratic-Republican Party and became a leading member of the Albany Regency. As the Democratic-Republicans fractured in the 1820s, he became a member of the Democratic Party. Between 1821 and 1831, he successively served as Adjutant General of New York, New York State Comptroller, and as an associate justice of the New York Supreme Court. In 1831, the New York legislature elected Marcy to the U.S. Senate, and he held that position until 1833, when he became the Governor of New York. He served three terms as governor until his defeat in 1838 by the Whig nominee, William Seward.

He served as Secretary of War under James K. Polk from 1845 to 1849, overseeing the Mexican–American War. After leaving the Polk administration, he resumed the practice of law and became a leader of the &quot;Soft&quot; Hunker faction of the New York Democratic Party. He returned to the Cabinet in 1853, serving as Secretary of State under Franklin Pierce. In this role, he resolved a dispute about the status of U.S. immigrants abroad and directed U.S. diplomats to dress in the plain style of an ordinary American rather than the court-dress many had adopted from Europe. He also negotiated a reciprocity treaty with British North America and the Gadsden purchase with Mexico, acquiring territory in present-day Arizona and New Mexico. He left office in 1857 and died shortly thereafter.

==Early life==
William Learned Marcy was born in what is now Southbridge, Massachusetts, the son of farmer Jedediah Marcy and Ruth (Learned) Marcy. He attended schools in Leicester and graduated from The Woodstock Academy in Woodstock, Connecticut, before enrolling at Brown University, from which he graduated in 1808. After receiving his degree, Marcy, taught school in Dedham, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. He studied law with Troy, New York attorney William L. Bliss, was admitted to the bar in 1811, and began a practice in Troy. Marcy served in the militia during the War of 1812, first as an ensign in the 155th New York Infantry Regiment, and later advancing through the ranks to first lieutenant and captain. On October 22, 1812, he took part in the storming of the British post at St. Regis, Canada. He remained with the regiment after the war and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel as its second in command.

Afterward he served as Troy City Recorder from 1816 to 1818 and 1821 to 1823. As he sided with the Anti-Dewitt Clinton faction of the Democratic-Republican Party, known as the Bucktails, he was removed from office in 1818 after Clinton was elected governor. He was the editor of the &quot;Troy Budget&quot; newspaper.

In 1812, Marcy married Dolly Newell of Southbridge, who died in 1821. On April 28, 1824, he married Cornelia Knower (1801–1889, daughter of Benjamin Knower) at the Knower House in Guilderland, New York. They had three children—Samuel (1820–1862), Edmund (1832–1853), and Cornelia (1834–1888). Samuel Marcy was a United States Navy officer who was killed on board the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; during the American Civil War. Edmund was ill when he died on board the USS &quot;Preble&quot; while going to the Azores in the hopes of regaining his health. Cornelia Marcy was the wife of Edmund Henry Pendleton (1845–1910), a Union Army veteran who later became a successful author.

==State politics==
Marcy became the leading member of the Albany Regency, a group of Democratic politicians who controlled State politics between 1821 and 1838. He was Adjutant General of New York with the rank of brigadier general from 1821 to 1823, New York State Comptroller from 1823 to 1829, and an associate justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1829 to 1831.

In 1831, he was elected U.S. Senator from New York by the state legislature as a Jacksonian Democrat, and served from March 4, 1831, to January 1, 1833. He resigned upon taking office as governor, to which position he was elected in 1832. He sat on the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the 22nd Congress. Defending Jackson&#x27;s nomination of Martin Van Buren as minister to the United Kingdom in 1832, Marcy used the phrase &quot;&#x27;to the victor belong the spoils,&quot; from which the term spoils system is derived to refer to patronage political appointments.
Marcy was elected as Governor of New York for three terms, from 1833 until 1838. As governor he checked the issue of bank charters by the legislature and secured the enactment, in 1838, of a general banking law, which abolished the monopoly features that resulted from the old banking system. In 1838, he was defeated by Whig William H. Seward, which led to a radical change in state politics and then ended the Regency. To the abolitionists who questioned the candidates for governor, Marcy was considered a &quot;doughface,&quot; a man with Southern sympathies. He was well aware of the importance of Southern cotton and trade for New York state, both as a major part of exports from New York City and to the textile mills of upstate that processed cotton from the Deep South.

Marcy was appointed as a member of the Mexican Claims Commission, serving from 1839 to 1842. Later he was recognized as one of the leaders of the Hunkers, the conservative, office-seeking, and pro-compromise-on-slavery faction of the Democratic Party in New York.

==Federal politics==
Marcy served as United States Secretary of War in the Cabinet of President James K. Polk from 1845 until 1849, when he resumed the practice of law in New York. After 1849, Marcy led the &quot;Soft&quot; faction of the Hunkers that supported reconciliation with the Barnburners. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1852 but was unsuccessful, in part by &quot;Hard&quot; opposition led by Daniel S. Dickinson.

==Secretary of State==
Marcy returned to public life in 1853 to serve as United States Secretary of State under President Franklin Pierce. On June 1 of that year, he issued a circular to American diplomatic agents abroad, recommending that whenever practicable, they should appear in the simple dress of an American citizen. This directive created much discussion in Europe, where diplomats typically wore court dress. In 1867, Marcy&#x27;s recommendation was enacted into law by the US Congress.

Marcy resolved the Koszta Affair (1853), related to detention of an unnaturalized American resident by Austria, gaining his freedom. He negotiated the Gadsden Purchase from Mexico in the Southwest, the last major land acquisition in the contiguous United States. It added land to what are now the states of New Mexico and Arizona. With a southern route of territory all under United States control, southerners worked to promote a railroad from Texas to San Diego but were not successful.

In 1854 Marcy had to deal with the complications growing out of the bombardment of Greytown (now San Juan de Nicaragua), by the United States warship &quot;Cyane&quot; in retaliation for insults offered the American minister by its inhabitants and for their refusal to make restitution for damages to American property. The expedition of William Walker to Nicaragua, and his assumption of its Presidency, in 1855, further complicated the Central American question.

Upon the 1854 seizure by Spain of the American vessel &quot;Black Warrior&quot;, on the ground that this vessel had violated the customs regulations of the port of Havana, some propagandists in the United States Congress as well as Pierre Soulé, the American minister in Spain, seemed to prefer war and make possible the seizure of Cuba. It was largely due to Marcy&#x27;s influence that war was averted, Spain restored the confiscated cargo, paid restitution, and remitted the captain&#x27;s fine. Three American diplomats met to discuss the future of Cuba, but the resulting Ostend Manifesto was quite unexpected, and Marcy promptly disavowed the document.

The Crimean War led to a diplomatic controversy with Great Britain because of British recruiting in several American cities, and in May 1856, the papers of the British representative Sir John Crampton and several consuls were revoked. The following year the British government sent Sir Francis Napier to Washington to take Crampton&#x27;s place. A diplomatic disagreement with Britain caused Marcy to reject the Declaration of Paris of 1856, which would have set the rules of international maritime law.

Other affairs that demanded Marcy&#x27;s attention were a Canadian tariff reciprocity treaty, Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s negotiations for naval and trade access with Japan, and a British fishery dispute.

==Death==

Marcy died at Ballston Spa, New York, on July 4, 1857. He was buried at the Rural Cemetery in Albany, New York.

<text>The spinothalamic tract is a nerve tract in the anterolateral system in the spinal cord. This tract is an ascending sensory pathway to the thalamus. From the ventral posterolateral nucleus in the thalamus, sensory information is relayed upward to the somatosensory cortex of the postcentral gyrus.

The spinothalamic tract consists of two adjacent pathways: anterior and lateral. The anterior spinothalamic tract carries information about crude touch. The lateral spinothalamic tract conveys pain and temperature.

In the spinal cord, the spinothalamic tract has somatotopic organization. This is the segmental organization of its cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral components, which is arranged from most medial to most lateral respectively.

The pathway crosses over (decussates) at the level of the spinal cord, rather than in the brainstem like the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway and lateral corticospinal tract. It is one of the three tracts which make up the anterolateral system: anterior and lateral spinothalamic tract, spinotectal tract, spinoreticular tract.

==Structure==
There are two main parts of the spinothalamic tract: 
* The lateral spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature.
* The anterior spinothalamic tract (or &quot;ventral&quot; spinothalamic tract) transmits crude touch and firm pressure.

The spinothalamic tract, like the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, uses three neurons to convey sensory information from the periphery to conscious level at the cerebral cortex.

Pseudounipolar neurons in the dorsal root ganglion have axons that lead from the skin into the dorsal spinal cord where they ascend or descend one or two vertebral levels via Lissauer&#x27;s tract and then synapse with secondary neurons in either the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando or the nucleus proprius. These secondary neurons are called &quot;tract cells&quot;.

The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.

Traveling up the brainstem, the tract moves dorsally. The neurons ultimately synapse with third-order neurons in several nuclei of the thalamus—including the medial dorsal, ventral posterior lateral, and ventral posterior medial nuclei. From there, signals go to the cingulate cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, and insular cortex respectively.

===Anterior spinothalamic tract===
The anterior spinothalamic tract (Latin: &quot;tractus spinothalamicus anterior&quot;) or ventral spinothalamic fasciculus situated in the marginal part of the anterior funiculus and intermingled more or less with the vestibulospinal tract, is derived from cells in the posterior column or intermediate gray matter of the opposite side. Aβ fibres carry sensory information pertaining to crude touch from the skin. After entering the spinal cord the first order neurons synapse (in the nucleus proprius), and the second order neurons decussate via the anterior white commissure. These second order neurons ascend synapsing in the VPL of the thalamus. Incoming first order neurons can ascend or descend via the Lissauer tract. 

Its fibers convey crude touch information to the VPL (ventral posterolateral nucleus) of the thalamus.

The fibers of the anterior spinothalamic tract conduct information about pressure and crude touch (protopathic). The fine touch (epicritic) is conducted by fibers of the medial lemniscus. The medial lemniscus is formed by the axons of the neurons of the gracilis and cuneatus nuclei of the medulla oblongata which receive information about light touch, vibration and conscient proprioception from the gracilis and cuneatus fasciculus of the spinal cord. This fasciculus receive the axons of the first order neuron which is located in the dorsal root ganglion that receives afferent fibers from receptors in the skin, muscles and joints.

High-resolution RNA sequencing finds the anterior spinothalamic tract has five distinct types of neurons. Three clusters of which are located mainly in laminae I–III of the dorsal horn and two clusters in deeper laminae.

===Lateral spinothalamic tract===
The lateral spinothalamic tract (or lateral spinothalamic fasciculus), is a bundle of afferent nerve fibers ascending through the white matter of the spinal cord, in the spinothalamic tract, carrying sensory information to the brain. It carries pain, and temperature sensory information (protopathic sensation) to the thalamus. It is composed primarily of fast-conducting, sparsely myelinated A delta fibers and slow-conducting, unmyelinated C fibers. These are secondary sensory neurons which have already synapsed with the primary sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system in the posterior horn of the spinal cord (one of the three grey columns).

There is evidence to suggest the existence of a projection from lamina I and deeper layers of the dorsal horn to the ventrobasal complex and other thalamic nuclei, eventually passing pain and temperature information to the SI and SII somatosensory cortices. In macaque monkeys, neurons from the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus terminate at the posterior half of the superior limiting sulcus that bounds the dorsal insular cortext.

Together with the anterior spinothalamic tract, the lateral spinothalamic tract is sometimes termed the &quot;secondary sensory fasciculus&quot; or &quot;spinal lemniscus&quot;.

====Anatomy====
The neurons of the lateral spinothalamic tract originate in the spinal dorsal root ganglia. They project peripheral processes to the tissues in the form of free nerve endings which are sensitive to molecules indicative of cell damage. The central processes enter the spinal cord in an area at the back of the posterior horn known as the posterolateral tract. Here, the processes ascend approximately two levels before synapsing on second-order neurons. These secondary neurons are situated in the posterior horn, specifically in the Rexed laminae regions I, IV, V and VI. Region II is primarily composed of Golgi II interneurons, which are primarily for the modulation of pain, and largely project to secondary neurons in regions I and V. Secondary neurons from regions I and V decussate across the anterior white commissure and ascend in the (now contralateral) lateral spinothalamic tract. These fibers will ascend through the brainstem, including the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, as the spinal lemniscus until synapsing in the ventroposteriorlateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus. The third order neurons in the thalamus will then project through the internal capsule and corona radiata to various regions of the cortex, primarily the primary somatosensory cortex (Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2).

==Function==
The types of sensory information means that the sensation is accompanied by a reflex.

There are two sub-systems identified: 
* Direct (for direct conscious appreciation of pain) 
* Indirect (for affective and arousal impact of pain). Indirect projections include 
** Spino-Reticulo-Thalamo-Cortical (part of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS)
** Spino-Mesencephalic-Limbic (for affective impact of pain).

===Anterolateral system===
The anterolateral system (ALS) is an ascending bundle of fibers in the spinal cord, carried in three main pathways or tracts. The tracts convey pain, temperature (protopathic sensation), and crude touch from the periphery to the brain. The most important of these is the spinothalamic tract.

==Clinical significance==

In contrast to the axons of second-order neurons in dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, the axons of second-order neurons in the spinothalamic tracts cross at every segmental level in the spinal cord. This fact aids in determining whether a lesion is in the brain or the spinal cord. With lesions in the brain stem or higher, deficits of pain perception, touch sensation, and proprioception are all contralateral to the lesion. With spinal cord lesions, however, the deficit in pain perception is contralateral to the lesion, whereas the other deficits are ipsilateral. See Brown-Séquard syndrome.

Unilateral lesions usually cause contralateral anaesthesia (loss of pain and temperature). Anaesthesia will normally begin 1-2 segments below the level of lesion, due to the sensory fibers being carried by dorsal-lateral tract of Lissauer up several levels upon entry into the spinal cord, and will affect all caudal body areas. This is clinically tested by using pin pricks.

<doc id="603069" wikidata="Q7729248" url="?curid=603069" title="The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd">
<text>The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on NBC from May 21, 1987, to June 29, 1988, and on Lifetime from April 17, 1989, to April 13, 1991. It was created by Jay Tarses and stars Blair Brown in the title role.

==Premise==
The show depicts the life of Molly Bickford Dodd, a divorced woman in New York City with a lifestyle that could be described as both yuppie and bohemian. Molly seems to drift from job to job and relationship to relationship. Her ex-husband, a ne&#x27;er-do-well jazz musician, still cares for her. In fact, nearly every man (and the occasional woman) she meets adores her. Her warmth and emotional accessibility are the root cause of most of Molly&#x27;s problems in life. The BBC&#x27;s Radio Times characterised the show as &quot;An American comedy-drama series starring Blair Brown intelligent, attractive and independent, Molly Dodd has the world at her feet—so why must it always trip her up?

==Cast==
* Blair Brown as Molly Dodd
* James Greene as Davey McQuinn, elevator operator/doorman
* Allyn Ann McLerie as Florence Bickford, Molly&#x27;s mother
* William Converse-Roberts as Fred Dodd, Molly&#x27;s ex-husband
* Richard Lawson as Det. Nathaniel Hawthorne, one of Molly&#x27;s romantic interests
* David Strathairn as Moss Goodman, one of Molly&#x27;s romantic interests

Additional cast included:
* Maureen Anderman as her best friend Nina. 
* Sandy Faison as Mamie Grolnick, Molly&#x27;s younger sister.
* Victor Garber as Dennis Widmer
* Richard Venture as Edgar Bickford, Molly&#x27;s father 
* George Gaynes, John Pankow, J. Smith-Cameron, and Lewis Black.

==Episodes==
&quot;NOTE: Production Codes were taken from the Library of Congress.&quot;

===Season 1 (1987)===
===Season 2 (1988)===
===Season 3 (1989)===
===Season 4 (1990)===
===Season 5 (1991)===
==Production==
&quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot; had story lines that often did not resolve in a single episode.

The show was filmed using a single camera.

Production took place in Hollywood for the first two seasons before moving to Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York in season 3.

Tarses wrote and directed many of its episodes (and made a number of cameo appearances).

Blair Brown was given special billing above the title in the opening credits on the Lifetime episodes.

==Reception and network change==
NBC first aired the series as a summer replacement in 1987, running 13 episodes. &quot;Molly Dodd&quot; was critically acclaimed and a moderate ratings success (it was featured in the network&#x27;s then-powerhouse Thursday night lineup), but was not featured in the network&#x27;s fall schedule. It again was a mid-season replacement for NBC in spring 1988 with 12 episodes (a season-ending 13th episode was produced but not aired). NBC canceled &quot;Molly Dodd&quot; after the second season.

After its NBC cancelation, cable network Lifetime picked up the series, first re-airing the 26 episodes originally produced, and then commissioning three more 13-episode seasons for 1989, 1990, and 1991. When they were rerun on Lifetime, the original 26 episodes were time-sped (usually during both acts), and the opening titles trimmed. After production ceased, Lifetime continued to air &quot;Molly Dodd&quot; in reruns until 1993.

==Awards and nominations==
The show earned Brown five Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, one for each year of the show&#x27;s run. Brown won a CableACE Award for Best Actress in a Dramatic Series in 1991, during the fifth and final season&#x27;s airing. Tarses was also the recipient of multiple nominations.

==Music rights==
Despite some demand for the show on DVD or streaming services, the original producers did not clear music rights for subsequent broadcast. Although Brown often sang as Molly, the cost to secure the rights to the music itself would be substantial. In an interview, Brown indicated &quot;all the songs that I sang, they never got the rights. So [the show is] in a vault somewhere and will never see the light of day.&quot;

<text>Havelock-Belmont-Methuen is a township in central-eastern Ontario, Canada, in Peterborough County. On January 1, 1998, Belmont and Methuen Township amalgamated with the Village of Havelock to form what is now Havelock-Belmont-Methuen.

==History==

The region&#x27;s colonial history began with an influx of settlers after Belmont and Methuen Township was surveyed in 1823. The community of Havelock was incorporated as an independent village in 1892.

Havelock was named after the British general, Sir Henry Havelock.

Early settlers built their homes in an area of dense forests and numerous lakes and rivers within the rocky Canadian Shield. They survived by means of fishing, logging, and farming.

By 1869, Blairton, in the Township of Belmont County, was a village with a population of 500. The village was near the richest iron mines in the Dominion. Miners and laborers were in great demand. The village was a station of the Cobourg, Peterborough &amp; Marmora Railway. The land in the vicinity was almost all taken up. There were stages to Norwood and Marmora.

Later, in the nineteenth century and continuing to the present, mining became an important economic activity. Early businesses in Havelock included a post office, bakery, and a blacksmith were located south of the current village on high ground at the intersection of County Road 30 and Old Norwood Road. In 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed a right-of-way through the area north of Havelock and a year later laid rails and surveyed and filled the swampy land to make room for a larger village. 
The current village of Havelock was developed on the filled land by the tracks north of the former village site and was incorporated in 1892. In the fall of 1884, the first full passenger train stopped at Havelock, from Toronto on its way to Smith&#x27;s Falls. In 1961, the Havelock branch of the Toronto-Dominian Bank was robbed, in what was described by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2021 as &quot;one of the biggest bank robberies in Canadian history.&quot;

Havelock was an important freight depot from the 1880s to the 1960s. The railway is now run by Canadian Pacific as Kawartha Lakes Railway and its activity today consists of transporting nepheline syenite and crushed basalt rock from two mines north of Havelock operated by Unimin. In 1998, the village of Havelock was amalgamated with the township of Belmont-Methuen to form the current township of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen.

=== Historic School ===
The old school, a two-story building now known as the Hilltop Apartments, stands at the northwest corner of Oak Street and Mathison Street, Havelock. In 1890 to 1963 Havelock area students attended this school which in 1937 was renamed Havelock High School. In 1952 Havelock High School students were transferred to the new Norwood District High School in the neighbouring town of Norwood, Ontario. In 1963 Havelock Public School students were transferred to the new Havelock Public School, east of the Havelock Community Centre. In 1963 the school building was sold and converted to apartments. In September, 2005 the Havelock High School Reunion Committee placed in front of the apartments a commemorative plaque bolted to a large red granite stone from a local quarry.

=== Railway Station ===
The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) station on Ottawa Street (Hwy #7) in Havelock was built in 1929. It was designated in 1991 as a Heritage Railway Station by the Historic Sights and Monuments Board, Parks Canada. In 2004 the Station was purchased and renovated to accommodate restaurants.
== Local Government ==

<doc id="603074" wikidata="Q2631605" url="?curid=603074" title="State Comptroller of Israel">
<text>The State Comptroller of Israel ( &quot;Mevaker HaMedina&quot;, , literally: &quot;Critic of State&quot;) inspects, reviews, and audits the policies and operations of the government of the State of Israel. The State Comptroller&#x27;s Office is also the government&#x27;s office for public complaints. It serves under the aegis of the Knesset and has authority to examine all agencies of government.

== History ==

In 1965 the Comptroller&#x27;s Office hosted V INCOSAI, the fifth triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions.
The state comptroller is elected by the Knesset in a secret ballot for a single term of seven years. The state comptroller can be relieved only by the Knesset or by resignation or demise.

The comptroller may not be a member of the Knesset or otherwise engage in politics and is prohibited from any public or private activity that could create a conflict of interest with the independent performance of the duties of the office. The state comptroller, although lacking in authority to enforce compliance, has broad investigative powers and employs hundreds of staff members, including accountants, lawyers, and other relevant professionals.

The state comptroller acts in conjunction with the State Audit Committee of the Knesset and reports to it whenever necessary. The state comptroller may recommend that the State Audit Committee appoint a special commission of inquiry, but having no statutory authority of its own it relies on the Knesset to impose sanctions on errant bodies. The state comptroller&#x27;s budget is submitted directly to the Finance Committee and is exempt from prior consideration by the Ministry of Finance.

The comptroller elected in 2019 to replace Yosef Shapira is Matanyahu Englman.

== Duties ==
The principal function of the state comptroller is to check on the legality, regularity, efficiency, economy, and ethical conduct of public sector institutions. The checks are performed by continuous and spot inspections of the financial accounts and activities of all ministries, the armed forces and security services, local government bodies, and any corporations, enterprises, or organizations subsidized or managed by the state in any form.

By law, the State Comptroller in Israel also functions as Ombudsman (Hebrew: &quot;Netziv Tlunot HaTzibur&quot;) to whom members of the public may lodge complaints about actions by governmental bodies that have caused them harm.

The state comptroller&#x27;s office is divided into five major inspection units. The first four units are concerned, respectively, with ministries, defense services, local authorities, and corporations; the fifth inspection unit deals with public complaints concerning government bodies.

==Officeholders==
* (1949–61)
* Yitzhak Nebenzahl (1961–81)
* Yitzhak Tunik (1982–87)
* Yaakov Malz (1987–88)
* Miriam Ben-Porat (1988–98)
* Eliezer Goldberg (1998–2005)
* Micha Lindenstrauss (2005–2012)

<text>Canadian Government Railways was the legal name used between 1915–1918 for all federal government-owned railways in Canada.

The principal component companies were the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC), the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR), the Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR), and the Hudson Bay Railway (HBR). There were also several minor branch railways in the province of New Brunswick that were acquired by CGR during this time.

The deepening financial crisis in Canada&#x27;s railway industry toward the end of the First World War saw the majority of major railways across the country nationalized by the federal government. The CGR played a vital role in Canada&#x27;s wartime effort, moving vast numbers of troops and supplies. A notable role was the relief and reconstruction in Halifax after the 1917 Halifax Explosion and one CGR employee, Vince Coleman became a celebrated hero in the explosion.

The first system to be taken over was the bankrupt Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) on September 6, 1918, whereby the government-appointed &quot;Board of Management&quot; for CNoR was instructed to take responsibility for all CGR operations as well. Later that year, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways (CNR) as a means to simplify the funding and administration of the nationalized railway system, which was formally brought about by an order issued on December 20, 1918, by the Privy Council.

The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR) was nationalized after defaulting on loan payments March 7, 1919, and entered the CNR fold on July 12, 1920. GTPR&#x27;s parent company, the bankrupt Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was nationalized on May 21, 1920, and was absorbed into the CNR on January 30, 1923.

Although the CGR only existed for a short period of time before evolving into the Canadian National Railway, it was a very visible Canadian railway in World War One due to the large scale of wartime railway operation. Large amounts of rolling stock were lettered for the CGR, although in many regions, such as the Maritimes, the public continued to refer to its trains and facilities by their old name of the Intercolonial. The CGR moniker ceased to be used after 1918, but the CGR itself existed on paper until the late 20th century, largely due to real estate leases and other agreements. A Privy Council order dated July 22, 1993, authorized the sale of CGR to the Crown corporation CN for one Canadian dollar.

<text>The London Prodigal is an English Renaissance play, most notable for its inclusion among the Shakespeare apocrypha. A city comedy set in London, it tells the story of a prodigal son learning the error of his ways. It was published 1605 as a play by William Shakespeare but the attribution is regarded as spurious by most scholars.

== Date, authorship and publication ==
&quot;The London Prodigal&quot; has been dated as early as c. 1591, and as late as 1603–04. It is one of a long series of &quot;prodigal son&quot; plays that reach back as far as the Bible for inspiration and precedent; but it is also an example of the evolving Elizabethan genre of domestic dramas, and is &quot;one of the first naturalistic dramas in English&quot;.

The play was not entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register. It was published in quarto in 1605 by the stationer Nathaniel Butter, and printed by Thomas Creede. The title states that it is &quot;By &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;&quot;, and that it was performed by the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s, the company for whom Shakespeare worked. The attribution to Shakespeare is generally rejected by scholars as the play does not read like his other work.

It was not included in the 1623 First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s collected plays. However, in 1664 it was one of the seven plays that publisher Philip Chetwinde added to the second impression of his Third Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In modern times, the play has been published in two editions. An old-spelling edition appears in C.F. Tucker-Brooke&#x27;s &quot;The Shakespeare Apocrypha&quot;. A modern-spelling edition appears in the 2013 anthology &quot;William Shakespeare and Others: Collaborative Plays&quot;, whose editors state that it is &quot;almost certainly not by Shakespeare&quot;.

Individual scholars have attributed the play to Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker, John Marston, and Michael Drayton, Thomas Heywood, George Wilkins, and John Fletcher. None of these attributions, however, has been accepted by a significant proportion of the critical community. In 1994, Jonathan Hope proposed, based on linguistic evidence that the play is a collaboration by two authors.

==Synopsis==
Matthew Flowerdale, the prodigal son of a merchant, Flowerdale Senior, is a libertine, gambler, swearer, brawler, drinker and thief. Flowerdale Senior&#x27;s brother, Flowerdale Junior, warns him about Matthew&#x27;s dissolute behaviour but Flowerdale Senior dismisses his fear, believing that &quot;youth must have its course&quot; and that his son will soon make amends. In order to spy on his son, Flowerdale Senior feigns death and appears disguised as a servant. He is soon appalled by the sum of his son&#x27;s vices.
Matthew Flowerdale forges a will in which he pretends to be a wealthy man bequeathing all his fortune to Sir Lancelot Spurcock. When the latter discovers the will, he decides to marry his daughter Luce with Matthew. They are quickly married but Matthew is arrested for debt on his wedding day. He becomes poorer and poorer and robs one of Luce&#x27;s sisters. Although she is abominably treated by her husband (he even asks her to become a whore), Luce remains loyal to him and finally moves her dissolute husband to repentance and reform. Flowerdale Senior reveals his true identity and congratulates his son for his new resolutions.

<text>The Hall of State (originally the State of Texas Building) is a building in Dallas&#x27;s Fair Park that commemorates the history of the U.S. state of Texas and is considered one of the best examples of Art Deco architecture in the state. It was designed and built for the Texas Centennial Exposition.

==History==
Built in 1936 at the astronomical (especially during the Great Depression) price of $1.2 million, the building was the most expensive per unit area of any structure built in Texas. It was designed for the centennial of the Republic of Texas by architect Donald Barthelme in the beaux arts style and is considered one of the most representative examples of art deco architecture in Texas. According to documents from the Dallas Historical Society Centennial archives collection, John F. Livers designed and manufactured the majority of the Art Deco ornamental metalwork at his Livers Lighting and Bronze Company in Kansas City, Missouri, including the light fixtures. The Hall of State is the culmination of the long Esplanade of State which is flanked by six exhibition pavilions and features a long reflecting pool. It was built using Texas limestone and features memorials to many of the heroes of Texas history.

==Current==
The Dallas Historical Society has been responsible for managing the Hall of State since 1938. The Hall of State is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a part of Fair Park. In 1986, the building was restored at a cost of approximately $1.5 million, and the G.B. Dealey Library was opened.

The G.B. Dealey Library, located in the East Texas room of the Hall of State, holds more than ten thousand bound volumes and three million historic documents, including Sam Houston&#x27;s handwritten account of the battle of San Jacinto.

The Dallas Historical Society rents the Hall of State for events and provides guided tours to school groups.

The structure became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1981.

The American Museum of the Miniature Arts is currently located at the Hall of State.

==Architecture==

The curved exedra at the entrance to the Hall of Texas features tall limestone pillars sit in front of blue tiles designed to evoke the state&#x27;s flower, the bluebonnet (&quot;Lupinus texensis&quot;). In the center, above the entrance is an bronze with gold leaf statue by Allie Tennant of the &quot;Tejas Warrior&quot;: an archer holds high a bow without an arrow, meant to symbolize peace.

Inside the Hall of State is the Hall of Heroes, which features six bronze statues of James Fannin, Mirabeau B. Lamar, Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston, Thomas Jefferson Rusk and William B. Travis. There are also bronze plaques that commemorate the Battle of the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto. Outside, a statue of Robert L. Thornton, benefactor of the State Fair of Texas and former Mayor of Dallas stands, overlooking the esplanade.

On the exterior frieze, the Hall of State commemorates 60 prominent historical figures in Texas&#x27; history:
* Edward Burleson

<text>The Cairo Geniza, alternatively spelled the Cairo Genizah, is a collection of some 400,000 Jewish manuscript fragments and Fatimid administrative documents that were kept in the &quot;genizah&quot; or storeroom of the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Fustat or Old Cairo, Egypt. These manuscripts span the entire period of Middle-Eastern, North African, and Andalusian Jewish history between the 6th and 19th centuries CE, and comprise the largest and most diverse collection of medieval manuscripts in the world.

The Genizah texts are written in various languages, especially Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic, mainly on vellum and paper, but also on papyrus and cloth. In addition to containing Jewish religious texts such as Biblical, Talmudic, and later Rabbinic works (some in the original hands of the authors), the Genizah gives a detailed picture of the economic and cultural life of the Mediterranean region, especially during the 10th to 13th centuries.

Manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza are now dispersed among a number of libraries, including the Cambridge University Library, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the John Rylands Library, the Bodleian Library, the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, the British Library, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the National Library of Russia, Alliance Israélite Universelle, the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library at the University of Haifa and multiple private collections around the world. Most fragments come from the &quot;geniza&quot; chamber of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, but additional fragments were found at excavation sites near the synagogue and in the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo. Modern Cairo Geniza manuscript collections include some old documents that collectors bought in Egypt in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

== Discovery and present locations ==

The first European to note the collection was apparently Simon van Gelderen (a great-uncle of Heinrich Heine), who visited the Ben Ezra synagogue and reported about the Cairo Genizah in 1752 or 1753. In 1864 the traveler and scholar Jacob Saphir visited the synagogue and explored the Genizah for two days; while he did not identify any specific item of significance he suggested that possibly valuable items might be in store. In 1896, the Scottish scholars and twin sisters Agnes S. Lewis and Margaret D. Gibson returned from Egypt with fragments from the Genizah they considered to be of interest, and showed them to Solomon Schechter &quot;their irrepressibly curious rabbinical friend&quot; at Cambridge. Schechter, already aware of the Genizah but not of its significance, immediately recognized the importance of the material. With the financial assistance of his Cambridge colleague and friend Charles Taylor, Schechter made an expedition to Egypt, where, with the assistance of the Chief Rabbi, he sorted and removed the greater part of the contents of the Genizah chamber. Agnes and Margaret joined him there en route to Sinai (their fourth visit in five years) and he showed them the chamber which Agnes reported was &quot;simply indescribable&quot;.

The Genizah fragments have now been archived in various libraries around the world. The Taylor-Schechter collection at Cambridge is the largest, by far, single collection, with nearly 193,000 fragments (137,000 shelf-marks). There are a further 43,000 fragments at the Jewish Theological Seminary Library. The John Rylands University Library in Manchester holds a collection of over 11,000 fragments, which are currently being digitised and uploaded to an online archive. The Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford has a collection of 25,000 Genizah folios.

Westminster College in Cambridge held 1,700 fragments, which were deposited by Lewis and Gibson in 1896. In 2013 the two Oxbridge libraries, the Bodleian Library at Oxford and Cambridge University Library, joined together to raise funds to buy the Westminster collection (now renamed the Lewis-Gibson collection) after it was put up for sale for £1.2 million. This is the first time the two libraries have collaborated for such a fundraising effort.

== Contents and significance ==

Many of the fragments found in the Cairo Genizah may be dated to the early centuries of the second millennium CE, and there are a fair number of earlier items as well as a number of nineteenth-century pieces. The manuscripts in the Genizah include sacred and religious materials as well as great deal of secular writings. The Genizah materials include a wide range of content. Among the literary fragments, the most popular categories are liturgical texts, Biblical and related texts, and Rabbinic literature. There are also materials with philosophical, scientific, mystical, and linguistic writings. Among the non-literary items there are legal documents and private letters. Also found were school exercises and merchants&#x27; account books, as well as communal records of various sorts.

The normal practice for genizot (pl. of genizah) was to remove the contents periodically and bury them in a cemetery. Many of these documents were written in the Aramaic language using the Hebrew alphabet. As the Jews considered Hebrew to be the language of God, and the Hebrew script to be the literal writing of God, the texts could not be destroyed even long after they had served their purpose. The Jews who wrote the materials in the Genizah were familiar with the culture and language of their contemporary society. The documents are invaluable as evidence for how colloquial Arabic of this period was spoken and understood. They also demonstrate that the Jewish creators of the documents were part of their contemporary society: they practiced the same trades as their Muslim and Christian neighbors, including farming; they bought, sold, and rented properties.
The importance of these materials for reconstructing the social and economic history for the period between 950 and 1250 cannot be overemphasized. Judaic scholar Shelomo Dov Goitein created an index for this time period which covers about 35,000 individuals. This included about 350 &quot;prominent people,&quot; among them Maimonides and his son Abraham, 200 &quot;better known families&quot;, and mentions of 450 professions and 450 goods. He identified material from Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria (but not Damascus or Aleppo), Tunisia, Sicily, and even covering trade with India. Cities mentioned range from Samarkand in Central Asia to Seville and Sijilmasa, Morocco to the west; from Aden north to Constantinople; Europe not only is represented by the Mediterranean port cities of Narbonne, Marseilles, Genoa and Venice, but even Kiev and Rouen are occasionally mentioned.

In particular the various records of payments to labourers for building maintenance and the like form by far the largest collection of records of day wages in the Islamic world for the early medieval period, despite difficulties in interpreting the currency units cited and other aspects of the data. They have invariably been cited in discussions of the medieval Islamic economy since the 1930s, when this aspect of the collection was researched, mostly by French scholars.
Many of the items in Cairo Genizah are not a complete manuscript, but are instead a fragment of one or two leaves, many of which are damaged themselves. Similarly, the pages of a single manuscript often became separated. It is not uncommon to find the pages of one manuscript housed in three or four different modern libraries. On the other hand, non-literary writings often lost their value with the passage of time, and were left in the Genizah while still more or less intact.

The materials comprise a vast number of texts, including many parts of Jewish religious writings and even fragments from the Quran. Of particular interest to biblical scholars are several incomplete manuscripts of the original Hebrew version of Sirach. Solomon Schechter also found two fragments of the Damascus Document, other fragments of which were later found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran.

The non-literary materials, which include court documents, legal writings, and the correspondence of the local Jewish community (such as the Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon), are somewhat smaller, but still impressive: Goitein estimated their size at &quot;about 10,000 items of some length, of which 7,000 are self-contained units large enough to be regarded as documents of historical value. Only half of these are preserved more or less completely.&quot;

The number of documents added to the Genizah changed throughout the years. For example, the number of documents added were fewer between 1266 and circa 1500, when most of the Jewish community had moved north to the city of Cairo proper, and saw a rise around 1500 when the local community was increased by refugees from Spain. It was they who brought to Cairo several documents that shed a new light on the history of Khazaria and Kievan Rus&#x27;, namely, the Khazar Correspondence, the Schechter Letter, and the Kievian Letter. The Genizah remained in use until it was emptied by Western scholars eager for its material.

A number of other genizot have provided smaller discoveries across the Old World, notably Italian ones such as that of Perugia. An 11th-century Afghan Geniza was found in 2011.

The Cairo Genizah fragments were extensively studied, cataloged and translated by Paul E. Kahle. His book, &quot;The Cairo Geniza&quot; was published by Blackwell in 1958, with a second edition in 1959.

===Accounting===
Jewish bankers in Old Cairo used a double-entry bookkeeping system which predated any known usage of such a form in Italy, and whose records remain from the 11th century AD, found amongst the Cairo Geniza.

== Research ==
The Cairo Genizah Collections at the University of Pennsylvania and at the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary is the subject of a citizen-science project on the website Zooniverse. Project volunteers are enlisted to sort digitized fragments of the Cairo Genizah, in order to facilitate research on the fragments.

The Friedberg Geniza Project is of great importance to research inasmuch as it includes all Genizah fragments and bibliographical data relating to them.

Since 1986, the Princeton Geniza Lab has been studying and digitizing geniza manuscripts. Their projects include the Princeton Geniza Project, a database of more than 30,000 records and 4,600 transcriptions of geniza texts. In early 2021, under the leadership of director Marina Rustow and in partnership with Daniel Stoekl Ben Ezra, the Lab began exploring machine learning as a method of transcribing geniza documents, using handwritten text recognition applications.

== Cultural impact ==
Indian anthropologist and writer Amitav Ghosh recounts his study of the Genizah fragments related to Jewish merchant Abraham Ben Yiju in the book &quot;In an Antique Land&quot;.

<doc id="603088" wikidata="Q318482" url="?curid=603088" title="Abel P. Upshur">
<text>Abel Parker Upshur (June 17, 1790 – February 28, 1844) was an American lawyer, planter, judge, and politician from the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Active in Virginia state politics for decades, with a brother and a nephew who became distinguished U.S. Navy officers, Judge Upshur left the Virginia bench to become the Secretary of the Navy and Secretary of State during the administration of President John Tyler, a fellow Virginian. He negotiated the treaty that led to the 1845 Texas annexation to the United States and helped ensure that it was admitted as a slave state. Upshur died on February 28, 1844, when a gun on the warship exploded during a demonstration.

==Early life and education==
Upshur was born in Northampton County on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore, in 1790, one of 12 children borne to the former Anne Parker and her husband Littleton Upshur. He was named after his paternal grandfather, who died on March 25, 1790. His maternal grandfather was George Parker. Littleton Upshur was reportedly a &quot;staunch individualist and rabid Federalist&quot;, owned the plantation Vaucluse, was elected several times to both Houses of the Virginia General Assembly (beginning with his election to the House of Delegates in 1807), and served as a captain in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, which began in part after raids on Eastern Shore plantations. His brother George P. Upshur (1799–1852) became a distinguished naval officer; another brother was John Brown Upshur (1776–1822). His niece Mary Jane Stith Sturges (1828–1891) married New Yorker Josiah R. Sturges after the Civil War, helped organize the Harlem Free Hospital and published a historical novel, &quot;Confederate Notes&quot;, in 1867, either anonymously or under the pseudonym &quot;Fanny Fielding&quot;.

After receiving a basic education through private tutors suitable for his class, Upshur attended Princeton University and Yale College; he was expelled from the former for participating in a student rebellion. He graduated from neither institution, instead returning to Richmond, Virginia, to study law with William Wirt.

==Marriage and family==
Upshur first married Elizabeth Dennis in Accomack County, Virginia on February 26, 1817; she died in childbirth on November 28, 1817. He remarried, this time to his second cousin, Elizabeth Ann Brown (née Upshur); they had one daughter, Susan Parker Brown Upshur (1826–1858).

==Virginia planter, lawyer and politician==
Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1810; Upshur briefly set up practice in Baltimore, Maryland, but returned to Virginia after his father&#x27;s death. He operated Vauclose plantation using enslaved labor, as had his father, and developed a law practice as well as became active in state politics. In the reconstructed 1790 census, the senior Abel Upshur was tithed for 13 blacks, one black between 12 and 16 years old, 15 horses and 4 chariots. In the 1820 federal census, Littleton Upshur owned 43 slaves. In the 1830 federal census, Judge Abel Upshur owned 17 slaves and employed 3 free colored people, and Col. Littleton Upshur owned 20 slaves. In the 1840 federal census, Abel Upshur owned 21 slaves.

Upshur was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1812, while his father represented both Northampton and neighboring Accomac County in the Virginia Senate (both part-time positions). As the War of 1812 ended, Upshur remained in the state capital, serving as Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Richmond (1816–1823). He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Congress. Northampton County voters returned him as one of their legislative delegates in 1825, and re-elected him in 1826, but he did not fill the second term, since fellow delegates elected him as a judge of the Virginia General Court in 1826.

Throughout his political career, Upshur was a slaveholder, as well as stalwart conservative and advocate for states&#x27; rights. Upshur again won election in 1829, this time as one of the four delegates representing Mathews, Middlesex, Accomac, Northampton and Gloucester Counties in the Virginia State Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830, where he served alongside Thomas R. Joynes, Thomas M. Bayley and William K. Perrin (replacing the deceased Calvin Read). At the convention, Upshur represented eastern slaveholders and became the man who spoke the most against democratic reforms. He expressed similar views during the nullification movement in South Carolina in 1832; he defended the principle of nullification and the state in a series of letters entitled &quot;&quot;. In 1839, Upshur also set forth his white supremacist views in an essay published by Richmond&#x27;s &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;. (Although Upshur opposed universal white manhood suffrage at that constitutional convention, such would happen at the next constitutional convention, in 1850, after Upshur&#x27;s death.)

Although a Federalist in his youth, Upshur became a states rights man in 1816, even a Jacksonian Democrat. However, after President Andrew Jackson (a slave owner himself) refused to countenance South Carolina&#x27;s nullification, he changed parties again and became a Whig. Upshur&#x27;s view of the Constitution received its fullest expression in his 1840 treatise in response to Judge Joseph Story, &quot;&quot;.

The reorganized state legislature again elected Upshur judge of the Northampton Circuit Court, and he continued in that position until 1841, when he became Secretary of the Navy, as described below.

===Secretary of the Navy===
After John Tyler became President of the United States in 1841, he appointed longtime friend Upshur as the 13th United States Secretary of the Navy in October of that year. His time with the Navy was marked by a strong emphasis on reform and reorganization, and efforts to expand and modernize the service. He served from October 11, 1841, to July 23, 1843. Among his achievements were the replacement of the old Board of Navy Commissioners with the bureau system, regularization of the officer corps, increased Navy appropriations, construction of new sailing and steam warships, and the establishment of the United States Naval Observatory and Hydrographic Office. Abel P. Upshur was also a staunch advocate for the expansion of the size of the U.S. Navy. Upshur sought the United States Navy to be at least half the size of the British Royal Navy.

Upshur&#x27;s zeal for a vastly expanded and empowered Federal navy struck some as being at odds with his fastidious advocacy of states’ rights and limited central government. The abolitionist and naval expansionist Congressman John Quincy Adams noted in his diary: “This new-born passion of the South for the increase of the navy is one of the most curious phenomena in our national history. From Jefferson’s dry-docks and gunboats, to admirals, three-deckers, and war-steamers equal to half the navy of Great Britain, is more than a stride—there is a flying-fish’s leap.” But for Southern navalists like Upshur, there was no contradiction. Both stances were necessary for the defense of the South&#x27;s especially vulnerable “social institutions” from abolitionism—domestic, in the case of states’ rights; British, in the case of geopolitics.

===Secretary of State===
In July 1843, President Tyler appointed Upshur United States Secretary of State to succeed Daniel Webster, who had resigned. His chief accomplishment was advocating for the annexation of the Republic of Texas as a slave state. Upshur and Texas ambassador Isaac Van Zandt worked closely on the treaty of annexation until Upshur&#x27;s death. He was also deeply involved in the negotiations in the Oregon boundary dispute and was a strong advocate of bringing the Oregon Country into the union. He was eventually willing to settle on the 49th parallel compromise for the northern border between the United States and Canada, although negotiations were not finished until after his death and the end of Tyler&#x27;s term as president.

==USS &quot;Princeton&quot; explosion and death==

On February 28, 1844, Upshur joined President Tyler and about 400 other dignitaries examining the new steamship , which sailed down the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia. He and Gilmer, his successor as Secretary of the Navy, and four other passengers died when one of the ship&#x27;s guns exploded near Fort Washington, Maryland, during a demonstration of its firing power, and many other officers and passengers were wounded. Upshur was buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. In 1874, later his remains were reinterred at Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
* The destroyer was commissioned in 1920, and was later a Lend-Lease ship for Great Britain.

These places have been named for him:
* Upshur County, West Virginia
* Upshur Street in northwest Washington, DC; Arlington, Virginia; Maryland; and northwest Portland, Oregon.
* Upshur County, Texas (interestingly, the county seat - Gilmer - is named for Thomas Walker Gilmer, another victim of the &quot;USS Princeton&quot; explosion)
* Mount Upshur, known as Boundary Peak 17, a summit on the Alaska-British Columbia border near Hyder, Alaska.

<doc id="603091" wikidata="Q363046" url="?curid=603091" title="Christian Mortensen">
<text>Thomas Peter Thorvald Kristian Ferdinand Mortensen (August 16, 1882 – April 25, 1998), known as Christian Mortensen, was a Danish-American supercentenarian who resided in California. When he died, his age of 115 years and 252 days was the longest verified male lifespan at the time, until Jiroemon Kimura surpassed him in 2012. Mortensen was baptized in on December 26, 1882. Besides his baptismal record, other records include the 1890 and 1901 census enumerations in Denmark, and church confirmation in 1896.

== Biography ==
Christian Mortensen was born to tailor Jens Karl Martinus Mortensen and his wife Maren Therkelsen Thybo in the village of Skårup in Fruering parish near the city of Skanderborg, Denmark, on August 16, 1882. He began work as a tailor&#x27;s apprentice in Skanderborg at age 16, in 1898, and later took work as a farmhand.
Mortensen emigrated to Ellis Island in the New York Bay area, the United States in 1903, then aged about 20 or 21 years old. He traveled while working as a tailor, but settled in Chicago, where he had relatives. Mortensen worked various trades, including as a milkman for Borden Dairy Company, as a restaurateur, and as a factory worker for the Continental Can Company.

He was married for less than ten years, divorced and had no children. He did not remarry.

In 1950, Mortensen retired near Galveston Bay, Texas. Then, 28 years later at the age of 96, he moved to a retirement home in San Rafael, California. Mortensen claimed he rode his bicycle to the Aldersly Retirement Community, telling the staff that he was there to stay. Mortensen lived at Aldersly for almost 20 years until his death in 1998.

Mortensen was visited by American scientist James Vaupel and other longevity researchers on the occasion of his 113th birthday. He was particularly pleased with a box of Danish cigars that the researchers had brought him. Mortensen was completely blind towards the end of his life and spent much of his time in bed sleeping or in a wheelchair listening to the radio. He showed no signs of major degenerative disease or dementia. His memory and reasoning were described as largely intact. He could walk only with assistance.

==Lifestyle==

Mortensen enjoyed cigars in moderation and drank lots of water. He led a simple and solitary life. He avoided red meat but was not a vegetarian. On his 115th birthday, Mortensen gave his advice for a long life: &quot;Friends, a good cigar, drinking lots of good water, no alcohol, staying positive and lots of singing will keep you alive for a long time.&quot;

<doc id="603100" wikidata="Q5012615" url="?curid=603100" title="CKX-TV">
<text>CKX-TV (channel 5) was a television station in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, which served as a private affiliate of CBC Television. Owned by CTVglobemedia, it was the first privately owned television station in Manitoba. It shared its call letters with its former sister station, CKX-FM, owned by Astral Media (formerly Standard Radio).

CKX-TV shared studios with CKX-FM and CKXA-FM (then known as &quot;101.1 The Farm&quot;) on Victoria Avenue in Brandon; CKX-TV&#x27;s transmitter was located in Oakland, Manitoba (it is now occupied by CKY-DT rebroadcaster CKYB-TV, which Bell Media has applied to close).

As a private affiliate of the CBC, the station aired most CBC network programming, but also aired some programs from A. Currently, CBC programming is available through CBC&#x27;s Winnipeg station CBWT, on Westman Cable channel 6, taking up CKX&#x27;s former slot.

In February 2009, CTV announced that CKX was up for sale as CBC would not continue its affiliation agreement. In July 2009, it was announced that Bluepoint Investment Corporation would buy the station for a dollar. However, Bluepoint pulled out of the sale on October 1, resulting in the station&#x27;s closing a day later.

==History==
The station was founded by John Craig and went on the air on January 28, 1955, a day which marked Craig Media&#x27;s start in television broadcasting.

In February 1959, CKX asked Manitoba Telephone System (MTS) to apply to the CBC to extend their television signals to four additional Manitoba communities; Dauphin, Swan River, The Pas and Flin Flon.

For nearly half a century, the station remained under the ownership of Craig Media.

During the early 1980s when the CRTC had called for applications for a new television station serving southern Manitoba, CKX-TV had raised fears that extending CKND-TVs signal into the Westman area would split the revenue from national advertisers which could cause CKX-TV to operate in the red.

In 2004, Craig Media announced a deal to sell its broadcasting assets to CHUM Limited. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 19, 2004, and became official on December 1.

CHUM relaunched the original Craig Media A-Channel stations as new affiliates of Citytv on August 2, 2005, at the same time as the existing NewNet stations picked up the &quot;A Channel&quot; name. It generally left CKX&#x27;s programming alone, though the A-Channel logo was occasionally seen during primetime programming.

On January 15, 2007, master control for CKX-TV was moved back from Portage la Prairie to Brandon.

Ownership changed hands once again on June 22, 2007, as CHUM Limited was sold to CTVglobemedia. Originally, CTVglobemedia wanted to retain CHUM&#x27;s Citytv system and sell CKX-TV, CHUM&#x27;s A-Channel stations, and several speciality channels to Rogers Communications. However, this was denied by the CRTC, and CTV was forced to sell the Citytv stations to Rogers instead. Richard Gray was named the head of news for CKX-TV and the A Channel stations. Gray reports directly to the CTVgm corporate group, as opposed to CTV News, to preserve independent news presentation and management. CKX-TV was CTV&#x27;s first CBC affiliate since selling their CBC stations in Northern Ontario and Saskatchewan to the CBC in 2002.

In early 2009, CBC decided it would not renew CKX&#x27;s affiliation agreement past its expiration date of August 31, 2009. When CTV offered to sell the station directly to the CBC for a dollar, they refused, saying they could not afford the station&#x27;s ongoing operational costs, and costs associated with the upcoming digital transition. Because of this, CTV put the station up for sale, saying it would shut it down on August 31 if no buyer was found.

On April 30, 2009, Shaw Communications announced it would purchase CKX, along with two of CTV&#x27;s A stations (CHWI in Windsor, Ontario and CKNX in Wingham, Ontario) from CTVgm for a dollar each. However, it was reported on June 30 that Shaw had backed out of the deal. Instead, on July 16, CTV announced that Bluepoint Investment Corporation, a new company owned by media veteran Bruce Claassen, would buy CKX for a dollar. The deal was planned to close by December 31, 2009, pending CRTC approval. Bluepoint intended to keep at least some CBC programming, though CKX was still a full CBC affiliate after August 31.
However, Bluepoint pulled out of the sale on October 1, citing inability to get satellite coverage. As a result, CTV shut the station down the next day, after its 6 PM newscast, bringing the station to show a screen thanking viewers for several hours. The last image televised on CKX-TV before going to black was the corporate logo and copyright notice for CTVglobemedia. The station&#x27;s website, ckxtv.com, also switched to a slate, thanking viewers and directing them to localtvmatters.ca and redirecting to the Bravo Canada website, to learn about CTV&#x27;s position that local television was being endangered.

The station was the second major TV station in Canada to have gone dark since 1977 (when CFVO-TV in Hull, Quebec left the air; all other defunct stations in Canada became repeaters of other stations almost seamlessly), the other being CHCA-TV in Red Deer, Alberta, closing about one month before CKX. The station&#x27;s license is still active after the station&#x27;s closure, although CHCA&#x27;s license was revoked in December 2009, and CFVO-TV&#x27;s license was transferred to Radio-Quebec (now Télé-Québec) as that station later became CIVO-TV. The Access Alberta stations CIAN-DT and CJAL-DT went dark on August 31, 2011. Two months later, it was Quebecor-owned CKXT-TV, which went dark on November 1, 2011.

By the time the CBC closed down its network of rebroadcasters on July 31, 2012, the network never reestablished an aerial presence in Brandon.

==Digital television==
Before its closure in 2009, CKX had not begun broadcasting in digital on its allocated channel 49.

Had the station remained on the air, after the phaseout of analogue television in Canada on August 31, 2011, CKX-DT was to remain on 49. With the use of PSIP, television receivers would have displayed CKX-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as 5. Following the station&#x27;s closedown, the allocations for its analog and digital frequencies became open for future stations.

==News==
CKX aired a one-hour local noon program, &quot;The Noon Show&quot;, from 12 noon to 1 p.m. daily while it also aired a live one-hour evening newscast, &quot;CKX News at 6&quot;, from 6 to 7 p.m. every weekday. CKX used to air a late-night half-hour newscast from 11 to 11:30 p.m. until cuts were made to the station in the 1990s and 2000.

Despite its local orientation, CKX news programming generally lagged in the ratings behind Winnipeg-based CTV station CKY-TV, which has a rebroadcaster in Brandon but limited news coverage of the region.

==Notable former on-air staff==
* Shawn Churchill – former sports anchor
* Darren Dreger – former sports anchor, now with TSN
* Dawna Friesen 
* Leah Hextall – former sports anchor, now with ESPN
* Jill Officer – former reporter

==Transmitters==
These were CKX&#x27;s rebroadcasters at the time of its closure.
* CKX-TV-1 11 Foxwarren
* CKX-TV-2 9 Melita
* CKX-TV-3 11 McCreary

<text>Arnulf de Montgomery (born 1066; died 1118/1122) was an Anglo-Norman magnate. He was a younger son of Roger de Montgomery and Mabel de Bellême. Arnulf&#x27;s father was a leading magnate in Normandy and England, and played an active part in the Anglo-Norman invasion of Wales in the late eleventh century. 

Following the Montgomerys&#x27; successes against the Welsh, Arnulf established himself at Pembroke, where an earth and timber castle was erected, and was probably rewarded with the title Earl of Pembroke.

At the turn of the twelfth century Arnulf reached height, with his lordship including much of the former Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth as well as various lands in Yorkshire. Not long after reaching this apex of his career, Arnulf assisted his eldest surviving brother, Robert de Bellême, in a rebellion against Henry I, King of England. It was also about this time that Arnulf married a daughter of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster, in what appears to have been an effort to gain military support against the English Crown. 

Following the ultimate collapse of the rebellion, however, the Montgomerys were outlawed and banished from the realm, and Arnulf appears to have spent much of the next twenty-odd years in a peripatetic life in Ireland and Normandy. Arnulf&#x27;s career exemplifies the opportunities available to younger sons of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Arnulf appears to have died between 1118 and 1122. A tombstone in Tulsk, Ireland bears the name of Arnoul (Arnulf) and the date 1122. 

Arnulf and his wife Lafracoth (daughter of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster) are known to have left one daughter, Alice, who was born circa 1115; however, according to Europäische Stammtafeln, Arnulf and Lafracoth had two children, Robert and Alice, who would have progeny.

==Background==

Arnulf was likely born in the late 1060s, possibly about 1066. He was a younger son of Roger de Montgomery, Vicomte of the Hièmois and Mabel de Bellême. Arnulf&#x27;s parents likely married in about 1050. His mother was a daughter of, and eventual heiress of, William de Bellême, Lord of Alençon. Arnulf&#x27;s father, a kinsman and close companion of William II, Duke of Normandy, was an eminent magnate in Normandy. As tutor to Matilda, Duchess of Normandy, Roger and his eldest sons did not embark on the 1066 Norman invasion of England. When William returned to Normandy as king in 1067, Roger accompanied him back to England, and was granted extensive lands, including the Sussex rapes of Arundel and Chichester, followed by the county of Shropshire. Soon afterwards, Roger was made Earl of Shrewsbury. By 1086, he was one of the wealthiest tenants-in-chief in England. Arnulf makes his first appearance in the historical record at about this time when he and his elder brother, Roger de Poitou, witnessed William&#x27;s confirmation of their father&#x27;s grant to the Norman abbey of Troarn in 1082/1083.

In 1088, Roger and at least three of his sons participated in plot to eject William Rufus, King of England from the throne with the intent to replace him with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, William Rufus&#x27; elder brother. This rebellion is documented by several sources, such as the ninth- to twelfth-century &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, and the twelfth-century texts &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot;, &quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot;, and &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;. According to the &quot;E&quot; version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;—the only strictly contemporary source of the four—Robert Curthose&#x27;s followers captured Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and thereby gained control of the castle of Rochester. This source identifies several leading members of the insurrection, including three unnamed sons of Roger. Whilst it is possible that these brothers were Roger&#x27;s eldest sons Robert de Bellême, Hugh de Montgomery, and Roger de Poitou, it is not impossible that the latter took no part in the rising, and that the third brother was in fact Arnulf himself. Although the rebellion was an ultimate failure, the king imposed no penalty upon Roger, and allowed Roger de Poitou to be reinstated with most of the lands that the eleventh-century &quot;Domesday Book&quot; shows he previously held.

==Rise==
Arnulf&#x27;s father was one of three close supporters of the king who were settled along the Anglo-Welsh border, in a region known as the Welsh marches. Although the first real penetration of Anglo-Norman power occurred in the 1070s, it wasn&#x27;t until the last decade of the eleventh century that more permanent marcher settlements were envisaged in Wales. In 1093, encroaching marcher lords engaged and slew Rhys ap Tewdwr, King of Deheubarth in Brycheiniog. Contemporaries marked Rhys&#x27; fall as the end of kingship amongst the Welsh, and his demise left a power-vacuum in which men such as Arnulf seized upon. The south-west Welsh (&quot;countries&quot;) of Ceredigion and Dyfed were thus overwhelmed and settled by the conquering incomers. In the latter (&quot;country&quot;), Arnulf&#x27;s father founded an earth and timber castle in which Arnulf established himself. This ringwork, strategically seated on the highest point of a promontory between two tidal inlets, sat on the site where the castle of Pembroke stands today. Although nothing now remains of the original castle, it is described by the twelfth-century &quot;Itinerarium Kambriæ&quot; as a &quot;slender fortress built of stakes and turf&quot;.

William Rufus subsequently rewarded Arnulf with a lordship seated at his castle. There is substantial evidence indicating that Arnulf was, in fact, made Earl of Pembroke. For example, he was accorded forms of the Latin style by Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, &quot;Itinerarium Kambriæ&quot;, the twelfth-century &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot;, the twelfth-century &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, the twelfth-century &quot;Warenne Chronicle&quot;, and the cartulary of the abbey of Saint-Martin de Sées. The castle at Pembroke is remarkable in the fact that, unlike other Anglo-Norman or English fortresses in west Wales, it never fell into the hands of the Welsh. At some time between 1097 and 1108, Arnulf&#x27;s castellan at Pembroke, Gerald de Windsor, married Rhys&#x27; daughter, Nest. According to &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, Arnulf captured and imprisoned Rhys&#x27; young son, Hywel, before the latter was able to escape after suffering certain bodily injuries. Having established himself at Pembroke, Arnulf appears to have resided in England, leaving Gerald at Pembroke as his or steward.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1094, Arnulf&#x27;s elder brother, Hugh de Montgomery, inherited the earldom of Shrewsbury. Surviving sources reveal that the brothers were closely associated with each other. Within two years they made a joint grant to the far-off abbey of La Sauve-Majeure. Furthermore, Arnulf appears to have witnessed a grant of Hugh de Montgomery&#x27;s to the abbey, in a charter dated to 1095–1098. In a Latin grant to the abbey of Saint-Martin de Sées, founded by his father, Arnulf bestowed a donation on behalf of his ancestors, lord, friends, and &quot;very dear brother Hugh&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Although the particular wording in this grant may reveal genuine affection for his brother, these &quot;acta&quot; as a whole could reveal that Arnulf was regarded as the heir of the unmarried and childless Hugh de Montgomery, and that William Rufus intended to acknowledge this inheritance as well.

Partly as a result of the political conquest of Wales in the late eleventh century, the Anglo-Norman Church endeavoured to subjugate and exploit the Welsh Church. From the perspective of the English Crown, the Welsh Church was isolated, archaic, deviant, and backward-looking. Conversely, Anglo-Normans regarded themselves as religious reformers, and sought to impose their own standards and practices upon the Welsh. One way in which the Anglo-Normans imposed their ecclesiastical authority upon the Welsh was through the appointment and control of bishops. Within a year of his consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1093, Anselm temporarily suspended the Welsh bishops of Glamorgan and St David&#x27;s, revealing that these diocesan territories had fallen under Canterbury&#x27;s ecclesiastical authority. In May 1095, Wilfrid, Bishop of St David&#x27;s came to terms with Anselm. In turn, the latter admonished several leading Anglo-Normans holding lands in the diocese of St David&#x27;s, urging them to regard Wilfrid as their bishop, and to return the lands, tithes, and churches that they had unjustly seized from him. Two marcher lords specifically singled out by Anselm were Arnulf and Robert de Bellême. In fact, the ravaging of the lands of St Davids in 1097 by Arnulf&#x27;s steward at Pembroke, Gerald, is recorded by the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century &quot;Brenhinedd y Saesson&quot;, &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; versions of the eleventh- to thirteenth-century &quot;Annales Cambriæ&quot;. As a friend of the archbishop, Arnulf may have been more liable to respect this call of restraint from Anselm than from anyone else.

In 1098, together with Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester, Hugh de Montgomery led a summer invasion of Gwynedd. Although the Anglo-Normans easily defeated the Welsh defenders, the attackers were later overwhelmed on Anglesey in an encounter with the forces of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway. Arnulf appears to have learned of his brother&#x27;s fate about a month later in Normandy, since he travelled to Sées, and founded a priory of the abbey&#x27;s monks at Pembroke in dedication to the memory of Hugh de Montgomery and his father. Although Arnulf may well have hoped to inherit his brother&#x27;s title and lands, William Rufus granted them to Arnulf&#x27;s older brother Robert de Bellême, who had captured Helias de la Flèche, Count of Maine only months before, dutifully handing the count over to the king.

==Downfall==
 
At the turn of the twelfth century, the Montgomerys were one of the leading families in England. At this point, Robert de Bellême had reached the height of his power, and appears to have been the most powerful and prosperous magnate in the Anglo-Norman world. Besides inheriting the expansive continental lands of the Montgomery and Bellême families, and succeeding to the earldom of Shrewsbury and the rape of Arundel, Robert de Bellême also obtained the honour of Tickhill in Nottinghamshire and southern Yorkshire. Furthermore, by right of his wife&#x27;s inheritance, Robert de Bellême gained the small but important continental county of Ponthieu. His brother, Roger de Poitou, was one of the most powerful magnates in northwest England, holding lands in Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Essex, Yorkshire, and Suffolk. By right of his wife, he gained the continental county of La Marche. As for their brother, Arnulf, he likely held the Earldom of Pembroke, a lordship which appears to have constituted the core of the former Kingdom of Deheubarth. Arnulf gained the lordship of Holderness, following the downfall of its former lord, the disgraced Odo, Count of Champagne.

In August 1100, whilst Robert Curthose was absent en route from the Holy Land, the reigning William Rufus was killed, and the vacant English throne was seized by their younger brother, Henry, Count of the Cotentin. Fearing an invasion from Normandy by Robert Curthose, an early act of Henry&#x27;s reign was an alliance with Robert II, Count of Flanders, formalised by treaty in March 1101. One of the guarantors recorded lending surety for the English king was Arnulf himself. Guarantors to such acts often led negotiations between involved parties, which could indicate that Arnulf acted as an intermediary between the king and count. Although his involvement on Henry&#x27;s behalf further evidences Arnulf&#x27;s considerable status, his career in the king&#x27;s service was short-lived.

Although Robert de Bellême had initially accepted Henry as king, by the time Robert Curthose asserted his claim to the throne at Alton in 1101, Robert de Bellême was supporting the duke&#x27;s cause. According to &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, the king spent a year collecting evidence against Robert de Bellême; and in 1102, Henry summoned the latter, charging him with forty-five different offences against himself and Robert Curthose. According to &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, Arnulf was likewise summoned and charged. Arnulf appears to have fled to Wales, and &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; records that Robert de Bellême fortified his English castles against Henry&#x27;s men. Whilst Robert de Bellême made alliances with the Welsh, Arnulf reached out to the Irish. Specifically, &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; reveals that Arnulf sent Gerald of Windsor to Ireland in order to arrange military assistance from Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The alliance was formalised by a remarkable marriage between Arnulf and one of Muirchertach&#x27;s daughters, the record of which is preserved by &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, &quot;Brenhinedd y Saesson&quot;, &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, and alluded to by the eleventh- to fourteenth-century &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot;. These sources are further corroborated by a particular letter from Muirchertach to Anselm,—perhaps dating to about 1105 or 1106/1107,—in which Muirchertach expressed his gratitude to the archbishop for intervening with Henry on behalf of &quot;my son-in-law Arnulf&quot;. Although the native Gaelic form of the bride&#x27;s name is unknown for certain, &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; names her &quot; in Latin. One possibility is that her name represents . Another is that it represents .

What specifically motivated Muirchertach to agree to an alliance is unknown. It certainly brought him into close contact with one of Europe&#x27;s leading families. One possibility is that he was attempting to enhance his status on an international stage. He may have also sought to secure the valuable trade route from south Wales and the Bristol Channel to Waterford. His involvement may well have formed part of a larger plan to not only increase power in Ireland but further exert influence throughout the Irish Sea region. As for Arnulf, the marital alliance could have been undertaken in an attempt to enhance his own status in society. On the other hand, the marriage may have been a path by which Arnulf or his brother attempted to gain access to Muirchertach&#x27;s military might. Furthermore, the alliance may have been coordinated as a means to gain the neutrality of Muirchertach&#x27;s powerful ally, Magnús, the king who had killed Hugh de Montgomery in 1098. Alternately, the Montgomerys may have intended to enlist military assistance from Magnús. Certainly, &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; states that Henry was greatly concerned with Magnús&#x27; presence in the region, although there is no evidence that the Norwegians assisted the rebels. Despite the fact that &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; reports that Muirchertach lent the two brothers military support, and the distinct possibility that Roger de Poitou aided them as well, the Bellême-Montgomery insurrection ended in utter failure.

Surviving sources give differing accounts of the rebellion. Arnulf&#x27;s principal contribution appears to have been his participation in a predatory strike into Staffordshire. According to the twelfth-century &quot;Historia regum Anglorum&quot; and &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot;, Robert de Bellême and Arnulf, supported by Welsh allies, ravaged a part of the county, before carrying off livestock and men to Wales. The detailed account of the general uprising preserved by &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; appears to be the most reliable record of events. This source reveals that, following Robert de Bellême&#x27;s flight from the king&#x27;s summons, Henry appears to have raised a feudal host consisting of his tenants-in-chief (who owed him knight-service) and the old English &quot;fyrd&quot; (a levy of one armed man from about every five hides or six carucates). Both &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot; and &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; and state that Henry&#x27;s host besieged the castle of Arundel for three months before its capitulation, after which the king led his forces to the castle of Tickhill which immediately surrendered. After temporarily standing down his army, Henry resumed operations in the autumn, he is recorded to have seized the castle of Bridgnorth after a three-week siege. At about this point, William Pantulf, a former vassal of the Montgomerys, is stated to have offered his services to Robert de Bellême. Upon being rebuffed by the latter, William Pantulf is recorded to have gone over to Henry&#x27;s side, and was apparently instrumental in convincing Robert de Bellême&#x27;s Welsh allies desert him and support the king instead. &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; specifically states that Iorwerth ap Bleddyn, a leading Welshman, was bought off by the king and began to harry his former ally&#x27;s lands. After Henry&#x27;s forces marched to Shrewsbury itself, &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; records that Robert de Bellême&#x27;s submitted to the king in person. Defeated, the three surviving sons of Roger de Montgomery were banished from the kingdom, with their lands and titles declared forfeit.

==Aftermath==

Whilst Robert fled to the continent, surviving sources suggest that Arnulf—and likely others from the ill-fated insurrection—sought refuge in Ireland. Certainly, &quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot; makes note of a deterioration in relations between Muirchertach and Henry before an English trade embargo forced reconciliation upon the Irish. One possibility is that this episode occurred as a consequence Muirchertach&#x27;s alliance with the Montgomerys, and his part in their rebellion. Furthermore, &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; claims that Arnulf and other Normans assisted the Muirchertach in a military capacity, apparently against the forces of Magnús himself. However, after the latter fell in battle against Muirchertach&#x27;s forces, this source states that the Irish turned upon the Normans, and that Muirchertach forced Arnulf from Ireland altogether. In fact, the details of this account are likely erroneous, as Magnús appears to have fallen against the Ulaid, not Muirchertach&#x27;s men. The claim of Arnulf&#x27;s flight from Ireland, and Muirchertach&#x27;s enmity against him, may be mistaken as well, especially in light of the emphatic letter between Muirchertach and Anselm concerning Arnulf. Such mediation between the Irish and English monarchs would seem to have been conducted whilst Arnulf was a resident at Muirchertach&#x27;s royal court. In any event, the account preserved by &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; may be evidence of English mercenarial involvement in Ireland during Henry&#x27;s reign. It is conceivable that Arnulf did indeed campaign in Ireland on behalf of Muirchertach, and that the latter&#x27;s marital alliances with Magnús and Arnulf in 1102 were undertaken in the context of offsetting Muirchertach&#x27;s main rival, Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain. It may have been that Muirchertach regarded Arnulf as insurance against the prospect of future treachery from Magnús. Whatever the case, unfortunately for Muirchertach, not only was Magnús slain in a skirmish in the following year, but Muirchertach&#x27;s forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of Domnall&#x27;s forces at Mag Coba. If there is any truth to the claim of Arnulf being driven from Ireland, it is possible that &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; may evince an attempt by Muirchertach to mend fractured relations with Henry.

Robert Curthose initially agreed to support Henry against the banished Robert de Bellême, who was now in Normandy and hostile to the duke. At some point before June 1103, Arnulf appears to have betrayed his brother&#x27;s trust, since &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; states that Arnulf took the castle of Alménêches, a Montgomery family stronghold, and handed it over to the duke. It may have been at this point that Arnulf sought refuge in Ireland. Whatever the case, Robert de Bellême&#x27;s efforts to recover the castle led to his razing of the nearby nunnery of Alménêches, where his sister, Emma, was abbess. By 1104, his military successes against the duke forced the latter to come to terms. With Robert de Bellême and Robert Curthose thus reconciled, Henry turned against the two and finally defeated them in battle, near the castle of Tinchebray in September 1106. Although a version of &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; suggests that Arnulf took part in the battle, the account of Arnulf&#x27;s earlier betrayal at Alménêches preserved by &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; may contradict this. Despite the correspondence evidencing Anselm&#x27;s reconciliation of Henry with Arnulf, the latter never held land in England ever again, and appears to have endured a peripatetic career for about twenty years. Evidence that he visited England, at least on one occasion, may be preserved by &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot; which states that Arnulf made a returning voyage from Normandy (&quot;&quot;).

Between 1110 and 1112, Robert de Bellême involved himself in uprisings in southern Normandy, encouraged by Henry&#x27;s opponent, the recently inaugurated Foulques, Count of Anjou and Maine. Henry responded by bringing charges against Robert de Bellême, and finally seizing him in November 1112. The latter&#x27;s lands were declared forfeit, and he was imprisoned by the king for the rest of his life. During the first quarter of the twelfth century, Arnulf attested eight charters of Foulques, making Arnulf one of the count&#x27;s most frequent witnesses. In about 1114, Arnulf witnessed an act between his great-niece, Philippa, Countess of Poitou, and Bernard-Aton, Vicomte of Béziers. Arnulf&#x27;s influence at Foulques&#x27;s court appears to be evidenced by particular actions in 1118. That year the townsfolk of Alençon rebelled against Henry and their lord Stephen, Count of Mortain, whilst the latter were campaigning against a continental coalition attempting to replace the king with Robert Curthose&#x27;s illegitimate son, William Clito. The region of Alençon was a former power centre of the Bellême family, and according to &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, the townsfolk requested that Arnulf intervene with Foulques on their behalf against Stephen&#x27;s injustices and oppression. In what turned out to be Henry&#x27;s single greatest defeat, Foulques&#x27; troops then seized the town and besieged the citadel, before crushing Henry&#x27;s relief forces, after which Foulques secured the citadel once and for all. Arnulf, probably now in his fifties, is not noted in any of the surviving sources documenting the clash. Nevertheless, he and his family could well have been responsible for an uprising that appears to flared up at about the same time in former Montgomery-Bellême lands in central Normandy. This insurrection seems to have contributed to Henry&#x27;s restoration of much of the former Montgomery-Bellême lands in Normandy to Robert de Bellême&#x27;s son, William III, Count of Ponthieu, in June 1119.

The next certain record concerning Arnulf occurs in 1122, when his name is listed in a mortuary roll, circulated after the death of churchman Vitalis of Savigny, in which the nuns of the abbey of Alménêches commemorated him, his parents, and his younger brother Philip. Arnulf, therefore, died sometime between 1118 and 1122. The depiction of Arnulf&#x27;s death preserved by &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; is likely unhistorical. This account relates that, following Magnús&#x27; death, Arnulf was forced from Ireland by Muirchertach, only to return about twenty years later, whereupon he remarried the latter&#x27;s daughter, and died following the feast. Eminent authorities assert that Arnulf left by his wife Lafracoth, a daughter, Alice, who married Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan.

==Legacy==
There are numerous instances where contemporaries noted members of the Montgomery family for unusual cruelty—Robert de Bellême in particular. According to &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, Mabel was murdered by a vassal, a particular act that may evidence her unpleasantness. &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; describes Hugh de Montgomery as the only &quot;mild and loveable&quot; () of Mabel&#x27;s sons, whilst Welsh sources present him in a much more negative light. A source concerning Arnulf may be &quot;Planctus Ricemarch&quot;, a sorrowful Latin lament composed by scholar Rhygyfarch ap Sulien. This source—a contemporary composition bewailing the cultural upheaval and oppression inflicted upon the Welsh after the Anglo-Norman conquests of 1093—may refer to subjugation suffered under Arnulf and his father.

The actions of the Montgomery family illustrate the remarkable speed at which Norman families could spread across far-flung regions. Although Norman families tended to practice primogeniture, the conquest of England and the opening up of Britain contributed a new area of exploitation for landless younger sons of the aristocracy. The careers of younger sons of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy are often obscure, with few surviving sources documenting their activities. The younger sons of Roger de Montgomery and Mabel are an exception, and Arnulf&#x27;s career illustrates the various opportunities available to contemporaries of his rank—men who could not rely upon inheritance alone, and who had to acquire territories of their own. Despite losing his lands later in his career, Arnulf&#x27;s numerous and regular attestations in court circles reveal that he retained substantial personal prestige. The far-flung nature of these attestations may well indicate that his skills as a negotiator were well-known and valued. Indeed, Arnulf&#x27;s career reveals the importance of personal-connections in the courtly-world of the Anglo-Norman era.

Arnulf&#x27;s family—traced with certainty only two patrilineal generations previous—derived its surname from lands now known as Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery, in Calvados, Normandy. Although descendants of Arnulf&#x27;s siblings survived for several generations, the family&#x27;s toponymic surname died with Arnulf.

<doc id="603111" wikidata="Q5631465" url="?curid=603111" title="HMS Aurora (F10)">
<text>HMS &quot;Aurora&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). Like other ships of the class, &quot;Aurora&quot; was named after a figure of mythology, Aurora being the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Eos.

==History==
&quot;Aurora&quot; was built by John Brown &amp; Company, shipbuilders of Clydebank, Scotland. &quot;Aurora&quot; was launched on 28 November 1962 and commissioned on 9 April 1964.

&quot;Aurora&quot; became the leader of the 2nd Frigate Squadron in 1964. From 1967 to 1968, Derek Bazalgette served her as Commanding Officer. On 17 April 1968, her Westland Wasp ASW helicopter from 829 Naval Air Squadron crashed off South Africa. It was replaced by an aircraft from .

In August 1969, &quot;Aurora&quot;, together with the American destroyer and the French destroyer , took part in the commemorations at Théoule-sur-Mer of the 25th anniversary of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France. From 1970 to 1971, Paul Greening served as her Commanding Officer.

On 19 September 1972, while on patrol near the Faroe Islands during the Second Cod War, &quot;Aurora&quot; came to the aid of the Icelandic fishing vessel &quot;Jon Eiriksson&quot; that had caught fire, rescuing the five-person crew of the fishing vessel with the frigate&#x27;s helicopter. Soon after this incident, &quot;Aurora&quot; underwent modernisation which included the addition of the Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile launcher that in effect changed the Batch One ships, of which &quot;Aurora&quot; was part, into a specialised ASW batch rather than its original role as a general-purpose batch. The modernisation was completed in 1976.

In 1978, &quot;Aurora&quot; joined the Fishery Protection Squadron, undertaking patrols and other duties in support of British fishing interests around the UK. She remained with the squadron until she was eventually transferred to the 7th Frigate Squadron, which was stationed in the Far East, just as the RN presence in that region was being reduced.

Further duties were undertaken by &quot;Aurora&quot; across the world and in 1982 she took part in the Armilla Patrol and in 1983 was deployed to the Far East, Australia and New Zealand during the Royal Navy&#x27;s &#x27;Orient Express&#x27; deployment along with HMS Invincible, HMS Rothsay and other RN Ships.

However in 1987, due to defence cuts, as well as manpower shortages, a common problem for the RN at that time, &quot;Aurora&quot; was decommissioned.

<doc id="603113" wikidata="Q7722086" url="?curid=603113" title="The Changeling (play)">
<text>The Changeling is a Jacobean tragedy written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley. Widely regarded as being among the best tragedies of the English Renaissance, the play has accumulated a large amount of critical commentary.

The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 7 May 1622, and was first published in 1652 by the bookseller Humphrey Moseley.

==Authorship==
The title page of the first edition of &quot;The Changeling&quot; attributes the play to Middleton and Rowley. The division of authorship between the two writers was first delineated by Pauline Wiggin in 1897, and is widely accepted. David Lake, in his survey of authorship problems in the Middleton canon, summarises the standard division of shares this way:
: Middleton – Act II; Act III, scenes i, ii, and iv; Act IV, scenes i and ii; Act V, scenes i and ii;
: Rowley – Act I; Act III, scene iii; Act IV, scene iii; Act V, scene iii.
Lake differs from previous commentators only in assigning the first seventeen lines of IV, ii to Rowley. The essential point of the dichotomy is that Rowley wrote the subplot and the opening and closing scenes, while Middleton was primarily responsible for the main plot—a division of labour that is unsurprising, given the examples of other Middleton–Rowley collaborations. The main plot itself derives from a 1621 story collection by John Reynolds.

==Themes and Motifs==
The theme is the treachery that comes as a consequence of sinful human nature. The play expresses this theme through the reference of &quot;original sin&quot; and its consequential &quot;fall&quot;. Subsequently, moral purity is restored after the motives of the main character are revealed. The motif of faulty eyesight is used to express the theme &quot;blindness shuts out the consequences of impulsive acts, and with, what amounts to an idée fixe, the chief characters then seek to impose their wills on an unbending and indifferent world, victimizing those equally as blind&quot;.

==Synopsis==
There are two parallel plots. The main plot in Alicante (&quot;Alligant&quot;) focuses on Beatrice-Joanna; Alonzo, to whom she is betrothed; and Alsemero, whom she loves. To rid herself of Alonzo, Beatrice makes De Flores (who secretly loves her) murder him. This, predictably, has a tragic outcome. The sub-plot in the madhouse involves Alibius and his young wife Isabella. Franciscus and Antonio are in love with her and pretend to be a madman and a fool, respectively, to see her. Lollio also wants her. This ends comically.

===Act I, scene i===
&quot;Outside a church&quot;
Alsemero enters from church and tells us of his love for a woman he met there. Jasperino enters from the harbour, reminding Alsemero that the &quot;wind&#x27;s fair&quot; and that they should leave for Malta. Alsemero tells him that he is not ready to go yet. Alsemero does not give any reason to Jasperino but tells him that he wants to stay back. In truth, he wants to try to stay close to Beatrice. Beatrice enters with Diaphanta and Alsemero greets her. Alsemero had a reputation as asexual, thus Jasperino is surprised to learn that Alsemero has fallen in love with Beatrice. Jasperino watches and makes comments as Beatrice and Alsemero flirt. Alsemero proposes to Beatrice, but, in an aside, she regrets that five days ago she was promised in marriage to Alonzo de Piracquo. Her father (Vermandero) had arranged this marriage for her, although Beatrice is not at all interested in Alonzo. Instead, Beatrice is much taken by Alsemero. Alsemero waits for an answer. Jasperino resolves to get a girl for himself and sees Diaphanta.

Then, De Flores enters to inform Beatrice of her father&#x27;s imminent arrival. Beatrice is always repulsed by De Flores (one of the reasons being that De Flores is physically ugly) and treats him badly. However, as De Flores is besotted with Beatrice, he suffers the abuses she heaps on him just to hear her voice and see her. Beatrice tells him to go away (not only because she dislikes De Flores but also because De Flores disrupts her meeting with Alsemero); he backs off, but still watches her. Jasperino and Diaphanta begin having a conversation full of sexual innuendos. Vermandero joins Beatrice, causing her to change her behaviour. She introduces him to Alsemero; knowing the young man&#x27;s father, Vermandero invites him in to see their castle. Vermandero also talks of Beatrice&#x27;s fiancé, causing her to say goodbye to Alsemero in preparation for her return home. Alsemero is heartbroken hearing talk of Beatrice&#x27;s fiancé; he plans to leave, but Vermandero insists that he stay. As they leave, Beatrice drops her glove. De Flores picks it up and offers it to her but she will not take it as she is disgusted. Beatrice exits and De Flores closes the scene with a soliloquy.

===Act I, scene ii===
&quot;Alibius&#x27;s madhouse&quot;

Alibius starts to tell Lollio a secret. The old man says he cannot satisfy his wife sexually and fears she will be disloyal to him. Therefore, he asks Lollio to guard her and lock her up. Lollio agrees, knowing that he could be left alone with Isabella and may have a chance to have sex with her. Lollio goes on to analyse the two kinds of patients in the mental asylum—fools (people who were born with mental deficiencies) and madmen (people who suffer a degradation of mental health during the course of their lives). He says that Alibius need not fear that Isabella will have sex with fools or madmen. Alibius says he is more concerned with sane tourists who come to view the patients.

Antonio and Pedro enter. Pedro gives Alibius a large sum of money to take care of Antonio. Lollio hints that he wants some too and Pedro grants him his wish. Lollio says that Antonio has almost the appearance of a gentleman and he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to tell Antonio was a fool. Then Pedro asks for Lollio to educate and improve the mind of Antonio (who also goes by &quot;Tony,&quot; a nickname associated in the Renaissance with madness). Lollio replies that he will &quot;make him as wise as myself.&quot; Pedro leaves, and Alibius counts the money. Lollio threatens to whip Antonio, also questioning him with short riddles. Surprisingly, Antonio provides very shrewd answers, which leads Lollio to remark that Antonio is very smart for a fool. The madmen (who are imprisoned in a different enclosure from the fools) begin shouting for food, and Alibius leaves to attend to them. Meanwhile, Lollio takes Antonio to the cells for fools.

===Act II, scene i===
&quot;A chamber in the castle&quot;

Beatrice gives Jasperino a note for Alsemero in secret. In her soliloquy, Beatrice talks of how great Alsemero is (because she thinks that among other things Alsemero has shown sound judgement in choosing someone like Jasperino as his companion) and then how horrible Alonzo de Piracquo is. She says the only reason that she is marrying Alonzo is because her father has forced the choice on her and she cannot disobey her father.

De Flores enters (having eavesdropped on Beatrice&#x27;s proclamations of love for Alsemero) but Beatrice does not see him initially while he talks of Alonzo&#x27;s love for her and her hatred of him. She sees him and gets angry because he stalls from delivering his message. Eventually he says that Alonzo and Tomazo have arrived. After delivering another soliloquy, he exits. Beatrice, repelled by De Flores, says she will get her father to dismiss him.

Then Vermandero, Alonzo and Tomazo enter. Vermandero attempts to be a welcoming host. While Beatrice and Vermandero talk, Tomazo tells his brother that Beatrice did not seem pleased to see him. Alonzo dismisses the remark. After Vermandero informs Alonzo that Beatrice has requested a three-day postponement of their wedding, Tomazo repeats his misgivings. He tells Alonzo not to marry Beatrice because she is in love with someone else. Alonzo refuses to listen, being madly in love and finding no faults in Beatrice. He says he does not think that she was behaving coldly with him.

===Act II, scene ii===
&quot;Another chamber in the castle&quot;

Diaphanta leads Alsemero into a chamber secretly. She is acting on her lady&#x27;s (Beatrice&#x27;s) instructions. However, Diaphanta too is smitten with Alsemero. When Beatrice enters, she leaves the room unwillingly as she was enjoying being alone with Alsemero. Alsemero and Beatrice talk and embrace. They talk about how they could &quot;remove the cause&quot; by killing Alonzo. Alsemero declares he will challenge Piraquo to a duel (meaning Alsemero would end up dead or in jail.) Beatrice protests saying that that wouldn&#x27;t actually help in uniting them but would rather further separate them physically. Beatrice, on an aside, realises that she can use De Flores to kill Alonzo. Beatrice shoves Alsemero back to Diaphanta (who is overjoyed).

De Flores enters, having been hidden. De Flores realises that Beatrice will have to transgress one bond (with Alonzo) if she is to have sex with Alsemero. This acts as a kind of impetus to De Flores who thinks if she breaks a bond once, she may break it several times and even he himself might have a chance to have sex with her. Beatrice decides to flirt with him. She behaves not only civilly but also amorously with him. She promises him some medicine that will cure his bad skin. He is delighted at her apparent change of heart. She tells him she is being forced to marry a man she hates, and De Flores realises she wants him to murder Alonzo. In return, she gives him some money, and says a greater reward (by which she means more money but which De Flores assumes as an offer for sex) awaits him if he successfully completes the task. De Flores kneels before her (he is also a gentleman) and agrees readily to commit the murder, thinking he&#x27;ll be able to sleep with her afterwards. Beatrice says she expects him to leave the country after the murder; she is pleased that she can get rid of De Flores and Alonzo at the same time. Beatrice exits.

Alonzo enters. Alonzo asks De Flores for a tour of the castle. De Flores says he will show him around after dinner. He hides a sword in his cloak.

===Act III, scene i===
&quot;A narrow passage / A vault&quot;

As they descend, De Flores advises that the space is very narrow so Alonzo should find it easier to walk if he leaves his sword behind.

===Act III, scene ii===
De Flores instructs Alonzo to look out a window. While he is doing this, De Flores stabs him three times. De Flores sees a diamond ring on the finger of the dead Alonzo. He tries to remove the diamond ring and take it for himself but he is somehow unable to remove the ring from the dead Alonzo&#x27;s finger. He instead cuts off the entire finger and takes it with him. Then he clears away the body.

===Act III, scene iii===
&quot;Alibius&#x27; madhouse&quot;

Isabella asks Lollio why she has been locked up. Lollio claims it&#x27;s his master&#x27;s wish so that Isabella isn&#x27;t able to venture out and be sexually active with other men. Isabella complains that there are only madmen and fools in the mental asylum. Then she says that she recently saw that a very good-looking patient was admitted and requests Lollio to bring the patient to her. Lollio shows in Franciscus. Isabella asks Lollio how Franciscus went mad. Lollio replies that it was because of spurned love. Isabella remarks that Franciscus seems like a gentleman by the way he speaks. Lollio whips Franciscus for insulting him and for making advances towards Isabella. They soon realise that Franciscus is not really a madman but only pretending to be one, and Lollio puts Franciscus back in his cell.

Lollio brings Antonio to meet Isabella. The madmen make noises, and Lollio goes to beat them. As he leaves, Antonio reveals to Isabella that he is only pretending to be a fool so as to be admitted into the asylum and gain access to her. Antonio tries to undress himself and have sex with Isabella but she is able to avoid it for the time being. Lollio returns to ask Antonio some questions, but leaves again as the madmen start creating a ruckus and Lollio has to manage both cells. After he leaves, Antonio begins kissing Isabella, not knowing Lollio is spying on them. Suddenly madmen dressed as birds interrupt their encounter. Lollio again goes offstage to attend to them. He comes back to return Antonio to his cell. Isabella remarks that one need not go out of the house to seek sexual escapades. Lollio then challenges Isabella about Antonio and tries to sexually molest Isabella in return for keeping it a secret. Alibius enters, oblivious to the conversation, and tells them that Vermandero has invited him to make his patients perform (simply as madmen) at Beatrice&#x27;s wedding.

===Act III, scene iv===
&quot;A chamber in the castle&quot;

Vermandero, Beatrice, Jasperino, and Alsemero enter; only Vermandero does not know about Beatrice and Alsemero. They all leave to look around the castle, except Beatrice. Beatrice says that she&#x27;s starting to convince her father to like Alsemero. De Flores enters with the intention of having sex with Beatrice, thinking this is what she wants too. He tells Beatrice that &quot;Piracquo is no more&quot; and then shows her the finger with the diamond ring. Beatrice says it was the first token that Vermandero made her send to Alonzo. Beatrice asks De Flores to take the ring as it is worth three hundred ducats, then on seeing the fact that De Flores is disappointed, offers another three thousand florins. De Flores is disgusted at the idea of murdering for money; he murdered for the reward of having sex with Beatrice. Beatrice offers to double the amount, but is confused about why De Flores will not leave contented with money, assuming that the amount he wants is much too high to actually announce out loud. She thus suggests he goes out of the country (as she had told him earlier) and send her the amount he wants on paper. He replies that if he leaves, she must too, since they are bound together in guilt. De Flores kisses her in a last-ditch attempt to seal their love, but Beatrice rejects him with disgust. De Flores explains in meticulous detail exactly why she has to submit to him, mainly that he can now effectively blackmail her or else he will inform everyone how she hired him to murder Alonzo. He says that his life is worth nothing if he cannot have her, and therefore is willing to incriminate himself if she does not sleep with him. She tries to impress on him the difference in their social class, but he claims that her evil act has made them equals. She makes one last effort to offer him all her gold, but again he refuses. She eventually realises the vicious cycle of sin that she has entered.

===Act IV, scene i===
&quot;Dumb Show&quot;

Various gentlemen enter, Vermandero meeting them, wondering over the flight of Alonzo. Alsemero, Jasperino and the Gallants enter. Vermandero points to the Gallants, the gentlemen seeming to applaud the choice. Beatrice, in her wedding dress, enters. She is accompanied with Diaphanta, Isabella, and other women.

De Flores enters last, smiling at the &quot;accident&quot;; Alonzo&#x27;s ghost appears to De Flores in the midst of his smile, startling him, and shows him the hand whose finger he had cut off.

Beatrice has yielded to De Flores&#x27;s sexual demands, and has also married Alsemero. Alone in the afternoon in Alsemero&#x27;s room, she feels too ashamed to have sex with her new husband on their wedding night. In Alsemero&#x27;s closet, she finds many medicines. One is a pregnancy test kit and another a virginity test kit. Diaphanta enters, looking for Alsemero. Beatrice tells Diaphanta that she will offer 1000 ducats to any virgin if she secretly has sex with her husband Alsemero, instead of her, on their wedding night. But to test whether Diaphanta is a virgin or not, both of them take the virginity test. The virginity test shows that Beatrice is not a virgin whereas Diaphanta is, as she has exhibited the usual symptoms of first yawning, then sneezing, and finally laughing. They arrange for Diaphanta to go to Alsemero&#x27;s bed that night, in the pitch darkness, and pretend to be Beatrice.

===Act IV, scene ii===
Vermandero finds that two of his gentlemen, Antonio and Franciscus, have left the castle. He issues arrest warrants for them, believing they have murdered Alonzo and fled. Tomazo enters, accusing Vermandero of killing his brother. Vermandero pretends that Alonzo has just run away and it is he, Vermandero, who should actually be offended that his future son-in-law has run away at the last moment. Vermandero says Tomazo should leave too, as he is the brother of an ignoble coward like Alonzo. Vermandero exits.

De Flores enters, and Tomazo greets him warmly, remembering that his brother Alonzo was fond of De Flores. Tomazo even goes on to say that whereas Vermandero is not trustworthy, De Flores is a trustworthy gentleman. All this talk reminds De Flores of Tomazo&#x27;s brother Alonzo whom he killed. De Flores exits. Alsemero enters and Tomazo is hostile towards him. Tomazo challenges Alsemero to a duel after the wedding. Tomazo exits, Jasperino runs in. Jasperino tells Alsemero that he heard Beatrice and De Flores having a conversation similar to one lovers might have. Alsemero instructs Jasperino to go and get the virginity test. Beatrice enters just before Jasperino returns. Alsemero thinks Beatrice looks very different and must have been abused. Alsemero gives Beatrice the potion, and she drinks it, then fakes the symptoms thereby &quot;proving&quot; to Alsemero and Jasperino that she is a virgin.

===Act IV, scene iii===
Lollio and Isabella read a letter in which Franciscus declares that he is only pretending to be a madman to gain access to Isabella and that he is in love with her. Lollio says that if Isabella has sex with Franciscus, then he wants to have sex with her too. Isabella says that if she indeed does commit adultery, she will sleep with him, implying that she has no intention of committing adultery. She asks Lollio how to deal with Antonio and Franciscus&#x27;s attraction to her, and he advises her to abuse them. To that end, she leaves to dress as a madwoman.

Alibius arrives and asks about the wedding. Alibius then asks how Isabella is getting on. Lollio assures him she is fine and he exits. Antonio enters, and Lollio forces him to dance. Lollio exits, and Isabella enters in her new clothes as a madwoman. Isabella attempts to kiss him but Antonio resists, unable to recognise Isabella and disgusted at the idea of being kissed by a madwoman. Antonio confesses that he is no fool but just a gentleman pretending to be a fool. Isabella denounces him for loving her external appearance only. She exits, and Lollio enters, telling Antonio that if he kills Franciscus, he can have sex with Isabella. Franciscus enters, and Lollio reads the letter he wrote to Isabella. Lollio tells him that if he kills Antonio, Isabella will have sex with him. Alibius enters, and Lollio goes to fetch the madmen. All the madmen dance for the wedding.

===Act V, scene i===
It is 2 a.m. and Diaphanta has not yet come out of Alsemero&#x27;s chamber, even though Beatrice had instructed her to finish by midnight. Therefore, Beatrice suspects that Diaphanta is actually enjoying having sex with Alsemero. This leads her to suspect that it must have been Diaphanta who had informed Alsemero of Beatrice&#x27;s loss of virginity (as Diaphanta may have had a chance to figure out that what she and Beatrice indulged in were virginity tests). This leads to Beatrice getting very angry with Diaphanta. De Flores enters. Beatrice is worried that if Diaphanta does not come out before daybreak, Alsemero will be able to see with whom he has had sex with and will recognise his mistake and Beatrice&#x27;s plot will be ruined. De Flores comes up with an idea to get Diaphanta out of the room. He says that he will set Diaphanta&#x27;s chambers on fire and that will wake up the entire house and when Diaphanta returns to her room then De Flores will pretend that he will clean the chimney with a gun but he will kill her with it. Beatrice agrees, even suggesting that she now loves De Flores. Alonzo&#x27;s ghost appears again and haunts De Flores and Beatrice. De Flores lights the fire, offstage, then leads the group of residents who attempt to douse it. Diaphanta appears, and Beatrice tells her to return to her chamber. Vermandero enters, followed by Alsemero and Jasperino. The gunshot is heard, signifying Diaphanta&#x27;s murder. De Flores returns to the stage, heroically carrying Diaphanta&#x27;s burnt body from the fire. De Flores is promised financial reward by Vermandero and others for his bravery in alerting everyone to the fire and thereby preventing further damage.

===Act V, scene ii===
Tomazo, in a sudden fit of misanthropy, decides to blame the next person he sees for the death of his brother (since he holds everyone potentially accountable). De Flores enters. Tomazo becomes enraged. He reiterates Beatrice&#x27;s earlier misgivings about using something that has also been used by De Flores. He says that if his sword were to touch De Flores once, he would not use that sword again, and strikes him. De Flores draws his sword as though to retaliate, but is forcibly reminded of Alonzo&#x27;s murder, and cannot bring himself to strike. De Flores is unnerved by Tomazo&#x27;s sudden, intuitive hostility, and leaves hastily. Alibius and Isabella enter with Vermandero. Tomazo tells them to go away. Vermandero informs Tomazo that he has found Alonzo&#x27;s murderers—Antonio and Franciscus, who were hiding in a mental asylum after committing the murder.

===Act V, scene iii===
Jasperino and Alsemero have seen Beatrice and De Flores together in a garden and are discussing it. Beatrice enters, Jasperino hides. Alsemero accuses Beatrice of being a liar and a whore, and suggests that she&#x27;s been cheating with De Flores. She confesses that she employed De Flores to murder Alonzo, but explains that she did it out of love for Alsemero, because her first motive was to remove Alonzo so that she and Alsemero could be together. Alsemero says he must think about what to do, and locks Beatrice in a closet to wait. De Flores enters, and Alsemero gets him to admit to murder. De Flores, under the impression that Beatrice is attempting to betray and outmanoeuvre him, exposes her infidelity. Alsemero confines him in the closet with Beatrice. Vermandero, Alibius, Isabella, Tomazo, and Franciscus enter, thinking they have solved the case of Alonzo&#x27;s murder. Alsemero also claims he has solved Alonzo&#x27;s murder. As Alsemero begins to reveal the truth, screams of pleasure and of pain are heard within the room, and the pair comes out, Beatrice stabbed by De Flores. Beatrice confesses her fallen state and also that she sent Diaphanta in her place to the bedroom to have sex with Alsemero. De Flores admits to killing Alonzo, stabs himself, and dies before Tomazo can seek revenge. With his last words, De Flores instructs Beatrice to follow him in death, and as she dies, Beatrice asks Alsemero for forgiveness. They speak about changes and changelings. Alsemero says Beatrice was beauty changed to whoredom, he himself a supposed husband changed with wantonness. Antonio says he was changed from a little ass to a great fool and was almost changed to be hanged at the gallows. Franciscus says he was changed from a little wit to stark mad. Alibius says he realises his folly and will change himself and never keep fake patients.

===Epilogue===
The epilogue is a mere eight lines in which Alsemero explains that it is impossible to comfort people after they have lost a person close to them. The only solution is for that person to be replaced, the implication being that the audience must applaud for this &quot;replacement&quot; to occur.

==Film, television and stage adaptations==
In 1974, as part of &quot;Play of the Month&quot;, the BBC broadcast a production directed by Anthony Page and starring Stanley Baker as De Flores, Helen Mirren as Beatrice-Joanna, Brian Cox as Alsemero, Tony Selby as Jasperino and Susan Penhaligon as Isabella. This is available on DVD in the &quot;Helen Mirren at the BBC&quot; box set.

In 1994, a version directed by Simon Curtis removed the madhouse subplot and was broadcast by the BBC starring Elizabeth McGovern as Beatrice-Joanna, Bob Hoskins as De Flores, Hugh Grant as Alsemero and Sean Pertwee as Tomazo. It was broadcast in the United States on the BRAVO cable television network.

A 1998 film version directed by Marcus Thompson starred Guy Williams as Alonso, Amanda Ray-King as Beatrice-Joanna, Ian Dury as De Flores and Colm O&#x27;Maonlai as Alsemero.
Notable stage performances have included the English Stage Company&#x27;s 1960 production with Mary Ure and Robert Shaw, directed by Tony Richardson, and the 1988 National Theatre production starring Miranda Richardson as Beatrice-Joanna and George Harris as De Flores.

A 2009 ITV television tragedy, &quot;Compulsion&quot;, is loosely based on &quot;The Changeling&quot;.

In 2012 the play returned for a new version at London&#x27;s Young Vic theatre. The actors doubled up roles for the main and sub plot, such as Diaphanta and Isabella.

In 2014 Dominic Dromgoole directed the play in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at the Globe Theatre, recreating the performance with the sole use of candlelight for the performance.

In 2016 Jesse Berger directed the play Off-Broadway at Red Bull Theater, in a production which featured Manoel Felciano and Sara Topham. https://www.redbulltheater.com/the-changeling

Between 2016 and 2017 the play was mounted four times around the city of Toronto, first in a text adapted by Julian R. Munds, &quot;Changeling: A Grand Guignol for Murderous times&quot; (dir. Harrison Thomas); then by James Wallis, a&quot;s The Changeling: A Staged Reading&quot;, for his production company Shakespeare BASH&#x27;d; then in association with the Stratford Festival of Canada and the School of Performance at Ryerson University, by Paul Yachnin, a professor of English at McGill University, for Early Modern Conversions; and finally by the Stratford Festival, as a full production at the Tom Patterson Theatre (dir. Jackie Maxwell), starring Mikaela Davies and Ben Carlson.

In 2019, a small-scale tour was mounted by Resurgens Theatre Company, an original practice company led by Dr. Brent Griffin in association with the Atlanta Shakespeare Tavern. The tour was designed for educational audiences and performed in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.

In 2020, during the UK COVID-19 lockdown, a Radio production of the play was created by the graduation year of the Guildford School of Acting. The class composed and recorded the Soundtrack themselves. The production was directed by Tam Williams, and Musical Direction and Sound Editing was overseen by Paul Herbert. More information, and the recording itself is available on https://www.thechangelinggsa.com/

<doc id="603115" wikidata="Q3881939" url="?curid=603115" title="Beyond the Rocks">
<text>Beyond the Rocks is a 1906 novel by Elinor Glyn. The novel was later adapted into a 1922 silent film in which Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino (credited as Rodolph Valentino) starred together for the only time. The film was directed by Sam Wood and distributed by Paramount Pictures.

The novel&#x27;s title comes from a conversation in Chapter 4 about the nature of Fate, where the main character expresses belief that &quot;if one does one&#x27;s best some kind angel will guide one&#x27;s bark [on the river of life] past the rocks and safely into the smooth waters of the pool beyond.&quot; Frequently thereafter, the characters long for angels who will steer them &quot;beyond the rocks.&quot;

==Plot==

The beautiful young Theodora Fitzgerald belongs to a family of noble lineage whose fortunes have waned and who have lived in near poverty for most of her life. The book begins with her arranged marriage to Josiah Brown, a nouveau-riche Australian in his fifties. The marriage was contracted for convenience: Josiah simply wants a pretty and aristocratic wife to improve his standing in society, and the Fitzgerald family are in need of Brown&#x27;s financial resources. Theodora only agrees to the marriage for the sake of her father and sisters.

Immediately after the wedding, Josiah falls ill. Theodora proves a dutiful and capable wife, and attends to her husband&#x27;s every need, though she is secretly very unhappy. After a year of marriage, Josiah is well enough to visit Paris, where Theodora sees her father, Dominic, again for the first time since her wedding. She is thrilled to observe that at least he is receiving all the benefits she&#x27;d hoped to bring from her sacrifice: he now runs in aristocratic circles and is courting a wealthy American widow, Mrs. McBride. Theodora attends several social outings with her father, and at one dinner is introduced to Hector, Lord Bracondale. Theodora and Hector hit things off splendidly, and soon fall in love. Mrs. McBride is aware of Theodora&#x27;s unhappy marriage, and seeing the situation she sympathetically arranges for Hector and Theodora to spend time together as often as possible. One day while Theodora and Hector are being chauffeured back to Paris after an outing at Versailles, the two indulge in a romantic encounter in the back of the car. Full of guilt thereafter, the two conclude they must behave themselves from now on and must no longer pursue each other romantically; they will, however, continue to be friendly to one another any time future social obligations might cause them to meet.

Hector at this point is terribly in love with Theodora, and though he tries his best to live by his promise to her, he still goes out of his way to see her and to secure invitations to all the same gatherings that she attends. He fantasizes about marrying her and makes sure to introduce her to his mother and to his sister. However, Theodora&#x27;s status as a newcomer into society, and the obvious favour that Hector pays her over other eligible women who desire his hand, causes ire and jealousy to be directed her way. Rumors begin to spread, and several people believe Hector and Theodora to be lovers. Morella Winmarleigh, a spurned candidate for Hector&#x27;s hand, particularly sets out destroy Theodora. She maliciously switches a letter Theodora had written to Hector with another letter meant for Josiah. Meanwhile, without anyone else&#x27;s knowledge, Theodora and Hector have concluded that they cannot attempt to remain friends any longer—their love is too strong—and so they must agree to never see each other again.

The next day, Josiah receives Theodora&#x27;s letter meant for Hector: the contents amount to Theodora asking Hector never to see her again, even though the two of them could be very happy together, because it is her duty to instead attend to the happiness of her husband Josiah. Josiah realises for the first time how he has stood in the way of Theodora&#x27;s happiness, and resolves to do his best to make her happy from now on. He forwards the letter to Hector and requests he never allow Theodora to learn of the mix-up. The next several months pass with Theodora and Josiah both trying their best to make the other happy, even while both are secretly miserable. Both begin to suffer from ill health. Ultimately, Josiah dies; eighteen months later, Mrs. McBride (now married to Dominic Fitzgerald) throws a picnic at Versailles to which both Theodora and Hector are invited. The book ends with the couple reunited, in a state of &quot;passionate love and delirious happiness.&quot;

== Publicity ==
The novel was republished in 1922 in an edition by The Macaulay Company which included &quot;illustrations from the Paramount Photo-Play&quot; of Valentino and Swanson.

Publicity at the time described the film as:
:A flaming romance as only the author of &quot;Three Weeks&quot; could write it; as only Gloria Swanson, with dashing Rodolph Valentino playing the lover, could make it live in all its ardent splendor.

:The story of a passionate young heart bound by society&#x27;s conventions, struggling and risking all for sadness:
::— of gay nights of revelry in the Parisian world of fashion.
::— of intrigue and coquetry in the gilded resorts of London high society.

:Never before have such dramatic love scenes, such spectacular adventure been placed before the public. The love-drama with all the thrills and luxury of a lifetime! The one book and picture you&#x27;ll never forget!

<text>The 2000 Democratic National Convention was a quadrennial presidential nominating convention for the Democratic Party. The convention nominated Vice President Al Gore for president and Senator Joe Lieberman from Connecticut for vice president. The convention was held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California from August 14 to August 17, 2000. Gore accepted the presidential nomination on August 17, the final night of the convention.

==Logistics==
===Site selection===

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) initially invited 28 cities to bid for the convention. The &quot;preliminary general requirements&quot; that the Democratic Party asked of bidding cities was to be able to provide 20,000 high-quality hotel rooms within 30 minutes of the venue, and for the venue to capable of holding 25,000 counting both fixed seating and floor seating. Nine cities submitted proposals. Of these, seven cities (Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Philadelphia) received visits from DNC representatives. All except New Orleans were offering new venues that had been constructed in the 1990s. Philadelphia withdrew its bid after being selected as the host of the 2000 Republican National Convention. Boston, Denver, and Los Angeles were named as finalists.

On March 15, 1999, the DNC announced Los Angeles as the site of the convention. This was the second Democratic National Convention to be held in Los Angeles, with the first having been the 1960 convention. The other finalist cities would host the two following Democratic National Conventions; Boston hosted the 2004 convention while Denver hosted the 2008 convention.

Co-chairman of the committee leading Los Angeles&#x27; bid for the convention included Eli Broad and David Geffen, among others. The effort for Los Angeles to host was modeled after the private/public venture used to stage the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The city decided to bid only for the Democratic convention, and not seek the Republican convention because they felt that the odds of Republicans holding a convention in California was unlikely since the 1996 Republican National Convention was in San Diego, California.

===Scheduling===
Since the mid-20th century or earlier, it has been tradition for the party of the incumbent president to hold their convention after that of the other major party. In 2000, Republicans held their convention July 31 through August 3.

On April 16, 1999 Chair of the Democratic National Committee Joe Andrew announced that the convention would take place August 14–17.

===Corporate partnerships===
United Airlines was named the convention&#x27;s &quot;official airline&quot; on August 19, 1999. AT&amp;T served as the primary technology partner for the convention, as well as a lead corporate sponsor. Event411.com served as the &quot;official event-planning provider&quot; of the convention.

===Security===
At both the 2000 major party presidential nominating conventions, security was heightened compared to that of past conventions.

Crowd control security concerns were heightened at the Democratic convention due to a number of the organizations behind the activities of the 1999 Seattle WTO protests pledging to protest in Los Angeles during the convention. Also, still in recent memory, was the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

In the fall of 1999, the Democratic National Convention Committee established a security task force, bringing together the convention&#x27;s logistics team, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Fire Department, the United States Secret Service, and other agencies of the federal, state, and municipal levels.

Ken Banner served as the convention&#x27;s director of security.

===Stage design===
Per a Democratic National Convention Committee&#x27;s press release, the stage of the convention was elevated five feet above the floor of the arena, was roughly 3,700 square feet in area (with the podium measuring 1,825 square feet, the orchestra measuring 1,225 square feet, and the camera turrets measuring 720 square feet), and had and had a 18x30 foot video screen.

The podium&#x27;s lectern was able to be mechanically lowered beneath the stage, and the walls located behind both sides of the lectern could also be raised from on the stage.

The podium was painted with water-based non-toxic paint, with the colors being Red 199, Blue 300, TV White (Cool Gray #3), and Metal Effects platinum #ME222.

Rene Lagler, who had been the interior designer for the 1988, 1992, and 1996 conventions, designed the podium, in addition to designing the central camera platform and also working on both the convention&#x27;s interior and exterior design.

Bob Dickenson served as the convention&#x27;s lighting designer, and Batrick Baltzell served as its audio designer.

==Convention leadership==
Ron Gonzales and Blanche Lincoln served as co-chairs of the convention&#x27;s credentials committee. Mary Landrieu and Gary Locke served as co-chairs of the convention&#x27;s rules committee.

The co-chairs of the convention&#x27;s platform committee were Sharon Sayles Belton and Dick Durbin. Its vice chairs included Bob Butterworth, James Hunt Jr., Jack Reed.

=== Hillary Clinton ===
=== Gray Davis ===
Governor of California Gray Davis delivered remarks on both the first and third days of the convention.

His first speech was a welcoming speech on behalf of the host state of the convention. In it, he harkened back to the 1960 Democratic National Convention held in Los Angeles 40 years earlier, which nominated John F. Kennedy for president, and declared, &quot;we remain the new frontier President Kennedy envisioned here. And our party still embodies the spirit of service and duty he called to life.&quot;. He highlighted a number of values and issues that he argued were promoted by Democratic Party.

=== Chris Dodd ===
=== Harold Ford Jr. ===

The keynote speaker of the convention was Congressman Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee. Ford spoke on the second night of the convention.

Ford, who, at 30, was at the time the youngest member of Congress, directed his speech towards younger voters, saying, &quot;I also stand here representing a new generation, a generation committed to those ideals and inspired by an unshakable confidence in our future.&quot;

=== Dick Gephardt ===
Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives Dick Gephardt of Missouri spoke on the convention&#x27;s third night. In his speech, he criticized the Republican majority in both chambers of the United States Congress for. He characterized them as unwilling to pass a patients&#x27; bill of rights, a Medicare prescription benefit, campaign reform, and gun safety measures.

===Al Gore===

Al Gore delivered his presidential nomination acceptance speech on the final night of the convention.

Gore&#x27;s acceptance speech focused on the future saying, &quot;We&#x27;re entering a new time, we&#x27;re electing a new president, and I stand here tonight as my own man. I want you to know me for who I truly am.&quot; He mentioned President Clinton only once near the beginning of the speech. The speech was focused on issues: &quot;I&#x27;m here to talk seriously about the issues. I believe people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do. I intend to tell you tonight. You ought to be able to know, and then judge for yourself.&quot;

===Tipper Gore===
===Jesse Jackson===
Jesse Jackson, founder, president and CEO of the Rainbow/Push Coalition; former United States shadow senator from the District of Columbia; and candidate for the 1984 and 1988 Democratic presidential nominations, spoke on the convention&#x27;s second evening.

In his speech, Jackson criticized the Republican convention held two weeks earlier, commenting, &quot;Two weeks ago, in Philadelphia, the nation was treated to a stage show - smoke, mirrors, hired acts that Republicans called inclusion. That was the inclusion illusion. In Philadelphia, diversity ended on the stage. They could not mention the words Africa, Appalachia, or AIDS once. So it is good to be here in Los Angeles, to look over this great assembly and see the real deal - the quilt of many patches that is America.&quot;

Jackson strongly praised the selection of Lieberman as Gore&#x27;s running mate, while criticizing Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney.

Jackson named a number of issues where he argued Gore and Lieberman held the moral high ground over Bush and Cheney.

Jackson characterized the Republicans as a &quot;grizzly old team&quot; seeking to give tax breaks to the rich. He warned voters that a Bush victory would not just bring Bush to power, but also a &quot;team&quot; comprised Republicans such as Dick Armey, Bob Barr, Tom DeLay, Jesse Helms, and Strom Thurmond. Jackson urged America to, &quot;stay out of the Bushes&quot;, a phrase which the audience began chanting.

=== Tommy Lee Jones ===
Actor Tommy Lee Jones, who had been college roommates with Al Gore, delivered a nominating speech for Gore on the convention&#x27;s third night. Jones recounted his friendship with Gore, and hailed Gore&#x27;s character.

=== Ted Kennedy ===
===Hadassah Lieberman===

Hadassah Lieberman, the wife of the vice presidential nominee, delivered an introduction before her Husband&#x27;s acceptance speech on the convention&#x27;s third night.

===Joe Lieberman===
Lieberman delivered his vice presidential nomination acceptance speech on the third night of the convention, despite the fact that he would not be formally nominated until the next day.

Vice-presidential nominee Lieberman invoked the spirit of John F. Kennedy in his speech, saying: &quot;Tonight, I believe that the next frontier isn&#x27;t just in front of us, but inside of us--to overcome the differences that are still between us, to break down the barriers that remain and to help every American claim the possibilities of their own lives.&quot;

==Protests==

Large scale, sometimes violent protests took place outside of the Staples Center as well as throughout downtown Los Angeles. Protest groups ranged from anti-abortion supporters, to homeless activists, to anti-globalization protestors, and anarchists. Out of increased fear after the surprise mass-protests at the 1999 &quot;Battle for Seattle&quot; WTO protests, media coverage and LAPD concern were heightened for the event.

Concerns were further raised when violent riots also broke out after the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2000 National Basketball Association Championship only a few months before the convention. Originally, a &quot;Protest Zone&quot; was designated a city block away from the Staples Center, but a court order forced the zone moved immediately adjacent to the arena, in a parking lot.

The protests became violent during the first evening of the convention, and many different protests, some orderly, some violent, took place over the full four days of the convention. There were numerous arrests, injuries and property damage, but the protests were less than originally feared. The band Rage Against the Machine played outside the convention showing its disdain of the policies being promoted inside the building.

== After the convention ==
In November, Al Gore narrowly lost to Texas Governor George W. Bush in the general election having won the popular vote but losing the electoral vote in a decision handed down more than a month after the election by the Supreme Court. This decision read as follows: &quot;Noting that the Equal Protection clause guarantees individuals that their ballots cannot be devalued by &#x27;later arbitrary and disparate treatment,&#x27; the per curiam opinion held 7–2 that the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s scheme for recounting ballots was unconstitutional. Even if the recount was fair in theory, it was unfair in practice. The record suggested that different standards were applied from ballot to ballot, precinct to precinct, and county to county. Because of those and other procedural difficulties, the court held, 5 to 4, that no constitutional recount could be fashioned in the time remaining&quot;.

<text>A gravestone or tombstone is a marker, usually stone, that is placed over a grave. A marker set at the head of the grave may be called a headstone. An especially old or elaborate stone slab may be called a funeral stele, stela, or slab. The use of such markers is traditional for Chinese, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic burials, as well as other traditions. In East Asia, the tomb&#x27;s spirit tablet is the focus for ancestral veneration and may be removable for greater protection between rituals. Ancient grave markers typically incorporated funerary art, especially details in stone relief. With greater literacy, more markers began to include inscriptions of the deceased&#x27;s name, date of birth, and date of death, often along with a personal message or prayer. The presence of a frame for photographs of the deceased is also increasingly common.

== Use ==
The stele (plural: stelae), as it is called in an archaeological context, is one of the oldest forms of funerary art. Originally, a tombstone was the stone lid of a stone coffin, or the coffin itself, and a gravestone was the stone slab (or ledger stone) that was laid flat over a grave. Now, all three terms (&quot;stele&quot;, &quot;tombstone&quot; or &quot;gravestone&quot;) are also used for markers set (usually upright) at the head of the grave. Some graves in the 18th century also contained footstones to demarcate the foot end of the grave. This sometimes developed into full kerb sets that marked the whole perimeter of the grave. Footstones were rarely annotated with more than the deceased&#x27;s initials and year of death, and sometimes a memorial mason and plot reference number. Many cemeteries and churchyards have removed those extra stones to ease grass cutting by machine mower. In some UK cemeteries, the principal, and indeed only, marker is placed at the foot of the grave.

Owing to soil movement and downhill creep on gentle slopes, older headstones and footstones can often be found tilted at an angle. Over time, this movement can result in the stones being sited several metres away from their original location.

Graves and any related memorials are a focus for mourning and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a gravestone over the years, so that one marker may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since gravestones and a plot in a cemetery or churchyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In a Christian context, the very wealthy often erected elaborate memorials within churches rather than having simply external gravestones. Crematoria frequently offer similar alternatives to families who do not have a grave to mark, but who want a focus for their mourning and for remembrance. Carved or cast commemorative plaques inside the crematorium for example may serve this purpose.

== Materials ==

A cemetery may follow national codes of practice or independently prescribe the size and use of certain materials, especially in a conservation area. Some may limit the placing of a wooden memorial to six months after burial, after which a more permanent memorial must be placed. Others may require stones of a certain shape or position to facilitate grass-cutting. Headstones of granite, marble and other kinds of stone are usually created, installed, and repaired by monumental masons. Cemeteries require regular inspection and maintenance, as stones may settle, topple and, on rare occasions, fall and injure people; or graves may simply become overgrown and their markers lost or vandalised.

Restoration is a specialized job for a monumental mason. Even overgrowth removal requires care to avoid damaging the carving. For example, ivy should only be cut at the base roots and left to naturally die off, never pulled off forcefully.

Many materials have been used as markers.

===Stone===
* Fieldstones. In many cultures markers for graves other than enclosed areas, such as planted with characteristic plants particularly in northern Europe the yew, were natural fieldstones, some unmarked and others decorated or incised using a metal awl. Typical motifs for the carving included a symbol and the deceased&#x27;s name and age.
* Granite. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.
* Marble and limestone. Both limestone and marble take carving well. Marble is a recrystallised form of limestone. The mild acid in rainwater can slowly dissolve marble and limestone over time, which can make inscriptions unreadable. Portland stone was a type of limestone commonly used in Englandafter weathering, fossiliferous deposits tend to appear on the surface. Marble became popular from the early 19th century, though its extra cost limited its appeal.
* Sandstone. Sandstone is durable, yet soft enough to carve easily. Some sandstone markers are so well preserved that individual chisel marks are discernible, while others have delaminated and crumbled to dust. Delamination occurs when moisture gets between the layers of the sandstone. As it freezes and expands the layers flake off. In the 17th century, sandstone replaced field stones in Colonial America. Yorkstone was a common sandstone material used in England.
* Slate. Slate can have a pleasing texture but is slightly porous and prone to delamination. Slate was commonly used by colonial New England carvers, especially in Boston where elaborate slate markers were shipped down the Atlantic coast as far south as Charleston and Savanah. It takes lettering well, often highlighted with white paint or gilding. 
* Schist. Schist Was a common material for grave making in the American Colonies during the 17th and 18th Century. While harder to Carve than Sandstone or Slate, lettering and symbols usually had to be carved deeper into the stone and therefore held up well over long periods of time. While not as durable as most slate, most have held up well against the elements.

===Metal, wood and plants===


* Iron. Iron grave markers and decorations were popular during the Victorian era in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, often being produced by specialist foundries or the local blacksmith. Cast iron headstones have lasted for generations while wrought ironwork often only survives in a rusted or eroded state. In eastern Värmland, Sweden, iron crosses instead of stones have been popular since the 18th century.
* White bronze. Actually sand cast zinc, but called white bronze for marketing purposes. Almost all, if not all, zinc grave markers were made by the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, CT, between 1874 and 1914. The company set up subsidiaries in Detroit, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Des Moines; a Chicago subsidiary was named the American Bronze Company, while the St. Thomas White Bronze Monument Company was set up in Ontario, Canada. They are in cemeteries of the period all across the U.S. and Canada. They were sold as more durable than marble, about 1/3 less expensive and progressive.
* Wood. This was a popular material during the Georgian and Victorian era, and almost certainly before, in Great Britain and elsewhere. Some could be very ornate, although few survive beyond 50–100 years due to natural decomposition or termites and other wood boring insects. In Hungary, the &quot;kopjafa&quot; is a traditional carved wooden grave marker.
* Planting. Trees or shrubs, particularly roses, may be planted, especially to mark the location of ashes. This may be accompanied by a small inscribed metal or wooden marker.

== Inscriptions ==
Markers sometimes bear inscriptions. The information on the headstone generally includes the name of the deceased and their date of birth and death. Such information can be useful to genealogists and local historians. Larger cemeteries may require a discreet reference code as well to help accurately fix the location for maintenance. The cemetery owner, church, or, as in the UK, national guidelines might encourage the use of &#x27;tasteful&#x27; and accurate wording in inscriptions. The placement of inscriptions is traditionally placed on the forward-facing side of the memorial but can also be seen in some cases on the reverse and around the edges of the stone itself. Some families request that an inscription be made on the portion of the memorial that will be underground.

In addition, some gravestones also bear epitaphs in praise of the deceased or quotations from religious texts, such as &quot;requiescat in pace&quot;. In a few instances the inscription is in the form of a plea, admonishment, testament of faith, claim to fame or even a curseWilliam Shakespeare&#x27;s inscription famously declares

Or a warning about mortality, such as this Persian poetry carved on an ancient tombstone in the Tajiki capital of Dushanbe.


Or a simpler warning of inevitability of death:


Headstone engravers faced their own &quot;year 2000 problem&quot; when still-living people, as many as 500,000 in the United States alone, pre-purchased headstones with pre-carved death years beginning with 19–.

Bas-relief carvings of a religious nature or of a profile of the deceased can be seen on some headstones, especially up to the 19th century. Since the invention of photography, a gravestone might include a framed photograph or cameo of the deceased; photographic images or artwork (showing the loved one, or some other image relevant to their life, interests or achievements) are sometimes now engraved onto smooth stone surfaces.

Some headstones use lettering made of white metal fixed into the stone, which is easy to read but can be damaged by ivy or frost. Deep carvings on a hard-wearing stone may weather many centuries exposed in graveyards and still remain legible. Those fixed on the inside of churches, on the walls, or on the floor (often as near the altar as possible) may last much longer: such memorials were often embellished with a monumental brass. Irish geologist Patrick Wyse Jackson mused on gravestone legibility in 1993 with regards to the different types of stone available:
The choice of language and/or script on gravestones has been studied by sociolinguists as indicators of language choices and language loyalty. For example, by studying cemeteries used by immigrant communities, some languages were found to be carved &quot;long after the language ceased to be spoken&quot; in the communities. In other cases, a language used in the inscription may indicate a religious affiliation.

Marker inscriptions have also been used for political purposes, such as the grave marker installed in January 2008 at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky by Mathew Prescott, an employee of PETA. The grave marker is located near the grave of KFC founder Harland Sanders and bears the acrostic message &quot;KFC tortures birds&quot;. The group placed its grave marker to promote its contention that KFC is cruel to chickens.

== Form and decoration ==

Gravestones may be simple upright slabs with semi-circular, rounded, gabled, pointed-arched, pedimental, square or other shaped tops. During the 18th century, they were often decorated with &quot;memento mori&quot; (symbolic reminders of death) such as skulls or winged skulls, winged cherub heads, heavenly crowns, or the picks and shovels of the gravedigger. Somewhat unusual were more elaborate allegorical figures, such as Old Father Time, or emblems of trade or status, or even some event from the life of the deceased (particularly how they died). Large tomb chests, false sarcophagi as the actual remains were in the earth below, or smaller coped chests were commonly used by the gentry as a means of commemorating a number of members of the same family. In the 19th century, headstone styles became very diverse, ranging from plain to highly decorated, and often using crosses on a base or other shapes differing from the traditional slab. By this time popular designs were shifting from symbols of death like Winged heads and Skulls to Urns and Willow trees. Marble also became overwhelmingly popular as a grave material during the 1800s in the United States. More elaborately carved markers, such as crosses or angels also became popular during this time. Simple curb surrounds, sometimes filled with glass chippings, were popular during the mid-20th century.

Islamic headstones are traditionally more a rectangular upright shaft, often topped with a carved topknot symbolic of a turban; but in Western countries more local styles are often used.

Some form of simple decoration may be employed. Special emblems on tombstones indicate several familiar themes in many faiths. Some examples are:

* Anchor: Steadfast hope

* Shattered urn: Old age, mourning if draped
* Weeping willow: Mourning, grief
Greek letters might also be used:

* formula_1 (alpha and omega): The beginning and the end
* formula_2 (chi rho): The first letters spelling the name of Christ

== Safety ==
Over time a headstone may settle or its fixings weaken. After several instances where unstable stones have fallen in dangerous circumstances, some burial authorities &quot;topple test&quot; headstones by firm pressure to check for stability. They may then tape them off or flatten them.

This procedure has proved controversial in the UK, where an authority&#x27;s duty of care to protect visitors is complicated because it often does not have any ownership rights over the dangerous marker. Authorities that have knocked over stones during testing or have unilaterally lifted and laid flat any potentially hazardous stones have been criticised, after grieving relatives have discovered that their relative&#x27;s marker has been moved. Since 2007 Consistory Court and local authority guidance now restricts the force used in a topple test and requires an authority to consult relatives before moving a stone. In addition, before laying a stone flat, it must be recorded for posterity.

== Gravestone Cleaning ==
Gravestone cleaning is a practice that both professionals and volunteers can do to preserve gravestones and increase their life spans. Before cleaning any gravestones, permission must be given to the cleaner by a &quot;descendant, the sexton, cemetery superintendent or the town, in that order. If unsure who to ask, go to your town cemetery keeper and inquire.&quot; A gravestone can be cleaned to remove human vandalism and graffiti, biological growth such as algae or lichen, and other minerals, soiling, or staining.

One of the most important tenets of gravestone cleaning is &quot;do no harm.&quot; In the United States, the National Park Service has published a list of guidelines that outline the best practices of gravestone cleaning:

Do
* &quot;Do no harm
* Do select the gentlest cleaning method to accomplish the task
* Do perform small test patches before cleaning the entire stone
* Do follow manufacturers’ recommendations
* Do follow manufacturers’ safety guidance
* Do exercise patience

Don&#x27;t
* Don&#x27;t remove original surfaces
* Don&#x27;t use bleach or other salt laden cleaners
* Don&#x27;t power wash with high pressures
* Don&#x27;t sand blast or use harsh mechanical methods such as power tools
* Don&#x27;t use strong acids or bases&quot;

<doc id="603122" wikidata="Q1262419" url="?curid=603122" title="Holland–Dozier–Holland">
<text>Holland–Dozier–Holland was a songwriting and production team consisting of Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland. The trio wrote, arranged and produced many songs that helped define the Motown sound in the 1960s. During their tenure at Motown Records from 1962 to 1967, Dozier and Brian Holland were the composers and producers for each song, and Eddie Holland wrote the lyrics and arranged the vocals. Their most celebrated productions were singles for the Four Tops and the Supremes, including 10 of the Supremes&#x27; 12 US No. 1 singles, including &quot;Baby Love&quot;, &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot;, and &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;.

From 1969 to 1972, due to a legal dispute with Motown, they did not write material under their own names, but instead used the collective pseudonym &quot;Edythe Wayne&quot;. When the trio left Motown, they continued to work as a production team (with Eddie Holland being added to the producer credits), and as a songwriting team, until 1973.

The trio was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

==History==
The trio came together at Motown in the early 1960s. Eddie Holland had been working with Motown founder Berry Gordy prior to that label being formed; his 1958 Mercury single &quot;You&quot; was one of Gordy&#x27;s earliest productions. Later, Eddie Holland had a career as a Motown recording artist, scoring a US Top 30 hit in 1961 with &quot;Jamie&quot;. Eddie&#x27;s brother Brian Holland was a Motown staff songwriter who also tasted success in 1961, being a co-composer of the Marvelettes&#x27; US No. 1 &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;. Dozier had been a recording artist for several labels in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the Anna label (owned by Berry Gordy&#x27;s sister) and Motown subsidiary Mel-o-dy.

The three men eventually teamed up to create material for both themselves and other artists, but soon found they preferred being writers and producers to being performers (especially Eddie, who suffered from stage fright and retired from performing in 1964). They would write and produce scores of songs for Motown artists, including 25 Number 1 hit singles, such as &quot;Heat Wave&quot; for Martha and the Vandellas and &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&quot; for Marvin Gaye.

===Lawsuits and solo careers===
In 1967, H-D-H, as they were familiarly called, entered into a dispute with Berry Gordy Jr. over profit-sharing and royalties. Eddie Holland had the others stage a work slowdown and, by early 1968, the trio had left the label. They started their own labels, Invictus Records and Hot Wax Records, which were modestly successful. When Motown sued for breach of contract, H-D-H countersued. The subsequent litigation was one of the longest legal battles in music industry history. Because they were legally contracted to Motown&#x27;s publishing arm, Jobete, they could not use their own names on songs they wrote, and their material was credited to Wayne-Dunbar. Edith Wayne was a friend of the Holland family, and Ron Dunbar was an associate who was a songwriter and producer. The lawsuit was settled in 1977.

Dozier left Holland–Dozier–Holland Productions, Inc. (HDHP) in 1973 and resumed his career as a solo performing artist. In 1975, HDHP and Invictus Records sued Dozier and 31 others, claiming conspiracy to restrain trade and other charges. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge in 1982. From the mid-1970s onwards, HDHP, with Harold Beatty replacing Dozier, wrote and produced songs for a number of artists. HDHP even worked on material for Motown artists in the 1970s, including The Supremes and Michael Jackson, while its litigation against the company was still pending. Dozier commented in 2008, &quot;The lawsuit was just our way of taking care of business that needed to be taken care of—just like Berry Gordy had to take care of his business which resulted in the lawsuit. Business is business, love is love.&quot;

Holland–Dozier–Holland threatened to sue the band Aerosmith in 1989 due to the resemblance of parts of the song &quot;The Other Side&quot; (from the album &quot;Pump&quot;) to the Holland–Dozier–Holland song &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love&quot;. To forestall litigation, Aerosmith agreed to add Holland–Dozier–Holland to the songwriting credits in the album&#x27;s liner notes.

===Later years===
Dozier had his own production company and continued to work as a solo artist, producer and recording artist, while the Holland Brothers own HDH Records and Productions (without any participation from Dozier), which issues recordings from the Invictus and Hot Wax catalogs as well as new material.

For a &quot;one-time only reunion&quot;, the three composed the score for the musical production of &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, based on the novel by Olivia Goldsmith and a later hit film. The musical included 22 new songs from the songwriting trio, with a book by Rupert Holmes. The musical was produced by Paul Lambert and Jonas Neilson and premiered in July 2009 at The Old Globe Theater in San Diego. The San Diego production sold approximately 29,000 tickets in its five-week run. Ticket demand was so strong early on that The Old Globe extended its run (originally four weeks) prior to opening night. However, reviews were mixed to negative, and the producers opted to rework the book.

In June 2014, it was announced that &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (with an entirely new book written by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason) would be heading to Chicago premiering on February 16, 2015. The play now included a sprinkling of classic H-D-H songs (including &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;My World Is Empty Without You&quot;), interspersed with the new material. Following the Chicago run, the production was to head to Broadway for a fall 2015 arrival, but the critical reception to the play was lukewarm to negative, and the production quietly closed after its Chicago run.

==Legacy==
Longtime BMI songwriters, Brian Holland affiliated with the performing rights organization in 1960, followed by Lamont Dozier in 1961 and Eddie Holland in 1963. They have won many BMI Awards, including BMI Pop Awards and Million-Air citations. On May 13, 2003, Holland–Dozier–Holland were honored as BMI Icons at the 51st BMI Pop Awards.

Holland–Dozier–Holland are mentioned (along with the Four Tops and their vocalist Levi Stubbs, as well as Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong) in the lyrics of the song &quot;Levi Stubbs&#x27; Tears&quot; from the 1986 Billy Bragg album &quot;Talking with the Taxman about Poetry&quot;; and also in the lyrics of the Magnetic Fields&#x27; song &quot;The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure&quot;, from their 1999 album &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;.

Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2010.

<text>The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate, also referred to as the City class, is a class of multi-role patrol frigates that have served the Royal Canadian Navy since 1992. The class is the outcome of the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, which dates to the mid-1970s. was the first of an eventual twelve Canadian-designed and Canadian-built vessels which combine traditional anti-submarine capabilities with systems to deal with surface and air threats as well. Ships of the class are named after capital cities of Canadian provinces (St. John&#x27;s, Halifax, Charlottetown, Fredericton, Québec City, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Regina), the capital of Canada, Ottawa, and the major cities of Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver.

In 2007, the Government of Canada announced a planned refit of the &quot;Halifax&quot; class which is known as the Halifax Class Modernization Project (HCMP) of which the Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) project is a part. In November 2008, a Lockheed Martin Canada-led team including Saab AB, Elisra, IBM Canada, CAE Professional Services, L-3 Electronic Systems and xwave, was awarded the contract. The construction phase of the program was completed in November 2016. , the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class modernization program is being closed out, but full operational capacity was reached on 31 January 2018.

In October 2011 the Canadian government launched the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy which aims to replace the &quot;Halifax&quot; class, as well as the capabilities of the s, with up to 15 new destroyers. This replacement class is currently in the design stage and full-rate construction is anticipated to begin in 2025. However, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels continue to be upgraded with at least some ships of the class anticipated as likely to continue service into the 2040s.

==Description and design==
The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate design, emerging from the Canadian Patrol Frigate Program, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare. In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six frigates, with a second batch ordered in December 1987. To reflect the changing long-term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.

As built, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . That made them slightly larger than the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating .

This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . As designed the &quot;Halifax&quot; class had a total complement 236 personnel; 219 naval personnel of which 17 were officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 were officers. During the FELEX/HCM projects the addition of 19 berths was completed to allow embarkation of additional CTG personnel. This brought the total available crew complement to 255 persons. 

===Control systems===
The tactical command and control systems were developed in Canada. These included the Shipboard Integrated Communications System (SHINCOM), the Shipboard Integrated Machinery Control (SHINMACS), and Shipboard Integrated Integrated Processing and Display System (SHINPADS). SHINCOM was developed by DRS Technology Canada and was exported to other navies. SHINMACS was developed by CAE. SHINPADS was developed by Sperry Computer Systems in Winnipeg. with technical assistance from the United States. It used a revolutionary redundant and distributed computer architecture which was exported for use in US military control systems.

===Armament and aircraft===

As built the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a &quot;bear trap&quot; system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments on either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.

As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for &quot;last-ditch&quot; defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.

As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than . The vessels also carry eight machine guns.

===Countermeasures and sensors===
As built, the decoy system comprises two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship&#x27;s radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.
Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull-mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.

==Refit==
The Government of Canada announced on 5 July 2007 a $3.1 billion refit program for the &quot;Halifax&quot; class which would take place from 2010 to 2018 and extend the ships&#x27; service lives through to the 2030s. 
The total cost of the program was set at $4.3 billion, with $2 billion for combat systems upgrades and $1.2 billion for mid-life refits. A further $1 billion was paid to contractors for other projects.

Faced with delays and restrictions from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Navy opted to modernize the &quot;Halifax&quot; class using as much non-American equipment as possible, including technology from Canada, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands and Israel. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations has also been blamed for the delay of the CH-148 Cyclone which was running two years behind the original schedule. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class received state of the art equipment able to handle modern threats through 2030. The modernization includes passive and active weapons, radars, and new combat architecture.

The refit program was formally announced as completed on the west coast by Victoria Shipyards on 29 April 2016 by the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan when &quot;Regina&quot; was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy. &quot;Calgary&quot; was the first to undergo work at Victoria, followed by &quot;Winnipeg&quot;, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, &quot;Ottawa&quot; and &quot;Regina&quot;. The construction phase of the program on the east coast was completed on 29 November 2016 when the final east coast ship, &quot;Toronto&quot;, was handed back to the Royal Canadian Navy at Halifax Shipyard.

===Control systems===
The new combat system architecture and combat management system is the CMS330 Combat Management System from Lockheed Martin Canada, which includes elements of the Saab 9LV Mk4 combat management system (known as the &quot;CanACCS-9LV&quot; suite of components.) CMS330 is a development of SHINPADS.

The Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) from L-3 MAPPS provides systems management. IPMS is a development of SHINMACS.

===Weaponry and propulsion upgrades===

The &quot;Halifax&quot; class currently use the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), instead of the obsolete RIM-7 Sea Sparrow. The ESSM gives a greater range against anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. BAE Systems received a contract to upgrade the Bofors 57 mm Mk 2 to Bofors 57 mm Mk 3 configuration. The upgrades were performed at Karlskoga between 2010 and 2016, before being installed in Halifax and Victoria.

The Department of National Defence requested a tender to provide a naval remote weapon system (NRWS) defence capability to the &quot;Halifax&quot; and &quot;Iroquois&quot; classes. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class was to be fitted with this new system to replace the 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun. Although not part of the refit, Raytheon Canada Limited was awarded a contract of $180 million for eight years to overhaul, convert and repair all Canadian CIWS to a Block 1B Baseline 1 configuration.

It was announced by the Department of National Defence that Hewitt Equipment was chosen to replace the diesel generators aboard the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels in June 2015. The contract was awarded for 10 years, with options to extend it out to 22 years and covers ships assigned to either coast. The speed of the vessels in the class increased to over following the FELEX upgrades.

===Sensors and countermeasures===

As part of the refit, Thales Canada supplied the Sirius long-range Infrared Search and Track (IRST) for the &quot;Halifax&quot; class. The IRST is currently in use on board the German s. The IRST is able to track low radar cross-section aircraft and ships.

Saab provided 26 CEROS 200 Fire Control Directors. The CEROS 200 is a Radar and Optronic Tracking system which interfaces with advanced anti-ship missiles and gun systems. It provides defence against modern threats including modern sea skimming anti-ship missiles or asymmetric threats in littoral environments. The CEROS 200 is part of the 9LV Mk4.

The &quot;Halifax&quot; class were fitted with a modified Sea Giraffe SG-150 multi-function search radar. The SG-150 HC will be upgraded and will secure a high level of operational availability as well as improved functions. Thales supplied 13 Smart-S Mk2 S-band radars, including one for training purposes. These radars are optimized for medium-to-long-range search and target designation with a high degree of detection. The Smart-S Mk2 is a 3D multibeam radar which can detect hostile targets in near-shore environments. The deliveries began at the end of 2010 and were completed in 2015.

Raytheon Anschütz provided at least 12 Pathfinder ST MK 2 Radar systems. The Pathfinder Mark II is designed to provide a modern and flexible navigation tool. The Pathfinder ST Mk 2 radar system is part of the 9LV Mk4. In 2015, Canada acquired twelve sets of X and S-Band navigation radars from Raytheon Anschütz for the class. The new radars have advanced detection capability, new radiation control and pulse blanker interfaces and have improved interaction with the vessels&#x27; upgraded command and control system.

The &quot;Halifax&quot; class were fitted with the Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS) developed by Rheinmetall. MASS is a fully computerized countermeasure. The system is connected to the ship&#x27;s sensors and protects ships from attacks by advanced, sensor-guided missiles by launching decoys that operate in all relevant wavelengths. Elbit Systems received a contract to supply Electronic Warfare equipment for the &quot;Halifax&quot; class, including active jamming and tracking systems.

Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH received a contract to provide 14 Passive Electronic Countermeasures Systems (ECM).

===Communications===
The &quot;Halifax&quot; class received two Navy Multi-band Terminals (NMT), installed on the forward port and starboard sides of the hangar, to increase its satellite communications capabilities. The NMT system communicates with satellites in geostationary orbit via the Ka band. This system was augmented by the Maritime Satellite Communications Upgrade (MSCU), featuring the AN/USC-69(V3) antenna installed on the hangar top. The system was first used by the &quot;Halifax&quot; class on deployments to Operation Reassurance in 2012.

<doc id="603134" wikidata="Q1421569" url="?curid=603134" title="Five Islands, Nova Scotia">
<text>Five Islands is a rural community in Colchester County, Nova Scotia, Canada with a population of 316 located on the north shore of Minas Basin, home of the highest tides in the world. It is named after five small islands – Moose, Diamond, Long, Egg, and Pinnacle – located just off the coast. The islands are an exposed part of the North Mountain Basalt. Moose Island is in Colchester County. The remaining islands are in Cumberland County. Beyond Pinnacle Island is a seastack called Pinnacle Rock.

The Five Islands Provincial Park includes Moose and Diamond Islands. Five Islands had a lighthouse in operation from 1914 to 1999. It was moved several times due to erosion. The lighthouse has since been preserved by a community group.

Native Mi&#x27;kmaq legend has it that the Five Islands were created when their god Glooscap threw the mud, sticks and stones at the giant beaver who dammed his medicine garden in Advocate. The mud, sticks and stones that formed the islands are said to have trapped the beaver in one of the islands and turned it into gold.

==Economy==

The main sources of income in Five Islands are from natural resources including blueberries, fishing, and clam harvesting and processing. Tourism is also important, with several restaurants and campgrounds in the area.

In the late 1800s there was a large barite mine, (called &quot;barytes&quot; at the time by the locals) on the Bass River called the Duncan/Eureka Mine. The barite was used in the Henderson &amp; Potts (later Brandram-Henderson) Paint Factory, located in Lower Five Islands. Later, barite was shipped to Halifax and the United States for its use in paint manufacturing.
==Moose Island==
Seniors living in the community recall youthful memories of Moose Island deriving its name from stories of the island having supported a moose herd until shortly after settlers inhabited the surrounding areas. There are other legends relating to this island as well but this seems to be the most laudable to many who have lived there many years ago.

Moose Island was the only one of the five ever to be inhabited and carries with it the most tangible tale of intrigue. Early in the 1800s, John Ruff, a Scotsman, settled this outpost with his family. He cleared much of the forest and established a modest mixed farm, supplying the coastal village with produce, wood and charcoal. He was reputed to be a hard, cruel person, and rumors circulated that he abused his wife and children. When he died a violent death, suspicions arose that he had been murdered by his son. A controversial trial led to acquittal, and afterwards the family moved to the mainland, carrying the unresolved mystery with them. Legend has John Ruff&#x27;s spirit stalking the long overgrown fields during misty, moonless nights in search of vengeance. On a dark night on the beach, some people have said that they could see a light that walks the shore of the island.

==Diamond Island==
==Long Island==

In 2003 Long Island was purchased by Dick Lemon, who wanted to build on its top, above the sea bed, a retreat for artists, writers, musicians and academics. The cliffs prohibited access except by a rope assisted scramble up a muddy draw. The sea, being in the Bay of Fundy&#x27;s tide reach, is deep at high tide and empty at low tide, so boat access to the island is limited each day to a four-hour window, namely the high tide during daylight. When the tide is low, people on Long Island can walk or run on the sea bed for miles. Taking advantage of the extreme tides, Lemon in 2007 began a charity event called Not Since Moses, a 5K and 10K run from Long and Moose Islands through the sea bed to shore. Meanwhile, beginning in 2004, local workers began creating a retreat on Long Island. A helicopter carried heavy equipment including a tent for workers to live in during the construction (since they could not practically travel daily to and from the island). Then, to begin, locals hung from the cliffs and pounded in supports for 194 steps rising from the sea to the island&#x27;s top. A lift was designed by Dennis Ross, the project manager, who had retired as a corrections officer at the nearby prison in Springhill. The locally built lift ultimately hauled 25 tons of gravel, about of lumber, and another 20 tons of furniture and furnishings and all else needed for a three bedroom two bath main house plus four sleeping cabins. These include a miniature lighthouse, a cabin built in the shape of a river boat edged over a cliff, a perch cabin on a promontory and a caretakers cabin. Ross oversaw the construction, the drilling with a specialty rig of two wells and the installation of a solar and generator power system for the main house which enjoys all the comforts of a modern home including full kitchen. The retreat is used May through October by users such as the Nova Scotia College of Arts and Design, Ships Company Theatre, St. Mary&#x27;s University and various groups which have included private tourists.

During the night of 19 October 2015, the hole that had been in Long Island collapsed.

==Egg Island==
==Pinnacle Island==

Pinnacle Island is home to a colony of gulls.

==Geology==

The islands and the park are composed of basalt resting on top of Triassic age sandstone. The boundary between the two formations runs through the islands. Moose and Pinnacle show both sandstone and basalt, Diamond and Long are all basalt, and Egg is all sandstone. The basalts contain minerals that are interesting to rockhounds including agate, zeolites such as stilbite and gmelinite, and calcite.

On the mainland, slightly inland from the community, the land rises quickly. This is the Cobequid Fault. Barite and calcite are found in some of the ravines.

==Lighthouse==

Five Islands is home to one lighthouse at Five Islands Lighthouse Park. The existing tower was originally built in 1914, and later moved in 1952 and 1957. Having deteriorated over the years, the tower was saved from being demolished by the Five Islands Lighthouse Preservation Society and moved to the Sand Point campground as a tourist attraction in 1996. In 2008, the Five Islands Lighthouse was moved to a nearby municipal park, becoming the focal point of said park.

==Notable people==

Purdy Crawford (born Five Islands 1931, died Toronto 2014), lawyer, business executive, philanthropist.

<text>The Cotton Bowl is an outdoor stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States. Opened in 1930 as Fair Park Stadium, it is on the site of the State Fair of Texas, known as Fair Park.

The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual college football post-season bowl game known as the Cotton Bowl Classic, after which the stadium is named. Starting on New Year&#x27;s Day 1937, it hosted the first 73 editions of the game, through January 2009; the game was moved to AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington in January 2010. The stadium hosts the Red River Rivalry, the annual college football game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns, and formerly, the First Responder Bowl.

The stadium has been home to many football teams over the years, including: SMU Mustangs (NCAA), Dallas Cowboys (NFL; 1960–1971), Dallas Texans (NFL) (1952), Dallas Texans (AFL; 1960–1962), and soccer teams, the Dallas Tornado (NASL; 1967–1968), FC Dallas (MLS; as the Dallas Burn 1996–2004, as FC Dallas 2005), and Dallas Trinity FC (USLS; 2024-). It was also one of the nine venues used for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. As of 2022, it is the largest stadium by capacity in the United States without a professional or college team as a regular tenant.

It became known as &quot;The House That Doak Built,&quot; due to the immense crowds that SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s.

In their seventh season, the Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the NFL championship at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1967. The college bowl game that year included SMU and was played the day before, New Year&#x27;s Eve, which required a quick turnaround to transform the field. The two games were filled to its 75,504 capacity, but both home teams lost to the visitors.

Artificial turf was installed in 1970 and removed in 1993 in preparation for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The elevation of the playing field is approximately above sea level.

==History==
Construction began on Fair Park Stadium in 1930 on the same site as the wooden football stadium before known as Fair Park Stadium. Completed that year, the first game in the stadium was between Dallas-area high schools in October 1930. The original stadium–the lower half of the current facility–was built for a cost of $328,000 and seated 45,507 spectators. The name was officially changed to the Cotton Bowl in 1936.

In 1948, a second deck was added to the west side, increasing capacity to 67,000. The east side was double-decked the following year, increasing capacity to 75,504. These decks were added to respond to the demand for fans to watch SMU halfback Doak Walker, leading the Cotton Bowl to be known as &quot;the house that Doak built.&quot; The superstructure was also built at this time, creating the distinctive facade for the stadium. In 1968, chair-backs were installed, reducing capacity to 72,032. In 1970, the Cotton Bowl installed an AstroTurf surface, which remained until 1993.

In 1950, as a way to break the Texas League record for opening-day attendance, Richard Burnett got permission to play in the Cotton Bowl, which at the time could hold as many as 75,000. In order to draw a big crowd, he wanted a lineup of former stars to don Dallas Eagles uniforms and face one Tulsa hitter in the top of the first inning. Most of the retired stars were cool to the idea, except for then-current Dallas Eagles manager Charlie Grimm. When the legendary Ty Cobb agreed to come to Dallas, the others followed his lead. Preceding the game was a parade through downtown Dallas. &quot;It was the pre-game show that got &#x27;em&quot;, bellowed Dizzy Dean by way of self-congratulation. &quot;Cobb, Cochrane, Home Run Baker, Speaker, and Ol&#x27; Diz in Dallas duds.&quot; The 54,151 who showed up were lucky enough to see Ty Cobb hit several balls into the stands, just to show he could still handle the bat. The Kilgore College Rangerettes drill team performed on the field prior to the game. Texas governor Allan Shivers threw out the first pitch. Defensively, the old-timer lineup of the Eagles were: Duffy Lewis in left field, Cobb in center field, Texas native Tris Speaker in right field, Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker at third base, Travis Jackson at shortstop, Charlie Gehringer at second base, manager Grimm at first base, Mickey Cochrane at catcher, and former Houston Buffaloes star pitcher Dizzy Dean on the mound. Dean walked the leadoff batter for Tulsa, Harry Donabedian, on a 3–2 count, and then the regular Dallas players took the field. Dean got into an orchestrated rhubarb and was tossed from the game. The attendance figure still stands as the largest in Texas League history and second largest in the history of the minor leagues.

The Cotton Bowl hosted six matches of the 1994 World Cup. To meet FIFA requirements for these games the stadium field was widened, the press box was enlarged and natural grass was re-installed. The playing surface has remained natural grass ever since. Capacity was decreased to 71,615 in 1994 and to 68,252 in 1996. The Stadium also hosted the Gold Cup Soccer Matches in 1993.

In the 2000s (decade), the renewed dominance of both the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns created a new interest in their rivalry, and the stadium. Temporary stands were erected in each end zone to increase seating for these games from just over 68,000 to 90,000.

In November 2006, the city of Dallas and the State Fair of Texas finally agreed on funding for a long-planned $50 million renovation, with $30 million of this amount from a city bond. Thus, in April 2007, the schools signed a contract to play at the Cotton Bowl through 2015, coupled with a $57 million fund for upgrades and improvements to the aging stadium. The 2008 Red River Showdown was held on October 11.

The 2008 renovations include the expansion of the seating capacity of the stadium from 68,252 to 92,100, mostly through the complete encircling of the second deck, new media and VIP facilities, a new scoreboard and video screen, updated restrooms and concession areas, lighting, utility and sound upgrades and the replacement of all the stadium&#x27;s seats. A new record for attendance was set when 96,009 fans attended the 2009 Texas vs. Oklahoma football game.

The renovation was also intended to increase the chances of the Cotton Bowl Classic becoming a part of the Bowl Championship Series. However, the renovation was not enough to prevent the Cotton Bowl Classic from moving out of its namesake stadium after the 2009 game. Dallas&#x27; occasionally cold January weather had been a longstanding concern for the game, and was believed to have precluded any prospect of adding it to the BCS even after the expansion. (The Cotton Bowl Classic would eventually be added to the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; College Football Playoff bowls after the game moved to what is now AT&amp;T Stadium.) 

On January 1, 2020, the NHL Winter Classic was held at the Cotton Bowl. Over 85,000 attended the match between the Dallas Stars and Nashville Predators.

On December 6, 2023, it was announced the Red River Rivalry would stay in the Cotton Bowl through 2036. It was also announced with the single largest investment into the stadium from the city of Dallas with an estimated $140 million two-year renovation.

==Stadium usage==
The Cotton Bowl has been used by a number of teams in several sports throughout its history, and has hosted three collegiate bowl games. The Cotton Bowl has also hosted large music concerts, including the inaugural Texxas Jam and other similar events.

===American football===

====Cotton Bowl Classic====
From 1937 to 2009, the Cotton Bowl hosted the Cotton Bowl Classic, an annual NCAA Division I bowl game. Beginning in 2010, the bowl game has been played at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. From 1941 to 1994, the Southwest Conference champion would play in the bowl game; since 1997, the first postseason of the Big 12 Conference, its second-place team has competed against an SEC team in the Cotton Bowl Classic.

====Dallas Texans (NFL)====

The first professional football team in Texas was the Dallas Texans of the National Football League in 1952. Plagued by financial hardship and poor play, the Texans lasted only one season. The team played four games in the Cotton Bowl before going bankrupt, being taken over by the league, and finishing the season as a traveling team based in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

====Dallas Cowboys====

The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 12 seasons, from the team&#x27;s formation in 1960 until 1971. The 1966 NFL Championship Game between the Cowboys and Green Bay Packers was played in the Cotton Bowl. After playing their first two home games in 1971 at the Cotton Bowl, the Cowboys opened Texas Stadium in Irving on October 24.

====Dallas Texans (AFL)====

The Dallas Texans of the American Football League used the stadium all three of their seasons in Dallas (1960–1962), sharing it with the NFL Cowboys. Following the Texans&#x27; 1962 AFL Championship season, owner Lamar Hunt moved the franchise to Kansas City, Missouri and renamed it the Chiefs.

====First Responder Bowl====

From January 2011 until 2018, the Cotton Bowl was the home of the First Responder Bowl, an annual college football bowl game. The game was tentatively named the &quot;Dallas Football Classic&quot; prior to TicketCity being announced as the bowl game&#x27;s first title sponsor. The game was called the &quot;TicketCity Bowl&quot; for the first two match ups. On October 4, 2012, the name changed again to the &quot;Heart of Dallas Bowl&quot; for eight seasons before changing to the &quot;First Responder Bowl&quot; for the 2018 season. In 2019 the game was relocated to Gerald J. Ford Stadium at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas, to accommodate the 2020 NHL Winter Classic. While originally a temporary measure, the game has remained at Ford Stadium in succeeding years.

The game has had bowl tie-ins with the Big 12 Conference in 2011, Conference USA in 2012, and the Big Ten Conference in both 2011 and 2012. The inaugural game saw the Texas Tech Red Raiders defeat the Northwestern Wildcats, 45–38.

====Red River Rivalry====
The annual college football game between the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma Sooners, also known before 2005 as the Red River Shootout, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the State Fair of Texas, instead of on either school&#x27;s campus. Ticket sales are equally divided between the two schools, and the fans are split on the 50-yard line. Following the 2024 game, the Longhorns have a record of 64–51–5 against the Sooners.

====SMU Mustangs====

The Cotton Bowl served as the home for the SMU Mustangs football team for two periods in the program&#x27;s history. SMU played at least a few games at the Cotton Bowl from 1932 onward. They gradually moved more of their home games there during the 1930s and 1940s, as it was double the size of their on-campus stadium, Ownby Stadium. The Mustangs moved there permanently in 1948 due to Doak Walker&#x27;s popularity. The Mustangs played at the Cotton Bowl until 1978, when they moved to Texas Stadium.

The Cotton Bowl also served as home to SMU in the 1990s, after the team served the NCAA death penalty due to numerous recruiting violations, and spent the first six years after their return at Ownby Stadium. Games moved back to campus in 2000 with the completion of Gerald J. Ford Stadium.

====State Fair Classic====
In addition to the Red River Rivalry, the Grambling State University Tigers and the Prairie View A&amp;M University Panthers play each other at the Cotton Bowl in the State Fair Classic. This game often occurs the weekend before the Texas-OU Red River Rivalry game. It is a neutral site for both teams; Grambling State is located in northern Louisiana and Prairie View A&amp;M is located about northwest of Houston. The halftime show, the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, is arguably more eagerly anticipated than the game itself. The State Fair Classic is heavily marketed in the Dallas – Fort Worth Metroplex, with local hip hop stations encouraging a large turnout among the region&#x27;s African-American community. The State Fair Classic is currently the largest FCS football game in Texas.

====Texas State Fair Classic Showdown====
In 2016, the Texas State Fair in conjunction with the City of Dallas announced an expansion of games played during the state fair for 2018 and 2019. Following the Red River Rivalry weekend, the Texas Southern University Tigers played against the Southern University Jaguars. The game was on a neutral site for both teams, Texas Southern University is centrally located in Houston and Southern University is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (South Louisiana). The two schools are long-time SWAC rivals and have nationally recognized marching bands.

====Texas high school football====
The Cotton Bowl has a long history of hosting Texas high school football games. From the early days of the stadium, it was used for playoff and championship games. In 1945 and 1967, the stadium hosted two of the largest audiences to ever see a Texas high school football game. In 2011 and 2012, it played host to the North Texas Football Classic to kick off those seasons.

====Powderpuff football====
Blondes vs. Brunettes powderpuff football games are played in cities across the United States. Proceeds from the event are donated to The Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative Joseph Hugh Allen, died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2008. Looking for a way to raise funds for The Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, Abbott organized a powderpuff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan. The games are currently played in over 20 cities throughout the United States. The increasing popularity of the game in the Dallas area resulted in moving the 2012 game to the Cotton Bowl where it could accommodate a larger crowd.

===Association football===
====1994 FIFA World Cup====
====2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup====
On July 29, 2014, the Cotton Bowl hosted a soccer match between Real Madrid and A.S. Roma which was part of the 2014 International Champions Cup and AS Roma won the match 1–0. It also hosted 6 matches of the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

====Other international matches====
====Dallas Tornado====

Early in their existence, the Dallas Tornado played two seasons of professional soccer in the Cotton Bowl. They spent their inaugural year, 1967, as a franchise of the United Soccer Association and 1968 as members of the North American Soccer League in the Cotton Bowl. For the Tornado, a wider field was installed that required several storm drains to be moved. The team moved to P.C. Cobb Stadium for the 1969 season and played at four more venues in the Dallas area before they folded after the 1981 season.

====Dallas Burn====
The Dallas Burn, a founding member of Major League Soccer (MLS), played at the Cotton Bowl for their first seven seasons between 1996 and 2002. Their first match, played in front of 27,779 spectators on April 14, 1996, was a 1–0 win against the San Jose Clash. The Burn paid $15,000 per match at the Cotton Bowl and lacked control over scheduling and concession sales; the team drew an average attendance of roughly 12,000 to 15,000 until they moved in 2003 to Dragon Stadium in Southlake, Texas.

The Burn (later renamed FC Dallas) returned to the Cotton Bowl for the 2004 and 2005 seasons while preparing to open their own stadium in Frisco. Their final regular season match at the Cotton Bowl was a 2–2 draw with the San Jose Earthquakes on July 3, 2005. FC Dallas later returned to the Cotton Bowl for a doubleheader with a Mexico–Colombia international friendly on September 30, 2009. The event drew 51,012 spectators to the stadium. FC Dallas would not return to the Cotton Bowl until 2024 when they played a preseason friendly against Inter Miami CF, whose popularity had surged following the signing of Lionel Messi.

==== Dallas Trinity FC ====

Dallas Trinity FC, a women&#x27;s professional soccer team and founding member of the USL Super League, currently plays at the Cotton Bowl. Their first home game was an exhibition match against FC Barcelona Femení on August 30, 2024, followed by their home season opener against DC Power FC on September 7, 2024.

===Ice hockey===

====NHL Winter Classic====

The 2020 NHL Winter Classic was held at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 2020. The game was hosted by the Dallas Stars against the Nashville Predators; the Dallas Stars won. It was the first Winter Classic appearance for both teams. It also marked the first outdoor NHL game to be hosted in a southern state. The Stars defeated the Predators in a 4–2 comeback victory. Recorded attendance was 85,630, the second highest ever for an NHL game.

===Concerts===

====Music====
The stadium has also been a venue for a number of historic concerts, most notably that which featured then 21-year-old Elvis Presley, which took place on October 11, 1956, and attracted what was then the largest audience in Texas history for an outdoor concert, in excess of 27,000.

Many consecutive summers of huge concerts, featuring several artists, began in July 1978, with the 1st annual Texxas Jam, which sold out with over 80,000 attendees. For crowd control purposes, ticket sales for any future Cotton Bowl General Admission floor seating was limited, and Jams following the 1978 Jam, never reached 80,000 for that reason. Each Texxas Jam had a unique lineup of major artists chosen by the promoter. Over the years, the Texxas Jam featured some of the top-billed headliner artists of the day, including Aerosmith, Heart, Deep Purple, Boston, Journey, Ted Nugent, Scorpions, Loverboy, Cheap Trick, Van Halen, Blue Öyster Cult, Sammy Hagar, Nazareth, Styx, Foghat, Santana, The Eagles &amp; Triumph, among others.

The annual events came to an end in the summer of 1988, when Van Halen headlined the &quot;Monsters Of Rock&quot; Tour.
U2 played here during the first leg of the Popmart Tour

Since then, the stadium has continued to be used as a major concert venue; Eric Clapton held his first three-day Crossroads Guitar Festival there in 2004.

South Korean boy band BTS was set to perform at the stadium on May 9–10, 2020 as part of their Map of the Soul Tour; however, the shows were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Rolling Stones have played 7 shows at the Cotton Bowl July 6, 1975, October 31, 1981, November 1, 1981, November 10, 1989, November 11, 1989, November 18, 1994, and November 2, 2021.
====Drum Corps====
The Cotton Bowl hosted both the 1971 VFW National Championships and the 1991 Drum Corps International World Championships.

==In popular culture==
* Football game scenes from the 1977 film Semi-Tough were filmed in the Cotton Bowl.
* The stadium was featured in a 1981 episode of &quot;Dallas&quot; where J. R. Ewing meets Dusty Farlow.

<text>Ballston is a neighborhood in Arlington County, Virginia. Ballston is located at the western end of the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. It is a major transportation hub and has one of the nation&#x27;s highest concentrations of scientific research institutes and research and development agencies, including DARPA, the Office of Naval Research, the Advanced Research Institute of Virginia Tech, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and engineering, management, and public sector consulting firms. Ballston also includes a section known as Virginia Square and sometimes the area is collectively known as Ballston-Virginia Square. 

Ballston proper is served by the Ballston–MU station, and the Virginia Square section of Ballston is served by the Virginia Square-GMU station, both of which are on the Orange and Silver Lines of the Washington Metro. By some measures, Ballston is the densest neighborhood in the Washington metropolitan area.

==History==
===18th century===

Ballston is named after the Ball family, and one of their family cemeteries lies in the neighborhood at N. Stafford Street and Fairfax Drive, also known as VA State Route 237. Ballston began as Birch&#x27;s Crossroads, and later became Ball&#x27;s Crossroads at what is now the intersection of N. Glebe Road and Wilson Boulevard.

A historical marker that stands near the southeastern corner of the intersection reads:
This intersection has been a focal point since about 1740, when two roads were developed, one from the future site of Alexandria to the mouth of Pimmit Run, the other from Awbury’s Ferry (at the site of Rosslyn) to The Falls Church. The first came to be known as the Glebe Road because it passed the glebe of Fairfax Parish and in order to distinguish it from other roads to the Falls. The second was eventually named Wilson Boulevard in honor of President Wilson. The intersection became known as Ball’s Crossroads when Ball’s Tavern was established here in the early 1800s.

===19th century===
In 1896, an interurban electric trolley line, the Fairfax line of the Washington, Arlington and Falls Church Railway (WA&amp;FC), began operating north of the crossroads along the present route of Fairfax Drive, whose name derives from that of the trolleys&#x27; final destination, Fairfax City. Construction of the trolley line, which branched at Clarendon to serve both Rosslyn and downtown Washington, D.C., temporarily shifted much of the area&#x27;s development away from the crossroads. 

===20th century===
A historical marker near the northwestern corner of Fairfax Drive and N. Stafford Street, one block east of the Ballston–MU station, at the former site of the Ballston trolley station, states:
By 1900, a well-defined village called Central Ballston had developed in the area bounded by the present-day Wilson Boulevard, Taylor Street, Washington Boulevard, and Pollard Street. More diffuse settlement extended westward to Lubber Run and southward along Glebe Road to Henderson Road.

The track of the Washington, Arlington, and Falls Church Electric Railroad ran along what is now Fairfax Drive; the Ballston Station was at Ballston Avenue, now North Stuart Street. Here Clements Avenue, now Stafford Street, divided to pass on either side of an old Ball family graveyard.

The Ball family burial ground on Washington Boulevard has a historical marker, which states:
Old Ball Family Burial Ground. This is one of Arlington&#x27;s oldest family burial grounds. Ensign John Ball (1748–1814), a veteran of the American Revolution (Sixth Virginia Infantry) is buried here. John Ball was the son of Moses Ball, who was one of the pioneer settlers in the Glencarlyn area of Arlington. Also buried here in the cemetery are many of John Ball&#x27;s direct and collateral descendants including John Wesley Boldin, a Civil War soldier (Company D, Third Pennsylvania Cavalry) and members of the Marcey, Stricker, Donaldson, and Croson families.

In 1912, a competing interurban electric trolley line, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway constructed a branch that crossed the WA&amp;FC near the west end of Ballston, then called Lacey, near a WA&amp;FC car barn and railyard. Interstate 66 and the Bluemont Junction Trail now follow the route of this railroad branch between Rosslyn and the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park in Bluemont Park. A historical marker entitled &quot;Lacey Car Barn&quot; located near the northwest corner of N. Glebe Road and Fairfax Drive states:In 1896, the Washington, Arlington &amp; Falls Church Railway began running electric trolleys from Rosslyn to Falls Church on the present routes of Fairfax Drive and I-66. 

By 1907, the Fairfax trolley linked Fairfax, Vienna, and Ballston with downtown Washington, D.C. In 1910, at this location, the railway built a car barn, railyard, workshops, electrical substation, and general office. In 1912, the rival Washington and Old Dominion Railroad began crossing the tracks on a bridge 200 yards west of here, following the present route of I-66 from Rosslyn. The Fairfax trolley closed in 1939, but Metrorail’s Orange Line follows its route through Arlington.

In 1951, the Parkington Shopping Center opened at the intersection, formerly known as Balls Crossroads on the site of present-day Ballston Quarter. Parkington was anchored by the headquarters location of the Hecht Company, and was reputed to have the largest parking garage in the nation when it opened.

Ballston began to redevelop rapidly after the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) opened the Orange Line&#x27;s Ballston Metrorail station on December 1, 1979, and when an entrance to Interstate 66 (I-66) opened on December 22, 1982. 

Ballston also contains a section known as Virginia Square, which takes its name from the Virginia Square Shopping Center that once stood there. Virginia Square is served by the Virginia Square–GMU station. Ballston and Virginia Square-GMU metro stations are within a 1/2 mile walking distance from each other. The area is sometimes collectively known as Ballston-Virginia Square.

==Shopping and recreation==

Ballston Quarter, a shopping, entertainment and residential complex, reopened in 2019 after being closed for two years of renovations.

The MedStar Capitals Iceplex, constructed on top of the Ballston Quarter parking garage, houses the offices, training facility, for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL)y. In addition to the ice hockey team&#x27;s training center, the Iceplex features two indoor NHL-sized ice rinks, office space, locker rooms, a full-service pro-shop, a Capitals team store, a snack bar, and space for special events. The facility provides public skating, figure skating, and hockey programs for youths and adults. Virginia Square Shopping Center once operated in the now named Virginia Square section of the Ballston neighborhood.

Ballston hosts the annual Taste of Arlington food festival, a street fair which has been produced each spring since 1987. The 2009 Taste of Arlington event featured over 40 area restaurants offering portions of their cuisine to ticket-holders, and drew approximately 15,000 people. The regional business development organization, the Ballston Business Improvement District (Ballston BID), (formerly the Ballston-Virginia Square Partnership which is inclusive of the Virginia Square district of Ballston), other area community development organizations, and the National Science Foundation organize the festival. Ticket sales at the event raise funds for area charities.

==Economy==
The neighborhood has a concentrations of scientific research institutes, research and development agencies, think tanks, lobbying-advocacy groups, trade associations, government agencies, and aerospace manufacturing and defense industry companies, as well as engineering, management, and public sector consulting firms.

Ballston is also home to several university facilities, including:
* A Marymount University (MU) satellite campus. 
::In January 2014, the Arlington County Board approved MU&#x27;s site plan application to redevelop the campus with two new buildings, a nine-story office and educational building for Marymount University and a 15-story multifamily building with 272 residential units, by Arlington developer, the Shooshan Company. The new campus opened in August 2017.

<text>Edward Bryan Andrews Jr. (October 9, 1914 – March 8, 1985) was an American stage, film and television actor. Andrews was one of the most recognizable character actors on television and in films from the 1950s through the 1980s. His stark white hair, imposing build and horn-rimmed glasses influenced the roles he received, as he was often cast as an ornery boss, a cagey businessman or other officious types.

== Life and career ==
Andrews was born in Griffin, Georgia, the son of an Episcopal priest, and was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cleveland, Ohio and Wheeling, West Virginia. At the age of 12, he won a walk-on role in a stock theater production featuring James Gleason.

He attended the University of Virginia, and at age 21 made his stage debut in 1935, progressing to Broadway that same year. During this period, Andrews starred in the short-lived but well-received military drama &quot;So Proudly We Hail&quot; in the lead role opposite Richard Cromwell. In 1936, Andrews debuted in the film &quot;Rushin&#x27; Art&quot;. In 1949 he made a brief, uncredited appearance as a neighbor to David Wayne&#x27;s character in &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;. His next film appearance came in 1955 as the subversive and corrupt Rhett Tanner, head of a violent political machine, in &quot;The Phenix City Story&quot;. This was soon followed by roles in other films such as &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (1956), &quot;These Wilder Years&quot; (1956), &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; (1956), &quot;Tension at Table Rock&quot; (1956), &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot; (1956), &quot;Hot Summer Night&quot; (1957), &quot;The Tattered Dress&quot; (1957), &quot;The Fiend Who Walked the West&quot; (1958) and &quot;Night of the Quarter Moon&quot; (1959).

=== Films ===
While Andrews&#x27; film acting career began in earnest in his forties, he appeared much older than he actually was and he was consistently typecast as a grandfatherly type. Though he often played amiable characters, Andrews was equally adept at portraying characters such as sleazy businessmen types or uptight bureaucrats.

Andrews appeared in several popular films, including &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960) in which he was memorable as George F. Babbitt, &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961) and &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (1963) as the secretary of defense, &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; (1963) with Doris Day and James Garner, &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964) with Doris Day and Rock Hudson and &quot;Avanti!&quot; (1972) as a government agent. Among his other film credits are &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961), &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; (1961), &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964), &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot; (1964), &quot;Kisses for My President&quot; (1964), &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; (1966); &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot; (1969) with Elvis Presley, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970) as Admiral Harold R. Stark, &quot;How to Frame a Figg&quot; (1971), &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; (1971), &quot;Now You See Him, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; (1972), &quot;Charley and the Angel&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Seniors&quot; (1978). He played Molly Ringwald&#x27;s grandfather in the John Hughes film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984) before making his final feature-film appearance in &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984).

=== Television ===
Andrews guest-starred on many television series including &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Hands of Mystery&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot; (1954 series), &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Third From the Sun&quot; and &quot;You Drive&quot;), &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Love American Style&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;Storefront Lawyers&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;.

Andrews was a regular on the ABC series &quot;Broadside&quot; (1964–1965) as Commander Roger Adrian. He had previously filmed the pilot for the popular series &quot;Hazel&quot; in the role of George Baxter. His was the only role recast when the pilot became a series; he was replaced by actor Don DeFore. 

Andrews played the character of Charley in the 1966 dramatization of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and was active in television productions throughout the early 1980s. He played Elton Dykstra on &quot;The Intruders&quot;, Ernest W. Stanley in &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, Mayor Robert Chisholm alongside Don Knotts in the film &quot;How to Frame a Figg&quot; (1971), and Mayor Massey on the television film &quot;The Whiz Kid and the Mystery at Riverton&quot;. In 1968, he played a safecracker in a four-part episode of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and in early 1969, he appeared as a drug-dealing mortician on &quot;Mod Squad&quot;. He also had the lead role as Harry Flood in the NBC short-lived 1979 series &quot;Supertrain&quot;. In 1982, he appeared in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Andrews appeared in a series of popular commercials for Bell Telephone as an overbearing executive.

== Personal life ==

Andrews&#x27; Broadway career was interrupted by military service during World War II. He served as the captain and commanding officer of Battery C within the 751st Field Artillery Battalion of the U.S. Army and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal in September 1945.

Andrews married Emily Barnes in 1955. They had two daughters, Abigail and Tabitha, and a son, Edward III.

Andrews was an avid yachtsman.

&quot;Bewitched&quot; star Elizabeth Montgomery selected Tabitha as the name for her character&#x27;s daughter after Andrews&#x27; daughter. She said: &quot;The name was my idea. I loved it, because it was so old-fashioned. I got it from one of the daughters of Edward Andrews, the actor. The two Andrews girls are named Tabitha and Abigail.&quot;

== Death ==
On March 8, 1985, Andrews suffered a heart attack at his home in Pacific Palisades. He was transported to Santa Monica Hospital where he died later that day. A memorial service was held at St. Matthew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Pacific Palisades on March 11. Andrews was later cremated.

<doc id="603157" wikidata="Q234251" url="?curid=603157" title="Louisa Ulrika of Prussia">
<text>Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (; ; 24 July 1720 - 16 July 1782) was Queen of Sweden from 1751 to 1771. She was married to King Adolf Frederick and she was queen mother during the reign of King Gustav III.

==Background==
Louisa Ulrika was born in Berlin as the daughter of Frederick William I of Prussia and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, and was thus a younger sister of both Wilhelmine of Bayreuth and Frederick the Great. She was given the Swedish name Ulrika because Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden had been her godmother. She exchanged letters with her godmother, and it was thought that she would marry a future son by Ulrika Eleonora, as Ulrika Eleonora herself had once been considered as a consort for Louisa Ulrika&#x27;s father. However, Ulrika Eleonora remained childless.

Louisa Ulrika was described as beautiful, intelligent, with a fierce temperament and a strong will. She was given an advanced education in accordance with the French Age of Enlightenment by the governess Marthe de Roucoulle and the governor Maturin Veyssiére la Croze, both French Huguenots. Her intellectual interests were not opposed by her father who, while disapproving in her brothers interest for learning, did not do so in the case of Louisa Ulrika, who was reportedly a favorite of her father. She and her eldest brother, the future Frederick the Great, had a reasonably good relationship, sharing their interest in science and culture. Her favorites among her siblings were her younger brother Prince Augustus William of Prussia and her sister Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia. At the court of her mother, she was introduced to Voltaire, with whom she engaged in a lifelong correspondence, and Maupertuis. Several dynastic marriages were considered for her from 1732 onward, including Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales, Charles III of Spain and Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt, but none came to fruition. She was appointed co-adjutrix of Quedlinburg Abbey with the prospect of becoming a reigning princess-abbess in 1743, a future of which she did not approve.

In 1743, an election was held to appoint a crown prince to the Swedish throne, as Frederick I of Sweden was childless, and the French de facto regent, Cardinal Fleury, suggested a marriage between Louisa Ulrika and the French candidate: Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken. This plans discontinued when Christian lost the election to the Russian candidate, Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp. When negotiations were made to arrange a marriage for the newly elected crown prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden, the first candidate for the match was Princess Louise of Denmark. These plans were revoked when a decision was made to create a triple alliance between Sweden, Russia and Prussia through dynastic marriage. The heir to the Swedish throne was therefore to marry a member of the Prussian royal house, while the heir to the Russian throne was to marry Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (the future Catherine the Great) who had been selected by Prussia. In accordance with this agreement, Louisa Ulrika or her sister Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia were to be selected for the Swedish match. The Swedish envoy in Berlin, Carl Rudenschöld, inspected them and recommended that the proposal be made to Louisa Ulrika. Frederick the Great himself preferred Anna Amalia for the Swedish marriage: he described Anna Amalia for the Swedish representatives as goodhearted and more suitable for Sweden, while Louisa Ulrika was arrogant, temperamental and a plotting intriguer. It has been suggested that Fredrick&#x27;s judgment was given because he believed that Anna Amalia would be easier to control as a Prussian agent in Sweden than the strong willed and dominant Louisa Ulrika. After having consulted Adolf Frederick, however, the Swedes chose Louisa Ulrika, and her brother gave his consent on 1 March 1744. She was given tuition about Sweden, was advised not to get involved in politics, and converted to Lutheranism on 28 June.

==Crown Princess==
On 17 July 1744, Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Frederick were married per procura in Berlin, with her favorite brother August Wilhelm as proxy for the absent groom. She was escorted from Berlin to Swedish Pomerania by the Swedish envoy count Carl Gustaf Tessin, his spouse Ulla Tessin and his wife&#x27;s niece Charlotta Sparre, who was appointed her maid of honor. In Swedish Pomerania, the entourage was welcomed by the Swedish General Governor of the province and the court of the late queen under the leadership of her Mistress of the Robes, countess Hedvig Elisabet Strömfelt: she kept only her lady-in-waiting Wilhelmine von der Knesebeck and a couple of footmen of her Prussian entourage.
The entourage left from Rügen and arrived in Sweden in Karlskrona, where she was officially welcomed by her spouse, Crown Prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden. On 18 August 1744, they were welcomed by King Frederick I at Drottningholm Palace, where their second wedding ceremony was performed the same day, followed by a ball, a court reception and the consummation of the marriage. Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Frederick reportedly had a mutually good impression of each other at their first meeting, and their personal relationship is described as mutually happy and harmonious. Adolf Frederick is described as introverted, gentle, and submissive. Reportedly, Louisa Ulrika was pleased with him because she immediately felt secure in the fact that she was his superior. Already during their first day together, she informed him that her brother Frederick the Great had plans for the alliance between Sweden, Russia and Prussia, and asked him to raise the subject with the Prussian envoy, which he also agreed to.

Louisa Ulrika was received with enthusiasm in Sweden as the hope for the salvation of succession crisis. At the birth of her first child in 1745, no children had been born in the Swedish royal house in over 50 years and she gained initial popularity with her beauty, wit and interest in science and culture. Carl Gustaf Tessin described her as &quot;the wisdom of a god in the image of an angel&quot;. Despite French being her native language, she was tutored in Swedish by Carl Jesper Benzelius and mastered it well after only two years. She studied Swedish literature and gathered a Swedish language library, she corresponded with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and created a nature scientific collection. Her arrogant and haughty demeanor, however, eventually made her less popular outside of the royal court.

Upon her arrival, she was granted Drottningholm Palace as her summer residence, where the &quot;Young Court&quot;, as it was called, amused themselves with picnics, masquerades and French language amateur theater. The Crown Prince&#x27;s court was dominated by Carl Gustaf Tessin, who escorted Louisa Ulrika to Sweden and remained an influential favorite during her years as Crown Princess. Adolf Frederick never cared much for Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika had him appointed marshal at court and eventually royal governor of her son Prince Gustav. Tessin was behind many amusements in the circle of the Crown Princess, and it was said that he was only too eager to please Louisa Ulrika in any way possible. There were unconfirmed rumors that Tessin was the lover of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as Crown Princess. Her son Gustav III later addressed these rumors, that although Count Tessin had been in love with her, his feelings were one-sided and not answered by his mother, as a love affair with a noble contradicted the &quot;natural contempt&quot; which Louisa Ulrika herself as a royal felt for every subject, noble or not. Her circle at court included Henrika Juliana von Liewen, who immediately became her favorite among her ladies-in-waiting; the intellectual Cathérine Charlotte De la Gardie, the scientist Eva Ekeblad, and the witty Anders Johan von Höpken.

From the moment she arrived in Sweden, Louisa Ulrika engaged in political activity. Her political ideal was absolute monarchy, and she disliked the Swedish constitutional monarchy from the moment it was explained to her. She also disliked the system of legal justice. When she, at one point, thought herself exposed to a plot, she wrote: &quot;The laws are so strange, and one does not dare to arrest someone on mere suspicion without proof, which benefit the individual more than the Kingdom.&quot; She respected the political ability of Carl Gustaf Tessin, and identified him as an ally in her wish to increase royal power. At Christmas 1744, she visited Tessin and gave him a lantern in the guise of the goddess Diana with the inscription: &quot;Made only to shed light on the political system of the day&quot;.

In the circle of her own court, she was surrounded by sympathizers of the Hats. Her favorite Henrika Juliana von Liewen was a prominent sympathizer of the Hats, as was Claes Ekeblad, Hans Henrik von Liewen, Anders Johan von Höpken and other members of her personal circle of friends, and through her court connections, she made an alliance with the Hats (party). Her strategy was to affect the votes in the parliament of the Riksdag through bribes. After the birth of her eldest son in 1746, she accompanied the Crown Prince on an official tour through the country, during which she gathered agents among members of the Caps through bribes. At the visit of the Cap&#x27;s parliamentary Kalsenius, she described him as: &quot;The biggest villain in the world, but I will not leave until I have bribed him. That is the only means by which one can reach the goal one has in mind.&quot; Kalsenius is also confirmed to have voted with the Hats party in the exactly the issues interesting to Louisa Ulrika during the votes in the Riksdag. Her goal was to overthrow the constitution and reintroduce the system of absolute monarchy with enlightened absolutism in Sweden. Her plans were internationally noted already by her creation of the &quot;L&#x27;Ordre de l&#x27;Harmonie&quot;, with the motto of unity. Her plans were opposed by Russia and Great Britain, who in 1746, allied with the Caps (party), attempted to stage a coup through their agents in Sweden against the royal house.

In February 1748, Louisa Ulrika prepared her first coup d&#x27;état to deposed parliamentary rule in favor of absolute monarchy. At that point, the king had taken ill and Russia was engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession. With the support of Tessin and Frederick the Great, Louisa Ulrika and the Hats party agreed to change the constitution in favor of more royal power, should the king die when the Russians were engaged in the war and unable to react. Louisa Ulrika agreed to let the Riksdag keep their power over the laws, while the monarch should be given power of the army, treasury and the foreign policy. The coup was aborted with the peace of the war and the recovery of Frederick I. In foreign policy, she was loyal to Prussia. Her brother Frederick the Great had given her the task to break the alliance between Sweden and Russia in favor of an alliance with Prussia: she made an alliance with Tessin, the Prussian ambassador and the Hats party, convinced Adolf Frederick to state his support for a Prussian alliance, and though she failed in the 1745 vote, the parliament voted for an alliance between Sweden, Prussia and France in 1747.

==Queen==
In 1751, the night before the death of King Frederick I, Louisa Ulrika prepared a coup d&#x27;état with Crown Prince Adolf Frederick and Hans Henrik von Liewen. The plan was, that rather than being confirmed as monarch by the Riksdag of the Estates after having made the royal oath to respect the constitution, Adolf Frederick was to take the initiative and, immediately after the King&#x27;s death, take control of the royal council and declare himself monarch by inheritance rather than to be elected as such by the Riksdag.

To investigate the preparations of the royal council, Louisa Ulrika personally contacted her favorite, Councillor Carl Gustaf Tessin, in his bed chamber that night. However, Tessin refused to inform her of the plans of the council, and further refused to support her plans of a coup. Upon the moment of the King&#x27;s death on 25 March, Tessin instead presented Adolf Frederick with a statement of a royal oath to sign before being acknowledged as king. On 26 March 1751, Adolf Frederick made an oath to the Riksdag of the Estates to respect the constitution before being acknowledged as king, in the presence of Louisa Ulrika. Prior to their coronation, Louisa Ulrika, in collaboration with her brother Frederick the Great, tried to prove that the constitution allowed the monarch more power than what the Riksdag had stated, and made clear that she was considering to refuse to allow Adolf Frederick sign the oath. On the day before the coronation, she was eventually forced to allow Adolf Frederick to sign it.

Adolf Frederick and Louisa Ulrika were crowned King and Queen of Sweden at Storkyrkan in Stockholm 26 November 1751. As Queen, Louisa Ulrika had some significance as a patron of culture and science. In 1753, she founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, and acted as patron of Carl von Linné, who was given the responsibility for the nature scientific collection at Drottningholm Palace. Her &quot;adoption&quot; of Gustav Badin was, in fact, intended as a form of scientific experiment. She also acted as patron for artists such as Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, Olof von Dalin, Jean Erik Rehn and Johan Pasch. She also had the Drottningholm Palace Theater and the Confidencen theater built: however, being a Francophile, as was the fashion, she did not benefit but rather interrupted the development of the Swedish theater, as she evicted the newly founded Swedish language theater at Bollhuset and replaced it with a French Theatre, the Du Londel Troupe, which was only a benefit for those who could speak French.

Immediately after the coronation, Louisa Ulrika prepared a new coup in favor of absolute monarchy. Queen Louisa Ulrika strongly dominated her husband and the court, and she would likely had been the real ruler during her spouse&#x27;s reign had Sweden been an absolute monarchy: at this point, however, the King was a mere decoration. This greatly displeased the Queen, herself born in an absolute monarchy. She could not understand nor condone the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag. For her, it was not acceptable for a royal person to have to receive peasants in the royal salons, as she was forced to do with the peasant&#x27;s representatives from the Riksdag. She was further enraged when the Riksdag forced the King to give up his claims on the throne of Holstein-Gottorp. To display her contempt, she humiliated the representatives of the Riksdag by using the etiquette of the royal court: she stopped their carriages at the Palace gates, forced them to wait for hours while she let those who arrived after them be received, and let them sit on smaller chairs to humiliate them. In the court theatres, the French theatre troupe and the Italian opera company performed plays encouraging the King to take control of his kingdom.

Tessin was no longer in her favor as a political ally, as he wrote in his diary that she no longer discussed politics with him and &quot;claimed that she took no part in politics&quot;. She also broke her earlier alliance with the Hats, which opposed her plans of an absolute monarchy. Instead, she formed a new party among the opposition in the Riksdag by promising rewards to her followers in case of a successful coup in favor of royal power. This group was called &quot;Hovpartiet&quot; (English: &#x27;The Royal Court Party&#x27;), the leading members being Carl Gustaf Löwenhielm, Adam Horn, Nils Adam Bielke, Erik Brahe, Eric Wrangel and Gustaf Jacob Horn. In 1753, she planned to stage a coup against the royal council to overthrow the constitution in collaboration with Anders Johan von Höpken, Carl Fredrik Scheffer and Claes Ekeblad, but the plan was aborted when Ekeblad refused. She unsuccessfully tried to convince France to retract their support of the Hats to deprive them of French support in the future conflict she and the Hovpartiet expected with the Hats in the constitution issue by claiming that she did not wish to change the constitution, merely attempting to prove that it did in fact allow for greater royal power than the Riksdag was willing to admit.

The year 1754 was the year of the alienation of Tessin. His favor with the Queen had deteriorated since 1750-51: first, when he used the Riksdag to force her to agree to the engagement between Crown Prince Gustav and Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, when she herself had wished to engage her son to Margravine Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt; and second, when he had betrayed her plans of a coup at the accession of her spouse. The relation between Louisa Ulrika and Tessin was never well seen by Adolf Frederick. Contemporary witnesses state the Tessin was in love with her and &quot;was not always able to conceal his feelings for the Crown Princess&quot;. It is unknown whether there was ever any physical relationship between the Queen and Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika herself mention in her memoirs that she had been offended somehow in that aspect. According to Crown Prince Gustav wrote in 1769, that Tessin had made Louisa Ulrika &quot;suggestions far from the reverence one is expected to show toward a sovereign.&quot; The Queen felt her pride offended and informed the King, who surprised Tessin on his knees before the Queen. This incident led to the King&#x27;s animosity toward Tessin and the exile of Count and Countess Tessin from court. The queen only remarked that she missed Countess Tessin.

The question on the replacement of Tessin as the governor of the Crown Prince placed the Queen in conflict with the Riksdag. Tessin was replaced as governor of the Crown Prince with Carl Fredrik Scheffer, a candidate selected by the Riksdag, an appointment which was enforced even after the candidate had been refused by the Queen. In 1755, the Riksdag presented their decision to rectify the loop holes in the constitution which Louisa Ulrika had used to claim that the King had greater constitutional power than the Riksdag had allowed him to practice. They stated that the loop holes in the constitution allowing for royal power would be removed, and that the monarch would no longer be allowed to refuse his signature: if he did so, a stamp with his name would be used. At the same time, a commission of the state begun to investigate political crimes. This resulted in a persecution of the followers of Louisa Ulrika within the &quot;Hovpartiet&quot;, one of whom, Eric Wrangel, fled to Norway to avoid arrest. Reportedly, this provocation triggered the Queen&#x27;s plan of a coup d&#x27;état, known in history as Coup of 1756.

The first plan was for the royal couple to travel to Uppsala under the pretext of a visit to Drottningholm Palace. In Uppsala, they would summon the regiments of Närke, Värmland and potentially Uppland as well as the Life Guards and march toward the capital. This plan was aborted because of the King&#x27;s illness in April 1755. To finance the coup, the Queen pawned parts of the Crown Jewels in Berlin. In the three months following her coronation, Louisa Ulrika removed 44 diamonds from the Queen&#x27;s Crown and replaced them with glass, which she pawned in Berlin as security for a loan by the help of her brother August. At this point, rumors reached the Riksdag. A lady-in-waiting of the Queen, Ulrika Strömfelt, who was a loyal follower of the Hats and not a supporter of absolute monarchy, reportedly informed the Riksdag that parts of the Crown Jewels were missing.

In April 1756, the Riksdag demanded to inventory the Crown Jewels. The queen replied that she refused to allow them to see the Crown Jewels as she regarded them as her private property. At this point, the King was taken ill, and she was thereby given the time to send for the jewels from Berlin. She was finally forced to agree to present them to inventory on 22 June. To prevent this, she and her followers within the Hovpartiet, Hård, Horn and Brahe, planned to stage the coup before that day, despite the protests of king Adolf Frederick. The plan was to bribe members of the public to create riots in the capital. The supporters of Hovpartiet would then take control of the Stockholm guard and garrison, which were also to be prepared through bribes. When the military was called out to deal with the riots, it would seize control over the capital&#x27;s military headquarters: the Riksdag would be closed and the opposition arrested and a new Riksdag would be summoned, which would be made to approve of a new constitution, reintroducing absolute monarchy.

The 21 June 1756, the royalist Ernst Angel was overheard talking about the plans of a royal revolution while drunk at a tavern. In parallel, one of the royalist officers, Christiernin, attempted to enlist Corporal Schedvin of the garrison in the coup who, however, informed the Hats. On 22 June 1756, the King and Queen left the capital for Ulriksdal Palace to avoid being present during the inventory of the Crown Jewels. That same day, Ernst Angel, Christiernin, Stålsvärd, Puke, Angel and a number of others were arrested. During the interrogation, Ernst Angel revealed the whole plot. When the King and Queen returned to the capital that night, the streets were patrolled by militia. The members of Hovpartiet were arrested or fled to avoid arrest. In July 1756, seven members of the Queen&#x27;s followers were executed.

The Riksdag of the Estates was well aware that Queen Louisa Ulrika was responsible for the attempted coup d&#x27;état, and there were discussions as how to deal with the Queen&#x27;s guilt. In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possibly with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Archbishop of Uppsala Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that &quot;she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she was responsible for the blood of the recently executed&quot;. She officially replied to the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured &quot;that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom&quot;: Troilius reported that &quot;only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best&quot;. The Archbishop reported, that he observed &quot;tears of rage and sorrow&quot; in her eyes. In private, Louisa Ulrika regarded the reprimand as a humiliating insult, and wrote to her brother Frederick the Great, that during the interview she attempted to display &quot;all the coldness, all the contempt possible to make in a demonstration [...] In my hardest moments I remind myself that I am the sister of Frederick the Great&quot;, and that she regretted nothing but that her revolution had failed. At the same time the King also had a statement read for him by a delegation from the Riksdag, stating that he would be deposed if such an incident was ever to occur again.

In 1757, Sweden entered the Seven Years&#x27; War and declared war on Prussia, the birth country of Louisa Ulrika. The Queen opposed the act and regarded is as an insult, especially since she assumed that a Swedish victory over Prussia would result in the deposition of Adolf Frederick in favor of Christian of Zweibrucken-Birkenfeld. However, a potential Swedish defeat was seen by her as a good opportunity for a coup d&#x27;état in favor of absolute monarchy, as a defeat would discredit the Riksdag. Therefore, she successfully asked her brother Frederick the Great to ask for her as a mediator in future peace negotiations. When the moment arose in 1760, she could not use it as she lacked necessary funds for bribes. In 1761, however, she managed to secure funds from Great Britain and Prussia, and made an alliance through bribes with the Caps (party) to affect the Riksdag in favor of peace with Prussia.
In January 1762, her suggestion of peace with Prussia was accepted in the Riksdag through her bought parliamentarians there, in exchange for a promise not to take revenge on the Hats (party). She was given the official assignment from the Riksdag to handle the peace negotiations with Prussia and secure that Sweden could keep Swedish Pomerania, a task she performed successfully, and she was officially thanked by the Riksdag for her service to the state in May. As a sign of gratitude for this act, the government paid her debts, which made it possible for her to use her money to affect the voting in the Riksdag through bribes.

In exchange for her service during the war, she demanded the 1756 reform of the constitution be retracted. It was decided that a special Riksdag of the states should be summoned to discuss a revised constitution: it was eventually set to take place in 1764. During the two years prior, Louisa Ulrika negotiated with members of both the Caps and the Hats to prepare for a successful reform in favor of absolute monarchy. She took the part of a mediator between to the two parties to unite them on which constitution to agree upon before the Riksdag was summoned. To prepare foreign powers for a new political system in Sweden, she founded a secret cabinet, &quot;Secret de la Reine&quot;, to handle her private foreign policy, appointing first Carl Wilhelm von Düben and then Nils Filip Gyldenstolpe in the position of her &quot;foreign minister&quot;. She appointed Anders Rudolf Du Rietz as her informal ambassador to Catherine the Great in Russia, and she also had Carl Julius von Bohlen appointed official ambassador of Sweden in Prussia. She secured the support of Russia, France and Great Britain, but failed in securing the necessary funds for bribes to the coming Riksdag. In November 1764, the unity between the Caps and Hats parties was broken due to the suspicions of France (who supported the Hats) and Great Britain (who supported the Caps), which deprived Louisa Ulrika of her alliance with the Hats party.

During the Riksdag of 1765, the Queen attempted to balance the Caps and the Hats by creating a third party of her followers from both parties under her follower Malmstein, which she managed to have elected vice speaker. The election to the Riksdag of 1765 was won by the Caps party. By demonstrating how she could affect the votes in the parliament through her third party, she was able to secure her alliance with the Caps. She also summoned the Ambassador of Russia to Kina Slott to secure support from Russia and its ally Denmark. When the question of the Constitution was finally raised in the Riksdag in August, however, the Caps refused to accept an increased royal power and instead limited the power of the Crown even more. With this, her efforts failed once again.

The powerful position of Queen Louisa Ulrika deteriorated with the declining health of her spouse, King Adolf Frederick, and the growing maturity of her son, Crown Prince Gustav. She recognized this threat, and when her son was declared an adult in 1762, she unsuccessfully opposed him taking a seat in the royal council. The tense relationship between her and her son, whom she viewed as a political rival, grew when he opposed her will by insisting to honor his engagement to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, whom he finally married in 1766, instead of marrying a Prussian bride selected by her, which he viewed as a way for her to keep her influence over him and the family. This was illustrated by the Queen&#x27;s harassment of the Crown Princess when she arrived in Sweden. After the Riksdag of 1766, it was no longer her, but her son the Crown Prince, who became the leader of the followers of absolute monarchy. In 1767, when the French ambassador sketched a suggestion of a Swedish coup d&#x27;état, it was, for the first time, the Crown Prince rather than the Queen who was regarded as the natural center figure of the coup.

During the December Crisis of 1768, the King refused to sign a state document, and a Riksdag was summoned to handle the situation.The royalists discussed a coup d&#x27;état to deposed the Riksdag and reintroduce absolute monarchy. Louisa Ulrika did not support a coup at that point, but her view was disregarded and the Crown Prince was instead seen as the leader of the opposition: the coup d&#x27;état was aborted because the Hats party broke an agreement rather than because of the Queen&#x27;s opposition to it.

Her arrogance, her political views and her conflicts with the Riksdag made her less and less liked during her tenure as Queen. Carl Gustaf Tessin once said about her: &quot;It seems undeniable, that our Queen would have been the most staunch of republicans, had she been born a subject; but God has let her be born in a position, where one is wary of one&#x27;s power&quot;.

==Queen Dowager==
In 1771, the King died and she became Queen Dowager. By this time, Louisa Ulrika was immensely unpopular in Sweden. When the news of the old King&#x27;s death reached her son, the new King Gustav III of Sweden, who was then in Paris, he wrote that the Queen Mother be protected, as &quot;I know how little loved my mother is&quot;.

In the Revolution of 1772, her son succeeded where she had failed in 1756 by reinstating absolute monarchy, and his revolution was of great satisfaction to her. Louisa Ulrika wrote to Gustav III to congratulate him on the coup about which she said: &quot;Yes, you are my son, and you deserve to be&quot;. At the time of the coup, she was in Berlin with her daughter. She was present in Swedish Pomerania when that province gave allegiance to the new constitution. When her brother, the King of Prussia, told her that the neighboring countries would now attack Sweden, she wrote to him that she would defend the province of Pomerania against him with her own blood.

Louisa Ulrika could, however, never settle with the position of Queen Dowager. She had expected to be the real ruler behind the throne, and when her son made it clear that he would rule independently from her, their relationship worsened. In 1772, he prevented her plans to marry off her second son Charles to Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt, and in 1774, Charles was married to Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp instead. Gustav III paid her debts with the condition that she established her own separate court at Fredrikshof Palace. In 1777, she was forced to sell Drottningholm Palace to her son Gustav.

In 1777–78, the conflict with her son erupted and she was a central figure in the great succession scandal regarding the legitimacy of the Crown Prince. In 1777, her two younger sons, Charles and Frederick Adolf, visited her. They claimed all women at court had lovers, and that with the exception of their mother, they could not think of even one who did not. Louisa Ulrika suggested that surely the Queen must also be an exception. In reply, her sons laughed and asked her if she had not heard of the rumors that Sophia Magdalena had an affair with Fredrik Munck. She became very upset and ordered Prince Charles to investigate if this were true, as his inheritance to the throne would be endangered by &quot;the common offspred of a common nobleman&quot;. Charles talked to Munck, Munck talked to King Gustav, Gustav talked to Charles who claimed the whole thing was the fault of the Queen Mother, which resulted in a great conflict between mother and son. When the son of the King was born in 1778, rumours circulated that he was the son of Munck. Louisa Ulrika accused the King of having another man father his child. A great scandal erupted, during which the King even threatened to exile her to Pomerania. In the following conflict, her youngest children, Sofia Albertina and Frederick, who had always been her favourites, took her side against the King. Louisa Ulrika was forced to make a formal statement, during which she withdrew her accusation. The statement was signed by the entire adult royal family except the royal couple; two princes, the princess, the Duchess, and six members of parliament. The relationship with Gustav was not repaired until she was on her deathbed. She died in Svartsjö.

<doc id="603160" wikidata="Q3393497" url="?curid=603160" title="Pointe-Fortune, Quebec">
<text>Pointe-Fortune () is a municipality in southwestern Quebec, Canada, on the Ottawa River (Rivière des Outaouais) in Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality, northwest of Montreal. The population at the 2021 Census was 582.

==Geography==
Pointe-Fortune is located on the right bank of the Ottawa River close to the Lake of Two Mountains. The locality borders the Ontario border, near the Carillon hydroelectric generating station. The municipality is located 65 km west of Montreal. Its territory is bounded to the west by the township of East Hawkesbury (Ontario) in the united counties of Prescott and Russell, to the north by the bay of Rigaud, to the east and to the south by the city of Rigaud. On the opposite shore of the lake of Two Mountains is the municipality of Saint-André-d&#x27;Argenteuil, in the Regional County Municipality of Argenteuil, in the Laurentides region. The total area of the municipality is 9.54km2, with 8.09km2 being terrestrial.

Pointe-Fortune is in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands and its terrain is flat. The altitude is 24m on the shore of the Lake of Two Mountains and rises to 48m at the southeastern end of the territory. The low ground levels create several wetlands inland. The soil of Pointe-Fortune consists in the eastern part of a sector dating from the Cambrian composed of sandstone, conglomerate, limestone and dolomite (Potsdam sandstone, Brador and Forteau formations) and, in its western part, of an area of dolomite and sandstone from the Lower Ordovician (Beekmantown group and Romaine formation).

==History==
The area was part of the Seigneury of Rigaud, granted in 1732 to the brothers Pierre and François-Pierre Rigaud de Vaudreuil. Around 1750, they operated a trading post on a point in the Ottawa River, which later became known as Pointe Fortune. The name &quot;Fortune&quot; could refer to Colonel William Fortune who had received a concession in nearby Chatham Township at the end of the 18th century, or to Joseph Fortune, an early 19th century militiaman and surveyor.

The municipality was formerly called Petites-Écorces and Petit-Carillon (referring to the larger Carillon directly across the Ottawa River), but in 1851, the post office opened under the English name of Point Fortune (modified to its current name in 1954). In 1880, the Village Municipality of Pointe-Fortune was created out of territory ceded by Sainte-Madeleine-de-Rigaud.In 2023, the village of Pointe-Fortune became a Municipality. 

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Pointe-Fortune had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Attractions==
Macdonell-Williamson House, which owes its existence to the fur trade and the Voyageurs, is located just west of the historical boundary marker, which still stands and marked the division between Upper and Lower Canada.

The Parish of Saint-François-Xavier-de-Pointe-Fortune celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2004. The municipality was originally served by the Catholic parish of St. Francois Xavier, established in 1904, which eventually closed on December 24, 2014. The church was sold and is now privately owned.

<doc id="603166" wikidata="Q59029" url="?curid=603166" title="Labor history">
<text>Labor history is a sub-discipline of social history which specializes on the history of the working classes and the labor movement. Labor historians may concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from rural history.

The central concerns of labor historians include industrial relations and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of mass politics (especially the rise of socialism) and the social and cultural history of the industrial working classes.

Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as Luddism and Chartism, the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this &quot;institutional&quot; approach included Sidney and Beatrice Webb. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress.

As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was &quot;designed to service and celebrate the Labor movement.&quot;

==Marxist influence==
In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. Kenneth O. Morgan, a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic:
:the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions&#x27; winter of discontent [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the Labour Party. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like Raphael Samuel into the &quot;New Left Review&quot;, a famous journal like &quot;Past and Present&quot;, the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like Tony Benn joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.

Morgan sees benefits: 
:In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labor and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, &#x27;history from below&#x27; so-called, and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the &#x27;condescension of posterity&#x27;; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.
Morgan tells of the downside as well:
: But the Marxist – or sometimes Trotskyist – emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissentit was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff... when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.

Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labor movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history &quot;from below&quot; and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson&#x27;s seminal study &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for social history in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, C. L. R. James, a Marxist who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the Haitian Revolution. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression &quot;within&quot; the working class.

Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers&#x27; organizations, and the &quot;history from below&quot; approach of the Marxist historians.

Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of class itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a postmodernist approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a &quot;language of class&quot;. Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.

==United States==

Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there&#x27;s been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.
The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000. It publishes &quot;International Labor and Working-Class History&quot;. H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students. the Labor and Working-Class History Association formed in 1988 and publishes &quot;&quot;.

Prominent scholars include John R. Commons (1862–1945), David Brody (b. 1930), Melvyn Dubofsky, David Montgomery (1927–2011), and Joseph A. McCartin (born 1959).

==United Kingdom==
Kirk (2010) surveys labor historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics. Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.

Outside the Marxist orbit, social historians paid a good deal of attention to labor history as well.

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labor history was, &quot;in sharp decline&quot;, because:
:there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class. Instead the &#x27;cultural turn&#x27; encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.

<text>Datblygu ( meaning &quot;develop&quot; or &quot;developing&quot;) were a Welsh experimental rock group formed in 1982. They are regarded as a catalyst of the new wave of Welsh rock in the early 1980s.

== History ==
The band was formed by vocalist David R. Edwards and instrumentalist T. Wyn Davies in 1982 while they were at Ysgol Uwchradd Aberteifi in Cardigan, with instrumentalist Patricia Morgan joining in 1984. Edwards&#x27; lyrics were almost entirely in the Welsh language, the subject matter reflecting his &quot;extreme disillusionment&quot; with life in Wales in the early 1980s era under Margaret Thatcher. After four cassette-only releases on Casetiau Neon, the band had their first vinyl release in 1987 on Anhrefn Records, with the &quot;Hwgr-Grawth-Og&quot; EP featuring just Edwards and Morgan, which was picked up by John Peel and led to a session being recorded for his BBC Radio 1 show (the first of five such sessions). While Welsh radio gave the band little airplay, they also found an outlet through Geraint Jarman&#x27;s &quot;Fideo 9&quot; television show on S4C. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Wyau&quot; (&quot;Eggs&quot;), was released in 1988, and was followed two years later with &quot;Pyst&quot; (&quot;Posts&quot;) on the Ofn label. Davies left in 1990 and the group continued as a duo for a while, before being augmented by a series of musicians, notably drummer Al Edwards. Moving to Ankst Records, the Christmas-themed &quot;Blwch Tymer Tymor&quot; cassette was issued in 1991. Edwards collaborated with Tŷ Gwydr and Llwybr Llaethog on the 1992 album &quot;LL.LL v T.G. MC DRE&quot;, before releasing a final Datblygu album in 1993 with &quot;Libertino&quot;. After a single, &quot;Alcohol&quot;/&quot;Amnesia&quot; in 1995, the band split up.

In August 2008 a new 7-inch single &quot;Can y Mynach Modern&quot; (The Song of the Modern Monk) was released. The song recounts (over its brief ninety seconds) the turmoil and madness that engulfed Edwards as the band fell apart in the mid nineties and the long road to recovery that resulted from the fallout. The track is intended as a full stop on their legacy rather than a brand new start.

Datblygu have been cited as a major influence on the generation of Welsh bands that followed, including Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals (who covered Datblygu&#x27;s &quot;Y Teimlad&quot; on their &quot;Mwng&quot; album).

In a rare TV appearance, Edwards featured on S4C documentary programme &quot;O Flaen dy Lygaid&quot; in 2009, presented by Cardiff-based broadcaster and friend of Edwards&#x27;s, Ali Yassine, which followed Edwards and his efforts to recover from mental illness. The programme also featured Datblygu bandmember and former Pobol y Cwm actress Ree Davies and her own battle against mental illness.

In 2012 an exhibition celebrating the band&#x27;s history was held in a Cardiff coffee shop. Edwards and Morgan reunited in 2012 for the EP &quot;Darluniau&#x27;r Ogof Unfed Ganrif ar Hugain&quot;. A new mini-album, &quot;Erbyn Hyn&quot;, was released in June 2014.

In 2020, an album &quot;Cwm Gwagle&quot;, was released. It was No. 2 in The Quietus&#x27; list of 2020&#x27;s Best of Weird Britain – &quot;Another crucial document of a brilliant band&quot;.

Edwards died 22 June 2021.

<text>CBWT-DT (channel 6) is a CBC Television station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It has common ownership with Ici Radio-Canada Télé station CBWFT-DT (channel 3). The two stations share studios on Portage Avenue and Young Street in Downtown Winnipeg; CBWT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located near Red Coat Trail/Highway 2 in Macdonald.

==History==

Planning for CBWT started in November 1952, when the Government of Canada announced its intention of setting up a television station in Winnipeg. The station was announced by J. R. Finlay at a Cosmopolitan Club meeting at the Marlborough Hotel on September 16, 1953. At the time, the station was projected to become western Canada&#x27;s first television station (before Vancouver&#x27;s CBUT), but was delayed. There was an entry for CBWT in the 1953 MTS telephone book. In September 1953, CBC Winnipeg moved into a new facility at 541 Portage Avenue.

A few months later, on May 31, 1954, CBWT began as a bilingual station on channel 4 with an effective radiated power of 60,000 watts. In the same year KXJB-TV began broadcasting on channel 4 from Fargo, North Dakota, and there were concerns of interference between the two stations. CBWT&#x27;s first equipment consisted of an RCA Victor TT10AL transmitter and a six-section Super Turnstile Type TF-6AM antenna, located atop the station&#x27;s roof.

One of CBWT&#x27;s first large mobile production was &quot;Ice Revue&quot;, broadcast from the Winnipeg Winter Club in March 1956. However, the equipment was different and there were complains of television receivers becoming stuck in the vertical or horizontal hold when the mobile unit switched cameras. Older tube-television sets had a sync generator which was blamed for the reception problem.

On September 30, 1956, the station connected to the Trans-Canada Microwave Relay System, which allowed Winnipeggers to watch CBC Television programming on the same day it was broadcast in Toronto and Montreal. To celebrate this link, CBC Television produced a special one-hour program, &quot;Along the Tower Trail&quot;, the Winnipeg segment featured a view of the CPR&#x27;s Marshalling Yards, the Saint Boniface Cathedral, a prairie harvest clip, and a musical piece sung by the Andrew Mynarski School choir. By late 1957, it was decided to move CBWT from channel 4 to channel 3. The changeover occurred in April 1958.

&quot;Eye-To-Eye&quot; was a weekly local current affairs program broadcast from 10:15 to 11 p.m. every Tuesday and was the predecessor to &quot;24Hours&quot;. It debuted on October 20, 1959, and was similar in style to &quot;Close-Up&quot; on the national network. The first topics covered were: &quot;The Slums of Winnipeg&quot;, &quot;Civic Politics – A Sick Joke&quot; and &quot;Interview – Two Young Ladies&quot;. &quot;Eye-To-Eye&quot; was produced by Ken Black and Warner Troyer.

On April 24, 1960, the station became English-only, while French programming moved to the newly launched CBWFT. At the same time two video tape recorders, worth $75,000 each, were installed at the station to replace the kinescope system used previously. The local version of &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; debuted in 1962 and was hosted by Bill Guest, alternately by Ernie Nairn. The program ran until 1985.

On November 16, 1964, CBWT swapped channels with CBWFT and higher-powered transmitters were installed on a new antenna mast near Starbuck, Manitoba. This enabled reception as far as away, and improved reception in the towns of Portage la Prairie, Gimli, Carman, Winkler, Morden, Morris, Letellier, Emerson, Altona, and Dominion City. It continues to be the tallest free-standing structure in the province. The move to VHF channel 6 also permitted people in the coverage area to hear the English feed&#x27;s audio on FM radios tuned to 87.7; this option was no longer available after the station shifted to digital and shut down the analogue transmitter.

There was a large National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians (NABET) strike throughout the CBC organization in the spring of 1981, and production of &quot;24Hours&quot; was halted. Strike action began at 10:30 p.m. on May 3. Shortly after the Mulroney government came to power in 1984, they made major cuts to the CBC, and as a result, 86 staff members were let go at CBWT. A second round of major cuts in December 1990, had a negative effect on local production, especially on the resources of &quot;24Hours&quot;.

On February 27, 1997, CBC Manitoba announced that it would update and expand its studio facilities by at a cost of $2.8 million. In 1998, CBC Manitoba&#x27;s newsroom and studios were expanded into a new building, after essentially using portables and an abandoned church for many years. The new studio featured a window looking down onto Portage. It was one of the first CBC stations to transition to a new digital Betacam SX format. The first television broadcast from the new studio occurred on Monday, September 21, 1998.

Previous programs produced at CBWT include &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, and &quot;Disclosure&quot;.

==Programming==
CBWT is CBC Television&#x27;s flagship station for the Central Time Zone, airing the main CBC schedule one hour after stations in the Eastern Time Zone. This differs from other Canadian television networks, whose Eastern and Central time zones stations air programs simultaneously.

&quot;Country Canada&quot;, &quot;CountryWide&quot; and a local edition of &quot;CBC News at Six&quot; (formerly the local segment of &quot;CBC News: Canada Now&quot; from 2000 to 2006 and &quot;24Hours&quot; from 1970 to 2000) have been produced at CBWT. In addition, &quot;The National&quot; has an investigative unit based at the station.

===Local programming===
&quot;Country Canada&quot; was one of the longest-running programs in Canadian television history and is broadcast nationally. It began as &quot;Country Calendar&quot; in 1954. The program name was carried over to a new digital specialty channel called CBC Country Canada, which first launched in September 2001. &quot;Spotlight&quot; was one of CBWT&#x27;s first news interview programs, which aired Monday through Saturdays between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m.

&quot;3&#x27;s Company&quot; was a local program broadcast in the early 1960s, hosted by Mary Liz Bayer, Bill Guest, and Jose Poneira, and similar to &quot;Living Winnipeg&quot;. Bayer had become the host of her own show, &quot;The Mary Liz Show&quot;, one year earlier. &quot;The Medicine Show&quot; was a local production shown nationally from January 1980 to August 1982. &quot;Show Business&quot;, hosted by Tom McCulloch, and &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;, a music program from a local bar, were produced by CBWT in 1981.

&quot;In Search of the Perfect Summer&quot; was a summertime series produced by Sean Sullivan and was co-hosted by Anne Harding and Laurie Mustard in the 1982 season. It was nominated &quot;Best Variety Program on Television&quot; in the 1982 Winnipeg Broadcast Awards. Mustard won &quot;Best Host/Interviewer&quot; for the series.

Between 1983 and 1986, Mustard hosted the Winnipeg edition of a Sunday morning program for kids called &quot;Switchback&quot;. By 1989, the Winnipeg program was cancelled and amalgamated with the CBKT Regina edition of &quot;Switchback&quot;, contributing a portion of the program content.

The end of regional non-news programming came in 2000–01, when &quot;Breakaway&quot;, a program profiling Manitoba towns which had aired since June 1987, was canceled in a round of CBC budget cuts. Co-host Sandi Coleman went on to host the morning program on CBC Radio One Yukon.

CBWT broadcast &quot;Living Winnipeg&quot;, another regional non-news program, weekdays from January 15, 2007, until the program was cancelled across the network in 2009.

===News operation===
As of March 2024, CBWT-DT broadcasts 5 hours of locally produced newscasts each week. CBWT airs a 60-minute supper hour newscast from 6 to 7 p.m. CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Information Radio&quot; program is also simulcast on CBC Television weekdays from 6 to 7 a.m. CBWT-DT used to produce a 10-minute summary at 11 p.m. on weeknights, however as of March 2024, the station now airs a rebroadcast of the 6 p.m. newscast at 11 p.m.

The first big news story CBWT covered was on June 8, 1954, about one week after the station opened, when the Time Building at 333 Portage Avenue caught fire. The Time Building was across from the Eaton&#x27;s building.

At one time, Western Manitoba Broadcasters (a subsidiary of Craig Media) and CBC Manitoba had an agreement where the Dauphin retransmitter (CBWST 8) would carry a local newscast in place of the Winnipeg news, under the branding of Intermountain Television (IMTV). The program was called &quot;IMTV The Report&quot; and was broadcast at 5:30 p.m. in the 1980s and 1990s.

&quot;News at Noon&quot; was CBWT&#x27;s half-hour news program that ran until January 1985, when the network program &quot;Midday&quot; took the timeslot. It had been previously called &quot;Noon Hour&quot;, which was a 60-minute program. &quot;Midday&quot; ran until 2000, but local news programming has not returned during the noon hour. &quot;24Hours&quot;, an hour-long news and current affairs program, had run from 1970 to 2000. 

On January 5, 2024, longtime CBC Manitoba meteorologist John Sauder signed off for the final time. Sauder had been with the CBC for 16 years, joining in 2008 from rival broadcaster CKY-TV.

On April 5, 2024, weeknight anchor Janet Stewart announced she would be leaving the television broadcast for a year to host &quot;Radio Noon&quot; on CBC Radio One. In May 2024, the corporation announced that Brittany Greenslade would host the 6 p.m. broadcast for one year.

==Technical information==
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CBWT switched from analogue to digital television broadcasting on December 9, 2011, from its Winnipeg transmitter atop the Richardson Building. There had been several delays in the switchover, due to issues involving antenna erection. CBWT&#x27;s former analog transmitter was located southwest of Winnipeg at . CBWT&#x27;s digital signal operates on UHF channel 27. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers will display CBWT&#x27;s virtual channel as 6.1.

===Former transmitters===
CBWT operated approximately 50 analogue television rebroadcasters throughout the province of Manitoba (e.g. The Pas and Thompson), the Central Time Zone portion of Northern Ontario (e.g. Kenora), and portions of Saskatchewan. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

CBWT began extending its signal using various methods, beginning in June 1962 with CBWBT in Flin Flon and CBWBT-1 in The Pas using kinescope recordings from CBWT. Later on, CBTA in Lynn Lake became part of the Frontier Coverage Package in September 1967. From 1968 onwards, CBWT used the province-wide microwave system to provide live television signals.

At one time, CBWAT in Kenora offered separate local news programming from CBWT, which was discontinued in 1979–80 when CJBN-TV went on the air.

<doc id="603172" wikidata="Q7884502" url="?curid=603172" title="Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau">
<text>The Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau is located in an arc around southeastern Ohio, West Virginia, into western Pennsylvania and a small portion of southwestern New York State.

This area is a dissected plateau, characterized by sandstone, shale, and many coal seams. This is the part of the Allegheny Plateau that lies outside the continental glaciation of the ice age.

==Geography==
One of the most spectacular and scenic areas in this region is located in southeast Ohio, and is known as the Hocking Hills region. This area, similar to but smaller than the Red River Gorge in the Cumberland Plateau in Kentucky, features cliffs, rock shelters and waterfalls.

The largest city in the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

===Rivers===
The Ohio River roughly bisects the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau in generally a north-northeast to south-southwest direction. Other significant rivers in the plateau include the Muskingum River and Tuscarawas River in Ohio, the Youghiogheny River and Allegheny River in Pennsylvania, and the Monongahela River and Kanawha River in West Virginia. The Kanawha River is formed by the confluence of the New River and the Gauley River. All three rivers are known for their spectacular deep gorges.

<doc id="603177" wikidata="Q7987718" url="?curid=603177" title="Western Coal Field">
<text>The West Kentucky Coal Field, alternatively The North Pennyrile or simply Northwest Kentucky, comprises an area in the west-central and northwestern part of the state, bounded by the Dripping Springs Escarpment and the Pennyroyal Plateau and the Ohio River, but is part of the Illinois Basin that extends into Indiana and Illinois. It is characterized by Pennsylvanian age sandstones, shales and coal. In a recent effort to distinguish itself from its coal mining past, which in the last 10 years has all but completely disappeared by 2024 with only a scant few mines still operating, the area now usually refers to itself as the Green River Valley since around 2002, named for the Green River, a southern tributary that flows through every county in the region except Union and Hancock. Most regional businesses and many government services use either Green River Valley or simply Green River in their name. Nearly, all of the counties in the area are part of the television market known as the Kentucky–Illinois–Indiana tri-state area.
==Included areas==
The Western Coal Field region of Kentucky includes all of the following counties:

*Butler County
*Daviess County
*Hancock County
*Henderson County
*Hopkins County
*McLean County
*Muhlenberg County
*Ohio County
*Union County
*Webster County

Additionally, the region includes parts of the following counties, mostly in the Clifty Area, which does not contain coal:

*Breckinridge County
*Christian County
*Edmonson County
*Grayson County
*Hart County
*Logan County
*Todd County
*Warren County

The term Western Coalfield (or Western Coal Field) is used to define the region with Pennsylvanian-age strata, largely sandstone and shale, in contrast to the Mississippian-age limestone of the adjoining and older Pennyroyal region. A transitional zone, generally defined as being part of the coalfield, is the Clifty Area, where there is no coal but some sandstone is bituminous, and has commercial value as paving material and potentially as tar sands for liquid refining.

The biggest concentration of surface mines in this region has historically been in Hopkins, Muhlenberg, and Ohio counties. All three counties still contain a very large amount of coal and have active mining, surface and underground, operations taking place. The use of power shovels and draglines were very common in these counties where the coal would lay as close as 60–80 feet from the surface. This is a region that was considered to be the largest producer of coal in the world from the 1960s through part of the &#x27;80s until it dramatically dropped in the early &#x27;90s after the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The largest mining company founded during the 30-year span of prosperity became Peabody Coal Company (Peabody Energy), whose corporate offices were located in the region in Henderson, Ky., at the time. A combination of economic shifts and industry contributed to a decline in coal production starting in the early 1970s. Western Kentucky coal production has risen since 2004, partly because coal-fired power plants have been reconfigured to meet Clean Air Act requirements, making it easier for them to burn and the region&#x27;s higher-sulfur coal. In 2012 Western Kentucky coal production exceeded Eastern Kentucky production for the first time since 1960, because of the decline of the industry in the Central Appalachian Basin. In 2003 Armstrong Coal Company leased a large chunk of property in the region from Peabody to recover the coal.

<text>Rigaud () is a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada, in the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality in Vallée-du-Haut-Saint-Laurent region. It is located at the junction of the Ottawa River and the Rigaud River, about west of downtown Montreal and east of Ottawa. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 7,854.

==History==

Rigaud is located on the traditional territory of the Algonquins, who fled the region before the arrival of the French, due to violent attacks by the Iroquois. Étienne Brûlé was the first European to travel on the Ottawa River, in 1615.

The Seigneury of Rigaud was granted in 1732 to the brothers Pierre and François-Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, governors in New France, and was sold in 1763 to Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, who in turn gave the seigneury to his son in 1771.

The seigneury saw its first settlers in 1783. At the beginning of the 19th century, the locality developed rapidly as an accommodation relay for loggers, and as a loading point for timber and cereals. In 1802, the Mission of Sainte-Magdeleine-de-Rigaud was founded, which became a parish in 1830. In 1835, the Rigaud Post Office opened. In 1845, the Municipality of Rigaud was formed, but abolished in 1847. It was reestablished in 1855 as the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Magdeleine-de-Rigaud (or Sainte-Madeleine-de-Rigaud).
In the second half of the 19th century, the establishment of several religious institutions and the development of the railways contribute to local development. In 1880, the village itself split off from the rural parish municipality to form the Village Municipality of Rigaud. That same year, Pointe-Fortune and Très-Saint-Rédempteur were also created out of territory of Sainte-Madeleine-de-Rigaud.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Rigaud was an important regional center and becomes administrative centre of the riding of Vaudreuil. Rigaud changed status to city in March 1911.

On November 29, 1995, the City of Rigaud and the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Madeleine-de-Rigaud rejoined to form the new Municipality of Rigaud, which changed status to city again on August 22, 2015.

In April 2023 there was a storm of black ice that affected the residents of the territory. People numbering 1872 lost electricity because of that storm.

==Geography==
Rigaud is located at the northwestern part of the Suroît region, on the south shore of Lake of Two Mountains, a widening of the Ottawa River, leading north towards the Laurentians region. It extends along the Rigaud River back from Ottawa, and several hamlets are built for certain riparian areas of the lake, others as old industrial centers in the plains, or more recently, rural residential developments. The western limit of the municipality constitutes the interprovincial border with the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, in Ontario.

Dairy and cattle farms dominate the western part of the territory, while the equine farms propagate in the east and north, and that several sugar bushes are exploited on the mountain. In addition to this agricultural activity, there are sand pits, as well as resort and leisure areas, and particularly winter and hiking sports and camping, as well as commercial and service areas serving both the surrounding population and traffic. transit . The population of Rigaud is around 7,854 inhabitants, as per the 2021 Census. Rigaud remains a regional community, unlike neighboring cities to the east, which have been integrated into the Montreal Metropolitan Area.

Neighbouring municipalities are Hudson, Vaudreuil-Dorion, Sainte-Marthe, Très-Saint-Rédempteur, East Hawkesbury, and Pointe-Fortune. The municipality located across Ottawa River is Saint-André-d&#x27;Argenteuil. The geographic location of Rigaud, at the head of the Ottawa River and between the Montreal and Ottawa metropolitan areas, has contributed largely to its economic development throughout its history.

The municipality covers a total area of , of which are terrestrial. The relief is composed, on the North side, of the Ottawa River plain, which is part of the St. Lawrence Lowlands and, on the South side, of the Rigaud Mountain. The plain is partly agricultural, partly wooded and partly urbanized. It has three subspaces: wetlands and lowlands, which are prone to flooding as they are located along the Ottawa River; the indentations and embankments of the Rigaud and Raquette rivers; and, the flat terrace, which makes up most of the territory. The soils of the plain consist of alluvial deposits, and Pointe à la Raquette is particularly alluvial and muddy.
Lake of Two Mountains and the Rigaud mountain dominate the landscape. The Rigaud mountain covers , and is divided into three physiographic units: the escarpment to the north-west; the central plateau modulated by local peaks; and the lower slopes to the east and north.

The forest mainly composed of rocky surface and loam, and approximately a third of its area is rocky and rugged . This bottom moraine consists of pieces of rock that a glacier has torn from its bed, the bedrock of the Canadian Shield, chunks he shrunk and rounded as he rolled over them, carrying them and losing them in this bowl, a few thousand years ago, at the end of the Wisconsin Ice Age. 8,500 years ago, when the lowlands of the St.Lawrence rose directly to the Champlain Sea, the Rigaud stadium was characterized by the powerful rivers which drained water from the present-day Great Lakes, transporting immense quantities of sand, thus forming the terraces of Rigaud and the plateau of Saint-Lazare. The lithology of Rigaud is characterized by three zones:

* a Cambrian substrate composed of sandstone, conglomerate, limestone and dolomite in the waterfront area from Rigaud to Vaudreuil; 
* dolomite and sandstone area of Ordovicien, less than the circumference of the Rigaud River; 
* and the granite of the Proterozoic on Rigaud mountain.

The Rigaud Mountain is home to one of the only two ancient forests of Suroît. The forest is generally intermediate there, with mature areas on the northern flank. Areas of young forest also line the shore of the Ottawa River. The forest stand is characteristic of the bioclimatic domain of the maple hickory stand. The hill is populated mainly with maple and beech groves. The exceptional forest ecosystems foster an extensive catalogue, of which a hemlock grove/red spruce forest, a red oak grove, a moist cedar forest with fir, a maple hickory and a maple linden forest on Rigaud mountain, as well as a silver maple with red ash, a maple hickory, and a group of oval hickory around the edges of . The Rigaud Mountain is home to about 250 white-tailed deer, as well as to the spotted salamander. It is also home to 250 species of birds, including the great woodpecker, the wild turkey, the ruffed grouse, as well as to owls. A large number of aquatic and migratory birds also live in wetlands, particularly on the shores of the Brazeau and Rigaud bays, as well as at Pointe à la Raquette.

=== Occupation of the territory ===

The plain offers favorable conditions for agriculture, infrastructure and urban development. Rigaud Mountain, because of its slope and the poor quality of its soil, has kept its forest cover, although it has had extensive residential and recreational development. More than a third of the territory of Rigaud is forest.

Farmland in Rigaud is mainly to the west, on the left bank of the Rigaud River, and primarily used for market gardening. The valley of the Rivière à la Raquette to the east is sparsely populated in the north due to the presence of swamps in the point; the land is used for various purposes including a sand pit, a transit service center, a campground and small horse farms. 
Rigaud mountain, along the crest of Chemin Saint-George and at the top of Rue Bourget, offers a view of the Ottawa River and the Laurentians. It is a wooded area, with hiking trails, a few isolated clusters of new country residences and old cabins, as well as recreational and tourism operations.

The village of Rigaud, which roughly corresponds to the old town of Rigaud, is made up of old and of traditional Quebec architecture. It is organized around the primary roads, Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Pierre streets, as well as Saint-Viateur Street. It includes almost all the businesses, shops, services and institutions of the municipality. The industrial companies are located in three industrial parks on the edge of the urban core, namely the industrial parks of the Cooperative, Doctor-Oscar-Gendron and J.-Marc-Séguin.

The cadastre and the arterial road network of Rigaud are structured around nine original concessions of the seigneury of Rigaud. Several hamlets and built-up areas dot the countryside: 
*La Baie, on the edge of Rigaud Bay to the west of the village;
*Rigaud-sur-le-Lac (Bas-de-la-Rivière), on the Ottawa River at the mouth of the Rigaud River, consists of old chalets, many of which have been transformed into residences, and is experiencing recent residential development; 
*Dragon (Grande Ligne), near Pointe à la Raquette on the edge of the railroad, was developed during the First World War.

The toponym of the hamlet comes from the golden dragon represented on the logo of the company &quot;Northern Explosive&quot; which was established there; 
* (Anse-à-la-Raquette), old and rural, is located on the edge of Anse near Hudson; Petit-Brûlé — Haut-de-la-Chute, rural country sector bordering the Rigaud and Rigaud Est rivers. The soil in this area is subject to landslides; 
*Mountain Ranches, made up of recent rural residential pockets on the north side of the Rigaud mountain, accessible by the Town Hall path; 
*Saint-Georges, on the Rigaud mountain plateau.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rigaud had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Attractions==
===Rigaud Mountain===

The main attraction is Mont-Rigaud, a hill with downhill ski runs (at Ski Mont Rigaud), a private school (Collège Bourget), a monastery, and a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Sanctuaire Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes). The mountain is also home to an unusual, natural rock garden known as the &quot;champs de patates&quot;, so named because of the local legend that it was once a potato field, turned to stone by God because the farmer worked on Sunday. There is also the open yearound Sucrerie de la Montagne, a traditional sugar shack offering explanation of the maple syrup production and traditional sugaring off feast.

===Other attractions===
On the opposite side of the mountain is a residential community known as &quot;Mountain Ranches.&quot; The middle to upper-middle class community features large, mostly secluded building lots in a wooded setting that draws residents because of its isolated tranquility and privacy. As such, it was the hiding place for fugitive Charlie Wilson, one of the leaders of the notorious 1963 Great train robbery in England. This area was also known for its &quot;tree farms&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s, providing a tax shelter for the well off, until the tax laws were later changed to require harvesting of those &quot;tree farms&quot;. The &quot;Pitcairn Tree Farm&quot; was one such example.

Other attractions include its maple and blueberry products, and the local microbrewery &quot;Le Castor&quot;.

A training center for the Canada Border Services Agency is located in Rigaud.

<text>The pfennig (;  &#x27;pfennigs&#x27; or &#x27;pfennige&#x27; ; symbol pf or ₰) or penny is a former German coin or note, which was an official currency from the 9th century until the introduction of the euro in 2002. While a valuable coin during the Middle Ages, it lost its value through the years and was the minor coin of the Mark currencies in the German Reich, West Germany and East Germany, and the reunified Germany until the introduction of the euro. Pfennig was also the name of the subunit of the Danzig mark (1922–1923) and the Danzig gulden (1923–1939) in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland).

== Overview ==
=== Name ===
The word &quot;Pfennig&quot; (replacing the &quot;denarius&quot; or &quot;denarius&quot; as a low-denomination silver coin) can be traced back to the 8th century and also became known as the &quot;Penning&quot;, &quot;Panni(n)g &quot;, &quot;Pfenni(n)c&quot;, &quot;Pfending&quot; and by other names, e.g. in Prussia until 1873, &quot;Pfenning&quot;. The &quot;-ing&quot;- or &quot;-inc&quot; suffix was used, in addition to &quot;-ung&quot;, the formation of affiliation substantives and also appears in other coin denominations, for example in the &quot;schilling&quot;. Beyond that, its origin has not been clarified, but an early borrowing from the Latin &quot;pondus&quot; (&quot;weight&quot;, cf. pound) is possible. According to an 1848 Leipzig trade lexicon the name pfennig was &quot;originally the general name of &quot;every&quot; coin in Germany, which is supposed to be derived from the hollow coins or bracteatess, because these had the shape of a &quot;pan&quot;&quot; (i.e. they were bent).&quot;

The word &quot;Pfennig&quot; is etymologically related to the English penny, the Swedish penning, which was also model for the Finnish penni (1860–2001), the Estonian penn (1918–1927), the Polish fenig (1917–1918), the Lithuanian word for money &quot;pinigai&quot; and the pfenig (fening) of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1998–today). The /pf/ rather than /p/ in both pronunciation and spelling is a result of the High German consonant shift or second Germanic sound shift which affected the High German dialects of what is now southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria. High German (and to some extent Central German) dialects form the basis for modern Standard German.

=== Related currencies ===
The pfennig was the progenitor of a whole series of later coin denominations, which became parts or multiples of the later pfennig. These include the &quot;groschen&quot; (&quot;big [pfennig]&quot;, from the Latin &quot;grossus&quot; &quot;big, thick&quot; ), &quot;Angster&quot; (&quot;narrow [pfennig]&quot;, from the Latin &quot;angustus&quot; &quot;narrow, thin&quot;), &quot;Albus&quot; (&quot;white [pfennig]&quot;, from the Latin &quot;albus&quot; &quot;white&quot;; initially equivalent to a &quot;Groschen&quot;), &quot;Witte&quot; (&quot;white [pfennig]&quot;), &quot;Rappen&quot; (&quot;pfennig with a raven&quot;), &quot;Stäbler&quot; (&quot;pfennig with the Basle staff&quot;), &quot;Heller&quot; (&quot;Haller [pfennig]&quot;), &quot;Schwaren&quot; (&quot;heavy [pfennig]&quot;) etc.

There were also &quot;light pfennigs&quot; (&quot;leichte Pfennige&quot;), &quot;good pfennigs&quot; (&quot;gute Pfennige&quot;) or &quot;custom pfennigs&quot; (&quot;Zollpfennige&quot;), which had this name on the coin. Some types of pfennig were given special names in the vernacular, such as the Erfurt &quot;coffin pfennig&quot; (&quot;Sargpfennig&quot;).

==Sign==

As a currency sign a variation of the minuscule letter &#x27;d&#x27; for &#x27;denarius&#x27; in German Kurrent script was modified so the terminal end of the minuscule Kurrent &#x27;d&#x27;, that trailed at the top of the ascender in an anticlockwise loop, was instead brought down behind the right of the ascender, to form a descender, that hooked clockwise, thus making it a distinct symbol, different from any of the other Kurrent letters in its own right: ₰.

The pfennig symbol has nearly fallen out of use since the 1950s, with the demise and eventual abolition of the Reichsmark with its &quot;Reichspfennig&quot;, as well as the abolition of Kurrent by the Nazis on 3 January 1941, thus making it increasingly cryptic as familiarity with Kurrent script has decreased since that time. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at .

Unicode has , a square combination of (), Japanese for &quot;pfennig&quot;, for compatibility with earlier Japanese character sets.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Charlemagne established, in the so-called &quot;Carolingian coin standard&quot;, that from a Carolingian (&quot;pound&quot;) of silver, 240 coins were to be minted (corresponding to about 1.7 g of silver per coin). The coin was called in the Latin language of the time, a after the old Roman coin (see § Coin standard). From this coin evolved later the French and the Italian . The Arabic word () can also be traced back to the Latin word . In the Old High German language, the was already called the () at the time of Charlemagne. In North German and Dutch-speaking countries it was later called a and in England the penny. The term for the Roman first appeared in England around 765, when King Offa had struck out of silver based on the Carolingian model. This explains the abbreviation &quot;d&quot; as in , which was used for the &quot;old&quot; penny in the United Kingdom until 1971. The early pfennig weighed around 1.3g to 2g, its weight tending to steadily decrease over the centuries. The widespread fluctuations in the weight of the same pfennigs were partly due to the manufacturing process, with the heavier pfennig specimens being sought out by private individuals in accordance with Gresham&#x27;s law. At that time and even partly up to modern times, it was the total weight of a certain number of similar pfennigs that had to be right for larger payments, a practice that tended to promote deviating exchange rates between smaller and larger coin denominations and which found its climax in the Kipper and Wipper era; for example, the terms (= 60 pf), or &quot;pound sterling&quot; (= 240 d).

From the 8th to the 13th century, the pfennig (or ) consisted of high-quality silver, and was the only denomination in circulation, other units being used purely as arithmetic units, and it thus had a high purchasing power. As a result, this era is also called the (&quot;pfennig era&quot;) in numismatics. Only very rarely were half-pfennigs minted, which were also known as &quot;obole&quot; or &quot;scherf&quot;.
Around 1200, the pfennig was the largest and only German silver denomination, apart from imported foreign gold and silver coins. Smaller denominations were created by cutting the coins in half or quarters, producing something called hacksilver, which was very easy to do with the one-sided thin hollow pfennigs or , which were then referred to as bracteates from the 17th century. The &quot;change&quot; that was often still required for price and quantity equalization by buyers and sellers on the city markets were small amounts of natural produce and goods that were included in the overall purchase process.

Around 1200, the different mint lords of the Holy Roman Empire minted their regional pfennigs to very different standards in terms of gross and fine weights, because the German kingdom handed over minting rights or did not enforce them as a uniform imperial standard consistently. As a result, many regional pfennigs with different exchange rates arose over time. Somes coins had a black tint due to the large addition of copper, and so a distinction was made between white pfennigs (, , ) and black pfennigs ( = &quot;copper pfennig&quot;). A well-known example is the , which was later legally defined as a or in subsequent imperial coinage regulations as a separate denomination valued at two to a pfennig until the 19th century e.g. in Bavaria. Even the early () had a noticeable addition of copper, so that the very quickly became the first German &quot;pure&quot; copper coin.

The pfennigs of the Schinderling period, the black pfennigs, were minted from 1457 mainly in southern Germany, especially in Austria and Bavaria, with almost no silver. The so-called (&quot;Evil Halser&quot;) of this time essentially consisted of a copper-tin alloy. The period of the so-called ended with the phasing out of the 5-lot pfennigs in 1460. The black pfennigs undermined confidence in Austria&#x27;s silver currency for a long time.

For the successful introduction of the silver currency, which replaced the regional pfennig, sufficient coins of lower denomination had to be available. The silver-rich Saxon dukes, for example, had hollow pfennigs and hollow hellers minted at Gotha and Langensalza to prescribed coinage ordinances. However, the constant reduction in the silver content of the groschen meant that new ordinances to reduce the silver content of the pfennigs that the cities sometimes minted themselves.

The (&quot;bowl pfennig&quot;) minted from 1374 to the 18th century is a concave pfennig, stamped on one side only, that was minted from 1374 onwards, and was so called due to its minting technique. It was created by stamping using one upper die only onto a larger planchet. As a result, the rim of the coin was pressed upwards into the shape of a bowl or plate.

The forerunners of the were the one-sided silver () and () of the Free Imperial City Strasbourg and the Trier pfennigs, which were being minted as early as the beginning of the 14th century. They are so-called (&quot;eternal pfennigs&quot;), since unlike most bracteates, they did not have to be exchanged regularly for a fee.

The so-called Palatine , named after its depiction of a lozenged shield or heraldic lozenge (), was minted from about 1390. From the 15th century, a characteristic feature of the pfennig was its curved shape and a prominent circle of beads, which surrounded the coin image. The pearl circle does not occur in the later minted from the 16th to the 18th century.

=== Pricing examples from the Saxon-Thuringian region ===
Krug gives the following examples of what could be bought for pfennigs in regions of Saxony and Thuringia:
The pfennigs concerned were usually the coins from the Freiberg state mint.

=== Modern period ===
==== 17th and 18th centuries ====
By the late 17th century, the pfennigs had lost most of their value. The last pfennig coins containing traces of silver are rarities minted in 1805. Effectively, by the end of the 17th century the pfennig had been reduced to a pure copper coin. In the 18th century, some German mints minted copper and billon pfennigs at around the same time. From the middle of the 18th century, however, the proportion of billon coins compared to pure copper pfennig coins tended to decrease, which was also reflected in the 2 to 4 pfennig coins. The last silver-containing 1 pfennig coins with the designation &quot;Pfenig&quot; were minted in Germany in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld from 1808 to 1811 and date stamped 1808 and are rare. Even the copper pfennigs were not all of the same value. Bremen therefore called its pfennigs (&quot;heavy pfennigs&quot;) for which the common name prevailed.

Some renowned coins made of copper are the or of Schwäbisch Hall, some centuries later called Heller, and minted throughout the country, and the (from , the cross minted on the coins), minted in Austria, Switzerland, and some regions of Upper Germany.

==== 19th and 20th centuries ====
Until 1821, various smaller coin systems were in use in the Prussian provinces. Only in the provinces of Brandenburg and Westphalia was the pfennig the smallest coin in terms of value. With the Prussian small coin reform of 1821, a uniform small coin system was introduced for all Prussian provinces. To distinguish it from the pfennigs before the reform, the new denomination was called . One thaler was no longer 288 pfennigs, but 360 . This new ratio was also reflected on the side with the coat of arms: . Other states, such as Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, minted pfennig coins well into the 19th century.

In the southern German states (Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria including the Palatinate, Saxony, and other smaller ones), the value of the was fixed at 1/240 of a by the coinage act of 1506 and that remained in force until 1871. (1 = 60 , 1 = 4 , 1 = 2 .) The half-pfennig () was the only coin of the period that remained officially valid after the introduction of the imperial currency (because of the beer tax in Bavaria).

In some southern German states, the term was a synonym for the pfennig (e.g. in the city of Frankfurt and in the Duchy of Nassau). In Bavaria, the heller was half a penny.
The gold.mark, introduced by the German Coinage Act of 1871, was the currency of the newly founded German Empire, divided into 100 pfennigs. This partition was retained through all German currencies (including the , the , and the pfennig of the Deutsche Mark) until 2001.
The last West German one- and two-pfennig coins were steel with a copper coating. The five- and ten-pfennig coins were steel with a brass coating. The latter was called a Groschen, while the five-pfennig coin, half a groschen, was regionally (east of the river Elbe) also referred to as the (), deriving from the former duodecimal division of the groschen. All four coins had their value imprinted on the obverse and an oak tree on the reverse.

The coins of the East German mark were made of aluminium, except for the 20 pfennig coin, which was made of an aluminium copper alloy.

==Pfennig since the euro==
After the introduction of the euro, some, mainly older, Germans tend to use the term pfennig instead of cent for the copper-coloured coins (and the term Groschen for the 10-cents-coin).

<text>Alice Pearce (October 16, 1917 – March 3, 1966) was an American actress. She was brought to Hollywood by Gene Kelly to reprise her Broadway performance in the film version of &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949). Pearce played comedic supporting roles in several films before being cast as nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz in the television sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot; in 1964. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series posthumously after the second season of the series. She died from ovarian cancer in 1966.

==Early life and career==
Pearce was born in New York City, the only child of Margaret Clark and Robert E. Pearce. Her father was a foreign banking specialist, and her family moved to Europe when she was 18 months old. They lived in Brussels, Antwerp, Rome, and Paris. At age nine, she fell off a swing after losing her grip and landed on her chin. This left her with an undeveloped chin. She returned to the United States as a teenager and boarded at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1940 with a degree in drama.

She began working in nightclubs as a comedienne and was cast in the original Broadway production of &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944–1946). Gene Kelly was so impressed by her that she became the only cast member to be included in the film version in 1949. Her comedic performance was well received by critics and public alike. She was given her own television variety show, &quot;The Alice Pearce Show&quot;. More movie roles followed, and she made appearances on Broadway where she met her husband, director Paul Davis, during a production of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;.

During the 1953–1954 television season, Pearce was seen regularly on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jamie&quot;, which starred Brandon deWilde. In 1964, Pearce was originally approached to play the part of Grandmama in the ABC television comedy series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. She turned down the part, which went to veteran actress Blossom Rock. Later that year, Pearce joined the cast of &quot;Bewitched&quot; as the nagging and nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz. Pearce&#x27;s scenes were almost entirely reactions to the witchcraft she had witnessed at the house across the street. Her hysterical accusations against Samantha, played by Elizabeth Montgomery, and the disbelief of her husband Abner (George Tobias) provided a common thread through many of the series&#x27; early episodes. She played the role until her death in 1966 and was replaced by Sandra Gould. Pearce was posthumously awarded an Emmy Award for this role. Her husband accepted the award on her behalf.

==Personal life==
Pearce was married twice. Her 1948 marriage to composer John Rox lasted until his death in 1957. In 1964, she married stage manager Paul Davis, with whom she remained until her death.

==Death==
Pearce was diagnosed with terminal cancer before &quot;Bewitched&quot; began. She kept her illness a secret, although her rapid weight loss was quite evident during the second season of the sitcom. She filmed her last episode, &quot;Baby&#x27;s First Paragraph,&quot; on January 21, 1966. Pearce died from ovarian cancer less than two months later on March 3, 1966, at age 48. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered at sea.

<doc id="603183" wikidata="Q71393" url="?curid=603183" title="Psi (instant messaging client)">
<text>Psi is a free instant messaging client for the XMPP protocol (including such services as Google Talk) which uses the Qt toolkit. It runs on Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), Windows, macOS and OS/2&lt;ref name=&quot;Psi/2&quot;&gt;Psi build for OS/2. Version 0.15, ZIP package.&lt;/ref&gt; (including eComStation and ArcaOS).

User interface of program is very flexible in customization. For example, there are &quot;multi windows&quot; and &quot;all in one&quot; modes, support of different iconsets and themes.

Ready-to-install deb and RPM packages are available for many Linux distributions. Successful ports of Psi were reported for Haiku, FreeBSD and Sun Solaris operating systems.

Due to Psi&#x27;s free/open-source nature, several forks have appeared, which occasionally contain features that may appear in future official Psi versions.

== Project name ==
&#x27;Psi&#x27; is the twenty-third letter of the Greek alphabet (Ψ), which is used as the software&#x27;s logo.

== Mission statement ==
The goal of the Psi project is to create a powerful, yet easy-to-use XMPP client that tries to strictly adhere to the XMPP drafts and XMPP XEPs. This means that in most cases, Psi will not implement a feature unless there is an accepted standard for it in the XMPP community. Doing so ensures that Psi will be compatible, stable, and predictable.

== History ==
The application was created by Justin Karneges and it began as a side project. At various points during its existence Karneges was paid to develop the codebase, during which Psi flourished. Typically however, the release cycle of Psi is relatively slow, but the client has always been seen by its fans as a very stable and powerful instant messaging client. Karneges left the project in late 2004 to pursue other endeavors.
In 2002 Michail Pishchagin started hacking Qt code which later became libpsi library. Pishchagin joined the team in March 2003 and he is responsible for many large chunks in Psi code.

In November 2004, maintenance was taken over by Kevin Smith, a long-time contributor to the project. In 2009, Smith handed maintenance back to Karneges, who also maintains Iris, the Qt/C++ XMPP library upon which Psi is based.

Remko Tronçon started writing his custom patches for Psi in 2003, and became an official developer in May 2005.

In 2009 a Psi fork named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are: implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for transferring them to upstream. As of 2017 all active Psi+ developers have become official Psi developers, and now Psi+ is just a development branch of Psi with rolling release development model.

Users who wants to receive new features and bug fixes very quickly may use Psi+ on daily basis. Users who do not care about new trends and prefer constancy may choose Psi as it uses classical development model and its releases are quite rare.

== Features ==
Because XMPP allows gateways to other services, which many servers support, it can also connect to Yahoo!, AIM, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ and Microsoft networks. Other services available using gateway servers include RSS and Atom news feeds, sending SMS messages to cellular networks and weather reports.

As of 2012, Psi has language packs for 20 languages, with more being created.

Emoticon packs are supported using the jisp format. Many jisp emoticon packs are available, including ones from AIM, iChat, and Trillian.

Psi supports file transfers between other XMPP clients, and it is possible to send to or receive files from other IM networks, if the user&#x27;s servers support this. Psi supports Contact Is Typing Notification (which works with Yahoo!, MSN, and AIM contacts). Version 0.10, released in January 2006, brought automatically resizing contact list and composing window in chat dialogs, tabbed chats, support for Growl messaging system on Mac OS X, window transparency and many other changes.

Support of audio and video calls in Psi via Jingle is implemented via officially supported plugin PsiMedia.

=== Encryption ===
Security is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client (OpenPGP, OTR, and OMEMO) via appropriate plugins. Encryption of messages in group chats is supported only via OMEMO plugin.

<text>Endpoint was a hardcore band from Louisville, Kentucky. Many of their songs dealt with social and political issues.

The band was founded in 1988 as Deathwatch. They released only one record, posthumously in 1991, which was a split 7-inch with another local band named Crain. In 1988, the band changed their name and the following year, with most of the original line-up, released a 17-song album on cassette through the Slamdek Record Company label. The album, called &quot;If The Spirits Are Willing&quot;, was available in Louisville area stores in May 1989. However, following this release, the band got a new rhythm section and went on to write &quot;In a Time of Hate,&quot; which was held up in production but was released in early 1991 on Conversion Records. The following year, the band released &quot;Catharsis,&quot; on Doghouse Records. Endpoint released two more records and toured the United States extensively and Europe between 1992 and 1994.

In 1994, the band finally decided to call it quits after a seven-year career. On December 31, they played their last and largest show for over two thousand people in, of course, Louisville. In 1995, the band released their last record, appropriately entitled &quot;The Last Record&quot;.

They reunited for two shows in 2010 as a benefit for Jason Noble of Rodan, who had been diagnosed with cancer.

A large number of Endpoint&#x27;s songs were political. They have been described as having a &quot;soaring pro-community message&quot;.

<doc id="603188" wikidata="Q2583254" url="?curid=603188" title="Flexitarianism">
<text>A flexitarian diet, also called a semi-vegetarian or &quot;fauxtarian&quot; diet, is one that is centered on plant foods with limited or occasional inclusion of meat. For example, a flexitarian might eat meat only some days each week.

== Definitions ==
Different definitions of flexitarianism are used. According to the Dutch environmental organisation &quot;Natuur &amp; Milieu&quot;, a flexitarian eats no meat, fish or lunch meat for at least one day a week. The Dutch research agency &quot;I&amp;O Research&quot; calls people flexitarian when they do not eat meat one or more days a week. The Dutch Food Health authority &quot;Voedingscentrum&quot; states that flexitarians do not eat meat (but can eat fish) three or more days a week in between or with a hot meal.

Vegetarianism is the strict practice of abstaining from consuming meat or any other animal tissue. &quot;Flexitarianism&quot; is a neoteric term that gained a considerable increase in usage in both science and public sectors in the 2010s. &quot;Flexitarian&quot; was listed in the mainstream &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; in 2012. In 2003, the American Dialect Society voted &quot;flexitarian&quot; as the year&#x27;s most useful word.

Other neologisms used as synonyms for semi-vegetarianism are &quot;demi-vegetarianism&quot;, &quot;reducetarianism&quot;, and &quot;semi-veganism&quot;.

== Developments ==
In 2015, according to the Voedingscentrum, 55% of Dutch people were flexitarians. According to Natuur &amp; Milieu, in 2016, 67% of the Dutch were flexitarian. According to research by Wageningen University &amp; Research, the number of Dutch people who call themselves flexitarians increased from 14% in 2011 to 43% in 2019. However, the number of days that self-proclaimed flexitarians ate meat increased over that period from 2.9 days a week to 3.7 days. The researchers suspected that this was mainly due to the inflation of this term among the Dutch.

According to a study by LEI Wageningen UR, the proportion of Dutch people who eat meat daily decreased from 26.7% to 18.4% between 2010 and 2012. According to a study by Dutch research agency &quot;Motivaction&quot; at the beginning of June 2012, reducing meat consumption is a conscious choice for 35% of the Dutch. 14.8% of the population ate meat no more than one or two days a week.
In Flanders, 1 in 6 people in 2013 do not eat meat one or more days a week. A quarter opts for a meat-free day at least once a month.

In 2003, the American Dialect Society chose the word flexitarian as the most useful word of the year.

== Motivations ==
Common reasons for adopting a flexitarian diet include religious restrictions, weight management, health consciousness, issues relating to animal welfare or animal rights (see ethical omnivorism), the environment (see environmental vegetarianism), or reducing resource use (see economic vegetarianism). Flexitarians may have attitudes and endorsement behavior concerning health issues, humanitarianism, and animal welfare.

==Varieties==
The main fundamental of some specific flexitarian diets is about the inflexible adherence to a diet that omits multiple classes and types of animals from the diet in entirety, rather than a sole focus on reduction in consumption frequency. Some examples include:
* Demitarianism: the practice of reducing meat consumption to half of what is culturally typical. The term was devised in October 2009 in Barsac, France combined workshop of Nitrogen in Europe (NinE) and Biodiversity in European Grasslands: Impacts of Nitrogen (BEGIN) where they developed &quot;The Barsac Declaration: Environmental Sustainability and the Demitarian Diet&quot;.
* Pescetarian diet: someone who follows this diet eats fish and/or shellfish and may or may not consume dairy and eggs. The consumption of other meat, such as poultry, mammal meat, and the flesh of other land-dwelling animals is abstained from. In the past, some vegetarian societies used to consider it to simply be a less-strict type of vegetarianism. This is no longer the case now that modern day vegetarian societies object to the consumption of all fish and shellfish.
* Pollotarian diet: someone who follows this diet eats chicken and/or other poultry and usually eggs as well. A pollotarian would not consume seafood or the meat from mammals or other animals, often for environmental, health or food justice reasons.
* Macrobiotic diet: a plant-based diet that may include occasional fish or other seafood. Cereals, especially brown rice, are the staples of the macrobiotic diet, supplemented by small amounts of vegetables and occasionally fish. Some advocates of the macrobiotic diet promote a vegetarian (or nearly vegan) approach as the ideal.
* Planetary health diet: dietary paradigms that have the following aims: to feed a growing world&#x27;s population, to greatly reduce the worldwide number of deaths caused by poor diet, and to be environmentally sustainable as to prevent the collapse of the natural world.

== Dietary pattern ==

All semi-vegetarians could accurately be described as people who eat a plant-based diet, but there is no firm consensus how infrequently someone would have to eat meat and fish for their diet to be considered a flexitarian diet rather than a regular plant-based diet. Recurring conditions of a flexitarian include consuming red siga or poultry only once a week. One study defined semi-vegetarians as consuming meat or fish three days a week. Occasionally, researchers define semi-vegetarianism as eschewing red meat in entirety and flexitarianism as the distinct practice of eating very little meat. Semi-vegetarianism/flexitarianism may be the default diet for much of the world, where meals based on plant materials provide the bulk of people&#x27;s regular energy intake. In many countries, this is often due to financial barriers as higher incomes are associated with diets rich in animal and dairy proteins rather than carbohydrate based staples. One estimate is that 14% of the global population is flexitarian.

==Society and culture==

In the United Kingdom, there was increased demand for vegan products in 2018. A 2018 study estimated that the amount of UK consumers following a &quot;meat-free diet&quot; had increased to 12%, including 6% vegetarians, 4% pescetarians and 2% vegans. A 2018 poll indicated that 10% of adult Canadians considered themselves as vegetarians or vegans, among whom 42% were young adults.

In 2019, an international group stated that the adoption of the flexitarian diet would &quot;save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet,&quot; when compared to the current Western diet. The term &quot;flexitarian&quot; has been criticized by many vegetarians and vegans as an oxymoron because people following the diet consume the flesh of animals.
