<text>General Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (5 November 1910 – 9 September 1997) was an Australian-born British soldier, painter, university administrator, author and in later life, a commentator.

==Early life==
Hackett, nicknamed &quot;Shan&quot;, was born in Perth, Western Australia. His Irish Australian father, also named Sir John Winthrop Hackett (1848–1916), originally from County Tipperary, was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (B.A., 1871; M.A., 1874), and he emigrated to Australia in 1875, eventually settling in Western Australia in 1882, where he became a newspaper proprietor and editor and a politician. His mother was Deborah Drake-Brockman (1887-1965), whose parents were prominent members of Western Australian society. Her six siblings included Grace Bussell, famous for rescuing shipwreck survivors as a teenager, and Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman, a prominent surveyor and explorer. 

On 3 August 1905, aged 57, Hackett Sr married Deborah Drake-Brockman, who was only 18 at the time — she later became Deborah, Lady Hackett; Deborah, Lady Moulden; and Deborah Buller Murphy — having married a director of several mining companies. They had four daughters and a son. Hackett senior died in 1916. Lady Hackett remarried in 1918.

Hackett junior received secondary schooling at Geelong Grammar School in Victoria and then travelled to London to study painting at the Central School of Art. He then studied Greats and Modern History at New College, Oxford, earning an M.A. As his degree was not good enough for an academic career, Hackett joined the British Army and was commissioned into the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars in 1933, having previously joined the Supplementary Reserve of Officers in 1931. During his military training, he completed a thesis in history with a focus on the crusades and the Early Middle Ages, particularly Saladin&#x27;s campaign in the Third Crusade, for which he was awarded a B. Litt. He also qualified as an interpreter in French, German and Italian, studied Arabic and eventually became fluent in ten languages.

==Family==

He married Margaret Frena, daughter of Joseph Peter Frena, in Jerusalem Cathedral on 21 March 1942. Margaret outlived Hackett by a decade, dying on 14 May 2007. They had one child, Susan Veronica Hackett (20 May 1945 – December 1992). 

==Early career==
He served in Palestine during the Arab revolt, where he was mentioned in despatches in 1936, and then with the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force from 1937 to 1941, when he was mentioned in despatches.

==Second World War==
Hackett fought in the British Army in the Second World War Syria-Lebanon campaign: he was wounded and was awarded the Military Cross. During his recovery in Palestine, he met Margaret Fena, the Austrian widow of a German. Despite the difficulties caused by her nationality, they married in Jerusalem in 1942.

In the North African campaign, he commanded &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron of the 8th Hussars (his parent unit) and was wounded again when his M3 Stuart tank was hit during the battles for Sidi Rezegh airfield. He was severely burnt when escaping the stricken vehicle. Whilst recuperating at GHQ in Cairo, he was instrumental in the formation of the Long Range Desert Group, the Special Air Service and Popski&#x27;s Private Army.

In 1944, Hackett raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade for the Allied assault on Arnhem, in Operation Market Garden. At the battle of Arnhem, Brigadier Hackett was severely wounded in the stomach, captured and then taken to the St. Elizabeth Hospital in Arnhem. A German doctor at the hospital wanted to administer a lethal injection to Hackett because he thought that the case was hopeless. However, he was operated on by Alexander Lipmann-Kessel, who, with superb surgery, managed to save the brigadier&#x27;s life.

After a period of recuperation, he managed to escape with the help of the Dutch underground. Although he was unfit to be moved, the Germans were about to move him to a prisoner-of-war camp. He was taken by &#x27;Piet van Arnhem&#x27;, a resistance worker from Ede, and driven to Ede. Hackett had extra bloody bandages applied to heighten the severity of his injuries. After leaving the hospital, Arnhem told the checkpoint they were taking Hackett to hospital, and were let through despite the hospital being in the opposite direction from which they had just come.

Hackett was hidden by a Dutch family, called de Nooij, who lived at No. 5 Torenstraat in Ede. The family nursed the brigadier back to health over a period of several months; he then managed to escape to the Allied lines with the help of the underground. He remained friends with the de Nooijs for the rest of their lives and visited immediately after they were liberated, bearing gifts. Hackett wrote about the experience in his book &quot;I Was A Stranger&quot;, published in 1977. He received his second Distinguished Service Order for his service at Arnhem.

==Later Army Career==
He returned to Palestine during the Palestine Emergency in 1947 where he assumed command of the Transjordan Frontier Force. Under his direction, the force was disbanded, as part of the British withdrawal from the region. He attended university at Graz, as a postgraduate in post-mediaeval studies and, after returning to the United Kingdom, he attended the Staff College, Camberley in 1951. After this, he was appointed to command the 20th Armoured Brigade and, on being promoted to major-general, assumed command of the 7th Armoured Division. In 1958, he became Commandant of the Royal Military College of Science at Shrivenham, and was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1961. He became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C), Northern Ireland Command, in 1961 and was knighted (KCB) on 2 June 1962. In 1963, he was appointed to Ministry of Defence as Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff (DCIGS), responsible for forces organisation and weapon development and became the leading figure in the reorganisation of the Territorial Army (TA), which made him unpopular. He relinquished his appointment on 4 February 1966.

On 14 April 1966, he was appointed command of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and the parallel command of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group, and his ability to speak several languages made him a natural choice, as did his friendship with foreign soldiers such as Johann von Kielmansegg of the Bundeswehr.

In 1968 he wrote a highly controversial letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that was critical of the British government&#x27;s apparent lack of concern over the strength of NATO forces in Europe but signed the letter as a NATO officer, not as a British commander.

==Retirement==
After his retirement from the army, Hackett continued to be active in several areas. From 1968 to 1975, he was Principal of King&#x27;s College, London. He was the president in 1971 of the Classical Association and in 1973 of the English Association. In 1978, he wrote a novel, &quot;The Third World War: August 1985&quot;, which was a fictionalized scenario of the Third World War based on a Red Army invasion of West Germany in 1985. It was followed in 1982 by &quot;The Third World War: The Untold Story&quot;, which elaborated on the original, including more detail from a Soviet perspective. American author Max Brooks cited Hackett&#x27;s novels as one source of inspiration for his novel &quot;World War Z&quot;. Hackett also appeared in the documentary &quot;In Search of the Trojan War&quot;, where he described &quot;The Iliad&quot; as &quot;a story about the sort of people I know.&quot;

==Decorations==
Hackett&#x27;s (British) military decorations included the Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, Distinguished Service Order and Bar, Military Cross. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; called him a man of &quot;intellect and prodigious courage.&quot;

<doc id="598824" wikidata="Q5029511" url="?curid=598824" title="Canada in the Cold War">
<text>During the Cold War, Canada was one of the western powers playing a central role in the major alliances. It was an ally of the United States, but there were several foreign policy differences between the two countries over the course of the Cold War. Canada&#x27;s peacekeeping role during the Cold War has played a major role in its positive global image. The country served in every UN peacekeeping effort from its inception in 1948 until 1989. This resulted in Canada providing the greatest amount of UN peacekeepers during the Cold War. 

Canada was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958, and played a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping operations—from the Korean War to the creation of a permanent UN peacekeeping force during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Subsequent peacekeeping interventions occurred in the Congo (1960), Cyprus (1964), the Sinai (1973), Vietnam (with the International Control Commission), Golan Heights, Lebanon (1978), and Namibia (1989–1990).

Canada did not follow the American lead in all Cold War actions, sometimes resulting in tensions between the two countries. For instance, Canada refused to join the Vietnam War; in 1984, the last nuclear weapons based in Canada were removed; diplomatic relations were maintained with Cuba; and the Canadian government recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China before the United States.

The Canadian military maintained a standing presence in Western Europe as part of its NATO deployment at several bases in Germany—including long tenures at CFB Baden-Soellingen and CFB Lahr, in the Black Forest region of West Germany. Also, Canadian military facilities were maintained in Bermuda, France, and the United Kingdom. From the early 1960s until the 1980s, Canada maintained weapon platforms armed with nuclear weapons—including nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets, surface-to-air missiles, and high-yield gravity bombs principally deployed in the Western European theatre of operations as well as in Canada.

==Background==
Canada emerged from the Second World War as a world power, radically transforming a principally agricultural and rural dominion of a dying empire into a truly sovereign nation, with a market economy focused on a combination of resource extraction and refinement, heavy manufacturing, and high-technology research and development. As a consequence of supplying so much of the war effort for six long years, Canada&#x27;s military grew to an exceptional size: over a million service personnel, the world&#x27;s fifth largest surface fleet and fourth largest air force. Despite a draw-down at the end of the war, the Canadian military nonetheless executed Operation Muskox, a massive deployment across the Canadian Arctic designed in part to train for a ground and air war in the region. Canadians also assisted in humanitarian efforts, and sent observers for the United Nations to India and Palestine in 1947 and 1948.

There was never any doubt early on as to which side Canada was on in the Cold War due to its location and historical alliances. On the domestic front, the Canadian state at all levels fought vehemently against what it characterized as communist subversion. Canadian and business leaders opposed the advance of the labour movement on the grounds that it was a Bolshevik conspiracy during the interwar period. The peak moments of this effort were the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and the anticommunist campaigns of the depression, including the stopping of the On-to-Ottawa Trek. Canada, along with other major, Allied Powers convened at the Yalta Conference in 1945 to discuss the reorganization of Europe, laying the groundwork for a new Europe. 

==Early Cold War (1946–1960)==
In February 1946, the Canadian government disclosed to the public the defection of a Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko, in Ottawa; who also disclosed the existence of a Soviet spy ring in the country. The event has been used by historians to mark the beginning of the Cold War era in Canada, with the Gouzenko Affair triggering another red scare in Canada. 

Canada was a founding member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), of which Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was a chief architect. Canada was one of its most ardent supporters and pushed (largely unsuccessfully) to have it become an economic and cultural organization in addition to a military alliance.

To defend North America against a possible enemy attack, Canada and the United States began to work very closely together in the 1950s. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) created a joint air-defence system. In northern Canada, the Distant Early Warning Line (or Dew Line) was established to give warning of Soviet bombers heading over the north pole. Similar early warning radar systems were also developed in the middle of Canada, known as the Mid-Canada Line; and across the 50th parallel north, known as the Pinetree Line.

===Domestic anti-Communism===

Canada addressed the threat posed by Communist sympathizers in a manner more moderate than in the United States. The United States wished the Canadian government would go further, asking for a purge of trade unions, but the Canadian government left the purge of trade unions to the AFL–CIO. The American officials were especially concerned about the sailors on Great Lakes freight vessels, and, in 1951, Canada added them to those already screened by its secret anti-communist screening program. The Communist Party of Canada had not been outlawed since Section 98, which was repealed by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1935.

Despite its comparatively moderate stance towards Communism, the Canadian state continued intensive surveillance of Communists and sharing of intelligence with the United States. PROFUNC was a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain Communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War.

Tensions between Canada and the United States heightened during this time as on April 4, 1957, Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, E. Herbert Norman, leaped to his death from a Cairo building after the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security released a textual record of a previous hearing to the media. Despite having been cleared several years earlier—first by the RCMP in 1950, then again by the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson (later Prime Minister)—the American media portrayed Norman as a spy and traitor. The only evidence the United States had was that as a student at Cambridge and Harvard he was a part of a Marxist communist study group. This made Pearson, who was still External Affairs Minister, backed by outrage across the country, send a note to the U.S. Government, threatening to offer no more security information on Canadian citizens until it was guaranteed that this information would not slip beyond the executive branch of the government.

===Peacekeeping===
It was during the Cold War period that Canada began to assert the international clout that went along with the reputation it had built on the international stage in World War I and World War II.

In the Korean War, the moderately sized contingent of volunteer soldiers from Canada made noteworthy contributions to the United Nations forces and served with distinction. Of particular note is the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry&#x27;s contribution to the Battle of Kapyong.

Canada&#x27;s major Cold War contribution to international politics was made in the innovation and implementation of &#x27;Peacekeeping&#x27;. Although a United Nations military force had been proposed and advocated for the preservation of peace vis a vis the U.N.&#x27;s mandate by Canada&#x27;s representatives Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his Secretary of State for External Affairs Louis St. Laurent at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in June 1945, it was not adopted at that time.
During the Suez Crisis of 1956, the idea promoted by Canada in 1945 of a United Nations military force returned to the fore. The conflict involving Britain, France, Israel and Egypt quickly developed into a potential flashpoint between the emerging &#x27;superpowers&#x27; of the United States and the Soviet Union as the Soviets made intimations that they would militarily support Egypt&#x27;s cause. The Soviets went as far as to say they would be willing to use &quot;all types of modern weapons of destruction&quot; on London and Paris—an overt threat of nuclear attack. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson re-introduced then-Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent&#x27;s UN military force concept in the form of an &#x27;Emergency Force&#x27; that would intercede and divide the combatants, and form a buffer zone or &#x27;human shield&#x27; between the opposing forces. Pearson&#x27;s United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), the first peacekeeping force, was deployed to separate the combatants, and enforce a ceasefire and resolution that was drawn up to end the hostilities.

==Canada–U.S. tensions (1961–1980)==
=== Diefenbaker and the Missile Crisis (1961–1963) ===
Great debate broke out while John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister as to whether Canada should accept U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory. Diefenbaker had already agreed to buy the BOMARC missile system from the Americans, which would be not as effective without nuclear warheads, but balked at permitting the weapons into Canada.

Canada also maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution. Prior to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the insistence on a much more placated policy towards the Cuban government had been a source of contention between the United States and Canada. Diefenbaker firmly stood by his policy decision, insisting that this was the result of the rights of states to establish their own forms of government, rejection of current US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine as well as Canada&#x27;s right to establish its own foreign policy. Concern in the Canadian government was focused primarily on nuclear weapons, many politicians in the opposition and in power believed that as long as the US president retained absolute control of the nuclear weapons, Canadian forces could be ordered to undertake nuclear missions for the US without Canadian consent.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Canada was expected to fall in line with American foreign policy, in that Canada&#x27;s military forces were expected to go on immediate war alert status. Diefenbaker however, refused to do so emphasizing the need for United Nations intervention. It would only be after a tense phone call between President John F. Kennedy and Diefenbaker that Canada&#x27;s armed forces would begin preparations for &quot;immediate enemy attack.&quot;

Although the crisis would eventually be solved by diplomatic talks between Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy, nothing would loom larger over the Canadian state in the months following the crisis than the governing party&#x27;s disarray on the question of nuclear arms.

=== Pearson and Trudeau (1963–1984) ===

In the 1963 Canadian election, Diefenbaker was replaced by the famed diplomat Lester B. Pearson, who accepted the warheads. Further tensions developed when Pearson criticized the American role in the Vietnam War in a speech he gave at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Also of note: In 1968, Canada&#x27;s three separate armed services were unified into the Canadian Armed Forces.)
Shortly after the implementation of economic policies and tariffs in 1971, known as the Nixon shock, the Canadian government began to articulate a Third Option policy; with plans to diversify Canadian trade and to downgrade the importance of its relationship with the United States. In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Canada and the United States dead.

During this period, Canada played a middle power role in international affairs, and pursued diplomatic relations with Communist countries that the US had severed ties with, such as Cuba and Red China after their respective revolutions. (The latter was not internationally recognized at the time.) Canada argued that rather than being soft on Communism, it was pursuing a strategy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; whereby it sought to influence Communism through the course of its international relationships.

Canada also refused to join the Organization of American States, disliking the support and tolerance of the Cold War OAS for dictators. Under Pearson&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, U.S.-Canadian policies grew further apart. Trudeau removed nuclear weapons from Canadian soil, formally recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China, established a personal friendship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and decreased the number of Canadian troops stationed at NATO bases in Europe.

In addition, Canada may have played a small role in helping to bring about &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Alexander Yakovlev was appointed as ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. During this time, he and Trudeau became close friends.

==Final years of the Cold War (1980–1991)==
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Ronald Reagan had a close relationship, but the 1980s also saw widespread protests against American testing of cruise missiles in Canada&#x27;s north.

In the early 1980s, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two began, tentatively at first, to discuss the need for liberalization in the Soviet Union. Yakovlev then returned to Moscow, and would eventually be called the &quot;godfather of glasnost,&quot; the intellectual force behind Gorbachev&#x27;s reform program.
In 1987, Canada released a long-awaited White Paper on Defence; signalling its intent to re-assert sovereignty over its Arctic waters. Concerned that Soviet submarines were operating in Canada&#x27;s Arctic Archipelago, several programs were proposed to close the gap between Canada&#x27;s current capabilities and its commitments to NATO. &quot;Project Spinnaker&quot; was born, a joint Canada–US endeavour whose secret purpose was to provide the capability to monitor submarine traffic in Canadian Arctic waters by deploying acoustic listening posts on the seafloor. This project required the development of a large autonomous underwater vehicle—named Theseus—whose sole purpose was to lay communications trunk cables on the seafloor in waters with a permanent ice cover. In the spring of 1996, Theseus was transported to CFS Alert (on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island) and then was deployed from an ice camp where it laid 180 km of fibre optic cable on the seafloor in ice-covered waters, successfully delivering it to an acoustic array deployed on the edge of the Continental Shelf.

==Post-Cold War==

When the Cold War ended, Canadian Forces were withdrawn from their NATO commitments in Germany, military spending was cut, and air raid sirens were removed across the country. The Diefenbunkers, Canada&#x27;s military-operated fallout shelters designed to ensure continuity of government, were decommissioned. In 1994, the last active United States military base in Canada, Naval Station Argentia Newfoundland, was decommissioned and the facility was turned over to the Government of Canada. The base was a storage facility for the Mk 101 Lulu and B57 nuclear bombs and a key node in the US Navy&#x27;s SOSUS network to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. Canada continues to participate in Cold War institutions such as NORAD and NATO, but they have been given new missions and priorities.

The Cold War in Canada came to an end during the period of 1990–1995 as the traditional mission to contain Soviet expansion faded into the new realities of warfare. The Cold War required permanent foreign deployments to Western Europe, something which was no longer necessary, and as such bases closed down. Less equipment was needed, and so much was sold off, soon to be replaced by newer equipment designed for future conflicts. At home, bases were closed and operations consolidated and streamlined for maximum efficiency, as by the early 1990s many Canadians were openly questioning the necessity of large defence budgets.

In 1990, Canadian troops were deployed to assist provincial police in Québec in an effort to defuse tensions between Mohawk Warriors and the Sûreté du Québec and local residents. In 1991 Canadian Forces personnel deployed in support of the American liberation of Kuwait. By 1992, Canadian peacekeepers were deployed to Cambodia, Croatia and Somalia. In 1993 Balkan involvement expanded into Bosnia and Canadian troops participated in some of the fiercest combat since the Korean War during Operation Medak Pocket.

By the end of the 1990s, Canada would have a completely different military, one more inclined towards the rigours of peacekeeping and peace-making operations under multinational coalitions. The country would be further involved in the Yugoslav Wars throughout the rest of the decade, would become involved in Haiti, and would further see action again in Zaire and East Timor. The Navy, by decade&#x27;s end (and prior to the modern post-9/11 era), was comparatively brand new, the Air Force well-balanced and modern as well. The Army began to acquire new equipment, such as the LAV-III, Bison APC and the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle as it transitioned to fighting irregular warfare instead of the large tank battles once feared would rage across Western Europe. It is with Canada&#x27;s late-Cold War and early-Peacekeeping Era military that Canada would embark on its deployment to Afghanistan, currently Canada&#x27;s longest-running war. 

In recent years, Canada has been involved in tensions with Russia following the takeover of Crimea from Ukraine and China due to its diplomatic spat over various issues such as treatment of Uyghurs, Meng Wenzhou and Hong Kong protests.

<text>Orchestra Hall is a concert hall that is located on 11th Street at Peavey Plaza in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. The home of the Minnesota Orchestra, it is a major landmark of the southern portion of Nicollet Mall and hosts many events throughout the year.

The auditorium seats 2,089, of which about 1,200 are accommodated on the main floor. The remaining seats are placed in three balconies above and along the sides of the main floor. The auditorium is actually a second building separated for acoustical reasons by a one-inch gap from the &quot;shell&quot; which contains the lobby and various administrative offices. The stage contains an unusual feature: a large cube motif in the rear stage wall which continues along the ceiling towards the rear of the auditorium. The cubes were added for acoustic reasons, successfully, and turned out to be visually striking as well.

==History==
The Hall was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates (New York City) with Hammel Green &amp; Abrahamson (Minneapolis) and acoustical engineer Cyril Harris (New York City) and opened for the 1974 concert season.

Originally noted for its modernist design, chosen to represent an orchestra for everyone, not what was then perceived to be the formal &quot;elitist&quot; designs of the past. The exterior of the building was recognizable by its large, blue ventilation ducts. Their unusual size was chosen to reduce air velocity and hence noise. The lobby area&#x27;s original &quot;power plant&quot; design was meant to remove tones of class and privilege from the symphony-going experience; it was upgraded in late 1997 and included several bars. Expansive windows overlooked the street.

Built in 1975, Peavey Plaza was designed by landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg who also designed the Loring Greenway. The plaza holds an amphitheater and water fountain, and is considered one of the endangered historic properties in Minnesota.

==Renovation==
In April 2007, it was announced that the hall would be undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation. This renovation was to emphasize the lobby and patron areas.

On April 9, 2010, plans were revealed for a $40 million renovation and expansion. The lobby and public areas were doubled in size and the former utilitarian exterior was replaced with stone and glass. A grand new entrance was also added. KPMB of Toronto were the architects and MBJ of Minneapolis were the structural engineers. Construction began in June 2012 and was completed in June 2013. The lobby was doubled in size, a cross-aisle in the auditorium was added, and new and larger seats were installed, reducing their number by 365 for a total of 2085. A new atrium was added as were new rehearsal rooms, and the women&#x27;s locker room was expanded.

==Acoustics==
While aspects of the interior design in the auditorium had a mixed reception, the acoustics were highly praised, and called &quot;almost too good to be true&quot;.

<text>William Nelson Edward Hall (28 April 1827 – 27 August 1904) was the first Black person, first Nova Scotian, and the third Canadian to receive the Victoria Cross due to his actions in the 1857 Siege of Lucknow. He received the medal for his actions during the Indian Rebellion. During the action in which the naval gun crew with which he was serving came under heavy fire as they attacked a mosque. Hall and an officer from his ship continued to load and fire a 24-pounder gun at the walls of the Shah Nujeef mosque after the rest of the party had been killed or injured by the local resistance hoping to secure the restoration of Mughal suzerainty.

==Early life==
William Edward Hall was born at Horton, Nova Scotia, in 1827 as the son of Jacob and Lucy Hall, who had escaped American slave owners in Maryland during the War of 1812 and were brought to freedom in Nova Scotia by the British Royal Navy as part of the Black Refugee movement. The Halls first lived in Summerville, Nova Scotia, where Jacob worked in a shipyard operated by Abraham Cunard until they bought a farm across the Avon River at Horton Bluff. Hall first worked in shipyards at nearby Hantsport, Nova Scotia, before going to sea at the age of seventeen. He sailed first on merchant ships based out of the Minas Basin including the barque &quot;Kent&quot; of Kentville, Nova Scotia.

==Naval career==

Hall briefly served in the United States Navy from 1847 to 1849, during the Mexican–American War. He served for a time aboard alongside John Taylor Wood, who later supported Hall&#x27;s US Navy pension claim.

Hall volunteered for the Royal Navy in February 1852, serving at first aboard . Hall fought in the Crimean War serving ashore in a Naval Brigade from &quot;Rodney&quot; at the battles of Inkerman and Sevastopol in 1854. After a brief tour on , Hall transferred to the screw frigate , where he became captain of the foretop.

When the Indian Mutiny broke out in May 1857, &quot;Shannon&quot; was among the fleet escorting a troop detachment to China. Upon arrival at Singapore, news of the situation in India reached the fleet, however the fleet completed its mission, arriving at Hong Kong. There, &quot;Shannon&quot; was ordered to Calcutta (since renamed Kolkata). A brigade from &quot;Shannon&quot;, comprising 450 men, was constituted under Captain William Peel. The ship was towed over up the Ganges River to Allahabad. Then the force fought across country to Campbell&#x27;s headquarters at Cawnpore and were in time to take part in the Siege of Lucknow.

===Relief of Lucknow===
On 16 November 1857 at Lucknow, India, naval guns were brought up close to the Shah Nujeef mosque, one of the key locations in the siege. One of the gun crews was short a man and Hall volunteered to fill out the position. The gun crews kept up a steady fire in an attempt to breach and clear the walls, while a hail of musket balls and grenades from the opposing fighters inside the mosque caused heavy casualties. After having little effect on the walls, two guns were ordered closer. Of the crews, only Able Seaman Hall and Lieutenant Thomas James Young, the battery&#x27;s commander, were able to continue fighting, all the rest having been killed or wounded, and between them they loaded and served the last gun, which was fired at less than from the wall, until it was breached. The joint citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; reads: 

===Later career===
Hall remained with the Royal Navy for the rest of his career. He joined the crew of in 1859. On 28 October 1859, he was presented with the Victoria Cross by Rear Admiral Charles Talbot while &quot;Donegal&quot; was anchored at Queenstown Harbour. Hall rose to the rating of Petty Officer First Class in by the time he retired in 1876. He returned to his home village in Horton Bluff where he ran a small farm until his death in 1904.
In 1901, the future King George V, visiting Nova Scotia, saw Hall at a parade, recognized his medals, and spoke with him.

==Commemorations==

He was originally buried in an unmarked grave without military honours. He was reinterred in 1954 in Hantsport, Nova Scotia where his grave is marked by a monument at the Baptist church. The Royal Canadian Legion (now closed) in Hantsport was named &quot;The Lucknow Branch&quot; in honour of his Victoria Cross action.

Hall&#x27;s original Victoria Cross was repatriated from Britain in 1967 by the government of Nova Scotia and is on permanent display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax.

Hall is also featured in exhibits at the Halifax Citadel and at the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia. Canada Post commemorated William Hall on a stamp, first issued on 1 February 2010 in Hantsport, Nova Scotia and officially launched at the Black Cultural Centre on 2 February 2010. Hall was designated a National Historic Person by the Canadian Historic Sites and Monuments Board at Hantsport on 8 October 2010 and a new plaque was unveiled in his honour.

In November 2010, a connector road in Hantsport was named the William Hall V.C. Memorial Highway. A sign, bearing Hall&#x27;s likeness, was erected on the road from Highway 101 to Trunk 1 near Hantsport.

The fourth ship in the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s was officially named HMCS &quot;William Hall&quot; in a ceremony at Irving Shipbuilding&#x27;s yard in Halifax on 28 April 2023.

<doc id="598843" wikidata="Q3154526" url="?curid=598843" title="Iron Range">
<text>The Iron Range is collectively or individually a number of elongated iron-ore mining districts around Lake Superior in the United States and Canada. Much of the ore-bearing region lies alongside the range of granite hills formed by the Giants Range batholith. These cherty iron ore deposits are Precambrian in the Vermilion Range and middle Precambrian in the Mesabi and Cuyuna ranges, all in Minnesota. The Gogebic Range in Wisconsin and the Marquette Iron Range and Menominee Range in Michigan have similar characteristics and are of similar age. Natural ores and concentrates were produced from 1848 until the mid-1950s, when taconites and jaspers were concentrated and pelletized, and started to become the major source of iron production.

The mining districts are in Minnesota&#x27;s Arrowhead Region. The region&#x27;s far eastern area, containing the Duluth Complex along the shore of Lake Superior, and the far northern area, along the Canada–U.S. border, are not associated with iron ore mining, but deposits of copper, nickel, and cobalt at the northern boundary of the Duluth Complex, where it meets the iron formations, are being considered for mining.

==The Iron Range and its economy==

From a geological perspective, Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range includes these four major iron deposits:
* Mesabi Range, the largest iron range, largely within Itasca and Saint Louis counties;
* Vermilion Range, northeast of the Mesabi, in Saint Louis and Lake counties;
* Gunflint Range, in the extreme northern portion of Cook County and extending into Canada; and
* Cuyuna Range, southwest of the Mesabi, largely within Crow Wing County.

Within Minnesota, &quot;The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation is a State Department, established by the legislature of 1941 to render public service through research and the actual development of all the state&#x27;s resources both natural and human.&quot; The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB), known as &quot;the I-triple-R-B&quot; or Iron Range Resources, is an economic development agency funded partly by state taxes on taconite-producing companies and charged with creating jobs.

There have been attempts to expand mining for other metals to areas near the Iron Range, most notably with the Twin Metals mine, but these have received pushback from the federal government and environmentalists because of environmental concerns resulting from their proximity to national protected lands.

==History==
Geologically, the Mesabi, Gunflint, and Cuyuna Ranges in Minnesota belong to the Paleoproterozoic Animikie Group, while the Vermilion Range is Neoarchean. The geologic history of the formations containing iron are typical of banded iron formations worldwide.

Before the 19th century, Native American groups mined native copper on the Keweenaw Peninsula. William Austin Burt discovered iron ore in the Marquette Range near Negaunee, Michigan in 1844. Iron ore was discovered on the Menominee Range in 1867 and on the Gogebic Range in 1884. It was first discovered in Minnesota on the Vermilion Range in 1885, the Mesabi Range in 1890, and the Cuyuna Range in 1903.

Underground mines were developed to remove the valuable ore of most ranges. But on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges, iron mining operations evolved into enormous open pit mines, where steamshovels and other industrial machines could remove massive amounts of ore. &quot;Large-scale commercial production of magnetite taconite ore on the Mesabi Range started in 1956 at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota.&quot;

==Cities and towns==
Some of the more significant communities in the region include:
* Aitkin (pop. 2,165) is on the Cuyuna Range&#x27;s eastern edge.
* Aurora (pop. 1,853) is on the Eastern Mesabi Range. The former St. James, Meadow, Miller and Stephens mines lie within the city limits.
* Babbitt (pop. 1,475)
* Biwabik (pop. 969)
* Bovey (pop. 804) is along U.S. Highway 169 between Coleraine and Taconite.
* Buhl (pop. 1,000) is along U.S. Highway 169 between Chisholm and Virginia.
* Chisholm (pop. 4,976) is the Mesabi Range&#x27;s geographic center.
* Coleraine (pop. 1,970) has been called the &quot;start place of the Iron Range.&quot;
* Crosby (pop. 2,386) is an old mining boomtown on the Iron Range&#x27;s southwestern edge.
* Deerwood (pop. 529) Mining engineer Cuyler Adams discovered the Cuyuna Range near Deerwood in 1895.
* Ely (pop. 3,460), in the Vermillion Range, the most popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
* Eveleth (pop. 3,718) Home of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame
* Grand Rapids (pop. 10,869) is named for the local rapids in the Mississippi River.
* Gilbert (pop. 1,799) is the location of Lake Ore-be-gone, an artificial lake created by flooding three open-pit iron ore mines.
* Hibbing (pop. 16,361) is the largest city by area in the state of Minnesota. It is home to the Hull–Rust–Mahoning Open Pit Iron Mine, one of the world&#x27;s largest open pit iron mines.
* Hoyt Lakes (pop. 1,888) is in the eastern Mesabi Range. Erie Mining Company previously mined ore and testing to mine new minerals is ongoing.
* Keewatin (pop. 1,068) is between Nashwauk and Hibbing. It is home to U.S. Steel&#x27;s KeeTac taconite mining and processing plant.
* Kinney (pop. 169) is an old mining boomtown on the Iron Range, between Buhl and Mountain Iron.
* Mountain Iron (pop. 2,869) is home to Minntac, the world&#x27;s largest taconite processing plant.
* Nashwauk (pop. 983) is a small town between Grand Rapids and Hibbing, 4 miles from Keewatin.
* Soudan is an unincorporated community in Breitung Township, Saint Louis County immediately east of the city of Tower on Minn.Highway 169 / Minn.Highway 1. It is the home of the Soudan Underground Mine State Park, which contained the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Soudan Underground Laboratory, which housed detectors, including MINOS, over 700 meters below the Earth&#x27;s surface.
* Taconite (pop. 360), named after the taconite pellets from iron ore, was a town many miners lived in.
* Virginia (pop. 8,712) is next to the Rouchleau mine pit, which is nearly three miles long, half a mile wide and 450 feet deep. The state&#x27;s tallest bridge crosses the pit.
* Winton (pop 172). Once several times larger than Ely, Winton sits just 3 miles north of Ely, and was once home to a very large lumber mill and a lumber boomtown.

Nearby communities important to the Iron Range:
* Duluth (pop. 86,265) The fourth largest city in the state, is a destination for much of the ore shipped via the DM&amp;IR railroad and loaded onto Lake freighters. A large part of the Iron Range is also included in the Duluth MN-WI MSA.
* Grand Marais (pop. 1,351) The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French voyageurs called the settled village Grand Marais (&quot;Great Marsh&quot;), referring to a marsh that in early fur-trading times was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village. The town comprises much of the Gunflint Trail, which extends to the former Paulson Mine site.
* Silver Bay (pop 1,857) is home to the plant that processes taconite from Babbitt.
* Two Harbors (pop. 3,745) is the county seat of Lake County, along the shore of Lake Superior. It was historically an important port for loading and shipping iron ore from the Range.

==Culture==
Immigrants from over 23 countries settled the area, drawn to the mining industry. By 1910 the Finns were the largest immigrant group, followed by Slovenes and Croats from the Austrian Empire, and Italians and Swedes. Over time the area developed a strong &quot;Ranger&quot; culture and accent. This northern Minnesota accent is still present in the area, especially among older people; hence the popular nickname &quot;da Range&quot;. 

The regional culture is strongly linked to former periods of steady, usually well-paid mining employment, although in recent decades, the region&#x27;s outdoor recreation and relative remoteness has attracted new residents unconnected to the industry. There are tensions between supporters and detractors of mining, especially over the potential reuse of ironworks to exploit copper ores. Bob Dylan, who grew up in Hibbing, memorialized the Iron Range in the 1963 song &quot;North Country Blues&quot;, a lament portraying hard times in the region. Presented in his 1964 album &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, it includes such lines as:

:&quot;So the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted&quot;
:&quot;And the room smelled heavy from drinking&quot;
:&quot;When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
:&quot;As I waited for the sun to go sinking&quot; 

The Iron Range cuisine is known for Cornish pasties stuffed with a combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, carrots, and potatoes. Pasties were an easy lunch for those working deep in the iron mines. Slovenian and Croatian immigrants brought the honey-nut bread potica to the Iron Range; it is still served on Easter and Christmas in northern Minnesota.

Ice hockey is a predominant sport in the region, which has produced several NHL players as well as the three members of the &quot;Iron Range line&quot; from the 1980 United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team that defeated the Soviet Union team in the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; game. In 2022, Hockeyland, a documentary focusing on high school hockey in the Iron Range and Duluth area was released.

==Politics==
The area has remained a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party stronghold despite its predominantly white and rural population because of its history of a largely unionized workforce in the mining industry, the mainstay of the economy of the Iron Range. In 2004, John Kerry carried most of the counties in the region by a comfortable margin over George W. Bush. Barack Obama outperformed McCain in 2008, carrying every county in the Range. The area was the largest rural Democratic stronghold in Minnesota outside of the urban centers in Minneapolis and St. Paul. 

In 2016, Donald Trump&#x27;s economic policies changed the Range&#x27;s electoral profile. He won multiple counties, reduced past Democratic winning margins and received endorsements from local Democratic mayors. In the 2022 midterm elections, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party lost more ground on the Iron Range, with Republican candidates running for lower-profile statewide offices flipping Carlton County. In the state legislature, Republicans picked up several seats on the Range despite losing both chambers overall. Nevertheless, the Range as a whole still votes slightly in favor of Democratic presidential nominees due to their high margins in Duluth, the range&#x27;s most populous city.

==Climate==
The region is known for harsh winters and pleasant summers. The average year-round temperature is in the 30s °F (between about 2 °C and 4 °C). Temperatures below −40 °F/°C occur somewhere in the region during most winters. The Midwestern Regional Climate Center climate summaries record that Virginia has a mean annual temperature of 38 °F, with an average January low temperature of −6.2 °F (about −21 °C) and July high of 77.4 °F (25 °C). Precipitation there averages 27 in (690 mm) annually and snowfall 53.2 in (135 cm).

<text>Killorglin () is a town in County Kerry, Ireland. As of the 2022 census, the town&#x27;s population was 2,163. Killorglin is on the Ring of Kerry tourist route, and annual events include the August Puck Fair festival, which starts with the crowning and parading of a &quot;king&quot; wild goat. The town is 26 km south of Tralee along the N70 road, and 22 km west of Killarney along the N72 road. Killorglin is in a civil parish of the same name.

== History ==
=== Origins and development ===
The earliest evidence of ancient settlement in the Killorglin area is the presence of prehistoric rock art. These rock carvings are part of a Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age tradition stretching across Atlantic Europe and occur in concentrations around the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas, with a cluster close to the nearby town of Glenbeigh. There are also a number of ringforts and early Christian ecclesiastical sites in the townlands of Dromavally and Castleconway. The ruins of Killorglin Castle, later known as Castle Conway, are located close to what is now the centre of the town. It was built in the early 13th century by Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly.

The area was held by the FitzGerald dynasty until the confiscation of their lands following the Desmond Rebellions in the late 16th century. In 1587, as part of the Munster Plantation, Killorglin (and its castle) was granted to Captain Jenkin Conway.
Much of the town centre was laid out in the 19th century. Killorglin&#x27;s Roman Catholic church was built (on the site of an earlier church) in 1891. The Church of Ireland church was originally built in 1816 and significantly redeveloped in 1868. The town hall was built in the early 20th century with the help of Andrew Carnegie.

=== Ballykissane 1916 ===
On Ballykissane Pier is a monument to commemorate the deaths of several Irish Volunteers, the first casualties of the Easter Rising in 1916. They were in a car that plunged off the pier into the River Laune while on the way to make contact with Roger Casement and a German arms ship masquerading as the &quot;Aud&quot;.

On Good Friday 21 April 1916, six Irish Volunteers set off from Dublin by train to Killarney. From there, they were to travel by car to Cahirciveen in order to seize control of the wireless station on Valentia Island. Thomas McInerney, who drove a car carrying three of the men, become lost just outside Killorglin and turned onto the road which led to the quay. The front wheels of the car went over the edge of the quay, became unbalanced, and fell into the River Laune. McInerney was the only person to escape the car and swim to shore. The other three occupants remained trapped in the vehicle and drowned.

== Economy and tourism ==

Fexco, a major financial services company, was founded in Killorglin in 1981 and is still headquartered in the town. Pharmaceutical firms Temmler and Astellas have small plants in Killorglin. It also has the operations centre for the Prize Bond Company.

A 100m wind turbine was erected at the Astellas Plant on the Tralee Road in 2012 and has become a local landmark 

Killorglin is on the Wild Atlantic Way and Ring of Kerry tourist routes. A visitor centre for the Reeks District is also located in the town.

== Culture ==
=== Puck Fair ===

Killorglin is known for the annual Puck Fair festival, which traditionally starts with the crowning of a &quot;king&quot; goat. There is a large bronze &quot;King Puck&quot; statue on the edge of town close to the bridge. This statue was commissioned by the Killorglin Millennium Committee and designed by Valentia Island Sculptor Alan Ryan Hall. The King Puck Statue and Puck Garden was completed in 2001 and officially unveiled by Killorglin Lord Mayor Paudie Cronin and the Killorglin Millennium Committee.

In 2011, &quot;The Puck Poet&quot; plaques were added to the Puck Garden to recall some of the writers and poets who have written about Killorglin. These include Edso Crowley, Sigerson Clifford, Peter Joy and Johnny Patterson.

=== Film ===
The father of Academy Award-winning actor Ed Begley (1901–1970) was born in Laharn, Killorglin.

The Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film-nominated stop-motion film &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; (2012) was produced by Cromane filmmaker Fodhla Cronin O&#x27;Reilly. Cronin O&#x27;Reilly attended secondary school in Killorglin.

As of 2015, Áine Moriarty from Killorglin was head of the Irish Film &amp; Television Academy (IFTA). Killorglin actor Muiris Crowley starred in the film &quot;Pilgrim Hill&quot; (2013). It was directed by fellow Kerryman Gerard Barrett.

=== Music and events ===
Killorglin and its Puck Fair feature in a number of traditional Irish ballads and songs, including &quot;Bridget Donohue&quot; written by Johnny Patterson, &quot;King Puck&quot; by Christy Moore, and &quot;Wildflower of the Laune&quot; by Peter Joy.

A local tradition, Biddy&#x27;s Day, occurs in the area during February. It involves groups, in traditional dress, visiting homes carrying a &quot;Brídeóg&quot; (or Biddy) effigy to ensure good luck. In 2019, this Mid-Kerry practice was one of 30 &quot;Intangible cultural heritage&quot; traditions afforded recognition by the state.

===Literature===
Books about Killorglin, or by Killorglin natives, include:
* &quot;Things My Mother Never Told Me&quot; (2003), by Blake Morrison, tells the story of the author&#x27;s mother who was from Killorglin and emigrated to England.
* &quot;Cast A Laune Shadow&quot; (1997), by local historian Patrick (Pa) Houlihan (1918-2010), is a history of the town in story.
* &quot;Puck Fair&quot;, by Pa&#x27;s eldest son Michael Houlihan, is about the annual festival in August. 
* &quot;St James and Fr Tom&quot;, by Terence Houlihan and Billy Browne, details the development of St James&#x27;s Catholic church by Fr Tom Lawlor. 
* &quot;The Civil War in Kerry&quot;, by local historian Tom Doyle, details the part Kerry and Killorglin played in the Irish Civil War.

The ship returned to Norfolk 17 December 1966, and in 1967 the ship performed a variety of work with the Second Fleet, with the major emphasis on anti-submarine warfare. Much time was spent in this period in areas just east of Cape Hatteras.

In May 1967, &quot;Fox&quot; operated with 55 ships from four countries in Operation Fizwiz Sunrise. In June, a NATO exercise called New Look took the ship to the North Atlantic for ten days of highly competitive ASW operations with the Royal Canadian Navy. In addition, there were two weeks of operations out of Key West as a school ship for the Fleet Sonar School. On 1 September 1967 the ship began a five-month deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.

D&#x27;Ormesson became Secretary-General of the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies at UNESCO, and the director of the conservative French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; from 1974 to 1979. D&#x27;Ormesson self-identified as conservative.

On 18 October 1973, d&#x27;Ormesson was elected a member of the Académie française, taking seat 12, following the death of Jules Romains, in 1973. On the death of Claude Lévi-Strauss on 30 October 2009, he became the Dean of the &quot;Académie&quot;, its longest-serving member.

D&#x27;Ormesson was a Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, and an officer of the National Order of Merit. In 2010, he was awarded the Ovid Prize, Romania, in recognition of his body of work.

<doc id="598862" wikidata="Q1088484" url="?curid=598862" title="Fess">
<text>In heraldry, a fess or fesse (from Middle English &#x27;, [[Old French]]&#x27;, and Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;band&quot;) is a charge on a coat of arms (or flag) that takes the form of a band running horizontally across the centre of the shield. Writers disagree in how much of the shield&#x27;s surface is to be covered by a fess or other ordinary, ranging from one-fifth to one-third. The &quot;Oxford Guide to Heraldry&quot; states that earlier writers including Leigh, Holme, and Guillim favour one-third, while later writers such as Edmondson favour one-fifth &quot;on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable.&quot; A fess is likely to be shown narrower if it is &quot;uncharged&quot;, that is, if it does not have other charges placed on it, and/or if it is to be shown with charges above and below it; and shown wider if &quot;charged&quot;. The fess or bar, termed in French heraldry, should not be confused with &quot;fasces&quot;.

==Gallery==
==Diminutives==
In English heraldry, two or more such charges appearing together on a shield are termed &quot;bars&quot;, though there are no definitive rules setting the width of the fess, the bar, nor their comparative width. A shield of (often six or eight) horizontal stripes of alternating colour is called &quot;barry&quot;. Narrower versions of the bar are called &quot;barrulets&quot; (&quot;little bars&quot;), and when a shield of horizontal stripes alternating colour is composed of ten or more stripes, it is called &quot;barruly&quot; or &quot;burely&quot; instead of &quot;barry&quot;. A &quot;cotise&quot;, defined as half the width of a barrulet, may be borne alongside a fess, and often two of these appear, one on either side of the fess. This is often termed &quot;a fess cotised&quot; (also &quot;cottised&quot;, &quot;coticed&quot; or &quot;cotticed&quot;). Another diminutive of the fess called a &quot;closet&quot; is said to be between a bar and barrulet, but this is seldom found.

==Other uses==


A shield &quot;party per fess&quot; (or simply &quot;per fess&quot;) is divided in half horizontally (&quot;in the manner of a fess&quot;). A charge placed horizontally may be termed &quot;fesswise&quot; or &quot;fessways&quot;, and two or more charges arranged in a horizontal row are blazoned &quot;in fess&quot; or &quot;in bar&quot;.

==Notable and unusual forms==
A &quot;mural fess&quot;, that is a fess embattled and masoned of the field, can be seen in the arms of Suzanne Elizabeth Altvater.

The arms of Rennie Fritchie, Baroness Fritchie provide an example of &quot;three Barrulets fracted and there conjoined to a Chevronel&quot;.

A flag which has a central &quot;horizontal&quot; stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a Spanish fess. The name is based on the most well-known example of this style of flag, the flag of Spain.

<doc id="598864" wikidata="Q710733" url="?curid=598864" title="George Rochberg">
<text>George Rochberg (July 5, 1918May 29, 2005) was an American composer of contemporary classical music. Long a serial composer, Rochberg abandoned the technique after his teenage son died in 1964, saying it had proved inadequate to express his grief and was empty of expressive power. By the 1970s, Rochberg&#x27;s use of tonal passages in his music had provoked controversy among critics and fellow composers. A professor at the University of Pennsylvania until 1983, Rochberg chaired its music department until 1968. He became the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities in 1978.

==Life==
Born in Paterson, New Jersey, Rochberg attended first the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included George Szell and Hans Weisse, then the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with Rosario Scalero and Gian Carlo Menotti. He served in the United States Army in the infantry during World War II. He was Jewish.

Rochberg chaired the music department at the University of Pennsylvania until 1968 and continued to teach there until 1983. In 1978, he was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities.

He married Gene Rosenfeld in 1941, and had two children, Paul and Francesca. In 1964, his son died of a brain tumor.

Rochberg died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 2005, aged 86. Most of his works are in the archive of the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Some can also be found in the Music Division of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, Lincoln Center in New York City, the University of Pennsylvania, the Curtis Institute of Music, and the City University of New York.

==Music==

A longtime exponent of serialism, Rochberg abandoned this compositional technique upon the death of his teenage son in 1964. He said he had found serialism expressively empty and that it had proved an inadequate means for him to express his grief and rage. By the 1970s, Rochberg had become controversial for the tonal passages in his music. His use of tonality first became widely known through the String Quartet No. 3 (1972), which includes a set of variations in the style of late Beethoven. Another movement of the quartet contains passages reminiscent of Gustav Mahler. This caused critics to classify him as a neoromantic composer. He compared atonality to abstract art and tonality to concrete art and compared his artistic evolution with the painter Philip Guston&#x27;s, calling &quot;the tension between concreteness and abstraction&quot; a fundamental issue for both of them. His music has also been described as neoconservative postmodernism

Of the works Rochberg composed early in his career, his Symphony No. 2 (1955–56) stands out as one of the most accomplished serial compositions by an American composer. He is perhaps best known for his String Quartets Nos. 3–6 (1972–78). Rochberg conceived Nos. 4–6 as a set and named them the &quot;Concord Quartets&quot; after the Concord String Quartet, which premiered and recorded the works. No. 6 includes a set of variations on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D.

A few of his works were collages of quotations from other composers. &quot;Contra Mortem et Tempus&quot;, for example, contains passages from Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Charles Ives.

Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, and 5, and the Violin Concerto were recorded in 2001–2002 by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbrücken and conductor Christopher Lyndon-Gee and released on the Naxos label.

===Legacy===
For notable students 

James Freeman, musician and teacher at Swarthmore College, said of Rochberg and serialism: &quot;If George Rochberg can do something like that, there&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t do and get away with it. I don&#x27;t have to write 12-tone music; I can if I want to. I can write stuff that sounds like Brahms. I can do anything I want. I&#x27;m free. And that was an extraordinary feeling in the late 1960s for young composers, I think, many of whom felt really constrained to write serial music.&quot;

==Writings==
Rochberg&#x27;s collected essays were published by the University of Michigan Press in 1984 as &quot;The Aesthetics of Survival&quot;. A revised and expanded edition, published shortly before his death, was awarded an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award in 2006. Selections from his correspondence with the Canadian composer István Anhalt were published in 2007 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press. His memoir, &quot;Five Lines, Four Spaces&quot;, was published by the University of Illinois Press in 2009.

<doc id="598867" wikidata="Q1587136" url="?curid=598867" title="Magnetic bearing">
<text>A magnetic bearing is a type of bearing that supports a load using magnetic levitation. Magnetic bearings support moving parts without physical contact. For instance, they are able to levitate a rotating shaft and permit relative motion with very low friction and no mechanical wear. Magnetic bearings support the highest speeds of any kind of bearing and have no maximum relative speed.

Active bearings have several advantages: they do not suffer from wear, have low friction, and can often accommodate irregularities in the mass distribution automatically, allowing rotors to spin around their center of mass with very low vibration.

Passive magnetic bearings use permanent magnets and, therefore, do not require any input power but are difficult to design due to the limitations described by Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem. Techniques using diamagnetic materials are relatively undeveloped and strongly depend on material characteristics. As a result, most magnetic bearings are active magnetic bearings, using electromagnets which require continuous power input and an active control system to keep the load stable. In a combined design, permanent magnets are often used to carry the static load and the active magnetic bearing is used when the levitated object deviates from its optimum position. Magnetic bearings typically require a back-up bearing in the case of power or control system failure.

Magnetic bearings are used in several industrial applications such as electrical power generation, petroleum refinement, machine tool operation and natural gas handling. They are also used in the Zippe-type centrifuge, for uranium enrichment and in turbomolecular pumps, where oil-lubricated bearings would be a source of contamination.

== Design ==

An active magnetic bearing works on the principle of electromagnetic suspension based on the induction of eddy currents in a rotating conductor. When an electrically conducting material is moving in a magnetic field, a current will be generated in the material that counters the change in the magnetic field (known as Lenz&#x27;s Law). This generates a current that will result in a magnetic field that is oriented opposite to the one from the magnet. The electrically conducting material is thus
acting as a magnetic mirror.

The hardware consists of an electromagnet assembly, a set of power amplifiers which supply current to the electromagnets, a controller, and gap sensors with associated electronics to provide the feedback required to control the position of the rotor within the gap. The power amplifier supplies equal bias current to two pairs of electromagnets on opposite sides of a rotor. This constant tug-of-war is mediated by the controller, which offsets the bias current by equal and opposite perturbations of current as the rotor deviates from its center position.

The gap sensors are usually inductive in nature and sense in a differential mode. The power amplifiers in a modern commercial application are solid state devices which operate in a pulse-width modulation configuration. The controller is usually a microprocessor or digital signal processor.

Two types of instabilities are typically present in magnetic bearings. Attractive magnets produce an unstable static force that decreases with increasing distance and increases at decreasing distances. This can cause the bearing to become unbalanced. Secondly, because magnetism is a conservative force, it provides little damping; oscillations may cause loss of successful suspension if any driving forces are present.

== History ==
The table below lists several early patents for active magnetic bearings. Earlier patents for magnetic suspensions can be found but are excluded here because they consist of assemblies of permanent magnets of problematic stability per Earnshaw&#x27;s Theorem.

Jesse Beams from the University of Virginia filed some of the earliest active magnetic bearing patents during World War II. The patents dealt with ultracentrifuges intended for the enrichment of isotopes of elements needed for the Manhattan Project. However, magnetic bearings did not mature until advances in solid-state electronics and modern computer-based control technology with the work of Habermann and Schweitzer. In 1987, Estelle Croot further improved active magnetic bearing technology, but these designs were not manufactured due to expensive costs of production, which used a laser guidance system. Estelle Croot&#x27;s research was the subject of three Australian patents and was funded by Nachi Fujikoshi, Nippon Seiko KK and Hitachi, and her calculations were used in other technologies that used rare-earth magnets but the active magnetic bearings were only developed to the prototype stage. Croot&#x27;s design also included an advance computerised control system, while the last design was a non-linear magnetic bearing.

Kasarda reviews the history of active magnetic bearings in depth. She notes that the first commercial application of active magnetic bearings was in turbomachinery. The active magnetic bearing allowed the elimination of oil reservoirs on compressors for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) gas pipelines in Alberta, Canada. This reduced the fire hazard allowing a substantial reduction in insurance costs. The success of these magnetic bearing installations led NGTL to pioneer the research and development of a digital magnetic bearing control system as a replacement for the analog control systems supplied by the American company Magnetic Bearings Inc. In 1992, NGTL&#x27;s magnetic bearing research group formed the company Revolve Technologies Inc. for commercializing the digital magnetic bearing technology. The company was later purchased by SKF of Sweden. The French company S2M, founded in 1976, was the first to commercially market active magnetic bearings. Extensive research on magnetic bearings continues at the University of Virginia in the Rotating Machinery and Controls Industrial Research Program.

During the decade starting in 1996, the Dutch oil-and-gas company NAM installed twenty gas compressors, each driven by a 23-megawatt variable-speed-drive electric motor. Each unit was fully equipped with active magnetic bearings on both the motor and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the active magnetic bearings were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha Bearings.) By using active magnetic bearings and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without having a gearbox in between) and by applying dry gas seals, a fully dry-dry (oil-free) system was achieved. Applying active magnetic bearings in both the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration using gears and ball bearings) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies, particularly at partial load. As was done in the Groningen field, the full installation can additionally be placed outdoors without the need for a large compressor building.

Non-contacting &quot;permanent magnet bearings&quot; with electromotive stabilisation were applied for patent by R. G. Gilbert in 1955 (U. S. Patent 2,946,930) and K. Boden, D. Scheffer in 1968 (German Patent 1750602). These inventions provide the technological basis for a number of practical applications, some of which have reached the stage of industrial series production under licence from Forschungszentrum Jülich since about 1980. 
Meeks pioneered hybrid magnetic bearing designs (US patent 5,111,102) in which permanent magnets provide the bias field and active control coils are used for stability and dynamic control. These designs using permanent magnets for bias fields are smaller and of lighter weight than purely electromagnetic bearings. The electronic control system is also smaller and requires less electrical power because the bias field is provided by the permanent magnets.
As the development of the necessary components progressed, scientific interest in the field also increased, peaking in the first International Symposium on Magnetic Bearings held in 1988 in Zürich with the founding of the International Society of Magnetic Bearings by Prof. Schweitzer (ETHZ), Prof. Allaire (University of Virginia), and Prof. Okada (Ibaraki University). Since then, the symposium has developed into a biennial conference series with a permanent portal on magnetic bearing technology where all symposium contributions are made available. The web portal is supported by the international research and industrial community. Joining the hall of fame and earning lifetime achievement awards in 2012 were Prof. Yohji Okada, Prof. Gerhard Schweitzer, and Michael Swann of Waukesha Magnetic Bearings.

== Applications ==

Magnetic bearing advantages include very low and predictable friction, and the ability to run without lubrication and in a vacuum. Magnetic bearings are increasingly used in industrial machines such as compressors, turbines, pumps, motors and generators.

Magnetic bearings are commonly used in watt-hour meters by electric utilities to measure home power consumption. They are also used in energy storage or transportation applications and to support equipment in a vacuum, for example in flywheel energy storage systems. A flywheel in a vacuum has very low wind resistance losses, but conventional bearings usually fail quickly in a vacuum due to poor lubrication. Magnetic bearings are also used to support maglev trains in order to get low noise and smooth ride by eliminating physical contact surfaces. Disadvantages include high cost, heavy weight and relatively large size.

Magnetic bearings are also used in some centrifugal compressors for chillers with a shaft made up of magnetic material lies between magnetic bearings. A small amount of current provides magnetic levitation to the shaft which remains freely suspended in air ensuring zero friction between the bearing and the shaft.

Among the most significant industrial applications are turbomolecular pumps for vacuum generation in semiconductor production plants. First commercial magnetic bearing type turbopumps without mechanical stabilisation were marketed by Leybold AG in 1975 (electromagnetic) and in 1989 (permanent magnet based).

In the field of vacuum metrology the &quot;spinning rotor gauge (SRG)&quot; was introduced as a reference standard by BIPM, Paris 1979. A first laboratory setup of this gauge was established by Jesse Beams in 1946. Commercial series production started in 1980 under licences from Forschungszentrum Jülich. The SRG is significant for vacuum process control in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

A new application of magnetic bearings is in artificial hearts. The use of magnetic suspension in ventricular assist devices was pioneered by Prof. Paul Allaire and Prof. Houston Wood at the University of Virginia, culminating in the first magnetically suspended ventricular assist centrifugal pump (VAD) in 1999.

Several ventricular assist devices use magnetic bearings, including the LifeFlow heart pump,
the DuraHeart Left Ventricular Assist System,
the Levitronix CentriMag,
and the Berlin Heart.
In these devices, the single moving part is suspended by a combination of hydrodynamic force and magnetic force.
By eliminating physical contact surfaces, magnetic bearings make it easier to reduce areas of high shear stress (which leads to red blood cell damage) and flow stagnation (which leads to clotting) in these blood pumps. Berlin Heart INCOR was the first commercial ventricular assist device without mechanical or fluid dynamic stabilisation.

Calnetix Technologies, Synchrony Magnetic Bearings (subsidiary of Johnson Controls International), Waukesha Magnetic Bearings, and S2M (subsidiary of SKF) are among the major magnetic bearing developers and manufacturers worldwide.

== Future advances ==

With the use of an induction-based levitation system present in maglev technologies such as the Inductrack system, magnetic bearings could replace complex control systems by using Halbach arrays and simple closed loop coils. These systems gain in simplicity, but are less advantageous with regard to eddy current losses. For rotating systems it is possible to use homopolar magnet designs instead of multipole Halbach structures, which reduce losses considerably.

An example that has bypassed the Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem issues is the homopolar electrodynamic bearing invented by Dr Torbjörn Lembke. This is a novel type of electromagnetic bearing based on a passive magnetic technology. It does not require any control electronics to operate and works because the electrical currents generated by motion cause a restoring force.

<text>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, commonly known as Mad Max 3, is a 1985 Australian post-apocalyptic dystopian action film directed by George Miller and George Ogilvie and written by Terry Hayes and Miller. It is the third installment in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchise, as well as the only one in it to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA. The film stars Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, and follows a lone roving warrior who is exiled into the desert. It was Gibson&#x27;s last performance as &quot;Mad Max&quot; Rockatansky.

&quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; was released in Australia on 10 July 1985. The film received positive reviews from critics. A fourth film, &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, was released in 2015, starring Tom Hardy as Max.

==Plot==
The world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland caused by ecocide and a nuclear war over resources. In Mainland Australia, Max Rockatansky crosses the desert in a motor vehicle. The airborne bandit Jedediah and his young son attack him and steal his vehicle. Max follows Jedediah&#x27;s trail to a trading post called &quot;Bartertown&quot;. Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, he impresses the local officials with his toughness, and the founder and ruler of the town, Aunty Entity, offers to resupply him if he completes a task.

Bartertown&#x27;s energy comes from &quot;Underworld,&quot; a subterranean refinery that turns pig feces into methane. The refinery is run by Master, a dwarf who rides around on Blaster, his giant bodyguard. &quot;Master Blaster&quot; has begun to challenge Aunty for control of Bartertown; Aunty wants Max to kill Blaster so she can subvert Master to her will.

Max infiltrates Underworld to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work there for slaughtering a pig to feed his children. When Master Blaster learns his newly-acquired vehicle belonged to Max, he forces Max to disarm its booby-trap. In doing so, Max sets off his alarm and discovers that Blaster is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises.

By law, conflicts in Bartertown are resolved by a fight to the death in Thunderdome, a gladiatorial arena. Max publicly accuses Master of stealing his vehicle, and a battle is scheduled against Blaster. Blaster dominates until Max blows a whistle, which makes Blaster grab his head in pain. Max knocks Blaster&#x27;s helmet off and prepares to kill him, but relents upon seeing that Blaster has an intellectual disability. Max reveals Aunty&#x27;s plot and Master threatens to shut down the refinery, so Aunty has Blaster killed. She is then able to terrorize Master into keeping the refinery running.

For breaking a deal, Max is bound, placed on a horse, and sent into the Wasteland, his punishment determined by the spin of a wheel. When the horse collapses from exhaustion, Max frees himself and continues on foot until he also collapses.

Warrior girl Savannah Nix finds Max near death and heals him. Her home, &quot;Planet Erf,&quot; is an oasis populated by a primitive tribe of teenagers and children. The children are descended from survivors of a crashed Qantas Boeing 747, some of whom left to seek help and never returned. They believe Max is the pilot, &quot;Captain Walker&quot;, come to fix the aeroplane and fly them to the fabled &quot;Tomorrow-morrow Land&quot;. Max denies he is Walker and insists there is no longer any civilisation like that in their stories. Disillusioned, some teenagers and children led by Savannah want to attempt the journey to Bartertown, but Max stops them and has them tied up, saying everyone should go on living in the oasis.

During the night, the separatists escape. Max agrees to bring them back, taking some members of the tribe along. However, both parties are in bad shape by the time he catches up. Out of supplies, Max is forced to lead the contingent back to Bartertown.

The combined group sneaks into Underworld and, with Pig Killer&#x27;s help, frees Master and escapes in a modified truck down train tracks, destroying the refinery and most of Bartertown in the process. Aunty orders her forces to pursue and retrieve Master. Max and his group do their best to fight off the attackers. They come across Jedediah and his son, whom Max coerces into providing a ride in their aeroplane. With the approach of Aunty&#x27;s army shortening the runway, Max gets in his vehicle, which a child stole from their pursuers, and crashes it to create an opening so the plane can take off. Injured and alone, Max is spared by an impressed Aunty, who leaves to rebuild Bartertown.

Jedediah flies Master, Pig Killer, and the separatists to the ruins of Sydney. Years later, they have established a community with other wanderers. While they attempt to rediscover the knowledge of the pre-apocalyptic world, each night Savannah recites the story of their journey, and they light up the city as a beacon for Max or any other travellers to follow. Meanwhile, Max wanders in the Wasteland, alone.

==Production==
&quot;Beyond Thunderdome&quot; was the first &quot;Mad Max&quot; film made without producer Byron Kennedy, who had been killed in a helicopter crash in 1983. Director George Miller was hesitant to continue without his producing partner, saying later: &quot;I was reluctant to go ahead. And then there was a sort of need to – let&#x27;s do something just to get over the shock and grief of all of that.&quot; There is a title card at the end of film before the credits roll that reads: &quot;...for Byron&quot;.

Miller co-directed the film with George Ogilvie, with whom he had worked on the 1983 television miniseries &quot;The Dismissal&quot;. About this decision, he said: &quot;I had a lot on my plate. I asked my friend George Ogilvie, who was working on the mini-series, &#x27;Could you come and help me?&#x27; But I don&#x27;t remember the experience because I was doing it to just... You know, I was grieving.&quot; For the film, Miller and Ogilvie employed a group workshopping rehearsal technique that they had developed.

Exterior location filming took place primarily in the mining town of Coober Pedy, though the set for Bartertown was built at an old brickworks (the Brickpit) at Homebush Bay in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs, and the children&#x27;s camp was in the Blue Mountains. According to cinematographer Dean Semler, &quot;&quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; proved far more challenging than &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;. We were dealing with more varied environments than before and it was essential that each of the worlds created for the film have a distinctly different look.&quot;

It was the most expensive Australian film at the time.

==Music==

The musical score for &quot;Beyond Thunderdome&quot; was composed by Maurice Jarre, replacing Brian May, who composed the music for the first two films in the series. The film also contains two songs performed by Tina Turner: &quot;One of the Living&quot;, which plays over the opening titles, and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)&quot;, which plays over the end credits.

&quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)&quot; reached #1 in Canada, #2 in the US, and #3 on the British single charts. &quot;One of the Living&quot; was rerecorded for single release, and it reached #15 in both Canada and the US, but only #55 in Britain. At the 28th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;One of the Living&quot; won the award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

A soundtrack album was released by Capitol Records in 1985. It included Turner&#x27;s songs alongside an instrumental version of &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)&quot; on Side 1, and some of Jarre&#x27;s music on Side 2. A double CD containing only Jarre&#x27;s original music was issued in 2010 on Tadlow Music/Silva Screen Records.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although the film&#x27;s budget was larger than that of its predecessors, its box office yield was only moderate in comparison. It grossed A$4,272,802 at the Australian box office, less than what &quot;Mad Max&quot; made and less than half of what &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; made.

In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $36 million, generating theatrical rentals of $18 million. Outside of the U.S. (including Australia), it earned a similar amount, giving it worldwide rentals of $36 million.

===Critical response===
Reaction to the film was generally positive. 

Critics disagreed over whether they considered the film to be the highest or lowest point of the &quot;Mad Max&quot; trilogy. Most of the negative criticism focused on the children in the second half of the film, whom many found too similar to the Lost Boys from the story of Peter Pan. Robert C. Cumbow of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; identified &quot;whole ideas, themes and characterizations&quot; adopted from &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, a 1980 post-apocalyptic novel by Russell Hoban.

On the other hand, there was much praise for the scene in the Thunderdome, which Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called &quot;the first really original movie idea about how to stage a fight since we got the first karate movies&quot; and &quot;one of the great creative action scenes in the movies&quot;. Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars and later placed it on his list of the ten best films of 1985. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;opens strong&quot; and has good acting from Gibson, Turner, and the children.

Some fans of the series have criticised the film for being &quot;Hollywood-ized&quot; and having a lighter tone than its predecessors.

=== Accolades === 
===Legacy===
As with the previous installments of the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series, &quot;Beyond Thunderdome&quot; has influenced popular culture in numerous ways. Of particular note is the widespread use of the term &quot;thunderdome&quot; to describe a contest in which the loser suffers a great hardship.

American filmmaker Chris Weitz has cited the film as an influence.

<text>Miguel García Granados y Zavala (29 September 1809 – 8 September 1878) was a Spanish-born Guatemalan politician and military general who served as President of Guatemala from 1871 to 1873.

== Early life ==

García Granados was born in El Puerto de Santa María, Spain. As a young adolescent, he was brought to Central America. He was a member of a wealthy military family. At age twenty-three, Granados visited South America, Europe and the cities of New York and Philadelphia in the US. He completed his schooling in London. 

He was the brother of Guatemalan writer María Josefa García Granados.

== Career ==
García Granados was known as a moderate liberal. He compromised with Rafael Carrera, and attempted to get along with his successor Vicente Cerna. Sympathetic with the revolt against the government, García Granados fled to exile and was supported by Guatemalan liberals. After returning to Guatemala, García Granados became the leader of the revolution against Cerna, eventually becoming known as its philosopher. García Granados played a key part in the regime of Justo Rufino Barrios, the founder of &quot;the army of 45 men&quot;. He served as a provisional president from 1871 to 1873 after the liberal victory of Guatemala City. García Granados wanted to regularize the government by constructing a lawful regime. In 1872, Guatemala invaded Honduras, where García Granados decreed freedom of the press and expelled the Jesuits.

García Granados and his successor Barrios support multiple liberal revolts. During his presidency, García Granados created the Guatemalan flag by decree, which remains almost identical to his 1871 version. Garcia Granados supported education and the arts. In 1871 he invited Italian conductor Pietro Visoni to stay in Guatemala and become the director of the main military band. Visoni later founded the Martial Symphony Band and the School of Substitutes (Escuela de Substitutos), the first formal music conservatory in Central America. After García Granados stepped down, Barrios served as president until the mid-1870s.

== Retirement ==

García Granados retired from public life to write articles for Guatemalan magazines and newspapers; accounts of the time when he was the leader of the liberal forces and as president; an essay about monetary policy and two volumes of memoirs.

In 1877, he arrived in Guatemala José Martí, who started teaching in the just founded Instituto Nacional Central para Varones and Escuela Normal para Varones. In those days, the high schools&#x27; faculty included Spaniard politician Valero Pujol, German engineer Edwin Rockstroh and Cuban poet José Joaquín Palma, who used to gather for intellectual conversations. In one of those meetings, Martí met María García Granados y Saborío, general García Granados&#x27; daughter. Despite his engagement to a Cuban woman, Martí started visiting the Garcia Granados residency, where he frequently played chess with the general and paid his respects to María. María fell in love with Martí, but after a sudden trip to Mexico in early 1878, came back to Guatemala already married. A few weeks after Marti left for good, María died, followed shortly thereafter by her father. In 1891, Martí wrote a poem in her memory, named &quot;La Niña de Guatemala&quot;, in which he implies that she died from love.

== Death ==

Garcia Granados died on 8 September 1878 at the age of 69. Garcia Granados was laid to rest in the old San Juan de Dios Cemetery. 

In 1894, his remains were transferred to a monument erected in his honor at the new General Cemetery.

His portrait appears on the 10 Quetzales bank note.

<doc id="598872" wikidata="Q3197100" url="?curid=598872" title="Kings of Rhythm">
<text>Kings of Rhythm are an American music group formed in the late 1940s in Clarksdale, Mississippi and led by Ike Turner through to his death in 2007. Turner would retain the name of the band throughout his career, although the group has undergone considerable line-up changes over time.

The group was an offshoot of a large big band ensemble called the Tophatters. By the late 1940s, Turner had renamed this group the Kings of Rhythm. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits of the day. In 1951, Turner and his Kings of Rhythm recorded the song &quot;Rocket 88&quot; (credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats), which is a contender for the first rock and roll record. The song is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles.

In the 1960s, the Kings of Rhythm became the band for the &quot;Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue&quot;. For a few years in the early 1970s they were renamed the Family Vibes, and released two albums under that name. After the disbanding of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue in 1976, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm in 2001 and released the Grammy-nominated album &quot;Here And Now&quot;. The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album &quot;Risin&#x27; with the Blues&quot; (2006). After Turner died in 2007, the band for some time was under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane, who was a childhood friend of Turner&#x27;s. The Kings of Rhythm continue to perform with vocalist Earl Thomas.

==Career==
===Formation: The Tophatters===
As a teenager, Ike Turner joined a large rhythm ensemble in Clarksdale, Mississippi called the Tophatters, which included musicians Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox, and Clayton Love. They performed at local dances, playing big band arrangements from sheet music. At one point the Tophatters had over 30 members, and eventually split into two, with one act who wanted to carry on playing dance band jazz calling themselves the Dukes of Swing and the other, led by Turner, becoming the Kings of Rhythm. A rivalry between the two former factions of the Tophatters lasted for some time, with the two staging an open air &#x27;battle-of-the-bands&#x27; where they played from atop two flatbed trucks every fortnight.

===1940s: Early years===
The Kings of Rhythm had a regular Wednesday night residency at Clarksdale&#x27;s Harlem Theater. This got them bookings around the Mississippi Delta region. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. In March 1951 whilst driving between gigs, the Kings of Rhythm dropped in on a B.B. King club date in Chambers, Mississippi. Turner persuaded King to let the band sit in and play a number with him. King contests this, remembering that it was only Turner who sat in with his band. They were well received and the club owner booked them for a weekend residency, whilst King recommended them to Sam Philips at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 1950s, The Kings received regular airplay from live sessions on Clarksdale radio station WROX-AM, at the behest of DJ Early Wright. The band would sometimes play a session that lasted an hour.

===1951: &quot;Rocket 88&quot;===

Sam Phillips invited the Kings of Rhythm down to Memphis to record at Sun Studios, and the group had to devise an original song at short notice for the session. The saxophonist, Jackie Brenston, suggested a song about the new Rocket 88 Oldsmobile. Turner worked out the arrangement and the piano introduction and the band collaborated on the rest with Brenston on vocals. &quot;Rocket 88&quot; came out with the group erroneously credited as Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, instead of Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm featuring Jackie Brenston. The single went on to sell half a million copies, reaching the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts in June 1951. The success of the record caused divisions within the group, with Brenston believing he was now the star and should front the group, and Turner and Raymond Hill bitter that they had received little recognition or recompense for writing and recording a hit record. Turner and the band were only paid $20 each for the record, with the exception of Brenston, who sold the rights to Phillips for $910.

The group&#x27;s regular singer, Johnny O&#x27;Neal, had left prior to the recording of &quot;Rocket 88&quot; to sign a contract with King Records, but Turner still refused to allow Brenston to take over as singer. Following the success of the record, Brenston was convinced he was the star of the group and left to pursue a solo career. This caused the group to fall apart with some members backing Brenston on the road. However, Turner held onto the name and soon reformed the Kings of Rhythm with a new line-up.

=== 1952–1954: Sun/Modern Records ===
Between 1952 and 1954, Turner became a session musician and production assistant for Sam Philips at Sun Records and the Bihari brothers at Modern/RPM Records. Turner was also a freelance talent scout, and used the Kings of Rhythm as session musicians. They played on many recording for the Biharis&#x27; Modern, RPM, and Flair labels.

Turner&#x27;s wife Bonnie Turner was a pianist and vocalist in his new line-up. They released the record &quot;My Heart Belongs To You&quot; / &quot;Looking for My Baby&quot; from RPM in 1952. The Kings of Rhythm which included Bonnie Turner, Raymond Hill, Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Emerson and Johnny O&#x27;Neal recorded for Sun in 1953 and 1954. Some of the recordings remained unissued until Charly Records released of &quot;Sun: The Roots Of Rock: Volume 3: Delta Rhythm Kings&quot; in 1976. Turner and the Kings of Rhythm last recorded for Sun in 1958 with Tommy Hodge; by then, Phillips had shifted his focus onto rockabilly music and wasn&#x27;t recording many black musicians anymore.

=== 1954–1962: St. Louis ===
In late 1954, Turner took the reformed version of Kings of Rhythm north to East St. Louis, which included Kizart, Sims, O&#x27;Neal, Jesse Knight Jr. and Turner&#x27;s then wife Annie Mae Wilson on piano and vocals. Around this time, Turner moved over to playing guitar to accommodate Wilson, taking lessons from Willie Kizart to improve.

Turner maintained strict discipline over the band, insisting they lived in a large house with him so he could conduct early morning rehearsals at a moment&#x27;s notice. He would fire anyone he suspected of drinking or taking drugs, and would fine band members if they played a wrong note. He controlled everything from the arrangements down to the suits the band wore onstage. Starting off playing at a club called Kingsbury&#x27;s in Madison, Illinois, within a year Turner had built up a full gig schedule, establishing his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their only real competition, Sir John&#x27;s Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, and continue playing until dawn. In St. Louis for the first time Turner and the band were exposed to a developing white teenage audience who were excited by rhythm and blues. Clubs they played in St. Louis included Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers, The Dynaflow, The Moonlight Lounge, Club Riviera and the West End Walters. In East St. Louis, the group would play at Kingsbury&#x27;s, Manhattan Club and The Sportsman.

Between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal in 1956. The session produced the regional hit &quot;I&#x27;m Tore Up,&quot; featuring lead vocalist Billy Gayles. In 1958, the band recorded for Cobra/Artistic in Chicago, serving as the house band for Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and Betty Everett. Turner befriended St. Louis R&amp;B fan Bill Stevens, who in 1959 set up the short-lived record label Stevens Records, which was financed by his father, Fred Stevens. Turner and the Kings of Rhythm recorded for Stevens, of which seven singles were released and later included on the Red Lightnin&#x27; compilation &quot;Hey Hey&quot; (1984).

=== 1960–1976: The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue ===

After the addition of his future wife Little Ann (Tina Turner) as lead singer, Turner formed the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. The creation of the revue was in a large part the birth of the soul revues of the 1960s. The Kings of Rhythm and Tina were joined on stage by the Ikettes, who contributed backing vocals and choreographed dance moves. As backing band to the duo, the band played on many substantial soul hits, including the million sellers &quot;A Fool In Love&quot; (1960) and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot;(1961) both for Sue Records. Also included in the revue were male singers Stacy Johnson, Vernon Guy, Jimmy Thomas and Bobby John. Turner moved the revue to California in 1962.

In the mid-1960s Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band. Turner fired him because his guitar solos became &quot;so elaborate they overstepped the bounds.&quot; In 1964, the band released the single &quot;Getting Nasty&quot; / &quot;Nutting Up&quot; under the alias Nasty Minds on Turner&#x27;s Sonja label. In addition the band appeared on local television shows and toured the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue was featured in the 1965 concert film &quot;The Big T.N.T. Show&quot;. The lineup for that performance was Turner and Herb Sadler on guitar, James Norwood on drums, Sam Rhodes on bass and Ernest Lane on piano. In the fall of 1966, the Ike Tina Turner Reve joined the Rolling Stones in their British Tour. They also joined the Rolling Stones for their American Tour in 1969.

By 1970, Ike &amp; Tina Turner had a resurgence on the charts with their rock covers. Following the success of their single &quot;Proud Mary&quot; in 1971, the Kings of Rhythm were renamed the Family Vibes. They released two albums as the Family Vibes, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1972) and &quot;Confined to Soul&quot; (1973), both produced by Turner. The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue disbanded in 1976.

=== 1986–1987: St. Louis Kings of Rhythm ===
In 1986, a revival of the King of Rhythm consisting of several veteran members toured Europe as the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm. The tour extended into 1987, and an album titled &quot;St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm&quot; was released on Timeless Records in Europe. Mayor Vincent Schoemehl officially appointed the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm ambassadors for the City of St. Louis.

=== 2001–present: Reformation ===
In the late 1990s Turner toured with Joe Louis Walker. The positive response to the tour encouraged him to reform the Kings of Rhythm. The Kings of Rhythm toured the U.S. in 2001 and headlined a showcase at South by Southwest, where they were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference. This led to the recording and release of the Grammy-nominated album &quot;Here And Now&quot; (2001) by Turner and the Kings of Rhythm. The album won two W.C. Handy Awards, the Blues Foundation&#x27;s equivalent of the Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional Blues Album and Comeback Album of the Year in 2002. They received positive reviews for their performances at various music festivals, including Montreux Jazz Festival (2002), North Sea Jazz Festival (2002), and Jazz à Vienne (2004).

The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album &quot;Risin&#x27; With The Blues&quot; (2006). After Turner died in December 2007, the band was temporarily under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane (1931–2012), a childhood friend of Turner&#x27;s. The band performed Turner&#x27;s classic songs at his funeral. Since 2008, the band has performed with vocalist Earl Thomas. Thomas became a fan of Ike &amp; Tina Turner after watching the film &quot;Soul To Soul&quot; (1971) as a child. He met Turner in 2004 and remained in contact with him until his death.

== Legacy ==
By some accounts, &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is considered the first rock and roll record.

Speaking on &quot;Rocket 88&quot; being a contender for the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said:In musical terms [he was] very important. &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record, the other being &quot;The Fat Man&quot; by Fats Domino from 1949. But &quot;Rocket 88&quot; does have a couple of elements which &quot;The Fat Man&quot; did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it&#x27;s in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner, even though his lead singer and saxophonist, Jackie Brenston, got the label credit.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Rocket 88&quot; was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles in 2018.

<text>Jean-Jacques Favier (; 13 April 1949 – 19 March 2023) was a German-born French engineer and a CNES astronaut who flew aboard the STS-78 NASA Space Shuttle mission in 1996. Favier was due to fly aboard the doomed &quot;Columbia&quot; mission in 2003 (STS-107), but later opted out of the mission. Jean-Jacques Favier was deputy director for space technology and deputy director for advanced concepts and strategy at CNES, director of the Solidification Laboratory at the French Atomic Energy Commission and research program director at the International Space University.

==Career==
Favier was the advisor to the director of the Material Science Research Center (CEREM) at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and was detached to CNES. He proposed the MEPHISTO program, a collaborative project between the French Space Agency and NASA, and has developed many other scientific projects in collaboration with the United States since 1985. He was the principal investigator for a MEPHISTO materials processing experiment, which made its debut on the United States Microgravity Payload in 1992 and 1994. He became a CNES payload specialist in 1985. He has been principal investigator of more than ten space experiments in collaboration with ESA, NASA, and the Russian Space Agency.

Favier was assigned as an alternate payload specialist on STS-65/IML-2, the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission, and supported the mission as a Crew Interface Coordinator (CIC/APS) from the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

Favier flew on STS-78 and logged over 405 hours in space. STS-78 &quot;Columbia&quot; (20 June to 7 July 1996) was a 16-day Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission. It included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation, and served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, covering 7 million miles in 405 hours, 48 minutes.

Favier was a member of the board of advisors of the International Space University and also the chair of the research steering committee. He was co-founder of a remote imaging company called &quot;Blue Planet&quot;, aimed at building a constellation of micro-satellites which image with a 1-meter resolution.

==Personal life and death==
Born in Kehl, Germany, he married Michèle Jean. They had four children. He enjoyed skiing, tennis, wind-surfing, and archaeology.

Favier died on 19 March 2023, in Albi at the age of 73.

<text>&quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; is a song written by Graham Lyle and Terry Britten, and recorded by Tina Turner for her fifth studio album, &quot;Private Dancer&quot; (1984). Capitol Records released it as a single from &quot;Private Dancer&quot; in May 1984 and it eventually became Turner&#x27;s biggest-selling single.

Although Turner had already scored a late-1983 top 30 hit with her rendition of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; became her first and only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single, selling over 2,000,000 copies worldwide. At the time, aged 44, Turner became the oldest solo female artist to top the Hot 100. It was the second-biggest single of 1984 in the United States and the 17th-biggest in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; received three awards at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. In 1993, the song&#x27;s title was used as the title for the biographical film based on Turner&#x27;s life.

In 2003, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; was included in VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 years.
In 2012, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, marking Turner&#x27;s third Grammy Hall of Fame award. The song ranked number 309 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; and at number 134 in their 2021 updated list. It also ranked number 38 on RIAA&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; list. Several musical artists have covered &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; and experienced commercial success with their renditions. American rapper Warren G released a hip hop version in 1996, and in July 2020, Norwegian DJ and producer Kygo released a remix of the song.

==Background and recording==
The song was written by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, who originally offered it to Cliff Richard, but it was rejected. Some months before Turner recorded the song, the British pop group Bucks Fizz were offered it. Member Jay Aston asked to sing lead on the track after hearing the demo, but was told by the producer that it was unsuitable for a female lead vocal. The group went on to record it in February 1984, but sung by male member Bobby G. Aston recalls the demo was very similar to the eventual Tina Turner version, but their finished version was in a very different style. It was intended for possible inclusion on their next album &quot;I Hear Talk&quot; but was shelved when Turner released her version first. The Bucks Fizz version went unreleased until it was included on a re-issue of their &quot;Are You Ready&quot; album in 2000. The Original Bucks Fizz included the song in their reunion concert tour in October 2009.

==Composition==
The sheet music for the song shows the key of C♭ major in common time with a suggested tempo of &quot;moderate groove&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Mark Millan of &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; described &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; as &quot;three minutes and 48 seconds of pop perfection&quot;. He noted that it is a &quot;soft synth-driven track countered by Turner&#x27;s battle weary voice, barely hiding the cynic in her&quot;, and stated that the song &quot;reeks of attitude&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;People Magazine&quot; noted &quot;the sophisticated pop&quot; of the song, adding that it has &quot;the characteristic flair and energy that have made Tina the envy of every singer this side of Aretha.&quot;

==Chart performance==
Until the release of &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;, Tina Turner had not had a US top-ten single since the early 1970s. The single went to number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remained there for three weeks, giving Turner her first and only solo number-one hit in the U.S. Turner was 44 when the song hit number one, at the time making her the oldest female solo artist to place a number-one single on the US Hot 100.

The song also spent five weeks at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart, from July 14 to August 18, 1984, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, by Prince, being the reason it never reached its number-one spot. At the end of the year, the song was ranked the second-best-performing song of 1984 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100, behind the aforementioned &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;.

Worldwide, the song did well on the music charts, reaching number one in Australia and Canada. It peaked at number three in New Zealand and on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her highest-charting single on the latter chart alongside &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)&quot;. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 10 in many European countries, including the top 5 in Ireland, Sweden, and Austria. It also reached number two in South Africa.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; features Turner walking down the street in a leather miniskirt, engaging with the public, intercut with scenes where she is singing directly to camera. The video was shot in New York City during the spring of 1984. Pamela Springsteen, Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s sister from &quot;Sleepaway Camp 2&quot;, makes an appearance as a street dancer along with Vanessa Bell Calloway, who would later portray the fictional character of Jackie (Turner&#x27;s friend) in the 1993 film &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;. The video was directed by John Mark Robinson.

An alternate black-and-white video directed by Bud Schaetzle features Tina singing the song against a black background while couples argue in a bar.

==Accolades==
In February 1985, the song received three awards at the Grammy Awards Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Turner&#x27;s live performance of the song at the Grammy show was released on the 1994 album &quot;Grammy&#x27;s Greatest Moments Volume I&quot;.

The music video for the song claimed a prize at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1985 for &quot;Best Female Video&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Legacy and impact==
The name of the song was used as the title of the 1993 biopic based on Turner&#x27;s life. The first line of the song&#x27;s chorus was interpolated in the 2002 song &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; by rapper Fat Joe and R&amp;B singer Ashanti. In 2018, a cover of the song was released as a non-album single by singer La&#x27;Porsha Renae. Mickey Guyton performed the song at the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. In 2023, American hard rock band Black Stone Cherry released a cover of the song as a non-album single in honor of Turner&#x27;s passing, with proceeds from the sale of the single being donated to organizations supporting domestic violence awareness.

==Warren G version==
&quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; was also recorded by American artists Warren G and Adina Howard for the &quot;Supercop soundtrack&quot;. The song both sampled and interpolated the chorus of Tina Turner&#x27;s 1984 song of the same name, though Warren G replaced the original lyrics with his own. &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; became a hit, making it to 32 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Warren G&#x27;s third top-forty single, as well as number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles chart. The single found greater success outside the US, peaking at number one in New Zealand, number two in Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and reaching the top 10 in an additional nine countries.

===Critical reception===
British magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; rated Warren G&#x27;s cover of &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; four out of five in their review.

===Music video===

==Kygo version==
A remix of the song was released as a single by Norwegian DJ and record producer Kygo and Tina Turner. The song was released on July 17, 2020. This was the last release by Turner before her death in May 2023.

===Background===
Talking about the song, Kygo said, &quot;&#x27;What&#x27;s Love Got To Do With It?&#x27; is one of my all time favourite songs and it feels surreal to get the opportunity to work with such a legendary artist. Can&#x27;t wait for you all to hear it!&quot; He also said in a statement, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to collaborate with Tina Turner, who is an icon that I grew up listening to. &#x27;What&#x27;s Love Got To Do With It&#x27; is one of my all-time favorite songs so to have a chance to rework it has been a very special moment in my career. I love working around timeless vocals and although it&#x27;s challenging to preserve elements of the original track and adding my own touch, I&#x27;m extremely happy with how it turned out!&quot;

===Music video===
A music video to accompany the release of &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; was first released onto YouTube on July 16, 2020. The video is directed by Sarah Bahbah and features Laura Harrier and Charles Michael Davis as star-crossed lovers who, despite looking on paper as having a strong and playful relationship, behind the scenes the couple lacks a deep emotional connection to last. In the end, one of them must walk away.

<text>Margo Wilson (1942–2009) was a Canadian evolutionary psychologist. She was a professor of psychology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, noted for her pioneering work in the field of evolutionary psychology and her contributions to the study of violence.

==Biography==
Wilson was born on October 1, 1942, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She spent her childhood years in the Gwich&#x27;in community of Fort McPherson, where her mother, a nurse, provided medical services. She attended the University of Alberta, graduating with an undergraduate degree in psychology in 1964. She then studied behavioural endocrinology at the University of California and, after winning a Commonwealth Scholarship, at University College London, England, where she earned her PhD in 1972.

From 1972 through 1975, she was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Toronto, where she met her future husband, fellow psychologist Martin Daly. Together, they moved to Hamilton in 1978 after Daly was hired by McMaster University. In the 1980s, Wilson was appointed professor of Psychology at McMaster, where she remained for the rest of her career.

Wilson was elected president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in 1997. With Daly, she was, for 10 years, the editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Evolution and Human Behavior,&quot;. In 1998, she was named a fellow of the Royal Society.

Wilson died in Hamilton on September 24, 2009, of cancer. In 2009, the Human Behavior and Evolution Society established the Margo Wilson Award (for best paper published in the previous year) to honour her contributions to the field.

== Research ==
In 1978, Wilson proposed the idea to Daly that they could analyze patterns of homicide to better understand humans&#x27; social behaviours from an evolutionary perspective. For the next 30 years, Wilson and Daly collaborated on this research, authoring several books and over 100 academic papers and book chapters in this area.

Their first book on this topic, &quot;Homicide&quot; (1988), has been described as a &quot;founding&quot; and &quot;classic&quot; text for the field of evolutionary psychology. Their second book on homicide, &quot;The truth about Cinderella&quot; (1999), summarized their findings on the Cinderella effect, which suggests that stepparents are more likely to mistreat children than biological parents.

<text>William Shenstone (18 November 171411 February 1763) was an English poet and one of the earliest practitioners of landscape gardening through the development of his estate, &quot;The Leasowes&quot;.

==Biography==
Son of Thomas Shenstone and Anne Penn, daughter of William Penn of Harborough Hall, then in 
Hagley (now Blakedown), Shenstone was born at the Leasowes, Halesowen on 18 November 1714. At that time this was an exclave of Shropshire within the county of Worcestershire and now in the West Midlands. Shenstone received part of his formal education at Halesowen Grammar School (now The Earls High School). In 1741, Shenstone became bailiff to the feoffees of Halesowen Grammar School.

While attending Solihull School, he began a lifelong friendship with Richard Jago. He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1732 and made another firm friend there in Richard Graves, the author of &quot;The Spiritual Quixote&quot;.

Shenstone took no degree, but, while still at Oxford, he published &quot;Poems on various occasions, written for the entertainment of the author&quot; (1737). This edition was intended for private circulation only but, containing the first draft of &quot;The Schoolmistress&quot;, it attracted some wider attention. Shenstone tried hard to suppress it but in 1742 he published anonymously a revised draft of &quot;The Schoolmistress, a Poem in imitation of Spenser&quot;. The inspiration of the poem was Sarah Lloyd, teacher of the village school where Shenstone received his first education. Isaac D&#x27;Israeli contended that Robert Dodsley had been misled in publishing it as one of a sequence of &quot;Moral Poems&quot;, its intention having been satirical, as evidenced by the &quot;ludicrous index&quot; appended to its original publication.
In 1741 he published &quot;The Judgment of Hercules&quot;. He inherited the Leasowes estate, and retired there in 1745 to undertake what proved the chief work of his life, the beautifying of his property. He embarked on elaborate schemes of landscape gardening which gave The Leasowes a wide celebrity (see &quot;ferme ornée&quot;), but sadly impoverished the owner. Shenstone was not a contented recluse. He desired constant admiration of his gardens, and he never ceased to lament his lack of fame as a poet.

In 1759, Shenstone made the acquaintance of James Woodhouse, a shoe-maker from nearby Rowley Regis who had started writing poetry. Shenstone encouraged Woodhouse&#x27;s literary efforts, allowing him access to the library at the Leasowes and including one of Woodhouse&#x27;s works in a collection of poems published in 1762.

Shenstone died unmarried on 11 February 1763.

==Critical appraisal==
Shenstone&#x27;s poems of nature were written in praise of its most artificial aspects, but the emotions they express were obviously genuine. His &quot;Schoolmistress&quot; was admired by Oliver Goldsmith, with whom Shenstone had much in common, and his &quot;Elegies&quot; written at various times and to some extent biographical in character won the praise of Robert Burns who, in the preface to &quot;Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect&quot; (1786), called him &quot;... that celebrated poet whose divine elegies do honour to our language, our nation and our species&quot;. The best example of purely technical skill in his works is perhaps his success in the management of the anapaestic trimeter in his &quot;Pastoral Ballad in Four Parts&quot; (written in 1743), but first printed in &quot;Dodsley&#x27;s Collection of Poems&quot; (vol. iv., 1755).

Arthur Schopenhauer mentioned Shenstone in his discussion of equivocation. &quot;[C]oncepts&quot;, Schopenhauer asserted, &quot;which in and by themselves contain nothing improper, yet the actual case brought under them leads to an improper conception&quot; are called equivocations. He continued:
==Bibliography==
Shenstone&#x27;s works were first published by his friend Robert Dodsley (3 vols., 1764–1769). The second volume contains Dodsley&#x27;s description of the Leasowes. The last, consisting of correspondence with Graves, Jago and others, appeared after Dodsley&#x27;s death. Other letters of Shenstone&#x27;s are included in Select Letters (ed. Thomas Hill 1778). The letters of Lady Luxborough (née Henrietta St John) to Shenstone were printed by T. Dodsley in 1775; much additional correspondence is preserved in the British Museum letters to Lady Luxborough (Add. MS. 28958), Dodsley&#x27;s letters to Shenstone (Add. MS. 28959), and correspondence between Shenstone and Bishop Percy from 1757 to 1763 the last being of especial interest; To Shenstone was due the original suggestion of Percy&#x27;s Reliques, a service which would alone entitle him to a place among the precursors of the romantic movement in English literature.

In a letter written in 1741 Shenstone became the first person to record the use of &quot;&quot;. In the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary this was recognised as the longest word in the English language. The word shrubbery is first recorded by the OED in a letter of Lady Luxborough in 1748 to Shenstone: &quot;Nature has been so remarkably kind this last Autumn to adorn my Shrubbery with the flowers that usually blow at Whitsuntide&quot;.

<doc id="598892" wikidata="Q6797886" url="?curid=598892" title="Mayors in England">
<text>In England, the offices of mayor and lord mayor have long been ceremonial posts, with few or no duties attached to them. In recent years they have doubled as more influential political roles while retaining the ceremonial functions. A mayor&#x27;s term of office denotes the municipal year.

Traditionally mayors and provosts have been elected by town, borough and city councils. Since 2000, several districts now have directly elected mayors with extensive powers. The role of the chair of a district council is exactly the same as the mayor of a borough council; they have the same status as first citizen, after the Sovereign, in their district, but they are not addressed as mayor.

==Election==
In England, where a borough or a city is a local government district or a civil parish, the mayor is elected annually by the council from their number and chairs meetings of the council with a casting vote. Where the mayoralty used to be associated with a local government district but that district has been abolished, charter trustees may be set up to provide continuity until a parish council may be set up. Where a parish council (whether the successor of a former borough or not) has resolved to style itself a town council, then its chair is entitled to the designation of town mayor, though in practice, the word &quot;town&quot; is often dropped.

==Lord mayors==

The right to appoint a lord mayor is a rare honour, even less frequently bestowed than city status.

Currently, 23 cities in England have lord mayors:
* Birmingham
* Bradford
* Bristol
* Canterbury
* Chester
* Coventry
* Exeter
* Kingston upon Hull
* Leeds
* Leicester
* Liverpool
* London
* Manchester
* Newcastle upon Tyne
* Norwich
* Nottingham
* Oxford
* Plymouth
* Portsmouth
* Sheffield
* Stoke-on-Trent
* City of Westminster
* York

In May 2022, Southampton was added to the list.

==Honorifics==
The Lord Mayors of London and York are styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. All other Lord Mayors, as well as the Mayors of cities and the original Cinque Ports (Sandwich, Hythe, Dover, Romney and Hastings), are styled &quot;The Right Worshipful&quot;. (Bristol styles its lord mayor &quot;Right Honourable&quot; instead, but this usage is without official sanction.) All other Mayors are styled &quot;The Worshipful&quot;, though this is in practice seldom used for a Town Mayor. These honorific styles are used only before the Mayoral title and not before the name, and are not retained after the term of office.

A mayor can also be styled Mr Mayor and usually appoints a consort, usually a spouse, other family member or fellow councillor. In England (and the Commonwealth) the designated female consort of a mayor is usually styled Mayoress or occasionally Mrs Mayor and accompanies the mayor to civic functions. A female mayor is also called mayor, not, as sometimes erroneously called, &quot;Lady Mayoress&quot;. A mayoress or Lady Mayoress is a female consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor; a male consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor is a Mayor&#x27;s Consort or Lord Mayor&#x27;s Consort.

<doc id="598896" wikidata="Q5211943" url="?curid=598896" title="Daman and Diu Portuguese Creole">
<text>The Daman and Diu Portuguese Creole, &amp; by its speakers as  meaning &quot;home language&quot;, refers to the variety of Indo-Portuguese creole spoken in the Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (Damaon territory), in the northern Konkan region of India. Before the Indian annexation of the territory, the creole spoken by the Damanese natives underwent a profound decreolisation in the erstwhile Portuguese Goa and Damaon colony, a phenomenon whereby the Indo-Portuguese creole reconverged with European Portuguese.

==Daman Indo-Portuguese==
The Daman creole is a descendant of the Norteiro creole, spoken originally by the &quot;Norteiros&quot; on the coast from Chaul, Vasai (Bassein), Bombay, to Damaon.

The superstrate language is Portuguese. The substrate of the Daman creole is likely to be Konkani. Gujarati has also been suggested as a possible substrate, but this is doubtful since the Gujarati people moved into the area only &quot;after&quot; the Portuguese arrived.

==Diu Indo-Portuguese==
The Diu Indo-Portuguese or Diu Portuguese is spoken in Diu district, India. It is a creole language based mainly on Portuguese and Gujarati. It is a member of the larger family of Indo-Portuguese creoles, particularly close to the variety of Daman. There is a considerably vital oral tradition in this language, with songs regularly performed in Diu, elsewhere in India and among Indo-Portuguese communities abroad.

Widely spoken in the past, it was first documented in the 19th century by the initiative of Hugo Schuchardt. At present, the language is spoken natively by most of the local Catholics, numbering about 180, but is potentially endangered by the pressure of other languages such as Gujarati, English and standard Portuguese.

==Number of speakers==
The Portuguese heritage in Daman is more common and lively than in Goa and this helped to keep the language alive. The language is spoken by an estimated number of 2,000 Damanese.

Besides the , Gujarati, Portuguese &amp; Konkani are also found in the territory.

Forrester graduated from West Point in June 1979 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He entered the U.S. Army Aviation School in 1979 and was designated an Army Aviator in September 1980. He was subsequently assigned as an instructor pilot at the Aviation School, and as the aide-de-camp to the Deputy Commanding General of the U.S. Army Aviation Center. In 1984, he was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division (Light), Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, where he served as a platoon leader, aviation company operations officer, and an assault helicopter battalion operations officer. After completing a master of science degree at the University of Virginia in 1989, he was assigned as a flight test engineer and as the research and development coordinator with the Army Aviation Engineering Flight Activity at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In June 1992, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and was designated an experimental test pilot. In 1992, he was assigned as an engineering test pilot at the U.S. Army Aviation Technical Test Center, Fort Rucker, Alabama. Other military schools include the Army Parachutist Course, U.S. Army Ranger School, the Combined Arms Services Staff School, and the Command and General Staff College.

A Master Army Aviator, Forrester has logged over 5,500 hours in over 50 different aircraft.

Forrester retired from the Army in October 2005.

== NASA career ==
Forrester was assigned to NASA at the Johnson Space Center as an aerospace engineer in July 1993. His technical assignments within the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch have included: flight software testing with the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); Astronaut Office representative for Landing/Rollout issues, Multi-function Electronic Display System (MEDS) upgrade of the Orbiter fleet, and the Portable In-flight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). He has also served as the crew representative for robotics development for the International Space Station.

Forrester was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially, Forrester was assigned to duties at the Kennedy Space Center as a member of the astronaut support team, responsible for Shuttle prelaunch vehicle checkout, crew ingress and strap-in, and crew egress after landing. He next served as the technical assistant to the Director, Flight Crew Operations. Following that, Forrester served as the Shuttle training and on-board crew procedures representative. Forrester flew on STS-105 in 2001, with the crew of STS-117 in 2007, and as a mission specialist on the STS-128 mission in 2009. He has logged over 950 hours in space, including four spacewalks totaling 25 hours and 22 minutes of EVA time.

===Chief of the Astronaut Office===
He was announced as Chief of the Astronaut Office on June 2, 2017. He is the first Army officer to hold this position. He replaced Chris Cassidy who returned to normal flight status. He served in this position until December 20, 2020, when Gregory R. Wiseman was selected.

=== Spaceflight experience ===
===STS-105===
&quot;Discovery&quot; (August 10–22, 2001) was the 11th mission to the International Space Station (ISS). While at the orbital outpost, the STS-105 crew delivered the Expedition 3 crew, attached the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), and transferred over 2.7 metric tons of supplies and equipment to the station. During the mission, Forrester and Dan Barry performed two spacewalks totaling 11 hours and 45 minutes of EVA time. Forrester served as the prime robotics operator to install the MPLM. STS-105 also brought home the Expedition 2 crew. The STS-105 mission was accomplished in 186 orbits of the Earth, traveling over 4.9 million miles in 285 hours and 13 minutes.

===STS-117===

&quot;Atlantis&quot; (June 8–22, 2007) was the 118th Shuttle mission and the 21st mission to visit the ISS, delivering the second starboard truss segment, the third set of U.S. solar arrays and batteries and associated equipment. The successful construction and repair mission involved four spacewalks by two teams. Forrester accumulated 13 hours and 37 minutes of EVA time in two spacewalks. The mission also delivered crewmember Clayton Anderson, and returned with Sunita Williams from the Expedition 15 crew. STS-117 returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California, having traveled 5.8 million miles in 14 days.

===STS-128===
&quot;Discovery&quot; (August 28-September 11, 2009) was the 128th Shuttle mission and the 30th mission to the ISS. While at the orbital outpost, the STS-128 crew rotated Nicole Stott for crewmember Timothy Kopra on Expedition 20, attached the Leonardo MPLM and transferred more than 18,000 pounds of supplies and equipment to the ISS. The STS-128 crew conducted three spacewalks. Forrester served as the prime robotics operator for &quot;Discovery&quot;. The STS-128 mission was accomplished in 217 orbits of the Earth, traveling more than 5.7 million miles in 332 hours and 53 minutes and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

<doc id="598907" wikidata="Q4216105" url="?curid=598907" title="William Carstares">
<text>William Carstares (also Carstaires; 11 February 164928 December 1715) was a Scottish minister who was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1705, 1708, 1711 and 1715. He was active in Whig politics and was Principal of the University of Edinburgh from 1703 to 1715.

==Early life==
Carstares was born at Cathcart, near Glasgow, Scotland, the son of the Rev. John Carstares, a Covenanter. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and then at the University of Utrecht. In the Netherlands he had an introduction to Gaspar Fagel. Through Fagel he met the Prince of Orange, the future King William III of England and II of Scotland, and began to take an active part in politics.

During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Carstares acted as an intelligence agent for the Prince of Orange, making journeys to England as &quot;William Williams&quot;. He corresponded with Pierre du Moulin (died 1676), who ran the Prince&#x27;s espionage. He was suspected by the English, and arrested by warrant in September 1674 on English soil.

==1675 to 1684==
Carstares was then committed to the Tower of London; the following year, 1675, he was transferred to Edinburgh Castle. He was believed to be concerned with Sir James Stewart in the authorship of a pamphlet &quot;An Account of Scotland&#x27;s Grievances by reason of the D. of Lauderdale&#x27;s Ministrie, humbly tendered to his Sacred Majesty&quot; (1674). John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale himself got Carstares to admit he had been involved in printing the pamphlet. Lauderdale used the threat of the torture of the boot, which could be employed legally in Scotland; but Carstares was not tortured. In August 1679 he was released, one of the government sops to Scottish opinion after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. He cannot, therefore, have been the William Carstares who was the chief prosecution witness at the trial of William Staley (the first of the Popish Plot trials) in November 1678, although that Carstares was also a Scotsman, and like his namesake is said to have acted as an intelligence agent.

After this, Carstares visited Ireland, joined nonconformist circles in London, and then in 1681 became pastor to a congregation at Theobalds, near Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. The aftermath of the Exclusion Crisis saw him directly involved in conspiracy with the Whig faction. Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll in the Netherlands was in touch with Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Carstares provided liaison, while his brother-in-law William Dunlop was able to use his colonial project in the Province of Carolina as cover for Shaftesbury&#x27;s preparations for rebellion.

During 1682 Carstares was in the Netherlands, but the following year he was again in London. He was implicated in the Rye House Plot, and arrested in July 1683 at Tenterden, Kent, using an assumed name. He denied knowing any of the plot, though he had heard assassination rumours from Robert Ferguson. He was again threatened with torture in London, this time by Sir George Mackenzie. Once more he was transferred to Edinburgh.

In July 1684 the Privy Council of Scotland tortured William Spence, Argyll&#x27;s agent, and Carstares was implicated. Carstares himself, who had seen poor health in his detention, was tortured in September, with the thumbikins, and then the boot, clumsily applied. The next day John Drummond, Secretary of State in Scotland, made a deal with Carstares that his answers would not be used in court, and had a doctor see him. Carstares then replied to the questions of the council. He signed a statement, managing to conceal the covert links to Dutch supporters, and the government published it. Later that month he was moved to Stirling Castle.

In the trial of Baillie of Jerviswood, Mackenzie as Lord Advocate found a way to use the statement by Carstares to secure a conviction; Baillie was hanged, drawn and quartered in December 1684. Carstares was freed, and went to London, and then to The Hague shortly before the Monmouth Rebellion, as an adviser to the Prince of Orange.

==Under William III==
Carstares was court chaplain to William as Prince of Orange, and at the time of the Williamite Revolution, sailed with the Prince to Torbay. He continued as royal chaplain for Scotland, once William was king of Great Britain. He was the confidential adviser of the king, especially with regard to Scottish affairs. He advocated that a Presbyterian polity should replace the Scottish bishops, and the immediate events of the Williamite conflicts bore out his opinion in practical terms. His subsequent influence on matters concerning the Kirk, as a courtier, earned him the nickname &quot;Cardinal Carstares&quot;. He also manipulated the Parliament of Scotland, helped by being able to read James Johnston&#x27;s mail. He was Queenberry&#x27;s man at court in 1700.

==Later life==
On the accession of Queen Anne, Carstares retained his post as Royal Chaplain in Scotland, residing in Edinburgh, having also been elected Principal of the University of Edinburgh in 1703. He remained Principal until his death in 1715. He was a reforming administrator, introducing the Dutch professorial system of teaching. From 1704 he was also &quot;second charge&quot; minister of Old Greyfriars under Rev James Hart in Edinburgh, and from 1706 was second charge of St Giles&#x27; under Rev George Hamilton.

He was four times chosen Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1705, 1708, 1711 and 1715.

He took an important part in promoting the Union, and was consulted by Harley and other leading Englishmen concerning it. During Anne&#x27;s reign, the chief object of his policy was to frustrate the measures which were planned by Lord Oxford to strengthen the Episcopalian Jacobites, especially a bill for extending the privileges of the Episcopalians and the bill for replacing in the hands of the old patrons the right of patronage, which by the Revolution Settlement had been vested in the elders and the Protestant heritors.

On the accession of George I, Carstares was appointed, with five others, to welcome the new dynasty in the name of the Church of Scotland. He was received graciously, and the office of royal chaplain was again conferred upon him. A few months after he was struck with apoplexy, and died on 28 December 1715.

He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The grave lies amongst the large monuments on the outer walls of the original churchyard, towards the southwest, slightly northwest of the Adam mausoleum.

==Family==
On 6 June 1682 Carstares married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Kekewich of Trehawk in Cornwall, who died in 1724. They had no children.

He was uncle by marriage to William Dunlop (1692–1720).

<text>Dirk Dries David Damiaan, Viscount Frimout (born 21 March 1941 in Poperinge, Belgium) is an astrophysicist for the European Space Agency. He flew aboard NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-45 as a payload specialist, making him the first Belgian in space.

==Education==
Elementary School at Poperinge. Secondary School at Koninklijk Technisch Atheneum (K.T.A) at Ghent, Belgium. Received an Engineer&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering at University of Ghent in 1963; a PhD in applied physics from University of Ghent in 1970; post-doctorate at University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (ESRO fellow) in 1971–1972.

==Career==
*1965-1978 Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy. As Head of Section Instrumentation, performed experiments with stratospheric balloons and sounding rockets.
*1978-1984 European Space Agency (ESA) as Crew Activities Coordinator and Experiment Coordinator for Spacelab-1.
*1984-1989 Microgravity Division of ESTEC, responsible for sounding rocket program, parabolic flights, experiments on EURECA, reflight of Spacelab-1 experiments.

Frimout flew as a payload specialist on STS-45 Atlantis (24 March to 2 April 1992). STS-45 was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth. During the nine-day flight, the crew aboard Atlantis operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties, which contributed significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate a man-made auroral discharge. At mission conclusion, Frimout had traveled 3.2 million miles in 143 Earth orbits and logged over 214 hours in space.

His flight made him instantaneously very famous in Belgium and triggered what was called &quot;Frimout-mania&quot;. Prince Philippe of Belgium talked with him when he was in space and a ticker tape parade was organized when he came back to Belgium.

Currently, Frimout is an ESA staff member. He is a senior engineer in the Payload Utilization Department of the Columbus Directorate, responsible for the ESA support to the European experiments on ATLAS-1, and the Microgravity Measurement Assembly to be flown on D2. 

He has authored more than 30 publications relating to Atmospheric Physics Experiments, Crew Training for Spacelab, and Microgravity Experiments.

==Personal==
He is married and has two children. Hobbies include running, cycling, walking, traveling, and chess.

==Awards and honors==
*1971–72 Postdoctoral Research Fellow from ESRO (European Space Research Organization).
*After his spaceflight, Frimout was ennobled and given the title of viscount in the Belgian nobility.

==Organizations==
*Fellow of the Royal Academy for Science and the Arts of Belgium, Class of Technical Sciences, since 2009.
*Associate member of the Belgian National Council for Space Research.
*Member of K VIV (Royal Association of Flemish Engineers).
*Association of Engineers from the University of Ghent.

<text>In computer programming, run-time type information or run-time type identification (RTTI) is a feature of some programming languages (such as C++, Object Pascal, and Ada) that exposes information about an object&#x27;s data type at runtime. Run-time type information may be available for all types or only to types that explicitly have it (as is the case with Ada). Run-time type information is a specialization of a more general concept called type introspection.

In the original C++ design, Bjarne Stroustrup did not include run-time type information, because he thought this mechanism was often misused.

==Overview==
In C++, RTTI can be used to do safe typecasts using the codice_1 operator, and to manipulate type information at runtime using the codice_2 operator and codice_3 class. In Object Pascal, RTTI can be used to perform safe type casts with the codice_4 operator, test the class to which an object belongs with the codice_5 operator, and manipulate type information at run time with classes contained in the codice_6 unit (i.e. classes: &quot;TRttiContext&quot;, &quot;TRttiInstanceType&quot;, etc.). In Ada, objects of tagged types also store a type tag, which permits the identification of the type of these object at runtime. The codice_7 operator can be used to test, at runtime, if an object is of a specific type and may be safely converted to it.

RTTI is available only for classes that are polymorphic, which means they have at least one virtual method. In practice, this is not a limitation because base classes must have a virtual destructor to allow objects of derived classes to perform proper cleanup if they are deleted from a base pointer.

Some compilers have flags to disable RTTI. Using these flags may reduce the overall size of the application, making them especially useful when targeting systems with a limited amount of memory.

== C++ – &quot;typeid&quot; ==
The codice_2 reserved word (keyword) is used to determine the class of an object at runtime. It returns a reference to codice_3 object, which exists until the end of the program. The use of codice_2, in a non-polymorphic context, is often preferred over codice_11 in situations where just the class information is needed, because codice_2 is always a constant-time procedure, whereas codice_13 may need to traverse the class derivation lattice of its argument at runtime. Some aspects of the returned object are implementation-defined, such as codice_14, and cannot be relied on across compilers to be consistent.

Objects of class codice_15 are thrown when the expression for codice_2 is the result of applying the unary * operator on a null pointer. Whether an exception is thrown for other null reference arguments is implementation-dependent. In other words, for the exception to be guaranteed, the expression must take the form codice_17 where codice_18 is any expression resulting in a null pointer.

===Example===

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

class Person {
public:
 virtual ~Person() = default;

class Employee : public Person {};

int main() {
 Person person;
 Employee employee;
 Person* ptr = &amp;employee;
 Person&amp; ref = employee;
 // The string returned by typeid::name is implementation-defined.
 std::cout « typeid(person).name()
 « std::endl; // Person (statically known at compile-time).
 std::cout « typeid(employee).name()
 « std::endl; // Employee (statically known at compile-time).
 std::cout « typeid(ptr).name()
 « std::endl; // Person* (statically known at compile-time).
 std::cout « typeid(*ptr).name()
 « std::endl; // Employee (looked up dynamically at run-time
 // because it is the dereference of a
 // pointer to a polymorphic class).
 std::cout « typeid(ref).name()
 « std::endl; // Employee (references can also be polymorphic)

 Person* p = nullptr;
 try {
 typeid(*p); // Not undefined behavior; throws std::bad_typeid.
 } catch (...) { }

 Person&amp; p_ref = *p; // Undefined behavior: dereferencing null
 typeid(p_ref); // does not meet requirements to throw std::bad_typeid
 // because the expression for typeid is not the result
 // of applying the unary * operator.

Output (exact output varies by system and compiler):

 Person
 Employee
 Person*
 Employee
 Employee

== C++ – &quot;dynamic_cast&quot; and Java cast ==
The codice_19 operator in C++ is used for downcasting a reference or pointer to a more specific type in the class hierarchy. Unlike the codice_20, the target of the codice_19 must be a pointer or reference to class. Unlike codice_20 and C-style typecast (where type check occurs while compiling), a type safety check is performed at runtime. If the types are not compatible, an exception will be thrown (when dealing with references) or a null pointer will be returned (when dealing with pointers).

A Java typecast behaves similarly; if the object being cast is not actually an instance of the target type, and cannot be converted to one by a language-defined method, an instance of codice_23 will be thrown.

===Example===
Suppose some function takes an object of type codice_24 as its argument, and wishes to perform some additional operation if the object passed is an instance of codice_25, a subclass of codice_24. This can be done using codice_19 as follows.
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

using namespace std;

class A {
public:
 // Since RTTI is included in the virtual method table there should be at
 // least one virtual function.
 virtual ~A() = default;

 void MethodSpecificToA() {
 cout « &quot;Method specific for A was invoked&quot; « endl;
};

class B: public A {
public:
 void MethodSpecificToB() {
 cout « &quot;Method specific for B was invoked&quot; « endl;
};

void MyFunction(A&amp; my_a) {
 try {
 // Cast will be successful only for B type objects.
 B&amp; my_b = dynamic_cast&lt;B&amp;&gt;(my_a);
 my_b.MethodSpecificToB();
 } catch (const bad_cast&amp; e) {
 cerr « &quot; Exception &quot; « e.what() « &quot; thrown.&quot; « endl;
 cerr « &quot; Object is not of type B&quot; « endl;
}

int main() {
 array&lt;unique_ptr&lt;A&gt;, 3&gt; array_of_a; // Array of pointers to base class A.
 array_of_a[0] = make_unique&lt;B&gt;(); // Pointer to B object.
 array_of_a[1] = make_unique&lt;B&gt;(); // Pointer to B object.
 array_of_a[2] = make_unique&lt;A&gt;(); // Pointer to A object.

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
 MyFunction(*array_of_a[i]);


Console output:
 Method specific for B was invoked
 Method specific for B was invoked
 Exception std::bad_cast thrown.
 Object is not of type B

A similar version of codice_28 can be written with pointers instead of references:
void MyFunction(A* my_a) {
 B* my_b = dynamic_cast&lt;B*&gt;(my_a);

 if (my_b != nullptr)
 my_b-&gt;methodSpecificToB();
 else
 std::cerr « &quot; Object is not B type&quot; « std::endl;


== Object Pascal, Delphi ==
In Object Pascal and Delphi, the operator codice_5 is used to check the type of a class at runtime. It tests the belonging of an object to a given class, including classes of individual ancestors present in the inheritance hierarchy tree (e.g. &quot;Button1&quot; is a &quot;TButton&quot; class that has ancestors: &quot;TWinControl&quot; → &quot;TControl&quot; → &quot;TComponent&quot; → &quot;TPersistent&quot; → &quot;TObject&quot;, where the latter is the ancestor of all classes). The operator codice_4 is used when an object needs to be treated at run time as if it belonged to an ancestor class.

The RTTI unit is used to manipulate object type information at run time. This unit contains a set of classes that allow you to: get information about an object&#x27;s class and its ancestors, properties, methods and events, change property values and call methods. The following example shows the use of the RTTI module to obtain information about the class to which an object belongs, creating it, and to call its method. The example assumes that the TSubject class has been declared in a unit named SubjectUnit.
uses
 RTTI, SubjectUnit;

procedure WithoutReflection;
var
 MySubject: TSubject;
begin
 MySubject := TSubject.Create;
 try
 Subject.Hello;
 finally
 Subject.Free;
 end;
end;

procedure WithReflection;
var
 RttiContext: TRttiContext;
 RttiType: TRttiInstanceType;
 Subject: TObject;
begin
 RttiType := RttiContext.FindType(&#x27;SubjectUnit.TSubject&#x27;) as TRttiInstanceType;
 Subject := RttiType.GetMethod(&#x27;Create&#x27;).Invoke(RttiType.MetaclassType, []).AsObject;
 try
 RttiType.GetMethod(&#x27;Hello&#x27;).Invoke(Subject, []);
 finally
 Subject.Free;
 end;
end;

<text>Francis Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Gaffney is an American doctor and former astronaut. He previously worked for NASA and participated in the STS-40 Space Life Sciences (SLS 1) Space Shuttle mission in 1991 as a payload specialist.

Gaffney was a co-investigator on an experiment that studied human cardiovascular adaption to space flight. The SLS-1 mission crew completed over 18 experiments in nine days, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight.

Dr. Gaffney became a member of the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Space Biology and Medicine, serving from 1992 to 2000. He is a professor of medicine (cardiovascular disease) at Vanderbilt University and continues to serve as a consultant and reviewer for human spaceflight-related studies.

He is currently a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University. Gaffney has over 50 publications in the areas of cardiovascular regulation and space physiology.

==Biography==
Gaffney was born June 9, 1946, in Carlsbad, New Mexico. He is married to Elizabeth (Lili) Burgo Sims of Berkeley, California. He has two daughters.

Gaffney graduated from Carlsbad, New Mexico High School in 1964; received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968; and a Doctor of Medicine degree, University of New Mexico in 1972.

A Colonel in the Texas Air National Guard, Gaffney served as a Flight Surgeon for the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group at Ellington Air National Guard Base, Houston, Texas.

Gaffney served as a Visiting Senior Scientist with the Life Sciences Division at NASA Headquarters from January 1987 through June 1989. He worked with the Operational Medicine group and was Associate Manager of Biomedical Research as well as Program Scientist for the D-2 Spacelab mission and the Research Animal Holding Facility. He was a member of several working groups and implementation teams planning collaborative research with German, French and Soviet government scientists. He also served on a number of Space Station Freedom and advanced mission planning groups including the &quot;Humans to Mars&quot; study group.

Gaffney&#x27;s 15 years of experience in cardiac research and operation of equipment such as echocardiograms and rebreathing devices led to his being selected as a payload specialist aboard STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), a mission which took place in June 1991. STS-40 was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. The SLS-1 mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments in nine days, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 20 seconds.

<text>Charles Donald &quot;Sam&quot; Gemar (born August 4, 1955) is an American former astronaut with NASA and a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. Gemar has flown on three Space Shuttle missions (STS-38, STS-48 and STS-62). Gemar has completed 385 orbits of the Earth and over 581 hours in space. He has also served in different positions in NASA, including as a CAPCOM for Shuttle missions. Gemar was the first astronaut to be born in the state of South Dakota.

==Experience==
Born August 4, 1955, in Yankton, South Dakota, Gemar enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1973 and reported for duty on June 11, 1973, following graduation from Scotland Public High School, Scotland, South Dakota. In November 1973, he was assigned to the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and later a Department of the Army appointment to join the United States Military Academy Class of 1979.

After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, he attended the Infantry Officers Basic Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, the Initial Entry Rotary Wing Aviation Course and the Fixed Wing Multi-Engine Aviators Course, both at Fort Rucker, Alabama. In October 1980, he transferred to the 24th Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia, where he remained until January 1, 1985. While at Fort Stewart/Hunter Army Airfield, he served as an assistant flight operations officer and flight platoon leader for the 24th Combat Aviation Battalion, commander of Wright Army Airfield, and chief of Operations Branch, for Hunter Army Airfield.

Other military schools completed include the Army Parachutist Course, Ranger School, and the Aviation Officers Advanced Course.

His hobbies include: water sports, jogging, woodworking, traveling.

==NASA experience==
Selected by NASA in June 1985, Gemar completed a one-year training and evaluation program and became an astronaut in July 1986. He is qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Since then he has held a variety of technical assignments in support of the Space Shuttle Program, including flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control during Space Shuttle missions; Chief of Astronaut Appearances. Gemar has flown three times and has logged over 580 hours in space. He flew on STS-38 (November 15–20, 1990), STS-48 (September 12–18, 1991), and STS-62 (March 4–18, 1994).

On his first mission, Gemar served on the five-man crew of STS-38 which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five-day mission crew members conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, in the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985, Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; and her crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990.

Gemar then served on the five-man crew of STS-48 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1991. During 81 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), designed to study the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere on a global scale thus providing scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere&#x27;s chemistry, winds and energy inputs, in addition to conducting numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. This five-day mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 18, 1991. Mission duration was 128 hours.

Gemar&#x27;s most recent mission was STS-62 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 4, 1994. This microgravity science and technology demonstration mission carried the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2) payloads. Sixty experiments or investigations were conducted in many scientific and engineering disciplines including: materials science, human physiology, biotechnology, protein crystal growth, robotics, structural dynamics, atmospheric ozone monitoring and spacecraft glow. During the spacecraft glow investigation, &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s orbital altitude was lowered to , the lowest ever flown by a Space Shuttle. STS-62, the second longest Space Shuttle mission to date, concluded after 13 days, 23 hours, and 16 minutes, following 224 orbits of the Earth with a landing at the Kennedy Space Center on March 18, 1994, after traveling 5.8 million miles.

<doc id="598935" wikidata="Q1063587" url="?curid=598935" title="The Stars My Destination">
<text>The Stars My Destination is a science fiction novel by American writer Alfred Bester. Its first publication was in book form in June 1956 in the United Kingdom, where it was titled Tiger! Tiger!, named after William Blake&#x27;s 1794 poem &quot;The Tyger&quot;, the first verse of which is printed as the first page of the novel. The book remains widely known under that title in the markets in which this edition was circulated. It was subsequently serialized in the American &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; magazine in four parts, beginning in October 1956. A working title was &quot;Hell&#x27;s My Destination&quot;; the book was also associated with the name &quot;The Burning Spear&quot;. It would prove to be Bester&#x27;s last novel for 19 years.

The novel was both widely criticized and praised when it first appeared, but now is appreciated as a classic work in its own right, and as a prescient forerunner of the cyberpunk literary genre.

==Premise==
In the 24th or 25th century (depending on the edition of the book), humans have colonized the Solar System and also learned to teleport (although not through outer space). It tells the story of Gulliver (&quot;Gully&quot;) Foyle, driven by and transformed by, a thirst for vengeance.

==Plot==

At the time when the book is set, &quot;jaunting&quot;—personal teleportation—has so upset the social and economic balance that the Inner Planets are at war with the Outer Satellites. Gully Foyle of the Presteign-owned merchant spaceship &quot;Nomad&quot;—an uneducated, unskilled, unambitious man whose life is at a dead end—is marooned in space when the ship is attacked. After six months of waiting, a passing spaceship, the &quot;Vorga&quot;, also owned by the powerful Presteign industrial clan, ignores his signal and abandons him. Foyle is enraged and is transformed into a man consumed by revenge, the first of many transformations.

Foyle repairs the ship and barely survives but is found and adopted by a cargo cult in the Asteroid Belt who tattoo a hideous mask of a tiger on his face. He recovers his health, escapes and is returned to Terra. His attempt to blow up the &quot;Vorga&quot; fails, and he is captured by Presteign. Unknown to Foyle, the &quot;Nomad&quot; was carrying &quot;PyrE&quot;, a new material which could make the difference between victory and defeat in the war. Presteign hires security agent Saul Dagenham to interrogate Foyle, to find the ship and PyrE.

Protected by his revenge fixation, Foyle cannot be broken and he is put into a -proof prison. There he meets Jisbella McQueen, who teaches him to think clearly and tells him he should find out who gave the order not to rescue him. Together they escape and get his tattoos removed—but not with total success: the subcutaneous scars become visible again whenever Foyle becomes too emotional. The pair travel to the &quot;Nomad&quot;, where they salvage not only PyrE, but also a fortune in platinum metal. Jisbella is captured by Dagenham, but Foyle escapes.

Some time later, Foyle re-emerges as &quot;Geoffrey Fourmyle&quot;, a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; dandy. Foyle has rigorously educated himself and had his body altered to become a killing machine. Through yoga, he has achieved the emotional self-control necessary to prevent his tattooed stigmata from showing. He seeks out Robin Wednesbury, a one-way telepath, whom he had raped earlier in the novel, and persuades her to help him charm his way through high society. Foyle tracks down the crew of the &quot;Vorga&quot; to learn the identity of the ship&#x27;s captain but each person he finds has been implanted with a death-reflex and dies when questioned. Each time, Foyle is tormented by the reappearance of &quot;The Burning Man&quot;, a vision of him on fire.

At a society party, Foyle is smitten with Presteign&#x27;s daughter Olivia. He also meets Jisbella again—now Dagenham&#x27;s lover—who chooses not to reveal Foyle&#x27;s identity, although Dagenham has realized it (Foyle&#x27;s alias was implanted in his subconscious mind during Dagenham&#x27;s interrogation). During a nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites, Foyle goes to Olivia to save her. She tells him that to have her, he must be as cruel and ruthless as she is. Robin, traumatized by the attacks, tries to buy her way out of her arrangement with Foyle by revealing the name of another &quot;Vorga&quot; crew member. Foyle agrees, but reneges, Robin goes to Central Intelligence to betray him.

Foyle learns that the captain of the &quot;Vorga&quot; has joined a cult on Mars and has had all her sensory nerves disabled, making her immune to conventional torture. Foyle kidnaps a telepath to interrogate the captain and learns that the ship did not rescue him because it was picking up refugees, taking their belongings and ejecting them into space. He also learns that the captain was Olivia Presteign. Now she rescues him from Martian commandos, as she sees in Foyle someone who can match her hatred and need to destroy.

Driven by a guilty conscience, Foyle tries to give himself up to Presteign&#x27;s lawyer, Regis Sheffield, who is known as a Terran patriot. Sheffield turns out to be a spy for the Outer Satellites and he captures Foyle. Sheffield tells Foyle that when the &quot;Nomad&quot; was attacked, Foyle was taken off the ship, transported 600,000 miles and set adrift in a spacesuit to be a decoy to attract ships to be ambushed. Instead, Foyle had space-jaunted—teleporting a cosmic distance, very much further than had been previously believed possible—back to the &quot;Nomad&quot;. Now, the Outer Satellites not only want PyrE, they want Foyle to learn the secret of space-jaunting.

Presteign reveals that PyrE is activated by telepathy and Robin is enlisted to trigger it to flush out Foyle. Bits of PyrE left exposed by Foyle&#x27;s tests to determine its purpose cause destruction worldwide but primarily at Foyle&#x27;s abandoned encampment in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, where Sheffield has brought him. The church partially collapses, killing Sheffield and trapping Foyle, unconscious but alive, over a pit of flame. Suffering from synesthesia brought on by the explosion affecting his neurological implants, Foyle through space and time as &quot;The Burning Man&quot;. Finally he lands in the future, where Robin telepathically tells him how to escape from the collapsing cathedral.

Back in the present, Foyle is pressured by Presteign, Y&#x27;ang-Yeovil, and Dagenham to surrender the rest of his cache of PyrE, which had been protected from exploding by its Inert Lead Isotope container, and to teach mankind how to space-. He leads them to where the rest of the PyrE is hidden but makes off with it and across the globe, throwing slugs of PyrE into the crowd at each stop. He asks humanity to choose: either destroy itself or follow him into space. Foyle realizes the key to space-jaunting is faith, not the certainty of an answer but the conviction that somewhere an answer exists. He from one nearby star to another, finding new worlds suitable for colonization, but reachable only if he shares the secret of space-jaunting. He comes to rest back with the cargo cult, where the people see him as a holy man and await his revelation.

==The novel==
===Composition===
The novel was outlined by Bester while he was living in Britain, and actually written mainly when he was living in Rome. The project had its origins in a newspaper clipping (or possibly a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article) that Bester read about Poon Lim, a shipwrecked World War II sailor on a raft, stranded in the South Atlantic. He had drifted un-rescued in the Atlantic for a world record 133 days, because passing ships thought he was a lure to bring them within torpedo range of a hidden submarine. From there grew the story of the antihero Gully Foyle, seeking revenge for his abandonment and causing havoc all about him: a future-set retelling of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

Like Edmond Dantès in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Foyle is thrown into prison, in this case the supposedly -proof Gouffre Martel located in caverns. He establishes a clandestine connection to another prisoner, Jisbella McQueen, and through her he is educated to the point where he can conceive a plan to escape and exact his revenge. Escaping with her and locating the wreck of the &quot;Nomad&quot;, he uses its treasure, as Dantès did, to reinvent himself as Geoffrey Fourmyle.

Bester once wrote that he used playful narration at one point to grab the reader&#x27;s attention.

===Publication and reception===
First published in book form in the UK in June 1956 as &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot;, &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; was subsequently serialized in &quot;Galaxy&quot;, where &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; had also appeared. It ran in four parts (October 1956 through January 1957), then was published in the US later in 1957.

The novel has often featured in lists of the best science fiction novels of all time.

===Influence on cyberpunk===
The novel has been described as proto-cyberpunk, predating the literary movement by over two decades. Specifically, the novel features megacorporations as powerful as governments, a dark overall vision of the future, and the cybernetic enhancement of the body.

==Allusions==
The name of Charles Fort Jaunte, who discovers teleportation, derives from Charles Fort, a writer principally of nonfiction, who coined the term &quot;teleportation&quot;.

The title &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; appears in a quatrain quoted by Foyle twice during the book. The first time, while he is trapped in outer space, he states:
:&quot;Gully Foyle is my name&quot;
:&quot;And Terra is my nation&quot;.
:&quot;Deep space is my dwelling place&quot;,
:&quot;And death&#x27;s my destination&quot;.

Toward the end of the novel, after he has returned to human life and become something of a hero, he states:
:&quot;Gully Foyle is my name&quot;
:&quot;And Terra is my nation&quot;.
:&quot;Deep space is my dwelling place&quot;,
:&quot;The stars my destination&quot;.

Both quatrains are based on a poetic form that was popular in England and the United States during the 18th-to-mid-20th centuries, in which a person stated their name, country, city or town, and a religious homily (often, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s my destination&quot;) within the rhyming four-line structure (see book rhyme). This literary device had been previously used by James Joyce in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and M.R. James in &quot;A Warning to the Curious&quot;.

Bester may have come across his title expression in the writings of John Whiteside Parsons, one of the fathers of modern rocketry, who was also a science fiction fan and occultist. In 1943, Parsons wrote: &quot;Rocketry may not be my True Will, but it&#x27;s one hell of a powerful drive. With Thelema as my goal and the stars my destination and my home, I have set my eyes on high&quot;.

Bester&#x27;s initial work on the book began in England, and he took the names for his characters from a UK telephone directory. As a result, many of the characters are named after British or Irish towns or other features: Gulliver Foyle (and his pseudonym, Fourmyle of Ceres), Robin Wednesbury, the Presteign clan, Regis Sheffield, Y&#x27;ang-Yeovil, Saul Dagenham, Sam Quatt, Rodger Kempsey, the Bo&#x27;ness and Uig ship underwriters.

==Characters==
* Gulliver (&quot;Gully&quot;) Foyle: Last remaining survivor of the merchant spaceship &quot;Nomad&quot;. Captured by the &quot;Scientific People&quot; on an asteroid, only his face is tattooed according to their customs. The tattoos are later painfully removed, but the scarred patterns left under his skin become visible whenever his emotions flare out of control.
* Presteign: Head of the wealthy Presteign clan, whose interests include a chain of luxury department stores, each managed by an identical &quot;Mr. Presto&quot;. Wealthy people like Presteign demonstrate their status by using outmoded methods of transportation and never jaunting if they can avoid it. Presteign holds court in his Star Chamber, an elaborate, old-fashioned office equipped with a bar and staffed by robots. It is designed to disorient visitors and give him the psychological edge.
* Robin Wednesbury: A Black woman, a Telesend, a one-way telepath who can send thoughts but not receive them. Foyle meets her in &quot; rehab&quot; while pretending to be someone who has lost the ability to . She discovers his deception, but he kidnaps her and rapes her to intimidate her into silence. Later, as Fourmyle, he recruits her to help him navigate the upper echelons of society. After she discovers who he really is, he offers her the prospect of finding her family, who were refugees aboard the &quot;Vorga&quot;.
* Jisbella (&quot;Jiz&quot;) McQueen: A rebellious woman, serving five years of &quot;cure&quot; in Gouffre Martel for larceny, she turned to crime to rebel against the limitations imposed on women to &quot;protect&quot; them in a world where everyone can teleport. She escapes with Foyle and takes him to a criminal doctor who is able to bleach out his facial tattoos by applying a chemical with a tattoo needle. The process is agony for Foyle, but Jisbella makes him endure it out of her disgust for him.
* Saul Dagenham: The head of a private &quot;special services&quot; agency contracted by Presteign to interrogate Gully Foyle and force him to reveal the location of the derelict &quot;Nomad&quot;. Dagenham was a nuclear scientist who became radioactive in an accident. He cannot remain in a room with other people for more than a short time.
* The agents of &quot;Dagenham Couriers Inc.&quot;: A bizarre collection of freaks who specialize in &quot;FFCC&quot;, or &quot;Fun, Fantasy, Confusion, and Catastrophe&quot; to carry out their missions of theft, kidnapping, and espionage.
* Peter Y&#x27;ang-Yeovil: Head of a government Central Intelligence agency based on ancient Chinese principles who is also trying to find &quot;Nomad&quot;. He is &quot;a member of the dreaded Society of Paper Men, and an adept of the Tsientsin Image Makers&quot;. Although of Chinese descent and able to speak fluent Mandarin, he does not look Chinese.
* Olivia Presteign: Daughter of Presteign, she is an albino who is blind to visible light, but can see in the infrared spectrum and some radio waves. Like Jisbella, she too is in revolt against her treatment as a woman, and also as a genetic anomaly. Her rebellion takes the form of interplanetary smuggling of refugees. It was on one such mission that she ordered her ship &quot;Vorga&quot; to ignore the distress calls from &quot;Nomad&quot;.
* Regis Sheffield: A high-priced lawyer working for Presteign, he is actually an agent of the Outer Satellites coalition.
* &quot;Bunny&quot;: Sheffield&#x27;s personal secretary, apparently Chinese, he speaks Mandarin with difficulty and is said to resemble a frightened rabbit, hence his nickname.

==Speculative science==
The novel included some early descriptions of proto-science and fictional technology, among them Bester&#x27;s portrayal of psionics, including the phenomenon of &quot;jaunting&quot;, named after the scientist (Charles Fort Jaunte) who discovered it. Jaunting is the instantaneous teleportation of one&#x27;s body (and anything one is wearing or carrying). One is able to move up to a thousand miles by just thinking.

Jaunting has other effects on the social fabric of the novel&#x27;s world, and these are examined in true science-fictional fashion. Women of the upper classes are locked away in -proof rooms &quot;for their protection&quot;, the treatment of criminals of necessity goes back to the Victorian &quot;separate system&quot;, and freaks and monsters abound.

The second significant technology in the novel is the rare substance known as &quot;PyrE&quot;, an extremely powerful explosive which is activated by telepathy. Possession of PyrE and knowledge of the means to detonate it is believed by both sides to be key to winning the interplanetary war.

Bester&#x27;s description of synesthesia is the first popular account published in the English language and is also quite accurate.

==Reception and influence==
Initially, reviews of &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; were mixed. The well-regarded science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, in &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot; (1956), wrote of the novel&#x27;s &quot;bad taste, inconsistency, irrationality, and downright factual errors&quot;, but called the ending of the book &quot;grotesquely moving&quot;. In a profile of Bester for &quot;Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature&quot; (2005), critic Steven H. Gale cited the novel as a reflection of the author&#x27;s maturation, addressing as it does &quot;the continued evolution of humankind as a species&quot;, a grander theme than those treated with in his earlier work. Gale declared the novel to be Bester&#x27;s most stylistically ambitious work, citing the use of disparate fonts to evoke synesthesia, the progressively intelligent language accorded to the maturing protagonist, and the framing of the narrative between the variations on Blake&#x27;s quatrain.

The book has received high praise from many fellow science fiction writers. After generally criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; as among stories &quot;that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical&quot;. By 1987, when the author died, &quot;it was apparent that the 1980s genre owed an enormous debt to Bester and to this book in particular&quot;. Neil Gaiman wrote in the introduction to a 1999 edition of the book: &quot;&quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; is, after all, the perfect cyberpunk novel: it contains such cheerfully protocyber elements as multinational corporate intrigue; a dangerous, mysterious, hyperscientific MacGuffin (PyrE); an amoral hero; a supercool thief-woman...&quot; James Lovegrove called it &quot;the very best of Bester&quot;, and Thomas M. Disch identified it as &quot;one of the great sf novels of the 1950s&quot;. Joe Haldeman wrote: &quot;Our field has produced only a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them&quot;, who also added that he reads the novel &quot;every two or three years and it still evokes a sense of wonder&quot;.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #60, and stated that &quot;the compulsive, pyrotechnic tale of obsession and revenge needs no introduction (read it!).&quot;

According to Samuel R. Delany, the book is &quot;considered by many to be the greatest single SF novel&quot;. while Robert Silverberg wrote that it is &quot;on everybody&#x27;s list of the ten greatest SF novels&quot;. Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock praised it as &quot;a wonderful adventure story&quot; that embodies truly libertarian principles. Ty Franck, co-author of &quot;The Expanse&quot; series, said: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember any of the other stories in [&quot;A Treasury of Great Science Fiction&quot;, Volume Two; an anthology of science fiction stories], and I read that book a dozen times. The only story that sticks out in my mind is &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;&quot;.

In a 2011 survey asking leading science fiction writers to name their favorite work of the genre, &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; was the choice of William Gibson and Moorcock. Gibson remarked that the book was &quot;perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy&quot;, and &quot;dizzying in its pace and sweep&quot;, and a &quot;talisman&quot; for him when undertaking his first novel. Moorcock hailed Bester&#x27;s novel as a reminder of &quot;why the best science fiction still contains, as in Ballard, vivid imagery and powerful prose coupled to a strong moral vision&quot;.

In 2012, the novel was included in the Library of America two-volume boxed set &quot;American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s&quot;, edited by Gary K. Wolfe.

==Adaptations==
===Comics===
In 1963, Australian comics illustrator Stanley Pitt and his brother Reginald worked on a proposed comic strip adaptation entitled &quot;Gully Foyle&quot;. Bester looked over the strips and gave his approval. A film company, which held the rights to the novel, apparently put a stop to this. Small circulation publications containing the strips appeared in 1967 and 2001.

A graphic novel adaptation drawn by Howard Chaykin, which utilized the complete text of the original novel was first published, in part, in 1979 by Baronet Publishing. The release of the conclusion was delayed due to Baronet&#x27;s bankruptcy. The second half was released by Marvel Entertainment&#x27;s Epic imprint in 1992.

===Radio===
A dramatisation titled &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on September 14, 1991 and repeated on August 16, 1993. It was scripted by Ivan Benbrook and directed by Andy Jordan. Alun Armstrong played Gully Foyle, Miranda Richardson was Olivia, Siobhan Redmond was Robin Wednesbury and Lesley Manville was Jisbella McQueen.
===Anime===
A 2004 anime series, &quot;&quot;, was originally intended as an adaptation of &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;. The copyright holders&#x27; refusal to allow an adaptation led the director, Mahiro Maeda, to instead use &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, which had inspired Bester&#x27;s story.

===Planned feature film adaptations===
As mentioned above, one production company had apparently secured the rights to the novel as early as the 1960s. A number of adaptations of the book have been scripted. So far, none have yet made it to the screen. While the novel has long been considered an &quot;unfilmable&quot; work, the screen rights were acquired by Universal Pictures in 2006 and by Paramount Pictures in 2015.

Film adaptations of &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; have been frequently rumored. According to David Hughes&#x27; &quot;Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made&quot;, Richard Gere owned the rights to, and wanted to star in, the adaptation following the success of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. At a later point, &quot;NeverEnding Story&quot; producer Bernd Eichinger had the rights and hired notable comic book artist Neal Adams to produce concept art. Still later, Paul W. S. Anderson was set to direct it, but wound up doing &quot;Event Horizon&quot; instead. Since then, a number of scripts have been written, but nothing more has happened.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Stars My Degradation&quot;, an early comic strip by Alan Moore (later with writing assistance from Steve) parodies the &quot;Gully Foyle is my name&quot; rhyme in the first installment.
* In Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story&quot; (2006), the title character recalls it as her deceased husband&#x27;s favorite novel. The short story &quot;The Jaunt&quot; (1981) takes its title from the book, which it names and references it at several points.
* Gully Foyle makes a cameo appearance as an agent for the Jurisfiction organisation in the BookWorld of author Jasper Fforde&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series. Another novel in the series, &quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot;, uses &quot;Stars My Destination&quot; as the title of a tabloid newspaper in the fictional universe of Emperor Zhark.
* &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, a British children&#x27;s TV series, uses &quot;jaunting&quot; to refer to teleportation.
* In the 2000 video game &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, Gully Foyle is listed as a current resident of the &#x27;Ton Hotel.
* Enzo Paulo Gugino, a character from the John Scalzi novel &quot;Zoe&#x27;s Tale&quot; wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; based on &quot;the title from an obscure fantasy adventure book that he&#x27;d never read but whose title stayed with him&quot;.
* In &quot;Crooked Little Vein&quot; by Warren Ellis, the element PyrE is referenced by Zack Pickles when explaining to protagonist Michael McGill the impact of rebel journalism on society and the power structure of society.
* In &quot;Death&#x27;s End&quot; by Cixin Liu, the Planetary Defense Council adopts Resolution 479, initiating the Stars Our Destination Project.
* &quot;Stars My Destination&quot; was the title of a year-long story arc in Starman comics.
* In the mobile game &quot;Tokyo Afterschool Summoners&quot;, the lore of the character Nomad is based on the contents of the book, as well as the poem &quot;The Tyger&quot;.
* Many musical groups, including Stereolab, roadside picnic, NASA Space Universe and Slough Feg reference Gully Foyle and/or the title of the novel. Foyle appears on the cover of Sough Feg&#x27;s &quot;Hardworlder&quot; album, along with a song entitled &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot;.

<text>Edward George Gibson (born November 8, 1936) is a former NASA astronaut, pilot, engineer, and physicist.

Before becoming an astronaut, Gibson graduated from the University of Rochester and the California Institute of Technology. He became a research assistant in jet propulsion while completing his studies, and eventually became a research scientist for Philco Corporation until joining NASA in 1965. Gibson is the last surviving crew member of Skylab 4.

Gibson was selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 4, the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew of Apollo 12, the second Moon landing mission, before working on the development of the Skylab space station. In 1973–74, Gibson made his only flight into space as science pilot aboard Skylab 4, the third and final crewed flight to Skylab. He, along with Commander Gerald Carr and Pilot William Pogue, spent just over 84 days in space.

Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October 1982.

==Early life and education==

Gibson was born in Buffalo, New York, on November 8, 1936. From ages 2 to 8, Gibson battled osteomyelitissoft spots in bonesand spent many months in and out of hospitals. Newly-available penicillin cured the disease. To strengthen his leg that was nearly amputated, Gibson took up sports: swimming, football, and track. He primarily used swimming to strengthen his leg. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class.

Gibson graduated from Kenmore Senior High School in Kenmore, New York, in 1955, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Rochester in June 1959. At the University of Rochester, Gibson became a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He received a Master of Science degree in engineering (jet propulsion option) from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in June 1960 and a PhD in engineering with a minor in physics from Caltech in June 1964. He was supervised by Maria Wonenburger.

==Early career==
While studying at Caltech, Gibson was a research assistant in the field of jet propulsion and classical physics. His technical publications are in the fields of plasma physics and solar physics. He was senior research scientist with the Applied Research Laboratories of the Philco Corporation at Newport Beach, California, from June 1964 until moving to NASA. While at Philco, he did research in lasers and the optical breakdown of gases.

Gibson has logged more than 4,300 hours flying time—2,270 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==

Gibson was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965. He completed a 53-week course in flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and earned his Air Force wings. Since then, he has flown helicopters and the T-38.

He served as a member of the astronaut support crew and as a CAPCOM for the Apollo 12 lunar landing, becoming the first from the scientist-astronaut group to get a crew assignment of any kind. He also participated in the design and testing of many elements of the Skylab space station. As part of his preparation for the Skylab program, Gibson studied solar physics, ultimately writing an introductory monograph/textbook on solar astrophysics &quot;The Quiet Sun&quot;, apart from 1973 English edition published in the United States there was 1977 Russian edition of this book, published in the Soviet Union by Mir Publishers.

===Skylab 4===
Gibson was the science pilot of Skylab 4. The third and final crewed visit to the Skylab space station, it launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 8, 1974. This was the longest crewed flight (84 days 1 hour 15 minutes) in the history of crewed space exploration at that time. Gibson was accompanied on the record-setting 34.5-million-mile flight by Commander Gerald P. Carr and Pilot William R. Pogue. They successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 revolutions of the Earth. They also acquired a wide variety of Earth resources observations data using Skylab&#x27;s Earth resources experiment package camera and sensor array. Dr. Gibson was the crewman primarily responsible for the 338 hours of Apollo Telescope Mount operation, which made extensive observations of solar processes.

Until the Soviet Union&#x27;s Soyuz 26 broke the record in March 1978, Gibson and his Skylab 4 teammates held the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds. Gibson logged 15 hours and 22 minutes in three EVAs outside the Skylab Orbital Workshop. Gibson is the last surviving Skylab 4 crew member (Carr died in 2020, and Pogue died in 2014).

Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corporation of Los Angeles, California. Beginning in March 1976, he served for one year as a consultant to ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, in West Germany, on Spacelab design under the sponsorship of a U.S. Senior Scientist Award form the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In March 1977, Gibson returned to the Astronaut Office astronaut candidate selection and training as Chief of the Scientist-Astronaut Candidates. During his second tenure at NASA, Gibson had hoped to fly on another space station mission due to his experience on Skylab, but at the same time was not keen on flying a Space Shuttle mission. He served as CAPCOM for STS-1. Gibson ultimately decided to retire from NASA again on October 31, 1982.

==Post-NASA career==
From July 1980 to August 1987, Gibson worked for TRW as a project manager at Space Park in support of Space Station Freedom.

In October 1990, Gibson began his own consulting firm, Gibson International Corp. The firm provides consulting services on program management, market development and space infrastructure design and operations.

He has performed a significant amount of speaking and writing, and published a text book in solar physics, two novels, &quot;Reach&quot; (1989) and &quot;In the Wrong Hands&quot; (1992), and edited &quot;The Greatest Adventure&quot;, a 1994 compilation of stories and pictures on space missions from many astronauts and cosmonauts around the world.

==Special honors and awards==
Gibson was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship and the R.C. Baker Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. He received the Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation (1970). He received the City of New York Gold Medal (1974). Gibson, along with the rest of the Skylab astronauts, received the City of Chicago Gold Medal in 1974. Gibson received the 1974 FAI Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal. In 1976, he received the U.S. Scientist Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which provided funds to research in West Germany for a year. He received the JSC Special Achievement Award in 1978. Gibson has also been presented with honorary doctorates of science from the University of Rochester and Wagner College in New York City, both in 1974.

The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy &quot;For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth.&quot; In 1974, President Nixon presented the Skylab 4 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. The American Astronautical Society&#x27;s 1975 Flight Achievement Award was awarded to the Skylab 4 crew. Federation Aeronautique Internationale awarded the Skylab 4 crew the De La Vaulx Medal and V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1974. Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts. The Skylab 4 crew won the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award in 1975 &quot;For demonstrated outstanding courage and skill during their record-breaking 84-day Skylab mission&quot;. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Personal life==

Gibson is married to Julianne Volk of Tonawanda, New York. He has four children: Jannet Lynn (born November 9, 1960), John Edward (born May 2, 1964), Julie Ann (born October 12, 1968), and Joseph Michael (born July 11, 1971).

== Media appearances ==
In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Gibson was played by actor Geoffrey Nauffts.

<doc id="598942" wikidata="Q2976730" url="?curid=598942" title="Grammy Award for Best Music Video">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Music Video is an accolade presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to performers, directors, and producers of quality short form music videos. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Video, Short Form, the award was first presented in 1984, as was a similar award for Best Long Form Music Video. From 1986 to 1997, the category name was changed to Best Music Video, Short Form. However, in 1988 and 1989, the award criteria were changed and the video awards were presented under the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The awards were returned to the original format in 1990. The category was called Best Short Form Music Video until 2012, from 2013 it was shortened to Best Music Video. Award recipients include the performers, directors, and producers associated with the winning videos, except for its first two years when the Grammy went to the performing artist only. For unknown reasons, the award for the Best Music Video in 1987 - &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; by Dire Straits - went to the band only, not to the director(s) or producer(s).

Kendrick Lamar holds the record for the most wins as a performer in this category, with three. Mark Romanek holds the record for the most wins as a director, with a total of three. Icelandic singer Björk holds the record for the most nominations as a performer without a win, with four. Taylor Swift became the first artist to win the category with a sole directing credit for their own music video when she won in 2023 for &quot;All Too Well: The Short Film&quot;.

<text>Richard Francis &quot;Dick&quot; Gordon Jr. (October 5, 1929 – November 6, 2017) was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, and a football executive. He was one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon, as command module pilot of the Apollo 12 mission, which orbited the Moon 45 times. Gordon had already flown in space as the pilot of the 1966 Gemini 11 mission.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Gordon was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 5, 1929, the first of five children of Richard Francis Gordon Sr. (1905–1963), a machinist, and his wife, Angela Frances Gordon ( Sullivan; 1903–1985), an elementary school teacher. He was a Boy Scout, and earned the rank of Star Scout. He graduated from North Kitsap High School in Poulsbo, Washington, in 1947, then entered the University of Washington, from where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1951 and he was also a member of Phi Sigma Kappa.

=== Naval career ===
After graduating from college, Gordon joined the United States Navy and received his wings as a Naval Aviator in 1953. He then attended All-Weather Flight School and jet transitional training, and was subsequently assigned to an all-weather fighter squadron at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.

In 1957, he attended the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, and served as a flight test pilot until 1960. During this tour of duty, he did flight test work on the F-8U Crusader, F-11F Tiger, North American FJ Fury, and A-4D Skyhawk, and was the first project test pilot for the F4H-1 Phantom II. He served with Fighter Squadron 121 (VF-121) at the Naval Air Station Miramar, California, as a flight instructor in the F4H-1 and participated in the introduction of that aircraft to the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. He was also flight safety officer, assistant operations officer, and ground training officer for Fighter Squadron 96 (VF-96) at Miramar. He logged more than 4,500 hours of flying time with 3,500 hours of those hours in jet aircraft. He was also a student at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California.

He won the Bendix Trophy race from Los Angeles to New York City in May 1961, flying an F4H-1 in which he established a new speed record of 869.74 miles per hour and a transcontinental speed record of 2 hours and 47 minutes.

=== NASA career ===
Gordon was one of the third group of astronauts, named by NASA in October 1963, being the oldest astronaut in his selection. He had been a finalist for the second selection, in 1962.

==== Project Gemini ====


Gordon served as backup pilot for the Gemini 8 flight. In September 1966, he made his first space flight, as pilot of Gemini 11, alongside Pete Conrad. At the time, the flight set an altitude record of , which still stands as the highest-apogee Earth orbit. Gordon was already good friends with Conrad, who had once been his roommate on the aircraft carrier . On the flight, Gordon performed two spacewalks, which included attaching a tether to the Agena and retrieving a nuclear emulsion experiment package.

==== Apollo program ====

Gordon was assigned as the backup command module pilot for Apollo 9. In November 1969, he flew as command module pilot of Apollo 12, the second crewed mission to land on the Moon. While his crewmates, Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, landed in the Ocean of Storms, Gordon remained in lunar orbit aboard the command module &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;, photographing tentative landing sites for future missions.

After Apollo 12, Gordon served as the backup commander of Apollo 15. He was slated to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 18, but the mission was canceled because of budget cuts.

Gordon logged a total of 315 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 2 hours and 41 minutes were spent in EVA.

==== Astronaut office ====
After his flights, Gordon worked in the astronaut office. He became the chief of advanced programs in 1971. Gordon worked on the design of the Space Shuttle.

He retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy in January 1972.

=== Post-NASA career ===
After leaving NASA, Gordon served as executive vice president of the New Orleans Saints Professional Football Club in the National Football League (1972–1976); was general manager of Energy Developers, Limited (EDL), a Texas partnership involved in a joint venture with Rocket Research Corporation for the development of a liquid chemical explosive for use in the oil and gas industry (1977); president of Resolution Engineering and Development Company (REDCO), which provided design and operational requirements for wild oil well control and fire fighting equipment on board large semisubmersible utility vessels (1978); following REDCO merger with Amarco Resources, Gordon assumed the additional duties of vice president of marketing, Westdale, an oil well servicing subsidiary of AMARCO operating in North Central Texas and Oklahoma, and also served as vice president for operations, Texas Division (1980); served as director, Scott Science and Technology, Inc., Los Angeles Division (1981–1983).

In March 1982 he became president of Astro Sciences Corporation. This company provides a range of services including engineering, project management, project field support teams, to software and hardware system design for control room applications. In the summer of 1984, Gordon was a technical advisor for and played the part of &quot;Capcom&quot; in the CBS miniseries &quot;Space&quot; by James A. Michener.

Gordon served as chairman and co-chairman of the Louisiana Heart Fund, chairman of the March of Dimes (Mother&#x27;s March), honorary chairman for Muscular Dystrophy, and on the boards of directors for the Boy Scouts of America and Boys&#x27; Club of Greater New Orleans.

=== Personal life ===
From his marriage (which ended in divorce) to his first wife Barbara Field, who died in 2014, Gordon had six children. He died in San Marcos, California, on November 6, 2017, at the age of 88. His hobbies included water skiing and golf. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="598946" wikidata="Q1406454" url="?curid=598946" title="Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence">
<text>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence is the debut album of American post-hardcore band Glassjaw, released on May 9, 2000, by Roadrunner Records. It was produced by Ross Robinson. The album received positive reviews from critics, and has since been cited as an influential album in the genre. 

Glassjaw has been rumored to discourage the purchasing of this album due to their acrimonious split from Roadrunner Records. Instead, they encourage people to download their music via file sharing software, such as Limewire. Robinson claimed that the label showed no interest in the band until he pushed to have them signed and showed little interest after.

A remastered version of the album was released on March 24, 2009, with two bonus tracks: &quot;Convectuoso&quot; and a cover of Youth of Today&#x27;s &quot;Modern Love Story&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Glassjaw originally formed in 1993 after vocalist Daryl Palumbo and guitarist Justin Beck met each other working for a summer camp. Throughout the next few years, the group issued various demo tapes and EPs and experienced many line up changes. Their line up would eventually stabilize by 1999, featuring bassist Manuel Carrero, guitarist Todd Weinstock, and drummer Sammy Siegler. With this line up, the group booked a recording session with local producer Don Fury, and the demo recording that resulted from it would eventually be heard by producer Ross Robinson. Robinson, impressed by the material, would then show up to a rehearsal, after which he offered them studio time at Indigo Ranch and convinced Roadrunner Records to sign the group.

Recording sessions for the album lasted for about two months total. While all material for the album was written by the band before production began, Robinson did influence arrangements of the tracks &quot;Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; has been noted for its overall angry and negative tone in terms of lyrics. The title track was written about Crohn&#x27;s disease, an intestinal disorder that Palumbo was diagnosed with in 1996. Many songs on the record were written concerning bad relationships.

The album has been subject to criticism surrounding its misogynistic lyrical undertones, which have prompted various apologies from Daryl Palumbo. In a 2017 article by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; titled &quot;Unraveling the Sexism of Emo&#x27;s Third Wave&quot;, Jenn Pelly addressed Glassjaw and the song &quot;Pretty Lush&quot; and criticised the band&#x27;s lyrics for being &quot;embarrassingly spiteful to bluntly-stated violence against women&quot;. Following the article&#x27;s publishing, Palumbo and the band made further statements condemning the lyrics, with Palumbo apologizing for the lyrics in an interview to &quot;The Guardian;&quot; &quot;[the lyrics] deserve scrutiny. You don&#x27;t talk to a woman like that. It took being that angry to write [the debut album&#x27;s lyrics], to make it work for my instrument in the band. I was always like &#x27;Argh, revenge!&#x27; Fall in love easily and then fall into hate easily. I didn&#x27;t have to say it that way … It&#x27;s stupid, you don&#x27;t speak face-to-face to a woman like that. I was angry. It&#x27;s offensive.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; has received generally favorable reviews.

Absolute Punk reviewer Namel praised the songs &quot;Pretty Lush&quot; and &quot;Piano&quot;, but said some of the album&#x27;s songs have &quot;cringe-worthy&quot; lyrics and criticized the track &quot;Babe&quot;. In a retrospective review of the album, MetalSucks reviewer Mike Gitter was highly positive of the album. Gitter stated &quot;Glassjaw laid down the bitchslap in-extremis&quot; and regarded the album as a landmark. NME compared the album to &quot;Jeff Buckley doused in napalm, crawling through a room full of broken glass.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Since the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence&quot; has been seen as an influential album in metal and post-hardcore. Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die has cited the album as an influence, stating on Twitter; &quot;This album changed everything for me.&quot; Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon also cited the album as an influence on him, and that it inspired him to become a singer. Journalists Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley included the album in their list of the most essential emo releases in their book &quot;Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture&quot; (2007). &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Pretty Lush&quot; at number 77 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

In 2022, Glassjaw have performed the album in its entirety during their 20+ Anniversary Tour.

<doc id="598948" wikidata="Q82278" url="?curid=598948" title="George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe">
<text>George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe, Baron Jellicoe of Southampton (4 April 1918 – 22 February 2007) was a British politician, diplomat and businessman.

Lord Jellicoe was the only son but sixth and youngest child of John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, who was a First World War naval officer, commander at the Battle of Jutland, and Admiral of the Fleet; and his wife Florence Gwendoline (died 1964), the second daughter of Sir Charles Cayzer, 1st Bt., of Gartmore, Perthshire. He inherited the title Earl Jellicoe at the age of 17, on the death of his father. As well as commanding the Special Boat Service in the Second World War, George Jellicoe was a long-serving parliamentarian, being a member of the House of Lords for 68 years (1939–2007).

==Early life==
Jellicoe was born at Hatfield and was christened on 29 July 1918 by the Most Rev. and Right Hon. Cosmo Lang, 89th Archbishop of York, while King George V (represented by Admiral Sir Stanley Colville) and Princess Patricia of Connaught (later known as Lady Patricia Ramsay) stood sponsor as two of his godparents. The others were: Miss Lilian Lear, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey (Third Sea Lord), Mr. Eustace Burrows (cousin), Major Herbert Cayzer (uncle), and The Rev. Frederick G. G. Jellicoe (uncle, and Rector of New Alresford).

Much of his childhood was spent at St Lawrence Hall, near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight; at St Peter&#x27;s Court, a prep school at Broadstairs, Kent; in London; and in the Dominion of New Zealand, where his father was viceroy with the title of Governor-General between 1921 and 1924. He was educated at Winchester College, where he was styled and known as Viscount Brocas. He won the Vere Herbert Smith history prize and secured an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1936. BA, Modern History tripos 1939, but awarded 1966). He was chairman of the Pitt Club, and his tutor Steven Runciman became a lifelong friend.

==Second World War==
In October 1939, Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 23 March 1940, before joining No. 8 (Guards) Commando, with whom on 31 January 1941 he sailed to the Middle East with Colonel Robert Laycock&#x27;s Layforce (whose commando officers included Evelyn Waugh, Randolph Churchill, Philip Dunne, Carol Mather, David Stirling, and many distinguished others). He served with L Detachment (from April 1942) (with some of the above and Stephen Hastings), which was the nucleus of the Special Air Service. He was mentioned in despatches thrice, and wounded (bullet in shoulder) once whilst with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 22 (Guards) Brigade in the Western Desert in January 1941. He won the DSO, and Croix de Guerre, in November 1942 for operating on a raid that claimed to have blown up more than 20 German aircraft (Ju 88s) on Heraklion airfield, Crete, that June:

His cool and resolute leadership, skill and courage throughout this very hazardous operation were mainly responsible for the high measure of success achieved. He ... placed charges on the enemy aircraft and brought off the survivors after the four Free French members of the party had been betrayed and killed or captured.

In September 1943, Jellicoe was sent to the Italian-held island of Rhodes to negotiate with the Italian Admiral Inigo Campioni for the surrender of his forces to the Allies. However, negotiations were pre-empted by a surprise German attack on the island on 9 September. He was able to escape from Rhodes during the resulting chaos while the Italian garrison was captured by the German invasion force. This was part of the Dodecanese Campaign.

In 1943, he was named Commander of the Special Boat Regiment, Middle East, and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was eventually promoted to brigadier. For the remainder of the war, his SBS command conducted secretive and dangerous operations along the coasts of Italy and Yugoslavia. In 1944, he won the MC for one of these actions. At the end of the war, Jellicoe was among the first Allied soldiers to enter German-occupied Athens, beating the communist-controlled guerrillas ELAS, to create a pro-Allied presence in the capital.

Years later, when First Lord of the Admiralty, Jellicoe told at least one reporter, &quot;The only serious military distinction I ever achieved was having a new type of assault boat named after me. It was called I am ashamed to say, the Jellicoe Inflatable Intruder Mark One.&quot;

In March 1944, Lord Jellicoe married Patricia Christine O&#x27;Kane (October 1917 – March 2012), who was employed at the British Embassy in Beirut. She had been born and raised in Shanghai and was the daughter of a Greenock-born Irish father and an English mother. Patricia, Countess Jellicoe (popularly known as Patsy Jellicoe), would remain married to Lord Jellicoe until 1966, when they divorced. They had two sons and two daughters together, the eldest son being the 3rd Earl Jellicoe.

==HM Foreign Service 1947–1958==
Soon after the war, Lord Jellicoe joined His Majesty&#x27;s Foreign Service (appointed a Foreign Service Officer, Grade 8, in the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service, 10 September 1947). He served in London (German political department, Third Secretary); Washington (Third Secretary, when Donald Maclean of the &quot;Cambridge five&quot; was Head of Chancery, and then as one of the 11 Second Secretaries with H. A. R. Philby, seeing the North Atlantic Treaty signed on 4 April 1949, all when Sir Oliver Franks was Ambassador); transferred to Brussels 10 September 1951 (Head of Chancery) acted as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in 1952); London (no. 2 in Northern department in charge of the Soviet Desk from September 1953); and Baghdad from January 1956 (First Secretary and Deputy Secretary General of the Baghdad Pact Organisation). The Suez Crisis (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p. 136).

Jellicoe eventually left the Foreign Office in March 1958, after marital difficulties had caused an impasse (February 1958, Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Hoyar-Millar wrote; &#x27;You have a choice of ceasing your relationship with this lady [Philippa Dunne] or changing your job&#x27;). He became a director of the Cayzer dynasty&#x27;s Clan Line Steamers (cargo ships), and Union Castle Steamship Co. (passengers).

However, enthusiasm for his mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s businesses ultimately gave way to the call of the Palace of Westminster, where, back from Iraq, he took the Oath in the Lords on 3 December 1957, in the Third Session of the 41st Parliament.

==House of Lords and 1960s==
Having first sat in parliament on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech in the House of Lords during a debate entitled &quot;The International Situation: The Middle East&quot;. He spoke from the Cross-Benches about the Baghdad Pact and Iraq:
By October 1958 he had joined the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a &quot;distinctly pink&quot; Whig, who gave him the honour of moving &quot;an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Gracious Speech&quot;
On 7 May 1959, he asked a prescient starred question on the planning of motorways:
On 20 July 1959, he initiated a debate on Western aid for uncommitted countries, and by January 1961 he was a Lord-in-waiting to H.M. the Queen, a Government Whip, in Macmillan&#x27;s administration. He was Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Local Government June 1961 – July 1962; Minister of State, Home Office July 1962 – October 1963; First Lord of the Admiralty October 1963 – April 1964; Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy April–October 1964; delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union (WEU) 1965–1967; president of the National Federation of Housing Societies 1965–1970; a governor of the Centre for Environmental Studies 1967–1970; chairman of the British Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution at Sea 1968; chairman of the third International Conference on oil pollution of the sea 1968; an hon. vice-president of PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism); and deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lords 1967–1970. From April 1967 Lords Jellicoe and Carrington represented the Conservatives in the Lords on the Inter-Party conference group on Lords&#x27; reform, which came up with the unsuccessful Parliament (No.2) Bill (1968–1969). Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said:
During the late 1960s he worked in the City of London where he became chairman of British Reserve Insurance and a director of S G Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd.

==Cabinet minister and resignation==
In Ted Heath&#x27;s administration he was Minister in charge for the Civil Service Department (CSD), Lord Privy Seal (as such he was eighth on the Roll of The Lords) and Leader of the House of Lords from 20 June 1970 until 24 May 1973.

Having earlier re-established relations with the miners&#x27; union leaders in February 1972, Heath appointed Jellicoe &quot;energy supremo&quot; to restore power supplies around the time of the Three-Day Week and had him set up and chair a Civil Contingencies Unit, which was, when an internal crisis arose, to operate through &quot;COBRA&quot; (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms).

In June 1972 Jellicoe was sent to lead Concorde&#x27;s first sales expedition. As Alan Trengove in &quot;My Lord, the super salesman&quot;, in the Australian &quot;The Sun&quot; of 22 June 1972 put it,
Trengove considered Sir George Edwards and Sir Geoffrey Tuttle &quot;equally impressive members of the sales team&quot;. (Supersonic flights were on the prototype Concorde G-BSST, certificate signed by Brian Trubshaw, and dated 15 June 1972.)

Jellicoe, with the help of his very experienced Chief Whip, the second Earl St Aldwyn, steered the European Communities Act (1972) through the Lords, allowing no amendments. The Industrial Relations Act was another legislative highlight.

In May 1973, Jellicoe admitted &quot;some casual affairs&quot; with call girls (from &quot;Mayfair Escorts&quot;) in the wake of an accidental confusion with Lord Lambton&#x27;s prostitution scandal. His name seems to have emerged as a result of a connection between Lambton, the madame Norma Levy, and a tenement house or community hall in Somers Town in the London district of St. Pancras called Jellicoe Hall or House, after Basil Jellicoe (1899–1935) the housing reformer and priest. The word Jellicoe was seen in Levy&#x27;s notebook, and a connection was assumed to the Minister rather than the building; a structure named after the earl&#x27;s distant cousin, and one that may have been opened by the Admiral himself in June 1928.

The resignation ended Jellicoe&#x27;s third career in government service. After the resignation (over his marginal involvement in a minor indiscretion) Richard Crossman, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, 30 May 1973 (page 18), described Jellicoe as:
On return from the Whitsun recess, tributes were paid in the Lords to their departed leader: the (Labour Party) Opposition leader and Jellicoe&#x27;s predecessor as Lord Privy Seal, Lord Shackleton said:
Lord Byers for the Liberal Party added: &quot;we regret bitterly his resignation ... He was a reforming innovator and the House owes a great deal more than it probably knows to the interest he took in this House and to his initiatives.&quot; (Hansard, 5 June 1973)

From the cross-benches Lord Strang added:
William Kendall, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, said:
In July 1973, the Diplock Commission, which had been set up to look into the security implications of Lambton and Jellicoe&#x27;s adventures, concluded its section on Jellicoe (paragraph 24):
==Business and post-government public career==
With no estates to distract him, Jellicoe was free to re-join S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. (1 October 1973), and with the help of Alan Lennox-Boyd, who was soon to retire from the board, he became a non-executive director of the sugar company Tate &amp; Lyle in 1973, a position held until 1993. Thanks in the main to Sir Saxon Tate, and presumably because he had succeeded as chairman (until June 1978) of their subsidiary Tunnel Refineries, the family made him Tate &amp; Lyle&#x27;s first non-family chairman 1978–1983. Having revived and retrenched Tate &amp; Lyle, Jellicoe became chairman of Booker Tate, 1988–91.

Other non-governmental jobs included: chairman of engineering plant company the Davy Corporation (Davy McKee) (now subsumed into Aker Kværner) 1985–1990; director Sotheby&#x27;s Holdings 1973–1993; Morgan Crucible 1974–88; Smiths Industries Ltd 1973–1986; S. G. Warburg &amp; Co 1964–1970, 1973–1988. He was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1979–1982. He succeeded Lord Limerick as chairman of the Department of Trade and Industry&#x27;s British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) 1983–1986, for which he was knighted. That was followed by chairmanship (1986–1990) and then the presidency (1990–1995) of the East European Trade Council (EETC). He was chairman of the Greek Fund Ltd 1988–1994 (Schroders) and of European Capital Ltd 1991–1995.

Lord Jellicoe was chairman of the council of King&#x27;s College London (KCL) 1974–1983; chairman of the Medical Research Council (MRC) 1982–1990; a trustee of the National Aids Trust (alongside the likes of Lord Goodman, David Puttnam and Robert Maxwell); president of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) (and of the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) after amalgamation) 1993–1997; president of the Anglo-Hellenic League 1978–1986; president of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust 1987–1994; president of the UK Crete Veterans Association 1991–2001; president of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) 1992–1995; chancellor of Southampton University 1984–1995, and has been closely associated with research and higher education. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990.

In 1995 he helped found Hakluyt &amp; Company, a strategic intelligence and advisory firm, for which he was a director 1996–2000. He was president of the SAS Regimental Association 1996–2000, when he became its patron. Jellicoe was a member of the Onassis International Prizes Committee (1983–1992); a vice-president of The European-Atlantic Group and of the Byron Society; he was on the board of the Hellenic College London; patron of the City of Southampton Society; a patron of the Greek Archaeological Committee (UK); one of five patrons of The Community Foundation for Wiltshire and Swindon; a director of The Landscape Foundation (now dormant); patron of Friends of The Royal Hospital School; patron of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology; a member of the World Innovation Fund (WIF) and an associate member of INEED. In 2002 he became a patron of The Second World War Experience Centre in Leeds.

==Later state contributions==
He was chairman of the Lords&#x27; Select Committee on Committees (1990–1993) and President of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (1980–1983). In 1983 he was author of the Jellicoe Report which reviewed the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976. &quot;The Times&quot; saw this appointment as the end of nine years penance in the political wilderness.

Between 1963 and 1973, Jellicoe had averaged 90 House of Lords daily attendances per parliamentary session. From 1973 to 1989, his attendance fell to an average of nine appearances per session. However, between 1990 and 2001, he made an average of 72 visits per session. He maintained this rate until early 2006, though his last full speech in the Lords was made as part of the Address in Reply to Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Gracious Speech (the Queen&#x27;s Speech debate) on 28 October 1996; his subject was Ukraine.

When the House of Lords Act 1999 removed his hereditary automatic entitlement to attend and sit in the House of Lords, he was created a life peer as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, so that he could continue to be summoned:1. Earl Jellicoe (Lord Jellicoe of Southampton) —The Rt Hon. George Patrick John Rushworth Earl Jellicoe, having been created Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, for life by Letters Patent dated 6 o&#x27;clock in the forenoon of 17th November 1999, took and subscribed the oath pursuant to statute.

Lord Jellicoe remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life. At his death in 2007, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because he waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. Earl Ferrers and Lords Renton, Carrington, Healey, and Strabolgi) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, at the time of his death, on the Privy Council only the Duke of Edinburgh (1951) and Lords Carrington (1959), Deedes and Renton (both 1962) had served longer.

==Character==
In May 1973, at the time of his resignation from the government, friends are quoted as saying:
In July 1970, as one of the first people to be breathalized, he was banned from driving for a year and fined 75 pounds with 20 guineas costs for having consumed more than the permitted level of alcohol in Old Brompton Road at 4 a.m. on 21 March 1970. Luck saw to it that the case came after the general election and the ban coincided with the arrival of his right to a full-time government car. 

In 2000, his friend, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Nicholas Henderson, wrote:
Lorna Windmill&#x27;s biography termed Jellicoe a &quot;British Achilles&quot; on account of two of his careers derailing as a result of women: in the 1950s for love, and in the 1970s for escorts. 

== Personal life ==
Lord Jellicoe married first, on 23 March 1944, Patricia O&#x27;Kane (1917–2012), by whom he had two sons and two daughters. He married secondly, in 1966, Philippa, daughter of Captain Philip Dunne (1904–1965), by whom he had one son and two daughters. He had eight children in total, born between 1944 and 1984. He was a member of Brooks&#x27;s (from 1940), the Special Forces Club, the Ski Club of Great Britain and was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Mercers.

He died on 22 February 2007, aged 88, at Tidcombe Manor, his house in Wiltshire.

<text>In integrated circuit design, integrated circuit (IC) layout, also known IC mask layout or mask design, is the representation of an integrated circuit in terms of planar geometric shapes which correspond to the patterns of metal, oxide, or semiconductor layers that make up the components of the integrated circuit. Originally the overall process was called tapeout, as historically early ICs used graphical black crepe tape on mylar media for photo imaging (erroneously believed to reference magnetic data—the photo process greatly predated magnetic media). 

When using a standard process—where the interaction of the many chemical, thermal, and photographic variables is known and carefully controlled—the behaviour of the final integrated circuit depends largely on the positions and interconnections of the geometric shapes. Using a computer-aided layout tool, the layout engineer—or layout technician—places and connects all of the components that make up the chip such that they meet certain criteria—typically: performance, size, density, and manufacturability. This practice is often subdivided between two primary layout disciplines: analog and digital.

The generated layout must pass a series of checks in a process known as physical verification. The most common checks in this verification process are

* Design rule checking (DRC), 
* Layout versus schematic (LVS),
* parasitic extraction, 
* antenna rule checking, and 
* electrical rule checking (ERC).

When all verification is complete, layout post processing is applied where the data is also translated into an industry-standard format, typically GDSII, and sent to a semiconductor foundry. The milestone completion of the layout process of sending this data to the foundry is now colloquially called &quot;tapeout&quot;. The foundry converts the data into mask data and uses it to generate the photomasks used in a photolithographic process of semiconductor device fabrication.

In the earlier, simpler, days of IC design, layout was done by hand using opaque tapes and films, an evolution derived from early days of printed circuit board (PCB) design -- tape-out.

Modern IC layout is done with the aid of IC layout editor software, mostly automatically using EDA tools, including place and route tools or schematic-driven layout tools.
Typically this involves a library of standard cells.

The manual operation of choosing and positioning the geometric shapes is informally known as &quot;polygon pushing&quot;.

<text>Ronald John Grabe (born June 13, 1945) is a former NASA astronaut and retired United States Air Force colonel.

He has earned the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with 7 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Liethen-Tittle Award (for Outstanding Student at the USAF Test Pilot School), the Royal Air Force Cross, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and NASA Space Flight Medals.

==Education and early career==

Grabe graduated from Stuyvesant High School (New York City) in 1962; earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from the United States Air Force Academy in 1966; and studied Aeronautics as a Fulbright Scholar at the Technische Hochschule (Darmstadt, West Germany) in 1967.

He returned to the United States in 1967 to complete pilot training at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He subsequently flew F-100 aircraft with the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and in 1969 was assigned as an F-100 pilot with the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing at Bien Hoa Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam, where he flew 200 combat missions.

In 1970, he was reassigned to the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base to fly F-100 and F-111 aircraft. He participated in the operational test and evaluation of the weapons system of the F-111D aircraft. Grabe attended the USAF Test Pilot School in 1974 and, upon graduating in 1975, was assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center as a test pilot for the A-7 and F-111. He was the program manager and chief project pilot for the Air Force&#x27;s digital flight control system for tactical fighters (DIGITAC) evaluation. He later served as an exchange test pilot with the Royal Air Force at Boscombe Down, United Kingdom, from 1976 to 1979. During this tour of duty, he served as the chief project pilot for the Royal Air Force Harrier and the Royal Navy Sea Harrier. He was an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, when advised of his selection by NASA.

He has logged more than 5,500 hours flying time.

==NASA experience==
Grabe became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. He has served as a chief verification pilot for STS-3 and STS-4 entry guidance, navigation and control simulation testing; as the Deputy Manager for Operations Integration, Space Shuttle Program Office; and subsequently as the Chief of Training within the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, Grabe served as pilot on STS-51-J (October 3–7, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4–8, 1989), and was the mission commander on STS-42 (January 22–30, 1992) and STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993).

Grabe has logged over 627 hours in space. Effective April 11, 1994, Grabe left NASA and the Air Force to join Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Virginia.

==Space flight experience==
STS-51-J, the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Atlantis, the final Orbiter in the Shuttle fleet. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. Mission duration was 97 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds.

STS-30 Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived at Venus in mid-1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. Magellan has been one of NASA&#x27;s most successful scientific missions and continues to operate today gaining information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic field. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989. Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds.

STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the seven-person crew accomplished the mission&#x27;s primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, the crew worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Mission duration was 193 hours, 14 minutes, 45 seconds.

STS-57 Endeavour launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary mission of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, STS-57 featured the first flight of the Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials processing and human factors. A spacewalk was conducted on this flight as part of an ongoing program to evaluate extravehicular activity (EVA) techniques for future missions. The Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 10 days on orbit. Mission duration was 239 hours, 45 minutes.

He is married to the former Lynn O&#x27;Keefe of Ottawa, Canada. Ron has two daughters and he and Lynn have a son. Recreational interests include skiing, wind surfing, and racquet sports.

<doc id="598955" wikidata="Q1424519" url="?curid=598955" title="Choker">
<text>A choker is a close-fitting necklace worn around the neck, typically 14 inch to 16 inch in length. Chokers can be made of a variety of materials, including velvet, plastic, beads, latex, leather, metal, such as silver, gold, or platinum, etc. They can be adorned in a variety of ways, including with sequins, , or a pendant.
==History==
Golden choker necklaces were crafted by Sumerian artisans around 2500 BC and according to curators from the Jewelry Museum of Fine Arts, chokers have been around for thousands of years, appearing in Ancient Egypt, in addition to the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Often made with gold or lapis, the necklaces were thought to be protective and imbued with special powers.

Chokers were also later worn in the 1st century A.D. They are mentioned in the &quot;Talmud&quot;, book Shabbat, chapter 6 as a common women&#x27;s accessory.

=== 19th Century ===

Neck accessories similar to chokers could be seen commonly throughout the century.

Ballerinas and the upper class in the late 19th century commonly wore certain types of chokers. However, at that same time, in the late 19th century, a plain, thin, red or black ribbon choker had ties to prostitution, as seen in Manet&#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot; (1861).

The 19th-century fashion for broad chokers reached its peak around 1900 in part due to Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom wearing one to hide a small scar. Chokers were popular into the 1920s and again in the &#x27;40s as &quot;colliers de chien&quot;. In particular, the term &quot;dog collars&quot; or &quot;colliers de chien&quot; caught on, and these designs – incorporating luxe diamonds, pearls, lace, and velvet – could be seen as objects of the elite because the best kinds were custom-made to fit one&#x27;s neck perfectly. In 1944 &quot;Life&quot; magazine stated that &quot;a dowager fashion of 40 years ago&quot; was being revived by young women, illustrating the trend with photos of models wearing the now vaguely rebellious &quot;dog collars&quot;.

==Modern fashion==
In the modern era, chokers have been popular with some celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow, who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards. Paris Hilton wore three inches of Swarovski around her neck in 2002. Rihanna has also been featured wearing chokers.

In the 2010s, the choker became a popular fashion among transgender women, due not only to its association with femininity but also because of its potential to hide the Adam&#x27;s apple without performing a tracheal shave.

<doc id="598961" wikidata="Q5311314" url="?curid=598961" title="Duchess of Kent">
<text>Duchess of Kent is the principal courtesy title used by the wife of the Duke of Kent. There have been four titles referring to Kent since the 18th century. The current duchess is Katharine, the wife of Prince Edward. He inherited the dukedom on 25 August 1942 upon the death of his father, Prince George, the fourth son of George V.

==History==
Henry Grey, 12th Earl of Kent since 1702 (of the eighth creation in the peerage of England) was raised to the peerage of Great Britain in 1706 under Queen Anne as Marquess of Kent, Earl of Harold and Viscount Goderich, then as Duke of Kent in 1710. In 1694, he had married Jemima Crew, who became Countess, Marchioness and then Duchess of Kent in 1702, 1706 and 1710 respectively. She died in 1728. In 1729, he married Sophia Bentinck, who died exactly a year after he did. The dukedom, marquessate and earldom of Kent all became extinct, as the duke had survived all of his sons and had no male collateral heirs. However, two subsidiary titles (the barony of Lucas of Crudwell and the marquessate of Grey) passed to his granddaughter, Jemima Yorke.

The Prince Edward Augustus was created Duke of Kent and Strathearn in the peerage of Great Britain by his father, George III, in 1799. In 1818, he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the daughter of Duke Francis and former regent of the Principality of Leiningen. They had one daughter, Princess Alexandrina Victoria, in 1819. The duke died with no male heir in 1820, while the duchess died in 1861. She never married again, but there were rumours (unproven) of an affair with John Conroy.

Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia became Countess of Kent in 1874 on her marriage to The Prince Alfred Ernest Albert, who had received the earldom of Kent in the peerage of the United Kingdom from his mother eight years earlier. The couple were more commonly known by their higher titles of Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, than as Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The duke died in 1900, and the duchess in 1920. They had survived their only son, Alfred, in 1899.

The Prince George Edward Alexander Edmund was created Duke of Kent by his father George V in 1934, some weeks in advance of his wedding to Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. She was a first cousin of the future royal consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. George died in 1942, leaving his peerage titles to his six-year-old son, Prince Edward. Marina continued to be styled &quot;The Duchess of Kent&quot; until Edward&#x27;s wedding, and was then styled &quot;Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent&quot; until her own death in 1968.

Katharine Worsley married Prince Edward in 1961 and has remained Duchess of Kent ever since.

===&quot;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&quot;===
The lyrics refer to killing pigeons with cyanide-coated peanuts and strychnine-treated corn. The latter method was used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to control pigeon populations in Boston public areas during the 1950s. The pianist hired for an orchestral version of the song, arranged and conducted by Richard Hayman with vocals by Lehrer, fell off his bench when he heard the title.

===&quot;Bright College Days&quot;===
This song borrows heavily from &quot;The Whiffenpoof Song&quot;, the traditional signature song of the Yale Whiffenpoofs.

===&quot;The Elements&quot;===
The lyrics of &quot;The Elements&quot; are a recitation of the names of all the chemical elements that were known at the time of writing, up to number 102, nobelium; sixteen more have been discovered since then. It can be found on his albums &quot;Songs &amp; More Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot; as well as &quot;An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer&quot;. The song is sung to the tune of Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Major General&#x27;s Song&quot; (&quot;I am the very model of a modern major-general...&quot;) from &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. At his concert in Copenhagen (1967), Lehrer admitted, &quot;I like to play this song every once in a while, just to see if I can still do it!&quot; Indeed, several of Lehrer&#x27;s fans, such as actor Daniel Radcliffe, have tried and failed to sing it (that is, he sang it in its entirety, but with slight hiccups). At some concerts he also played a version he claims is based on Aristotle&#x27;s elements: &quot;There&#x27;s earth and air and fire and water.&quot;

===&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;===
Lehrer comments that most popular movies of the time have a catchy title song that helps to draw in audiences. Believing that a recent (1957) film adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; had failed at the box office because it did not have such a song, he wrote this one in ragtime style. It was also a reference to the popularity of Freudian psychoanalysis and the Oedipus complex in popular culture in the 1940s and 1950s in the United States.

===&quot;In Old Mexico&quot;===
This song is prefaced by a lengthy commentary about the (fictional) Dr. Samuel Gall, who gained fame and fortune from his &quot;invention&quot; of the gallbladder. Performed in the style of Mexican folk music, it describes the narrator&#x27;s memory of a trip to that country and his viewing of a bullfight. The lyrics refer to three famous Spanish bullfighters, Belmonte, Dominguín, and Manolete, and also include a pejorative reference to Mexico as &quot;the land of the wetback.&quot;

===&quot;Clementine&quot;===
&quot;Clementine&quot; is a parody of the old folk song &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot; in several styles.

===&quot;It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier&quot;===
A parody of the official songs in use by the various branches of the United States military. Lehrer explains that the Army &quot;didn&#x27;t have no official song&quot; when he started basic training; he wrote this one in an attempt to remedy the situation. (The branch adopted &quot;The Army Goes Rolling Along&quot; as its song in 1956, one year after Lehrer enlisted.)

One of the rare parodies of Lehrer&#x27;s work emerged in Jim Bouton&#x27;s classic book &quot;Ball Four&quot;: &quot;It Makes a Fellow Proud to be an Astro&quot;, conjured up by members of the 1969 Houston Astros.

<doc id="598968" wikidata="Q7961305" url="?curid=598968" title="Walberswick">
<text>Walberswick is a village and civil parish on the Suffolk coast in England. It is at the mouth of the River Blyth on the south side of the river. The town of Southwold lies to the north of the river and is the nearest town to Walberswick, around away. Walberswick is around south of Lowestoft on the North Sea coast. It is east of Halesworth and northeast of the county town of Ipswich.

Coastal erosion and the shifting of the mouth of the River Blyth caused the neighbouring town of Dunwich, to the south, to be lost as a port in the last years of the 13th century. Following a brief period of rivalry and dispute with Dunwich, Walberswick became a major trading port from the 13th century until the First World War. Almost half of the village&#x27;s properties are holiday homes.

== History==
The name Walberswick is believed to derive from the Saxon Waldbert – probably a landowner – and &quot;wyc&quot;, meaning shelter or harbour. At the top of the village is the 15th-century St Andrew&#x27;s Church, which has been reduced in size since its medieval heyday. The size of the remaining St Andrew&#x27;s ruins demonstrate how large the parish church once was.

The name &#x27;Walleburyswyke&#x27;, appearing in a Latin legal record, dated 1440, may refer to the village.

The defences constructed around Walberswick during the Second World War have been documented. They included a number of pillboxes, landmines and flame fougasse installations. The beaches were protected with extensive barriers of scaffolding.

==Governance==
Walberswick forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Suffolk Coastal. The local government district is East Suffolk District Council, and Walberswick is part of the Southwold electoral ward.

==Demography==
The parish&#x27;s population was 380 at the 2011 census. A large proportion of the homes in the village are second homes or rented holiday homes and are not permanently occupied.

==Natural environment==
With over of heath and marshland protected within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Walberswick has good varied local habitats for birds.

A derelict windmill stands on the marshes near Walberswick. The area around the village makes up the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve, a protected area on with a range of wetland and heathland habitats.

==Landmarks==
The ornate metalwork village sign on the Green is a replica of one erected in 1953, at the village&#x27;s main road entrance, to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The original sign went missing in the 1980s, but after changing hands has since been returned and restored to mark the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. It was reinstalled opposite the church.

==Culture and community==
The village and surrounding beach and marshland have long attracted residents drawn from the arts, film and media. In the 1890s and 1900s, the village became associated with Philip Wilson Steer and his circle of English Impressionists. It was home to the noted artist and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh from 1914. It was also the birthplace of Oscar-nominated documentary film maker Humphrey Jennings, famous for his Second World War documentaries.

Considering its size, an inordinate number of British celebrities own or have owned holiday homes in the village including the late Clement Freud and his wife Jill, and their daughter Emma Freud and her partner Richard Curtis. Anna Freud (the daughter of Sigmund Freud) and Dorothy Burlingham (the daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany) kept a weekend retreat there from the late 1940s until the early 1980s. Film director Paul Greengrass, Martin Bell and ITV&#x27;s Director Peter Fincham have houses in the village, as did the late Geoffrey Palmer. Paul Heiney and Libby Purves live nearby.

The village is the setting for Esther Freud&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sea House&quot;, thinly disguised as &#x27;Steerborough&#x27;—presumably a coded reference, or in-joke, towards one-time resident Philip Wilson Steer (see above). Esther Freud, the cousin of Emma Freud and daughter of painter Lucian Freud, also has a house in the village with her husband, actor David Morrissey.

The village was famous for its annual crabbing competition, the British Open Crabbing Championship, last held in August 2010. The person who caught the heaviest crab within a period of 90 minutes was declared the winner. The proceeds supported many charitable causes.

Walberswick is reputedly haunted by a phantom coach, drawn by headless horses and driven by the murderer Tobias Gill, who was hanged in the area in the 18th century.

== Transport ==
Walberswick is on the B1387 road which runs from the A12 south of Blythburgh to the village where it terminates. It is at the mouth of the River Blyth which forms part of Southwold Harbour. Some mooring points for smaller craft in the harbour lie on the Walberswick side of the river. The river is crossed by the Bailey Bridge, a footbridge, to the west of the village. This provides pedestrian and bicycle access across the river to Southwold. A passenger ferry, operated by a rowing boat, operates across the river closer to the centre of the village during the tourist season.

Walberswick railway station was on the narrow-gauge Southwold Railway which ran from Halesworth (railway station) to Southwold (railway station). The station was located to the west of the village around south of the crossing at the Bailey Bridge. The line and station closed on 11 April 1929. The nearest railway stations are in Halesworth and Darsham.

<text>William George &quot;Borneo&quot; Gregory (born May 14, 1957) is an American retired NASA astronaut and United States Air Force lieutenant colonel.

== Early life and education ==

Gregory was born in Lockport, New York, into an Albanian American family. He graduated from Lockport High School in 1975. Gregory is an Eagle Scout. He then attended the United States Air Force Academy, where he graduated with a degree in engineering sciences in 1979. After this, he went to Columbia University to get a master&#x27;s degree in engineering mechanics (1980), and Troy University to get another master&#x27;s in management (1984). He is also a member of the USAF Academy Association of Graduates.

== Career ==

Between 1981 and 1986, Gregory served as an operational fighter pilot flying the D and F models of the F-111. In this capacity, he served as an instructor pilot at RAF Lakenheath, UK, and Cannon Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico. He attended the USAF Test Pilot School in 1987. Between 1988 and 1990 Gregory served as a test pilot at Edwards AFB flying the F-4, A-7D, and all five models of the F-15. Having flown in excess of 40 types of aircraft, Gregory has accumulated over 5,000 hours of flight time.

Gregory retired as a captain at an air cargo carrier based in the U.S.

== NASA career ==

Selected by NASA in January 1990, Gregory became an astronaut in July 1991. Gregory&#x27;s technical assignments included: Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut office representative for Landing/Rollout, T-38 Flying Safety; Kennedy Space Center Astronaut Support Personnel (ASP); spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control; astronaut office representative for rendezvous and proximity operations; and Spacecraft Operations Branch Chief. He flew on STS-67 (1995) and has logged 400 hours in space. Gregory retired from the Air Force and left NASA in the Summer of 1999. He served as Vice President of Business Development for Qwaltec, Inc. in Tempe, Arizona, and was an airline pilot for a U.S. based cargo carrier.

Gregory served as the STS-67 pilot on the seven-person astronomical research mission aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Launching from the Kennedy Space Center on March 2, 1995, and landing at Edwards AFB on March 18, 1995, the crew established a new mission duration record of 16 days, 15 hours, 8 minutes and 46 seconds, while completing 262 orbits and traveling nearly seven million miles. This second flight of the ASTRO telescope primary payload also included numerous secondary payloads.

<doc id="598971" wikidata="Q1420659" url="?curid=598971" title="Fisher information">
<text>In mathematical statistics, the Fisher information is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable random variable &quot;X&quot; carries about an unknown parameter &quot;θ&quot; of a distribution that models &quot;X&quot;. Formally, it is the variance of the score, or the expected value of the observed information. 

The role of the Fisher information in the asymptotic theory of maximum-likelihood estimation was emphasized and explored by the statistician Sir Ronald Fisher (following some initial results by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth). The Fisher information matrix is used to calculate the covariance matrices associated with maximum-likelihood estimates. It can also be used in the formulation of test statistics, such as the Wald test.

In Bayesian statistics, the Fisher information plays a role in the derivation of non-informative prior distributions according to Jeffreys&#x27; rule. It also appears as the large-sample covariance of the posterior distribution, provided that the prior is sufficiently smooth (a result known as Bernstein–von Mises theorem, which was anticipated by Laplace for exponential families). The same result is used when approximating the posterior with Laplace&#x27;s approximation, where the Fisher information appears as the covariance of the fitted Gaussian.

Statistical systems of a scientific nature (physical, biological, etc.) whose likelihood functions obey shift invariance have been shown to obey maximum Fisher information. The level of the maximum depends upon the nature of the system constraints.

==Definition==
The Fisher information is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable random variable formula_1 carries about an unknown parameter formula_2 upon which the probability of formula_1 depends. Let formula_4 be the probability density function (or probability mass function) for formula_1 conditioned on the value of formula_2. It describes the probability that we observe a given outcome of formula_1, &quot;given&quot; a known value of formula_2. If formula_9 is sharply peaked with respect to changes in formula_2, it is easy to indicate the &quot;correct&quot; value of formula_2 from the data, or equivalently, that the data formula_1 provides a lot of information about the parameter formula_2. If formula_9 is flat and spread-out, then it would take many samples of formula_1 to estimate the actual &quot;true&quot; value of formula_2 that &quot;would&quot; be obtained using the entire population being sampled. This suggests studying some kind of variance with respect to formula_2.

Formally, the partial derivative with respect to formula_2 of the natural logarithm of the likelihood function is called the &quot;score&quot;. Under certain regularity conditions, if formula_2 is the true parameter (i.e. formula_1 is actually distributed as formula_4), it can be shown that the expected value (the first moment) of the score, evaluated at the true parameter value formula_2, is 0: 
:formula_23

The Fisher information is defined to be the variance of the score:
:formula_24

Note that formula_25. A random variable carrying high Fisher information implies that the absolute value of the score is often high. The Fisher information is not a function of a particular observation, as the random variable &quot;X&quot; has been averaged out.

If is twice differentiable with respect to &quot;θ&quot;, and under certain additional regularity conditions, then the Fisher information may also be written as
:formula_26
since
:formula_27
and
:formula_28
Thus, the Fisher information may be seen as the curvature of the support curve (the graph of the log-likelihood). Near the maximum likelihood estimate, low Fisher information will indicates that the maximum appears to be &quot;blunt&quot;, that is, there are many points in the neighborhood that provide a similar log-likelihood. Conversely, a high Fisher information indicates that the maximum is &quot;sharp&quot;.

=== Regularity conditions ===
The regularity conditions are as follows:

# The partial derivative of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;θ&quot;) with respect to &quot;θ&quot; exists almost everywhere. (It can fail to exist on a null set, as long as this set does not depend on &quot;θ&quot;.)
# The integral of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;θ&quot;) can be differentiated under the integral sign with respect to &quot;θ&quot;.
# The support of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;θ&quot;) does not depend on &quot;θ&quot;.

If &quot;θ&quot; is a vector then the regularity conditions must hold for every component of &quot;θ&quot;. It is easy to find an example of a density that does not satisfy the regularity conditions: The density of a Uniform(0, &quot;θ&quot;) variable fails to satisfy conditions 1 and 3. In this case, even though the Fisher information can be computed from the definition, it will not have the properties it is typically assumed to have.

=== In terms of likelihood ===
Because the likelihood of &quot;θ&quot; given &quot;X&quot; is always proportional to the probability &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;θ&quot;), their logarithms necessarily differ by a constant that is independent of &quot;θ&quot;, and the derivatives of these logarithms with respect to &quot;θ&quot; are necessarily equal. Thus one can substitute in a log-likelihood &quot;l&quot;(&quot;θ&quot;; &quot;X&quot;) instead of in the definitions of Fisher Information.

=== Samples of any size ===
The value &quot;X&quot; can represent a single sample drawn from a single distribution or can represent a collection of samples drawn from a collection of distributions. If there are &quot;n&quot; samples and the corresponding &quot;n&quot; distributions are statistically independent then the Fisher information will necessarily be the sum of the single-sample Fisher information values, one for each single sample from its distribution. In particular, if the &quot;n&quot; distributions are independent and identically distributed then the Fisher information will necessarily be &quot;n&quot; times the Fisher information of a single sample from the common distribution. Stated in other words, the Fisher Information of i.i.d. observations of a sample of size &quot;n&quot; from a population is equal to the product of &quot;n&quot; and the Fisher Information of a single observation from the same population.

===Informal derivation of the Cramér–Rao bound===
The Cramér–Rao bound states that the inverse of the Fisher information is a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator of &quot;θ&quot;. and provide the following method of deriving the Cramér–Rao bound, a result which describes use of the Fisher information.

Informally, we begin by considering an unbiased estimator formula_29. Mathematically, &quot;unbiased&quot; means that

:formula_30

This expression is zero independent of &quot;θ&quot;, so its partial derivative with respect to &quot;θ&quot; must also be zero. By the product rule, this partial derivative is also equal to

:formula_31

For each &quot;θ&quot;, the likelihood function is a probability density function, and therefore formula_32. By using the chain rule on the partial derivative of formula_33 and then dividing and multiplying by formula_34, one can verify that

:formula_35

Using these two facts in the above, we get

:formula_36

Factoring the integrand gives
:formula_37

Squaring the expression in the integral, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality yields

:formula_38

The second bracketed factor is defined to be the Fisher Information, while the first bracketed factor is the expected mean-squared error of the estimator formula_39. By rearranging, the inequality tells us that

:formula_40

In other words, the precision to which we can estimate &quot;θ&quot; is fundamentally limited by the Fisher information of the likelihood function.

Alternatively, the same conclusion can be obtained directly from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for random variables, formula_41, applied to the random variables formula_29 and formula_43, and observing that for unbiased estimators we haveformula_44

== Examples ==

=== Single-parameter Bernoulli experiment ===
A Bernoulli trial is a random variable with two possible outcomes, 0 and 1, with 1 having a probability of &quot;θ&quot;. The outcome can be thought of as determined by the toss of a biased coin, with the probability of heads (1) being &quot;θ&quot; and the probability of tails (0) being .

Let &quot;X&quot; be a Bernoulli trial of one sample from the distribution. The Fisher information contained in &quot;X&quot; may be calculated to be:
:formula_45

Because Fisher information is additive, the Fisher information contained in &quot;n&quot; independent Bernoulli trials is therefore
:formula_46

If formula_47 is one of the formula_48 possible outcomes of &quot;n&quot; independent Bernoulli trials and formula_49 is the &quot;j&quot; th outcome of the &quot;i&quot; th trial, then the probability of formula_47 is given by:

:formula_51
The mean of the &quot;i&quot; th trial is formula_52 
The expected value of the mean of a trial is:
:formula_53
where the sum is over all formula_48 possible trial outcomes. The expected value of the square of the means is:
:formula_55
so the variance in the value of the mean is:
:formula_56

It is seen that the Fisher information is the reciprocal of the variance of the mean number of successes in &quot;n&quot; Bernoulli trials. This is generally true. In this case, the Cramér–Rao bound is an equality.

=== Estimate &quot;θ&quot; from &quot;X&quot; ~ Bern (√&quot;θ&quot;) ===
As another toy example consider a random variable formula_1 with possible outcomes 0 and 1, with probabilities formula_58 and formula_59, respectively, for some formula_60. Our goal is estimating formula_2 from observations of formula_1.

The Fisher information reads in this caseformula_63This expression can also be derived directly from the change of reparametrization formula given below. More generally, for any sufficiently regular function formula_9 such that formula_65, the Fisher information to retrieve formula_2 from formula_67 is similarly computed to beformula_68

==Matrix form==
When there are &quot;N&quot; parameters, so that &quot;θ&quot; is an vector formula_69 the Fisher information takes the form of an matrix. This matrix is called the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and has typical element

:formula_70

The FIM is a positive semidefinite matrix. If it is positive definite, then it defines a Riemannian metric on the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional parameter space. The topic information geometry uses this to connect Fisher information to differential geometry, and in that context, this metric is known as the Fisher information metric.

Under certain regularity conditions, the Fisher information matrix may also be written as

:formula_71

The result is interesting in several ways:
*It can be derived as the Hessian of the relative entropy.
*It can be used as a Riemannian metric for defining Fisher-Rao geometry when it is positive-definite.
*It can be understood as a metric induced from the Euclidean metric, after appropriate change of variable.
*In its complex-valued form, it is the Fubini–Study metric.
*It is the key part of the proof of Wilks&#x27; theorem, which allows confidence region estimates for maximum likelihood estimation (for those conditions for which it applies) without needing the Likelihood Principle.
*In cases where the analytical calculations of the FIM above are difficult, it is possible to form an average of easy Monte Carlo estimates of the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood function as an estimate of the FIM. The estimates may be based on values of the negative log-likelihood function or the gradient of the negative log-likelihood function; no analytical calculation of the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood function is needed.

===Information orthogonal parameters===
We say that two parameter component vectors &quot;θ1&quot; and &quot;θ2&quot; are information orthogonal if the Fisher information matrix is block diagonal, with these components in separate blocks. Orthogonal parameters are easy to deal with in the sense that their maximum likelihood estimates are asymptotically uncorrelated. When considering how to analyse a statistical model, the modeller is advised to invest some time searching for an orthogonal parametrization of the model, in particular when the parameter of interest is one-dimensional, but the nuisance parameter can have any dimension.

===Singular statistical model===
If the Fisher information matrix is positive definite for all , then the corresponding statistical model is said to be &quot;regular&quot;; otherwise, the statistical model is said to be &quot;singular&quot;. Examples of singular statistical models include the following: normal mixtures, binomial mixtures, multinomial mixtures, Bayesian networks, neural networks, radial basis functions, hidden Markov models, stochastic context-free grammars, reduced rank regressions, Boltzmann machines.

In machine learning, if a statistical model is devised so that it extracts hidden structure from a random phenomenon, then it naturally becomes singular.

===Multivariate normal distribution===
The FIM for a &quot;N&quot;-variate multivariate normal distribution, formula_72 has a special form. Let the &quot;K&quot;-dimensional vector of parameters be formula_73 and the vector of random normal variables be formula_74. Assume that the mean values of these random variables are formula_75, and let formula_76 be the covariance matrix. Then, for formula_77, the (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) entry of the FIM is:
:formula_78

where formula_79 denotes the transpose of a vector, formula_80 denotes the trace of a square matrix, and:

: formula_81

Note that a special, but very common, case is the one where formula_82, a constant. Then

:formula_83

In this case the Fisher information matrix may be identified with the coefficient matrix of the normal equations of least squares estimation theory.

Another special case occurs when the mean and covariance depend on two different vector parameters, say, &quot;β&quot; and &quot;θ&quot;. This is especially popular in the analysis of spatial data, which often uses a linear model with correlated residuals. In this case,

: formula_84

where
: formula_85

==Properties==

===Chain rule===
Similar to the entropy or mutual information, the Fisher information also possesses a chain rule decomposition. In particular, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are jointly distributed random variables, it follows that: 
:formula_86

where formula_87 and formula_88 is the Fisher information of &quot;Y&quot; relative to formula_2 calculated with respect to the conditional density of &quot;Y&quot; given a specific value &quot;X&quot; = &quot;x&quot;.

As a special case, if the two random variables are independent, the information yielded by the two random variables is the sum of the information from each random variable separately:
:formula_90

Consequently, the information in a random sample of &quot;n&quot; independent and identically distributed observations is &quot;n&quot; times the information in a sample of size 1.

=== &quot;f&quot;-divergence ===

Given a convex function formula_91 that formula_92 is finite for all formula_93, formula_94, and formula_95, (which could be infinite), it defines an &quot;f&quot;-divergence formula_96. Then if formula_9 is strictly convex at formula_98, then locally at formula_99, the Fisher information matrix is a metric, in the sense thatformula_100where formula_101 is the distribution parametrized by formula_2. That is, it&#x27;s the distribution with pdf formula_103.

In this form, it is clear that the Fisher information matrix is a Riemannian metric, and varies correctly under a change of variables. (see section on Reparameterization.)

===Sufficient statistic===
The information provided by a sufficient statistic is the same as that of the sample &quot;X&quot;. This may be seen by using Neyman&#x27;s factorization criterion for a sufficient statistic. If &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is sufficient for &quot;θ&quot;, then
:formula_104

for some functions &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot;. The independence of &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) from &quot;θ&quot; implies
:formula_105

and the equality of information then follows from the definition of Fisher information. More generally, if is a statistic, then

:formula_106

with equality if and only if &quot;T&quot; is a sufficient statistic.

===Reparameterization===
The Fisher information depends on the parametrization of the problem. If &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;η&quot; are two scalar parametrizations of an estimation problem, and &quot;θ&quot; is a continuously differentiable function of &quot;η&quot;, then
:formula_107

where formula_108 and formula_109 are the Fisher information measures of &quot;η&quot; and &quot;θ&quot;, respectively.

In the vector case, suppose formula_110 and formula_111 are &quot;k&quot;-vectors which parametrize an estimation problem, and suppose that formula_110 is a continuously differentiable function of formula_111, then,
:formula_114

where the (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;)th element of the &quot;k&quot; × &quot;k&quot; Jacobian matrix formula_115 is defined by
: formula_116
and where formula_117 is the matrix transpose of formula_118

In information geometry, this is seen as a change of coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, and the intrinsic properties of curvature are unchanged under different parametrizations. In general, the Fisher information matrix provides a Riemannian metric (more precisely, the Fisher–Rao metric) for the manifold of thermodynamic states, and can be used as an information-geometric complexity measure for a classification of phase transitions, e.g., the scalar curvature of the thermodynamic metric tensor diverges at (and only at) a phase transition point.

In the thermodynamic context, the Fisher information matrix is directly related to the rate of change in the corresponding order parameters. In particular, such relations identify second-order phase transitions via divergences of individual elements of the Fisher information matrix.

===Isoperimetric inequality===
The Fisher information matrix plays a role in an inequality like the isoperimetric inequality. Of all probability distributions with a given entropy, the one whose Fisher information matrix has the smallest trace is the Gaussian distribution. This is like how, of all bounded sets with a given volume, the sphere has the smallest surface area.

The proof involves taking a multivariate random variable formula_1 with density function formula_9 and adding a location parameter to form a family of densities formula_121. Then, by analogy with the Minkowski–Steiner formula, the &quot;surface area&quot; of formula_1 is defined to be
:formula_123
where formula_124 is a Gaussian variable with covariance matrix formula_125. The name &quot;surface area&quot; is apt because the entropy power formula_126 is the volume of the &quot;effective support set&quot;, so formula_127 is the &quot;derivative&quot; of the volume of the effective support set, much like the Minkowski-Steiner formula. The remainder of the proof uses the entropy power inequality, which is like the Brunn–Minkowski inequality. The trace of the Fisher information matrix is found to be a factor of formula_127.

==Applications==

===Optimal design of experiments===
Fisher information is widely used in optimal experimental design. Because of the reciprocity of estimator-variance and Fisher information, &quot;minimizing&quot; the &quot;variance&quot; corresponds to &quot;maximizing&quot; the &quot;information&quot;.

When the linear (or linearized) statistical model has several parameters, the mean of the parameter estimator is a vector and its variance is a matrix. The inverse of the variance matrix is called the &quot;information matrix&quot;. Because the variance of the estimator of a parameter vector is a matrix, the problem of &quot;minimizing the variance&quot; is complicated. Using statistical theory, statisticians compress the information-matrix using real-valued summary statistics; being real-valued functions, these &quot;information criteria&quot; can be maximized.

Traditionally, statisticians have evaluated estimators and designs by considering some summary statistic of the covariance matrix (of an unbiased estimator), usually with positive real values (like the determinant or matrix trace). Working with positive real numbers brings several advantages: If the estimator of a single parameter has a positive variance, then the variance and the Fisher information are both positive real numbers; hence they are members of the convex cone of nonnegative real numbers (whose nonzero members have reciprocals in this same cone).

For several parameters, the covariance matrices and information matrices are elements of the convex cone of nonnegative-definite symmetric matrices in a partially ordered vector space, under the Loewner (Löwner) order. This cone is closed under matrix addition and inversion, as well as under the multiplication of positive real numbers and matrices. An exposition of matrix theory and Loewner order appears in Pukelsheim.

The traditional optimality criteria are the information matrix&#x27;s invariants, in the sense of invariant theory; algebraically, the traditional optimality criteria are functionals of the eigenvalues of the (Fisher) information matrix (see optimal design).

===Jeffreys prior in Bayesian statistics===
In Bayesian statistics, the Fisher information is used to calculate the Jeffreys prior, which is a standard, non-informative prior for continuous distribution parameters.

===Computational neuroscience===
The Fisher information has been used to find bounds on the accuracy of neural codes. In that case, &quot;X&quot; is typically the joint responses of many neurons representing a low dimensional variable &quot;θ&quot; (such as a stimulus parameter). In particular the role of correlations in the noise of the neural responses has been studied.

===Epidemiology===
Fisher information was used to study how informative different data sources are for estimation of the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2.

=== Machine learning ===
The Fisher information is used in machine learning techniques such as elastic weight consolidation, which reduces catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks.

Fisher information can be used as an alternative to the Hessian of the loss function in second-order gradient descent network training.

=== Color discrimination ===

Using a Fisher information metric, da Fonseca et. al investigated the degree to which MacAdam ellipses (color discrimination ellipses) can be derived from the response functions of the retinal photoreceptors.

==Relation to relative entropy==

Fisher information is related to relative entropy. The relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence, between two distributions formula_129 and formula_130 can be written as
:formula_131

Now, consider a family of probability distributions formula_103 parametrized by formula_133. Then the Kullback–Leibler divergence, between two distributions in the family can be written as
:formula_134

If formula_2 is fixed, then the relative entropy between two distributions of the same family is minimized at formula_136. For formula_137 close to formula_2, one may expand the previous expression in a series up to second order:

:formula_139

But the second order derivative can be written as 
:formula_140

Thus the Fisher information represents the curvature of the relative entropy of a conditional distribution with respect to its parameters.

==History==
The Fisher information was discussed by several early statisticians, notably F. Y. Edgeworth. For example, Savage says: &quot;In it [Fisher information], he [Fisher] was to some extent anticipated (Edgeworth 1908–9 esp. 502, 507–8, 662, 677–8, 82–5 and references he [Edgeworth] cites including Pearson and Filon 1898 [. . .]).&quot; There are a number of early historical sources and a number of reviews of this early work.

<text>Sidney McNeill &quot;Sid&quot; Gutierrez (Colonel, USAF, Ret.) (born June 27, 1951), is an American pilot and former NASA astronaut. Since retiring from NASA, Gutierrez has worked in several leadership positions at Sandia National Laboratories and Rocket Crafters Inc.

== Early life and education==
Gutierrez was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He graduated from Valley High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1969. He then received his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973 and a Master of Arts degree in management from Webster University in 1977.

==Career==
Gutierrez was a member of the National Collegiate Championship Air Force Academy Parachute Team with over 550 jumps and a Master Parachutist rating. After graduation from the Academy, he completed Undergraduate Pilot Training at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas. He remained there as a T-38 instructor pilot from 1975 through 1977. In 1978 Gutierrez was assigned to the 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base, Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he flew the F-15 Eagle. He attended the USAF Test Pilot School in 1981 and was assigned to the F-16 Falcon Combined Test Force after graduation. While there, Gutierrez served as primary test pilot for airframe and propulsion testing on the F-16 aircraft. Test projects included the F-100 Digital Electronic Engine Cons, F-16C &amp; D Model Structural and Performance Testing, F-16 Maximum Performance Braking Tests, and F-16 Mobile Arrestment Qualification.

He has logged over 4,500 hours flying time in approximately 30 different types of airplanes, sailplanes, balloons, and rockets.

===NASA experience===
Selected by NASA in May 1984, Gutierrez became an astronaut in June 1985. In his first technical assignment, he served as commander for the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), flying simulated missions to verify Shuttle flight software. Following the Shuttle Challenger accident he served as an action officer for the Associate Administrator for Space Flight at NASA Headquarters. His duties included coordinating requests from the Presidential Commission and the U.S. Congress during the investigation. In 1986 and 1987, he participated in the recertification of the Space Shuttle Main Engines, Main Propulsion System, and External Tank. In 1988, he became the Astronaut Office lead for Shuttle software development, verification, and future requirements definition. In 1989 he supported launches of STS-28, 30, 32, 33 and 34 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

A veteran of two space flights, he has logged over 488 hours in space. He was the pilot on STS-40 (June 5 – 14, 1991) and was the spacecraft commander on STS-59 (April 9 – 20, 1994). After his first flight, Gutierrez served as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) - the voice link between the flight crew and mission control - for STS-42, 45, 46, 49 and 52. In 1992 he became the Astronaut Office Branch Chief for Operations Development, overseeing ascent, entry, abort, software, rendezvous, Shuttle systems, main engines, solid rocket boosters, external tank, and landing and rollout issues.

In September 1994, Gutierrez retired from the U.S. Air Force and NASA, returned to his native home of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined Sandia National Laboratories. From September 1994 to March 1995, he served as Manager for their Strategic Initiatives Department. In March he became Manager of the Airborne Sensors and Integration Department in the Exploratory Systems Development Center. He also served as Chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Technical Excellence Committee Spaceport Task Force.

Gutierrez serves on the board of directors of the Texas-New Mexico Power Company and Goodwill Industries of New Mexico and is a member of the New Mexico Space Center&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s Commission.

He is a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, the Air Force Association, the U.S. Air Force Academy Association of Graduates, the Society of Space Explorers, and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology Board of Regents (until January 2007).

===Space flight experience===

STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1), a dedicated space and life sciences mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 5, 1991. SLS-1 was a nine-day mission during which the crew performed experiments that explored how humans, animals, and cells respond to microgravity and re-adapt to Earth&#x27;s gravity on return. Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation. Following 146 orbits of the Earth, Columbia and her crew returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 14, 1991. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes, 20 seconds.

STS-59 Space Radar Laboratory (SRL-1), part of Mission to Planet Earth, was an eleven-day flight dedicated to the study of the Earth and the atmosphere around it. The two primary payloads were the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and Measurement of Air Pollution from Space (MAPS). The crew completed over 400 precise maneuvers (a Shuttle record) to properly point the radar, imaged over 400 selected sites with approximately 14,000 photographs (a Shuttle record) and recorded enough data to fill 26,000 encyclopedias. Areas of investigation included ecology, oceanography, geology, and hydrology. Launching on April 9, 1994, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Endeavour and her crew of six completed 183 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards AFB, California, on April 20, 1994.

=== Post-NASA career ===

==== Business ====
Gutierrez retired from the Air Force and NASA in 1994 and joined Sandia National Laboratories, where he served in various senior leadership positions.

<text>James Dean Bradfield (born 21 February 1969) is a Welsh singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. He is known for being the lead vocalist and guitarist for the Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. His cousin Sean Moore is also a member.

== Early life ==
James Dean Bradfield was born in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, only son of Monty and Sue Bradfield. His father was a carpenter and trade unionist. Bradfield was raised in a terraced house at Pontllanfraith. He attended the local Oakdale Comprehensive School where he suffered years of cruelty and bullying (he claims he was &quot;a Woody Allen-esque little nerd&quot;) for his name, lazy eye (nicknamed Crossfire), musical bent and small size. James formed a close relationship with three friends: his cousin Sean Moore, who lived with James and his family throughout their childhood after his own parents&#x27; divorce, and future bandmates Nicky Wire and Richey Edwards.

Bradfield loved to run and was a steeplechaser, and soon grew fond of punk rock band The Clash, although his earliest musical love was ELO. He gave up his dream of &quot;being like Napoleon&quot; and decided that he wanted to be a rock star. He learned to play guitar by learning how to play Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27;s &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; with the curtains drawn in his parents&#x27; front room.

== Solo career ==

In late April 2006, a track from Bradfield&#x27;s debut solo single entitled &quot;That&#x27;s No Way to Tell a Lie&quot; premiered on Janice Long&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 2. It became the first single from the album and was released on 10 July while the album, entitled &quot;The Great Western&quot;, was released on 24 July. The single debuted at No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart while the album debuted at No. 22 on the album chart. The positions were considered relatively successful considering the lack of promotion.

In support of the album, Bradfield played a series of solo gigs in May 2006 in Manchester, Glasgow, Dundee, Nottingham, Birmingham, and London. The setlists consisted of tracks from &quot;The Great Western&quot; as well as several Manics tracks including &quot;This Is Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Ocean Spray&quot;. He also played one further date at London ULU in June 2006, featuring a similar setlist to the other gigs. Bradfield also performed at the 2006 V Festival in late August. He embarked on his first full UK tour – consisting of 15 dates – in October. A second single, &quot;An English Gentleman&quot;, was lifted from &quot;The Great Western&quot; before the tour and entered the UK chart at No. 31 on 1 October 2006.

The second album by Bradfield, &quot;Even in Exile&quot;, was confirmed in March 2020 to &quot;NME&quot; alongside the announcement of a 2021 Manics album. That June, the album was confirmed to be inspired by the life and death of Chilean communist activist Víctor Jara, with lyrics written as unpublished poetry by Patrick Jones. Two tracks, &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a War&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Seeking the Room With the Three Windows&quot; were released the same day. The next week, the album was given a title and date alongside the launch of its first single, &quot;The Boy From the Plantation&quot;, which debuted on Steve Lamacq&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album was released on 14 August 2020 on digital, CD, cassette, and vinyl and entered the UK charts at No. 6, giving Bradfield his first solo top 10 album.

== Personal life ==
Despite having once said &quot;I always get bored of the company of women really quickly&quot;, he married the band&#x27;s PR agent Mylène Halsall in a ceremony in Florence, Italy, on 11 July 2004. The couple have two children. He is a supporter of Cardiff Blues and Nottingham Forest. In 2015, Bradfield and fellow Manic Sean Moore went to Patagonia in aid of the Velindre charity.

His current research is in planetary science studying the moon Europa, and other solar system bodies in the search for life beyond Earth.

==NASA career==
Grunsfeld was selected by NASA in March 1992 as an astronaut candidate and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space. Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS). As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility. The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for the International Space Station, using object-oriented programming techniques. Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office supporting Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development. Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office. Following STS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch, and worked on the Orbital Space Plane, exploration concepts, and technologies for use beyond low-Earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch. He served as NASA Chief Scientist assigned to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004. In January 2012, he became the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, replacing Ed Weiler.

Grunsfeld has been actively engaged in communicating space science topics to the public through interviews, public lectures, and television appearances. He was interviewed by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Astrobiology Magazine&quot; about the James Webb Space Telescope and at the Science with Hubble Space Telescope III conference in Venice, Italy, about carrying out repairs and upgrades on the Hubble Space Telescope. His public lectures include &quot;Hugging Hubble&quot; at the Space Telescope Science Institute&#x27;s May, 2010, Symposium, &quot;Big Science Questions&quot; at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Aspen Center for Physics and &quot;The Hubble Story&quot; presented as a special public lecture at Oxford University&#x27;s department of physics. He has made several television appearances to discuss the successful landing of the Mars &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover in August 2012 and its mission, including appearances on the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; with Judy Woodruff, the &quot;Colbert Report&quot;, and on NASA television.

On April 5, 2016, Grunsfield announced his retirement from NASA, starting April 30.

==Spaceflight experience==

STS-67/Astro-2 (March 2–18, 1995) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second flight of the Astro observatory, a unique complement of three ultra-violet telescopes. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.

STS-81 (January 12–22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia&#x27;s Mir space station, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Grunsfeld served as the flight engineer on this flight. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. During this flight, Grunsfeld placed a phone call to NPR&#x27;s auto-repair radio show, &quot;Car Talk&quot;. In this call he complained about the performance of his serial-numbered, Rockwell-manufactured &quot;government van&quot;. To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter and smoother for another six and a half, and then the engine would stop with a jolt. He went on to state that the brakes of the vehicle, when applied, would glow red-hot, and that the vehicle&#x27;s odometer displayed &quot;about 60 million miles&quot;. This created some consternation for the hosts, until they noticed the audio of Grunsfeld&#x27;s voice, being relayed from Mir via TDRS satellite, sounded similar to that of Tom Hanks in the then-recent film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, after which they realized the call was from space and the government van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle.

STS-103 (December 19–27, 1999) was an eight-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new gyroscopes and scientific instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVA). Grunsfeld performed two spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 23 minutes. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.

STS-109 (March 1–12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope installing a new digital camera, a cooling system for the infrared camera, new solar arrays and a new power system. HST servicing and upgrades were accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of five EVAs in five consecutive days. Grunsfeld served as the payload commander on STS-109 in charge of the space walking activities and the Hubble payload. He also performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes, including the installation of the new Power Control Unit. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.

STS-125 (May 11–24, 2009) was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A May 11, 2009, at 2:01 p.m. EDT, and landed on May 24, 2009 at California&#x27;s Edwards Air Force Base. During the mission, Grunsfeld performed three of the mission&#x27;s five back-to-back spacewalks, which installed two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope: The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six new gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules, to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. One issue Grunsfeld and his crew experienced during the overhaul was the stripping of 10mm bolts due to improper assembly and technique which he discussed again on Car Talk.

Grunsfeld has logged over 58 days in space, including eight space walks totaling 58 hours and 30 minutes.

==Space Telescope Science Institute==
According to a NASA press release in January 2010, Grunsfeld indicated he would leave the agency to serve as deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. There he helped prepare the institute for operations with NASA&#x27;s planned James Webb Space Telescope. He also became a research professor in the Johns Hopkins University department of physics and astronomy in July, 2010.

==Mountaineering==
Grunsfeld appeared on the PBS &quot;NOVA&quot; episode &quot;Deadly Ascent&quot;, which showed him climbing Denali, the highest peak in North America, in June 2000. Grunsfeld, along with Howard Donner, (a consultant to NASA) conducted research into the effects of body temperature at high altitudes by using internal thermometers swallowed in pill form. He was able to climb to an altitude of 18,200 feet before one of the team members had difficulty forcing the team to turn back. Grunsfeld was inspired by Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, and Brad Washburn in mountaineering.

In June 2004, Grunsfeld returned to Denali while on leave from NASA and successfully led a team of fellow NASA climbers that summitted. He is the one of two astronauts to have climbed to the top of Denali.

<doc id="598987" wikidata="Q134239" url="?curid=598987" title="Purple sulfur bacteria">
<text>The purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) are part of a group of Pseudomonadota capable of photosynthesis, collectively referred to as purple bacteria. They are anaerobic or microaerophilic, and are often found in stratified water environments including hot springs, stagnant water bodies, as well as microbial mats in intertidal zones. Unlike plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria do not use water as their reducing agent, and therefore do not produce oxygen. Instead, they can use sulfur in the form of sulfide, or thiosulfate (as well, some species can use H2, Fe2+, or NO2−) as the electron donor in their photosynthetic pathways. The sulfur is oxidized to produce granules of elemental sulfur. This, in turn, may be oxidized to form sulfuric acid.

The purple sulfur bacteria are largely divided into two families, the Chromatiaceae and the Ectothiorhodospiraceae, which produce internal and external sulfur granules respectively, and show differences in the structure of their internal membranes. They make up part of the order Chromatiales, included in the Gammaproteobacteria. The genus &quot;Halothiobacillus&quot; is also included in the Chromatiales, in its own family, but it is not photosynthetic.

==Characteristics of purple sulfur bacteria==
Major photosynthetic pigments: Bacteriochlorophylls a or b

Location of photosynthetic pigments: Plasma membrane and chromatophore (lamellar membrane complexes that are continuous with the plasma membrane)

Photosynthetic electron donors: H2, H2S, S

Sulfur deposition: Inside the cell

Metabolic type: Photolithoautotroph

== Ecology ==
=== Habitat ===
Purple sulfur bacteria are generally found in illuminated anoxic zones of lakes and other aquatic habitats where hydrogen sulfide accumulates and also in &quot;sulfur springs&quot; where geochemically or biologically produced hydrogen sulfide can trigger the formation of blooms of purple sulfur bacteria. Anoxic conditions are required for photosynthesis; these bacteria cannot thrive in oxygenated environments.

The most favorable lakes for the development of purple sulfur bacteria are meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes. Meromictic lakes stratify because they have denser (usually saline) water in the bottom and less dense (usually fresh water) nearer the surface. Growth of purple sulfur bacteria is also supported by the layering in holomictic lakes. These lakes are thermally stratified; in the spring and summer time, water at the surface is warmed, making it less dense than underlying colder water, which provides sufficiently stable stratification for purple sulfur bacteria growth. If sufficient sulfate is present to support sulfate reduction, the sulfide, produced in the sediments, diffuses upward into the anoxic bottom waters, where purple sulfur bacteria can form dense cell masses, called blooms, usually in association with green phototrophic bacteria.

Purple sulfur bacteria can also be found and are a prominent component in intertidal microbial mats. Mats, such as the Sippewissett Microbial Mat, have dynamic environments due to the flow of tides and incoming fresh water leading to similarly stratified environments as meromictic lakes. Purple sulfur bacteria growth is enabled as sulfur is supplied from the death and decomposition of microorganisms located above them within these intertidal pools. The stratification and sulfur source allows the PSB to grow in these intertidal pools where the mats occur. The PSB can help stabilize these microbial mat environment sediments through the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances that can bind the sediments in the pools.

===Ecological significance===
Purple sulfur bacteria are able to affect their environment by contributing to nutrient cycling, and by using their metabolism to alter their surroundings. They are able to play a significant role in primary production suggesting that these organisms affect the carbon cycle through carbon fixation. Purple sulfur bacteria also contribute to the phosphorus cycle in their habitat, and the iron cycle. Through upwelling of these organisms, phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in the oxic layer of lakes, is recycled and provided to heterotrophic bacteria for use. This indicates that although purple sulfur bacteria are found in the anoxic layer of their habitat, they are able to promote the growth of many heterotrophic organisms by supplying inorganic nutrients to the above oxic layer. Another form of recycling of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter by purple sulfur bacteria is through the food chain; they act as a source of food to other organisms.

Some purple sulfur bacteria have evolved to optimize their environmental conditions for their own growth. For example, in the South Andros Black Hole in the Bahamas, purple sulfur bacteria adopted a new characteristic in which they are able to use their metabolism to radiate heat energy into their surroundings. Due to the inefficiency of their carotenoids, or light-harvesting centres, the organisms are able to release excess light energy as heat energy. This adaptation allows them to compete more effectively within their environment. By raising the temperature of the surrounding water, they create an ecological niche which supports their own growth, while also allowing them to outcompete other non-thermotolerant organisms.

== Growth in meromictic lakes ==
Meromictic lakes are permanently stratified lakes produced by a gradient of saline concentrations. The highly salinated bottom layer is separated from the top layer of fresh water by the chemocline, where the salinity changes drastically. Due to the large difference in density, the upper and lower layers do not mix, resulting in an anoxic environment below the chemocline. This anoxic environment with light and sufficient sulfide availability is ideal for purple sulfur bacteria.

A study done at the Mahoney Lake suggested that purple sulfur bacteria contributes to the recycling of the inorganic nutrient, phosphorus. The upwelling of purple sulfur bacteria into the top layer of water creates a source of bound phosphorus, and phosphatase activity releases this phosphorus into the water. The soluble phosphorus is then incorporated into heterotrophic bacteria for use in developmental processes. In this way, purple sulfur bacteria participates in the phosphorus cycle and minimizes nutrient loss.

== Biomarkers ==
Purple sulfur bacteria make conjugated pigments called carotenoids that function in the light harvesting complex. When these organisms die and sink, some pigment molecules are preserved in modified form in the sediments. One carotenoid molecule produced, okenone, is diagenetically altered to the biomarker okenane. The discovery of okenane in marine sediments implies the presence of purple sulfur bacteria during the time of burial. Okenane has been identified in one sedimentary outcrop from Northern Australia dating to 1.64 billion years ago. The authors of the study concluded that, based on the presence of purple sulfur bacteria&#x27;s biomarker, the Paleoproterozoic ocean must have been anoxic and sulfidic at depth. This finding provides evidence for the Canfield Ocean hypothesis.

== Bioremediation ==
Purple sulfur bacteria can contribute to a reduction of environmentally harmful organic compounds and odour emission in manure wastewater lagoons where they are known to grow. Harmful compounds such as methane, a greenhouse gas, and hydrogen sulfide, a pungent, toxic compound, can be found in wastewater lagoons. PSB can help lower the concentration of both, and others.

Harmful organic compounds can be removed through photoassimilation, the uptake of carbon by organisms through photosynthesis. When PSB in the lagoons perform photosynthesis they can utilize the carbon from harmful compounds, such as methane, as their carbon source. This removes methane, a greenhouse gas, from the lagoon and reduces the lagoons&#x27; atmospheric pollution affect.

H2S can act as a sulfur source for PSB during these same photosynthetic processes that remove the organic compounds. The use of H2S as a reducing agent by PSB removes it from the lagoon and leads to a reduction of odour and toxicity in the lagoons.

<doc id="598988" wikidata="Q7868835" url="?curid=598988" title="USS Denver (LPD-9)">
<text>USS &quot;Denver&quot; (LPD-9), an , was the third ship of United States Navy to bear this name. &quot;Denver&quot;″s keel was laid on 7 July 1964 at Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company, Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 23 January 1965, christened by Mrs. Ann Daniels Love, wife of John A. Love, the former governor of Colorado, and commissioned on 26 October 1968. After 46 years of service, &quot;Denver&quot; was decommissioned at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam on 14 August 2014. At the time of her decommissioning, &quot;Denver&quot; was the oldest deployable warship in the U.S. Navy, and was one of the last active warships to have served in Vietnam.

==History==
===Vietnam War===
In 1970, &quot;Denver&quot; played a key role in the SS &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; incident. When &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; was commandeered by two mutinous crew members on 14 March 1970, &quot;Denver&quot; was immediately dispatched to intercept and recapture &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;. &quot;Denver&quot; never really caught up with &quot;Columbian Eagle&quot;, and sat outside the limits of Cambodia (to where &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; had been diverted) for a few days then departed the area.

On 21 July 1972 United States Marine Corps AH-1 helicopters operating from &quot;Denver&quot; attacked North Vietnamese barges north-northwest of Đồng Hới.

In April 1975, &quot;Denver&quot; participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam.

===Somalia Conflict 1993===

&quot;Denver&quot; left her home port of San Diego on 3 September 1993 and deployed with 900 Marines and a platoon from Seal Team 5 to support operations in Somalia as part of United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II).

===Collision with USNS &quot;Yukon&quot;===
On 13 July 2000, the ship was participating in a refueling exercise near the end of a deployment. &quot;Denver&quot;, off the coast of Oahu, collided with its refueling vessel, . &quot;Denver&quot;″s bow was seriously damaged. It remained in port at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs for two weeks.

===Typhoon Morakot===
Beginning on 17 August 2009 &quot;Denver&quot; started rendering humanitarian assistance to Taiwan due to the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot. &quot;Denver&quot; was tasked independently to render aid with two embarked squadrons, HM-14 and HSC-25.

Cooperating closely with Taiwan Army and Air Force, they were supporting efforts by airlifting food, medical supplies, and providing heavy lift support for earth moving equipment to assist with recovery efforts. Due to the sensitive nature surrounding Taiwan, especially with the One China policy, the Department of Defense did not publicly announce relief efforts. &quot;Denver&quot; was planned to be in the vicinity of Taiwan until 22 August 2009 to render aid to the people of Taiwan. &quot;Denver&quot; had just completed the exercise Talisman Saber 2009 and was on her way to her homeport when she was directly tasked with this humanitarian mission.

===2008 hull swap===
In 2008 &quot;Denver&quot; replaced . The crew from &quot;Juneau&quot; took all relevant gear and documents from &quot;Juneau&quot; and transferred them to &quot;Denver&quot;. &quot;Denver&quot; was then home-ported at Sasebo Naval Base, Japan, where it would remain until being decommissioned.

===2009 Sumatra earthquakes===
&quot;Denver&quot; was sent to Sumatra to assist in the recovery efforts following the earthquakes there in September 2009.

===2010===
During the 2010 Fall Patrol, from 1 September to 25 November 2010, &quot;Denver&quot; accompanied and on a tour of Southeast Asia. During the patrol, &quot;Denver&quot; took part in the 60th anniversary of the invasion of Incheon, Korea and assisted the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Megi. On 17 November, &quot;Denver&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; became the first U.S. warships to visit Hong Kong&#x27;s Victoria Harbour in more than two years.

===2011===
The ship departed Sasebo in September 2011 for a patrol of the western Pacific. Accompanying the ship were and USS &quot;Essex&quot;.

===2012===
In fall 2012, &quot;Denver&quot; departed for the 31st MEU fall patrol. During certification exercises around Guam, &quot;Denver&quot;″s boilers suffered severe damage. After three weeks of repair at Guam, &quot;Denver&quot; left to continue patrol. &quot;Denver&quot; finished the patrol with limited power.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Denver&quot; was decommissioned on 14 August 2014 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam in Hawaii. She had been the oldest active duty ship in the US Navy behind . Upon &quot;Denver&quot;″s decommissioning, became the Navy&#x27;s second oldest ship. The US government had offered to sell the ship to Malaysia to replace KD &quot;Sri Inderapura&quot; which was destroyed by fire in an incident in 2009.

The Navy announced that would replace &quot;Denver&quot; in Sasebo in the summer of 2015.

On 22 July 2022, &quot;Denver&quot; was sunk during a sinking exercise (SINKEX), as part of a multinational exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2022, approximately northwest of Kauai, Hawaii. She was hit by U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launching long-range anti-ship missiles; United States Army AH-64 Apache helicopters shot air-to-ground Hellfire missiles, rockets, and 30 mm guns; and Marine Corps F/A-18C/D Hornets fired AGM-88 HARM missiles, followed by a Harpoon (AGM-84) missile, and JDAMs. She was also shelled by with her Mark 45 gun, Japanese Self Defence Force Type 12 surface-to-ship missiles and the U.S. Army&#x27;s High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, sinking her in of water in the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="598989" wikidata="Q557066" url="?curid=598989" title="Frederick D. Gregory">
<text>Frederick Drew Gregory (born January 7, 1941) is a former United States Air Force pilot, military engineer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut as well as former NASA Deputy Administrator. He also served briefly as NASA Acting Administrator in early 2005, covering the period between the departure of Sean O&#x27;Keefe and the swearing in of Michael D. Griffin.

==Early life and education==
Gregory was born on January 7, 1941, in Washington, D.C., His father was Francis A. Gregory, an educator who was assistant superintendent for D.C. Public Schools as well as the first Black president of the D.C. Public Library Board of Trustees. His father was given the honors of having the Francis A. Gregory Neighborhood Library named after him. His mother was Nora Drew Gregory, a lifelong educator as well as public library advocate. She was also the sister of noted African-American physician, surgeon and researcher Dr. Charles Drew, who developed improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge in developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II, saving thousands of Allied lives. Gregory&#x27;s great-grandfather was educator James Monroe Gregory. His family lore suggests he has an ancestor from Madagascar.

Gregory was raised in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Anacostia High School. He attended the United States Air Force Academy after being nominated by Adam Clayton Powell Jr.; there, he received his Air Force commission and an undergraduate degree in military engineering.

==Military career==
After graduating from the Air Force Academy, Gregory earned his wings after helicopter school, flew in Vietnam, transitioned to fighter aircraft, attended the Navy Test Pilot School, and then conducted testing as an engineering test pilot for both the Air Force and NASA. He also received a master&#x27;s degree in information systems from George Washington University.

During his time in the Air Force, Gregory logged approximately 7,000 hours in more than 50 types of aircraft as a helicopter, fighter and test pilot. He flew 550 combat rescue missions in Vietnam.

==NASA career==
Gregory was selected as an astronaut in January 1978. His technical assignments included: Astronaut Office representative at the Kennedy Space Center during initial Orbiter checkout and launch support for STS-1 and STS-2; Flight Data File Manager; lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM); Chief, Operational Safety, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Chief, Astronaut Training; and a member of the Orbiter Configuration Control Board and the Space Shuttle Program Control Board. Notably, he was one of the CAPCOM during the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. A veteran of three Shuttle missions he has logged about 456 hours in space. He served as pilot on STS-51B (April 29 to May 6, 1985), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-33 (November 22–27, 1989), and STS-44 (November 24 to December 1, 1991).

===STS-51B===

STS-51B/Spacelab-3 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985, with Gregory serving as pilot. The crew aboard the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; included spacecraft commander, Robert Overmyer; mission specialists, Norman Thagard, William E. Thornton, and Don Lind; and payload specialists, Taylor Wang and Lodewijk van den Berg. On this second flight of the laboratory developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), the crew conducted a broad range of scientific experiments ranging from space physics to the suitability of animal-holding facilities. The crew also deployed the Northern Utah Satellite (NUSAT). After seven days of around-the-clock scientific operations, &quot;Challenger&quot; and its laboratory cargo landed on the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985. Mission duration was 168 hours, 8 minutes, 47 seconds.

===STS-33===

When STS-33 launched at night, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989, Gregory became the first African-American to command a space flight. On board the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;, Gregory&#x27;s crew included the pilot, John Blaha, and three mission specialists, Manley (Sonny) Carter, Story Musgrave, and Kathryn Thornton. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a hard surface landing on Runway 04 at Edwards AFB, California. Mission duration was 120 hours, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.

===STS-44===

STS-44 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 24, 1991. During 110 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed their prime payload, the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. They worked on a variety of secondary payloads ranging from the Military Man in Space experiment designed to evaluate the ability of a space borne observer to gather information about ground troops, equipment and facilities, and also participated in extensive studies evaluating medical countermeasures to long duration space flight. The crew aboard the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot; included the pilot Tom Henricks; three mission specialists, Story Musgrave, Jim Voss, and Mario Runco Jr.; and Army payload specialist Tom Hennen. The mission concluded on December 1, 1991, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Mission duration was 166 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds. 

===NASA administration===

Gregory served at NASA Headquarters as Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (1992–2001), and was Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight (2001–2002). On August 12, 2002, Mr. Gregory was sworn in as NASA Deputy Administrator. In that role, he was responsible to the Administrator for providing overall leadership, planning, and policy direction for the Agency. The Deputy Administrator performs the duties and exercises the powers delegated by the Administrator, assists the Administrator in making final Agency decisions, and acts for the Administrator in his or her absence by performing all necessary functions to govern NASA operations and exercise the powers vested in the Agency by law. The Deputy Administrator articulates the Agency&#x27;s vision and represents NASA to the Executive Office of the President, Congress, heads of Federal and other appropriate Government agencies, international organizations, and external organizations and communities. From the departure of Sean O&#x27;Keefe on February 20, 2005, to the swearing in of Michael D. Griffin on April 14, 2005, he was the NASA Acting Administrator. He returned to the post of Deputy Administrator and on September 9, 2005, submitted his resignation. He was replaced on November 29, 2005, by Shana Dale.

==Personal life==
Gregory was married to the former Barbara Archer of Washington, D.C., until her death in 2008. They had two grown children. Frederick, D. Jr., a Civil Servant working in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (DOD), and a graduate of Stanford University and the University of Florid and Heather Lynn, who is a social worker and graduate of Sweet Briar College and the University of Maryland.

<doc id="598993" wikidata="Q888316" url="?curid=598993" title="Bob Weir">
<text>Robert Hall Weir ( ; né Parber, born October 16, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the group disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with the Other Ones, later known as the Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog, and Furthur, which he co-led with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge, and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to form the band Dead &amp; Company.

During his career with the Grateful Dead, Weir played mostly rhythm guitar and sang many of the band&#x27;s rock &amp; roll and country &amp; western songs. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

==Early life==
Weir was born in San Francisco, California, to John (Jack) Parber (1925–2015), of Italian and German ancestry, and a fellow college student, Phyllis Inskeep (1924–1997), of German, Irish, and English ancestry, who later gave him up for adoption; he was raised by his adoptive parents, Frederic Utter Weir and Eleanor ( Cramer) Weir, in Atherton. He began playing guitar at age thirteen after less successful experimentation with the piano and the trumpet. He had trouble in school because of undiagnosed dyslexia and he was expelled from nearly every school he attended, including Menlo School in Atherton and Fountain Valley School in Colorado, where he met future Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow.

==Career==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1963, 16-year-old Weir and an underage friend were wandering the back alleys of Palo Alto, looking for a club that would admit them, when they heard banjo music. They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan&#x27;s Music Store. They encountered a 21-year-old Jerry Garcia, oblivious to the date, waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. The Beatles significantly influenced their musical direction. &quot;The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band,&quot; said Bob Weir. &quot;What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn&#x27;t think of anything else more worth doing.&quot; Originally called Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions, the band was later renamed The Warlocks and eventually the Grateful Dead.
Weir played rhythm guitar and sang a large portion of the lead vocals through all of the Dead&#x27;s 30-year career. In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as &quot;Mickey and the Hartbeats&quot;, were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, &quot;Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band... Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby&#x27;s guitar playing.&quot; Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full-time.

The incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir&#x27;s guitar playing. Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir&#x27;s playing more clearly than ever and &quot;I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.&quot; Lesh described Weir&#x27;s playing as &quot;quirky, whimsical and goofy&quot; and noted his ability to play chord voicings on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).

In the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences.

Weir&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Ace&quot; appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were Keith Godchaux and his wife Donna, both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album&#x27;s release. A live version of the album&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Playing in the Band&quot;, had been issued on the &quot;Skull &amp; Roses&quot; album of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976, Weir played in the Bay Area band Kingfish with friends Matt Kelly and Dave Torbert. He later contributed to Kelly&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;A Wing and a Prayer&quot;, on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with Brent Mydland, who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band, Bobby and the Midnites.
Shortly before Garcia&#x27;s death in 1995, Weir formed another band, RatDog Revue, later shortened to RatDog. In RatDog, Weir performs covers of songs by various artists, including The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, and Willie Dixon while also performing many Grateful Dead songs. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album &quot;Evening Moods&quot;.
Weir has participated in the various reformations of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s members, including 1998, 2000, and 2002 stints as the Other Ones and in 2003, 2004 and 2009 as The Dead. In 2008 he performed in the two Deadheads for Obama concerts. In 2009 Bob Weir and Phil Lesh formed a new band called Furthur—so-named in honor of Ken Kesey&#x27;s famous psychedelically painted bus.

In 2011, Weir founded the Tamalpais Research Institute, also known as TRI Studios. TRI is a high-tech recording studio and virtual music venue, used to stream live concerts over the internet in high-definition.

In 2012, Weir toured with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes and singer/songwriter Jackie Greene as the Weir, Robinson, &amp; Greene Acoustic Trio.

Weir resuscitated RatDog in March 2013. The RatDog Quartet, featuring Weir, Jay Lane, Robin Sylvester, and Jonathan Wilson debuted on March 3, at the Sweetwater Music Hall. Jason Crosby was their featured guest at the first two shows.

On April 25, 2013, Weir collapsed onstage during a Furthur performance at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York. The band finished the show without him. He performed with the band two days later in Atlantic City, but on April 29 a representative announced that Weir would be &quot;unable to perform in any capacity for the next several weeks&quot; for unspecified reasons. Weir resumed performing that summer.

On April 23, 2014, &quot;The Other One: The Long Strange Trip of Bob Weir&quot; premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival directed by Mike Fleiss husband of Miss America 2012, Laura Kaeppeler.

On August 10, 2014, Weir abruptly canceled all of his upcoming appearances, according to The Huffington Post, &quot;The cancellations include all shows for the rest of the year with his band Ratdog, as well as a concert with Furthur&quot;. According to Jambase, Ratdog performed without Weir in Las Vegas in July 2014. &quot;A statement from the venue said Weir was &#x27;under the weather&#x27;.&quot;

In early July 2015, Weir joined the other original living members of the Grateful Dead —Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and Phil Lesh — for three shows at Soldier Field in Chicago. These four surviving members (known as the &quot;Core Four&quot;) were joined by Jeff Chimenti on keys and Phish&#x27;s Trey Anastasio on lead guitar and shared vocals, and Bruce Hornsby on piano. The reunion was 20 years nearly to the day since the band&#x27;s final concert with Jerry Garcia at the same venue in 1995. &quot;Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead&quot; was billed as the original four members&#x27; last performance together. Based on demand, two additional Fare Thee Well concerts were added to the series, performed in late June 2015 at Levi Stadium in California.
On October 5, 2015, Weir performed with Ratdog at a special celebratory 60th Birthday Bash for Steve Kimock. It was the first time Ratdog had performed again since the aforementioned cancellations of his 2014 summer tour.

In late 2015, Weir teamed up with former Grateful Dead bandmates Mickey Hart and Billy Kreutzmann as well as guitarist John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to form Dead &amp; Company. They played 22 shows starting at the end of October, concluding with a four show New Year&#x27;s run including two shows in San Francisco and two in Los Angeles, ending with a three set show on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The band concluded its final tour on July 16, 2023, at Oracle Park in San Francisco. On January 31, 2024 the band announced a residency at Sphere in Las Vegas, Nevada, to begin in May 2024. While eighteen shows were announced initially, the residency was extended to thirty shows, ending in August 2024.

In May 2016, Weir was a guest speaker and performer for the second annual Einstein Gala, in Toronto, Canada, an event honoring the legacy of Albert Einstein and new visionaries in the arts and sciences. Weir spoke about what science and innovation had meant to him. Weir performed a solo acoustic set, and was joined mid-set by guitarist Dan Kanter. In the same month, Weir also confirmed, in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, that he was writing a book.

In 2016, a live recording of Weir performing with The National was included on the massive &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. Weir&#x27;s 2012 collaboration with members of The National as part of The Bridge Session helped pave the way for the Grateful Dead tribute.

In June 2016, at the Bonnaroo Arts And Music Festival, Weir received the first ever Les Paul Spirit Award, from the Les Paul Foundation. &quot;I cannot think of anyone more fitting to be honored with the first annual Les Paul Spirit Award than Bob Weir. Not only is he an extraordinary talent who has given us an amazing array of legendary music, but he is an innovator who understands music, technologies and the spirit of Les Paul,&quot; said Michael Braunstein, executive director of the Les Paul Foundation. &quot;If Les were still alive today, I have absolutely no doubt that he and Bob would be experimenting together at TRI Studios or at Les&#x27;s house and the results would be extraordinary.&quot;
Weir received the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Americana Honors &amp; Awards in Nashville, TN.

In September 2016, Weir released a new album of &quot;cowboy songs&quot; titled &quot;Blue Mountain&quot;. The release was followed by a tour beginning in October 2016. The album was inspired by his time working as a ranch hand in Wyoming, when he was fifteen years old.

During the spring of 2018, Weir performed a series of concerts with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. The duo, with guest musicians, was billed as Bobby and Phil.

In 2018 Weir formed a band called Wolf Bros. Billed as Bob Weir &amp; Wolf Bros, the group initially was a trio, with Weir on guitar and vocals, Don Was on upright bass, and Jay Lane on drums. They toured the U.S. in the fall of 2018, the spring of 2019, and in early 2020. In late 2020 and early 2021 the band played several concerts at TRI Studios with Jeff Chimenti on keyboards and Greg Leisz on pedal steel guitar. After the first of these shows the band also added a horn and string section called the Wolfpack, comprising Brian Switzer on trumpet, Adam Theis on trombone, Sheldon Brown on saxophone, clarinet, and flute, Mads Tolling on violin, and Alex Kelly on cello. In the summer of 2021 this larger ensemble, now billed as Bobby Weir &amp; Wolf Bros, played several concerts in Colorado and California.

==Personal life==

Weir remained single throughout his years with the Grateful Dead, although he lived for several years (1969–1975) with Frankie Hart. Hart had been a go-go dancer at the Peppermint Lounge in New York, had worked in Apple Records American marketing department, for Apple Records in London, and had performed on the TV shows &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot;. She was allegedly the inspiration for the Robert Hunter-Bob Weir song &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;. Weir made her acquaintance through Mickey Hart, who dated her briefly. He met her following her first Grateful Dead show in New York in 1968. Her real name at that time was Frankie Azzara (from a previous marriage), but used the stage name &quot;Frankie Hart&quot; (after apparently &quot;borrowing&quot; Hart&#x27;s last name). Although she and Weir never married, she adopted his last name after moving in with him and was subsequently known as Frankie Weir.

On July 15, 1999, Weir married Natascha Münter in Mill Valley, California. Together, they have two daughters, Shala Monet Weir and Chloe Kaelia Weir. Bob Weir&#x27;s sister-in law is Leilani Münter, a former race car driver in the ARCA Racing Series circuit. Weir is a long term vegetarian and advocate for animal rights who was influential in the founding of Farm Sanctuary.

Weir is on the board of directors of the Rex Foundation, the Furthur Foundation, and HeadCount. He also is a member of the advisory board of the Jerry Garcia Foundation along with Peter Shapiro and Seth Rogin. He is an honorary member of the board of directors of the environmental organization Rainforest Action Network, along with Woody Harrelson, Bonnie Raitt, and John Densmore. He is also on the honorary board of directors of Little Kids Rock, a non-profit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in under-served public schools throughout the U.S.

==Guitars==

Early pictures of The Warlocks in concert show him playing a Gretsch Duo-Jet, and after the Warlocks became the Grateful Dead, Weir briefly played a Rickenbacker 365, a Guild Starfire IV semi-hollowbody (with Garcia playing an identical cherry red Starfire IV, which appears very similar to the Gibson ES-335) as well as a Fender Telecaster before settling on a cherry red 1965 Gibson ES-335 as his primary guitar for the following decade. Weir can also be seen playing a sunburst ES-335 in &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;, filmed in October 1974. During the early 1970s, Weir also used a Gibson ES-345, a 1961 or 1962 Gibson SG and a black Gibson Les Paul of indeterminate age in 1971.

In 1974, Weir began working with Jeff Hasselberger at Ibanez to develop a custom instrument. Weir began playing the Ibanez 2681 during the recording of &quot;Blues for Allah&quot;; this was a testbed instrument with sliding pickups that Hasselberger used to develop several additional 2681s for use onstage, as well as Weir&#x27;s custom &quot;Cowboy Fancy&quot; guitar, which he played from 1976 until the mid-1980s. Weir began using a Modulus Blackknife at that point, and continued to play the Blackknife, along with a hybrid Modulus/Casio guitar for the &quot;Space&quot; segment of Grateful Dead concerts for the rest of that band&#x27;s history. Weir&#x27;s acoustic guitars include several Martins, a Guild, an Ovation, and a line of Alvarez-Yairi signature models.

With his post-Grateful Dead bands, Weir has played a Modulus G3FH custom, a Gibson ES-335, and a 1956 Fender Telecaster previously owned by James Louis Parber, his late half-brother.

In August 2016, during a preview of Weir&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Blue Mountain&quot;, Weir stated that the only instrument he used during the recording of the album was a Martin acoustic guitar.

From 2017 onwards, Weir has collaborated with New York-based D&#x27;Angelico Guitars to produce several signature model instruments. The Premier, a semi-hollow guitar, was released in 2017, and the Deluxe Bedford, a solid-body, was released in 2020.

During that time she taught undergraduate physics labs and was the recipient of several research assistantships. She conducted research in low temperature solid state physics, including studies in electron tunneling and vibrational modes of absorbed molecular species on metallic substrates (surfaces) at liquid helium temperatures. Results of her research have been published in several journals.

Godwin is an instrument rated private pilot.

== NASA career ==
Godwin joined NASA in 1980, in the Payload Operations Division, Mission Operations Directorate, where she worked in payload integration (attached payloads and Spacelabs), and as a flight controller and payloads officer on several Space Shuttle missions.

Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Godwin became an astronaut in July 1986. Her technical assignments have included working with flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), and coordinating mission development activities for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), deployable payloads, and Spacelab missions. She also has served as chief of astronaut appearances, chief of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office and as the astronaut liaison to its Educational Working Group, deputy chief of the Astronaut Office, and deputy director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate. Godwin is currently the assistant to the director for exploration, Flight Crew Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center.

A veteran of four space flights, Godwin has logged over 38 days in space, including over ten EVA hours in two spacewalks. In 1991 she served as a mission specialist on STS-37, was the payload commander on STS-59 in 1994, flew on STS-76 in 1996, a &quot;Mir&quot; docking mission, and served on STS-108/International Space Station Flight UF-1 in 2001.

== Spaceflight experience ==
=== STS-37 ===

Godwin served as mission specialist 1 on the crew of STS-37. Atlantis was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B April 5, 1991, 14:22:45 UTC and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California, April 11, 1991, 13:55:29 UTC. During the 93 orbits of the mission, the crew deployed the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) to study gamma ray sources in the universe. GRO, at about , was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also conducted an unscheduled spacewalk to free the GRO high gain antenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed in microgravity environments (SHARE), a chemical processing apparatus to characterize the structure of biological materials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfect protein crystals than can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carried amateur radio equipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scan TV, and packet radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds.

=== STS-59 ===

Godwin served as payload commander on the crew of STS-59.
&quot;Endeavour&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A April 9, 1994, 11:05 UTC. STS-59 was the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth&#x27;s surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, April 20, 1994, 16:55 UTC after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours, 29 minutes.

=== STS-76 ===

Godwin served as mission specialist 3 on the crew of STS-76.
&quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B from March 22, 1996, 08:13:04 UTC. STS-76 was the third docking mission to the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. Following rendezvous and docking with &quot;Mir&quot;, transfer of a NASA astronaut to &quot;Mir&quot; for a 5-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of United States astronauts aboard &quot;Mir&quot; for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to &quot;Mir&quot; and returned over of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Godwin performed a six-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the &quot;Mir&quot; docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The packages will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which uses digital photography from the Shuttle for science and education. The STS-76 mission concluded with a successful landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, March 31, 1996, 13:28:57 UTC after 145 orbits of the Earth, traveling in 221 hours and 15 minutes.

=== STS-108 ===

Godwin served as mission specialist 1 on the crew of STS-108.
&quot;Endeavour&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B 5 December 2001 22:19:28 UTC. STS-108 was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station. &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s crew delivered the Expedition-4 crew and returned the Expedition-3 crew. The crew unloaded over of supplies, logistics and science experiments from the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and repacked over of items no longer needed on the station for return to Earth. Godwin used the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm to install the MPLM onto the Station Node, and participated in a spacewalk to wrap thermal blankets around ISS Solar Array Beta Gimbal Assemblies. STS-108 concluded with a successful landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility 17 December 2001 17:56:13 UTC after 185 Earth orbits, traveling in 283 hours and 36 minutes.

<doc id="598996" wikidata="Q3223416" url="?curid=598996" title="A Fighting Man of Mars">
<text>A Fighting Man of Mars is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the seventh of his Barsoom series. Burroughs began writing it on February 28, 1929, and the finished story was first published in &quot;The Blue Book Magazine&quot; as a six-part serial in the issues for April to September 1930. It was later published as a complete novel by Metropolitan in May 1931.

==Plot summary==
Like many other Burroughs stories, &quot;A Fighting Man of Mars&quot; resembles &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. The story is purportedly relayed back to earth via the Gridley Wave, a sort of super radio frequency previously introduced in &quot;Tanar of Pellucidar&quot;, the third of Burrough&#x27;s &quot;Pellucidar&quot; novels, which thus provides a link between the two series. The story-teller is Ulysses Paxton, protagonist of the previous novel, &quot;The Master Mind of Mars&quot;, but this story is not about him; rather, it is the tale of Tan Hadron of Hastor, a lowly, poor padwar (a low-ranking officer) who is in love with the beautiful, haughty Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor Hatan, a minor but rich noble. As he is only a padwar, Sanoma spurns him. Then Sanoma Tora is kidnapped, and the novel moves into high gear.

As Tan Hadron crosses Mars (&quot;Barsoom&quot;, as Burroughs calls it) searching for Sanoma Tora, he encounters some of Barsoom&#x27;s most ferocious beasts: huge, many-armed, flesh-eating white apes, gigantic spiders, and the insane cannibals of U-Gor. He also meets the mad scientist Phor Tak, who cackles &quot;Heigh-oo!&quot; and is crazed with the desire for revenge.

The initial simplicity of Burroughs&#x27; well-worn pursuit plot is elaborated by Hadron&#x27;s rescue of an escaped slave, Tavia, from a band of six-limbed Green Martians of Torquas, en route to the city of Jahar where Hadron believes Sanoma Tora has been taken. Tavia is an atypical Burroughs heroine; depicted as self-reliant and competent with weapons, witty and intelligent, she compares favorably for both reader and Hadron with beautiful but shallow Sanoma Tora, who ultimately shows herself unworthy of the virtuous hero. With the addition of Nur An, a disaffected Jaharian warrior, and another escaped woman slave, Phao, Hadron&#x27;s quest becomes more collaborative than Burroughs&#x27; usual, although Tavia, in an unsurprising plot development, is revealed to be a princess at the end.

==Copyright==
The copyright for this story was not renewed by December 31, 1955, in the United States and therefore is in the public domain. Nevertheless, LibriVox.org does not recognize this status.

The copyright for this story has expired in Australia, and thus now resides in the public domain there. The text is available via Project Gutenberg Australia.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; said that &quot;Burroughs&#x27;s choice of a model was a wise one. The Arabian Nights are corking good adventure stories in their own right&quot;.

==Influence==
In 1973, George Lucas used the first chapter of this novel as the basis for an unfinished, two-page draft titled &quot;Journal of the Whills&quot;, the direct predecessor to &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

<text>The Bollingen Prize for Poetry is a literary honor bestowed on an American poet. Every two years, the award recognizes a poet for best new volume of work or lifetime achievement. It is awarded without nominations or submissions by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University.

==Inception and controversy==

The prize was established in 1948 by Paul Mellon, funded by a US $10,000 grant from the Bollingen Foundation to the Library of Congress. Both the prize and the foundation are named after the village of Bollingen, Switzerland and the Bollingen Tower, where Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung had his home. The inaugural prize, chosen by a jury of Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress, was first awarded to Ezra Pound for his collection of poems &quot;The Pisan Cantos&quot;.

The choice of a work by a man who had been a committed fascist sympathizer and who was then under indictment for treason in World War II for his anti-Semitic broadcasts infuriated many. A bitter controversy ensued in the press, and a congressional committee requested the Library of Congress disassociate itself from the award. The unused portion of the grant was returned to the Bollingen Foundation in 1949.

==Continuance through the Yale University Library==
The Bollingen Foundation decided to continue the program with the administrative tasks being handled by the Yale University Library. The prize was awarded annually from 1948 to 1963. In 1963, the amount of the award was increased to $5,000. After 1963, it was given every other year. The Bollingen Foundation was dissolved in 1968, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation took over funding. In 1973, the Mellon Foundation established an endowment of $100,000 to enable the Yale Library to continue awarding the prize in perpetuity.

In 1961, a similar prize was set up by the Bollingen Foundation for best translation. The prize for best translation was given out only from 1961-1968. It was first won by Robert Fitzgerald for his translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. It has also been won by Walter W. Arndt for his translation of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, and in 1963 by Richard Wilbur and Mona Van Duyn jointly.

<text>In botany, a stipe is a stalk that supports some other structure. The precise meaning is different depending on which taxonomic group is being described.

In the case of ferns, the stipe is only the petiole from the rootstock to the beginning of the leaf tissue, or lamina. The continuation of the structure within the lamina is then termed a rachis.

In flowering plants, the term is often used in reference to a stalk that sometimes supports a flower&#x27;s ovary. In orchids, the stipe or caudicle is the stalk-like support of the pollinia. It is a non-viscid band or strap connecting the pollinia with the viscidium (the viscid part of the rostellum or beak).

A stipe is also a structure found in organisms that are studied by botanists but that are no longer classified as plants. It may be the stem-like part of the thallus of a mushroom or a seaweed, and is particularly common among brown algae such as kelp. The stipe of a kelp often contains a central region of cells that, like the phloem of vascular plants, serves to transport nutrients within the alga.

<text>A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate.

Holdfasts vary in shape and form depending on both the species and the substrate type. The holdfasts of organisms that live in muddy substrates often have complex tangles of root-like growths. These projections are called  and similar structures of the same name are found on lichens. The holdfasts of organisms that live in sandy substrates are bulb-like and very flexible, such as those of sea pens, thus permitting the organism to pull the entire body into the substrate when the holdfast is contracted. The holdfasts of organisms that live on smooth surfaces (such as the surface of a boulder) have flattened bases which adhere to the surface. The organism derives no nutrition from this intimate contact with the substrate, as the process of liberating nutrients from the substrate requires enzymatically eroding the substrate away, thereby increasing the risk of the organism falling off the substrate.

The claw-like holdfasts of kelps and other algae differ from the roots of land plants, in that they have no absorbent function, instead serving only as an anchor.

<text>The Little Miami River () is a Class I tributary of the Ohio River that flows through five counties in southwestern Ohio in the United States. The Little Miami joins the Ohio River east of Cincinnati. It forms parts of the borders between Hamilton and Clermont counties and between Hamilton and Warren counties. The Little Miami River is one of 156 American rivers designated by the U.S. Congress or the Secretary of the Interior as a National Wild and Scenic River and lends its name to the adjacent Little Miami Scenic Trail.

==Hydrography==
The Little Miami River is a tributary of the Ohio River. It is part of a watershed that drains a area in 11 southwestern Ohio counties: Clark, Montgomery, Madison, Greene, Warren, Butler, Clinton, Clermont, Brown, Hamilton, and Highland. The river discharges on average into the Ohio River. An average of flow through the river proper; after heavy rains, the river flow may rise to .

Tributaries of the Little Miami include Beaver Creek, Sugar Creek, the East Fork Little Miami, North Fork, Todd&#x27;s Fork, Duck Creek, Caesar Creek, Massie Creek, and Turtle Creek. Yellow Springs Creek, fed in part by its tributary Birch Creek, join the Little Miami within the boundary of the Glen Helen Nature Preserve. The river&#x27;s main tributary, the East Fork of the Little Miami, was dammed in 1977 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create Harsha Lake, located in East Fork State Park. Similarly, in 1973, the Army Corps dammed Caesar Creek to create Caesar Creek Lake, located in Caesar Creek State Park.

The river&#x27;s headwaters, considered part of the North Fork, are located about from South Charleston in Clark County, near Plattsburgh. The river empties into the Ohio River at California, a neighborhood of Cincinnati in Hamilton County. Between the headwaters and the mouth, there is a decrease in elevation.

==History==
The Little Miami River is named for the Miami, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who lived in the region during the early days of white settlement. Historically, the river formed the eastern boundary of the Symmes Purchase and the western boundary of the Virginia Military District.

In 1967 The Ohio University Development Planning Institute (Athens, Ohio) published &quot;The Little Miami of Ohio; A Study of a Wild and Scenic River&quot;. This 56-page booklet, illustrated with maps and black and white photographs, first presented the idea of a corridor of parks and natural areas along the river.

In June 1967 Dayton newspaper editor Glenn Thompson would bring together educator Arthur Morgan, business leader Charles Sawyer, and outdoor enthusiast Corwin Fred to form Little Miami Incorporated, dedicated to the preservation of the Little Miami River. Mr. Thompson was the editor of the Dayton Journal-Herald in the late 1950s, and a strong advocate for the preservation of green space in the Miami Valley. The members of the newly formed Little Miami Incorporated would convince Ohio Congressman Clarence Brown to ask for inclusion of the Little Miami in the final list of 27 rivers to be studied for a proposed Scenic Rivers Bill.

The 1968 Wild and Scenic River Act designated portions of the Little Miami National Scenic River as Ohio&#x27;s first National Wild and Scenic River. On April 23 of following year, the Little Miami State Scenic River from Milford to the headwaters became Ohio&#x27;s first State Scenic River, due to legislation that predated the national act by a few months. The remainder of the river was added to the State Scenic River in 1971.

Hydropower of the Little Miami River was developed into the largest privately owned ammunition manufacturing center between New England and the Mississippi River. Company towns for the Miami Powder Company and Peters Cartridge Company were built at Goes Station and Kings Mills, respectively. The portion of Peters Cartridge Company factory on the opposite side of the river from Kings Mills in Hamilton Township, which closed in 1944 and is now owned by DuPont, was declared a Superfund site in 1996. Since then, studies by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency have established that the site no longer poses an environmental hazard to the nearby river. Even so, the site was listed as a Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) site by the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2012 for copper, lead and mercury soil contamination. In September 2018, 15 acres of the 71-acre site was removed for the NPL after successful cleanup goals were achieved.

==Ecology==
The Little Miami River is home to at least 87 species of fish, as well as many species of turtles, frogs, water snakes, birds, mammals and invertebrates. The river contains 36 species of mussels, including two threatened species, one of which is endangered. Ohio considers five of the species to be endangered. Recently, zebra mussels and Asiatic clams have crowded out native species.

The river is protected by a number of nature preserves owned by Little Miami Inc., as well as by state and local parks (see below).

==Recreation==

The Little Miami River is a National Scenic River. A series of state and county parks and bike trails have been built along the river, primarily the Little Miami Scenic Trail, which is concurrent with the Buckeye Trail and Little Miami Scenic State Park. Most of these trails have been built along the abandoned rail grades that run along the river (see Rail trail). The Ohio to Erie Trail project, under construction, aims to link these trails to other trails statewide to create a single bike trail from Lake Erie to the Ohio River.

The Little Miami is also popular among canoers and anglers. There are several canoe liveries along its course and the smallmouth bass fishing in the river is among the best in the state. For a river its size and considering that it drains mainly agricultural land, the water quality of the Little Miami River is excellent. Visitors may see a variety of wildlife including several varieties of turtles, mallards, and other ducks, Canada geese and blue herons.

<text>Michael Landon Gernhardt (born May 4, 1956) is a NASA astronaut and manager of the Environmental Physiology Laboratory, and principal investigator of the Prebreathe Reduction Program (PRP) at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

==Personal life==
He enjoys running, swimming, flying, fishing, and scuba diving. His father, George M. Gernhardt, is deceased. His mother, Suzanne C. Winters, resides in Whitestone, Virginia.

== Education ==

*1974 Graduated from Malabar High School, Mansfield, Ohio
*1978 Received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Vanderbilt University
*1983 Received a Master of Science degree in Bioengineering from University of Pennsylvania
*1991 Received a Doctorate in Bioengineering from University of Pennsylvania

==Organizations==

*American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
*Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society
*Sea Space Symposium
*Aerospace Medical Association.

=== Undersea career ===
From 1977 to 1984, Gernhardt worked as a professional diver and project engineer on a variety of subsea oil field construction and repair projects around the world. He has logged over 700 deep sea dives, and has experience in air, mixed gas, bounce bell and saturation diving. During his diving career, Gernhardt attended graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania, and developed a new theoretical decompression model based on tissue gas bubble dynamics. He then participated in the development and field implementation of a variety of new decompression tables. From 1984 to 1988, Gernhardt worked as Manager, and then Vice President of Special Projects, for Oceaneering International. During this time, he led the development of a telerobotic system for subsea platform cleaning and inspection, as well as a variety of new diver and robot tools. In 1988, he founded Oceaneering Space Systems, a company formed to transfer subsea technology and operational experience to the ISS program. From 1988 until his selection by NASA in 1992, he worked on the development of new astronaut and robot-compatible tools for performing maintenance on Space Station Freedom. He also worked on the development of new portable life support systems and decompression procedures for extra-vehicular activity.

=== NASA career ===
At NASA, Gernhardt reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. His technical assignments to date include:
*Flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL)
*Development of nitrox diving to support training for the Hubble Space Telescope repair, and on a variety of Space Station EVA developments
*Member of the astronaut support team at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, responsible for Shuttle prelaunch vehicle checkout, crew ingress/egress
*Spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control Center, Houston, during various Shuttle missions
*Lead an international research team in developing a new exercise prebreathe protocol that improved the safety and efficiency of space walks from the ISS.

Gernhardt presently serves as a member of the astronaut office EVA branch, as Principal Investigator of the Prebreathe Reduction Program, and as Manager of JSC&#x27;s Environmental Physiology Laboratory.

A four-flight veteran, Gernhardt has logged over 43 days in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 23 hours and 16 minutes. He was a mission specialist on STS-69 in 1995, STS-83 in 1997, STS-94 in 1997, and STS-104 in 2001.

Gernhardt served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. In April 2005, he was the commander of the NEEMO 8 mission.

Gernhardt drove the lunar rover prototype at President Barack Obama&#x27;s inaugural parade on January 20, 2009.

On September 19, 2011, NASA announced that Gernhardt would participate in the NEEMO 15 mission in October 2011 from the DeepWorker submersible. The DeepWorker is a small submarine used as an underwater stand-in for the Space Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of an asteroid.
In June 2012, Gernhardt piloted the DeepWorker as part of the NEEMO 16 mission, for which he was principal investigator.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-69 took place from September 7–18, 1995. Its prime objective was the successful deployment and retrieval of a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). The WSF was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of using this free-flying experiment to grow semiconductors, high temperature superconductors and other materials using the ultra-high vacuum created behind the spacecraft, near the experiment package. Gernhardt was one of two astronauts to perform a spacewalk to evaluate future Space Station tools and hardware, logging 6 hours and 46 minutes of EVA. Mission duration was 260 hours, 29 minutes, and 8 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 171 orbits of the Earth.

STS-83 took place from April 4–8, 1997. This was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and it was cut short due to problems with one of the Shuttle&#x27;s three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth.

STS-94 took place from July 1–17, 1997. This was a re-flight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and focused on materials and combustion science research in microgravity. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.

STS-104 took place from July 12–24, 2001. This was the 10th mission to the International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight, the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-2 crew. Gernhardt was one of two astronauts to perform three spacewalks to install the joint airlock &quot;Quest&quot; (including the first US spacewalk from the ISS), and to outfit it with four high-pressure gas tanks. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 306 hours and 35 minutes.

<text>Baix Empordà (; ; &quot;Lower Empordà&quot;) is a comarca (county) in the Girona region, Catalonia, in Spain. It is one of the two comarques into which Empordà was divided in the comarcal division of 1936, the other one being Alt Empordà. It is popularly known as (&quot;the Little Empordà&quot;). The capital is La Bisbal d&#x27;Empordà.

== Geography ==
=== Extent ===
Baix Empordà is the southern portion of the historical region of Empordà. It includes the municipalities between the Montgrí Massif, just north of the river Ter, and the Aro valley, in the south. It measure some from north to south, and from east to west, with a total area of . It borders Alt Empordà to the north, Gironès and Selva to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east.

The Mediterranean coast of the Baix Empordia is part of the Costa Brava, and is a major tourist destination, including resorts such as Sant Feliu de Guíxols, s&#x27;Agaro, Platja d&#x27;Aro, Sant Antoni de Calonge, Palamós, La Fosca, Calella de Palafrugell, Llafranc, Tamariu, Fornells de Mar and l&#x27;Estartit.

The capital of Baix Empordia is La Bisbal d&#x27;Empordà, which is some from the coast, but several of the &quot;comarca&quot;″s coastal municipalities have significantly larger populations, most notably Palafrugell, Sant Feliu de Guíxols and Palamós. There are 37 municipalities within the &quot;comarca&quot;.

<text>Brass knuckles (also referred to as brass knucks, knuckledusters, iron fist and paperweight, among other names) are a melee weapon used primarily in hand-to-hand combat. They are fitted and designed to be worn around the knuckles of the human hand. Despite their name, they are often made from other metals, plastics or carbon fibers and not necessarily brass. 

Designed to preserve and concentrate a punch&#x27;s force by directing it toward a harder and smaller contact area, they result in increased tissue disruption, including an increased likelihood of fracturing the intended target&#x27;s bones on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads the counter-force across the attacker&#x27;s palm, which would otherwise have been absorbed primarily by the attacker&#x27;s fingers. This reduces the likelihood of damage to the attacker&#x27;s fingers. 

The weapon has been controversial for its easy concealability and is illegal to own and use in a number of countries.

During the 19th century, cast iron, brass, lead, and wood knuckles were made in the United States during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Soldiers would often buy cast iron or brass knuckles. If they could not buy them, they would carve their own from wood, or cast them at camp by melting lead bullets and using a mold in the dirt.

Some brass knuckles have rounded rings, which increase the impact of blows from moderate to severe damage. Other instruments (not generally considered to be &quot;brass knuckles&quot; or &quot;metal knuckles&quot; &quot;per se&quot;) may have spikes, sharp points and cutting edges. These devices come in many variations and are called by a variety of names, including &quot;knuckle knives.&quot;

By the late 18th century, knuckledusters were incorporated into various kinds of pistols such as the Apache revolver used by criminals in France in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. During World War I the US Army issued two different knuckle knives, the US model 1917 and US model 1918 Mark I trench knives. Knuckles and knuckle knives were also being made in England at the time and purchased privately by British soldiers. It was advised not to polish brass knuckles as allowing the brass to darken would act as camouflage on the battlefield.

By World War II, knuckles and knuckle knives were quite popular with both American and British soldiers. The Model 1918 trench knives were reissued to American paratroopers. A notable knuckle knife still in use is the Cuchillo de Paracaidista, issued to Argentinian paratroopers. Current-issue models have an emergency blade in the crossguard.

== Legality and distribution ==
Brass knuckles are illegal in several countries, including: Hong Kong, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Bosnia, Croatia, Estonia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, Singapore, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Import of brass knuckles into Australia is illegal unless a government permit is obtained; permits are available for only limited purposes, such as police and government use, or use in film productions. They are prohibited weapons in the state of New South Wales.

In Brazil, brass knuckles are legal and freely sold. They are called , which means &#x27;English punch&#x27;, or , which means &#x27;puncher&#x27;.

In Canada, brass knuckles (Canadian French , which literally means &#x27;American fist&#x27;), or any similar devices made of metal, are listed as prohibited weapons; possession of such weapon is a criminal offence under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. Plastic knuckles have been determined to be legal in Canada.

In France, brass knuckles are illegal. They can be bought as a &quot;collectable&quot; (provided one is over 18), but it is forbidden to carry or use one, whatever the circumstance, including self-defense. The French term is , which literally means &#x27;American punch&#x27;.

In Russia, brass knuckles were illegal to purchase or own during Imperial times and are still forbidden according to Article 6 of the 1996 Federal Law on Weapons. They are called (from French , literally &#x27;head breaker&#x27;).

In Serbia, brass knuckles are legal to purchase and own (for people over 16 years old) but are not legal to carry in public. They are called , literally &#x27;boxer&#x27;.

In Taiwan, according to the Law of the Republic of China, possession and sales of brass knuckles are illegal. Under the regulation, brass knuckles are considered weapons. Without the permission of the central regulatory agency, it is against the law to manufacture, sell, transport, transfer, rent, or have them in any collection or on display.

In China, brass knuckles are completely legal as per the Law of the Republic of China. According to Article 32 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, citizens can legally own them for self-defense, but they are prohibited items in certain places. For example, brass knuckles are not allowed to be carried when travelling on the subway, buses, trains, or other public transport. In ancient China, brass knuckles were popular, and were used regularly as a concealed weapon or self-defense tool.

In the United States, brass knuckles are not prohibited at the federal level, but various state, county and city laws, and the District of Columbia, regulate or prohibit their purchase and/or possession. , brass knuckles are prohibited in 21 states. Some state laws require purchasers to be 18 or older. Most states have statutes regulating the carrying of weapons, and some specifically prohibit brass knuckles or &quot;metal knuckles&quot;. Brass knuckles can readily be purchased online or, where legal, at flea markets, swap meets, gun shows, and at specialty stores. Some companies manufacture belt buckles or novelty paper weights that function as brass knuckles. Brass knuckles made of plastic, rather than metal, have been marketed as &quot;undetectable by airport metal detectors&quot;. Some states that ban metal knuckles also ban plastic knuckles. For example, New York&#x27;s criminal statutes list both &quot;metal knuckles&quot; and &quot;plastic knuckles&quot; as prohibited weapons, but do not define either.

<text>The Pocket Cube (also known as the Mini Cube and Twizzle) is a 2×2×2 combination puzzle invented in 1970 by American puzzle designer Larry D. Nichols. The cube consists of 8 pieces, which are all corners.

==History==

In February 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 &quot;Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups&quot; and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols&#x27;s cube was held together with magnets. Nichols was granted on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented the 3×3×3 cube.

Nichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik&#x27;s 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols&#x27;s patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik&#x27;s 3×3×3 Cube.

==Group Theory==
The group theory of the 3×3×3 cube can be transferred to the 2×2×2 cube. The elements of the group are typically the moves of that can be executed on the cube (both individual rotations of layers and composite moves from several rotations) and the group operator is a concatenation of the moves.

To analyse the group of the 2×2×2 cube, the cube configuration has to be determined. This can be represented as a 2-tuple, which is made up of the following parameters:

* Position of the corner pieces as a bijective function (permutation)
* Orientation of the corner pieces as vector x

Two moves formula_1and formula_2 from the set formula_3of all moves are considered equal if they produce the same configuration with the same initial configuration of the cube. With the 2×2×2 cube, it must also be considered that there is no fixed orientation or top side of the cube, because the 2×2×2 cube has no fixed center pieces. Therefore, the equivalence relation formula_4 is introduced with formula_5 and formula_2 result in the same cube configuration (with optional rotation of the cube). This relation is reflexive, as two identical moves transform the cube into the same final configuration with the same initial configuration. In addition, the relation is symmetrical and transitive, as it is similar to the mathematical relation of equality.

With this equivalence relation, equivalence classes can be formed that are defined with formula_7 on the set of all moves formula_3. Accordingly, each equivalence class formula_9 contains all moves of the set formula_3 that are equivalent to the move with the equivalence relation. formula_9 is a subset of formula_3. All equivalent elements of an equivalence class formula_9 are the representatives of its equivalence class.

The quotient set formula_14 can be formed using these equivalence classes. It contains the equivalence classes of all cube moves without containing the same moves twice. The elements of formula_14 are all equivalence classes with regard to the equivalence relation formula_4. The following therefore applies: formula_17. This quotient set is the set of the group of the cube.

The 2×2×2 Rubik&#x27;s cube, has eight permutation objects (corner pieces), three possible orientations of the eight corner pieces and 24 possible rotations of the cube, as there is no unique top side.

Any permutation of the eight corners is possible (8! positions), and seven of them can be independently rotated with three possible orientations (37 positions). There is nothing identifying the orientation of the cube in space, reducing the positions by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent due to the lack of fixed centers (similar to what happens in circular permutations). This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; cubes where &quot;N&quot; is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube&#x27;s spatial orientation. The number of possible positions of the cube is

:formula_18 This is the order of the group as well.

The largest order of an element in this group is 45. For example, one such element of order 45 is 
:formula_19.

Any cube configuration can be solved in up to 14 turns (when making only quarter turns) or in up to 11 turns (when making half turns in addition to quarter turns).

The number a of positions that require n &quot;any&quot; (half or quarter) turns and number q of positions that require n quarter turns only are:

The two-generator subgroup (the number of positions generated just by rotations of two adjacent faces) is of order 29,160.
Code that generates these results can be found here.

==Methods==
A pocket cube can be solved with the same methods as a 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube, simply by treating it as a 3x3x3 with solved (invisible) centers and edges. More advanced methods combine multiple steps and require more algorithms. These algorithms designed for solving a 2×2×2 cube are often significantly shorter and faster than the algorithms one would use for solving a 3×3×3 cube.

The Ortega method, also called the Varasano method, is an intermediate method. First a face is built (but the pieces may be permuted incorrectly), then the last layer is oriented (OLL) and lastly both layers are permuted (PBL). The Ortega method requires a total of 12 algorithms.

The CLL method first builds a layer (with correct permutation) and then solves the second layer in one step by using one of 42 algorithms. A more advanced version of CLL is the TCLL Method also known as Twisty CLL. One layer is built with correct permutation similarly to normal CLL, however one corner piece can be incorrectly oriented. The rest of the cube is solved, and the incorrect corner orientated in one step. There are 83 cases for TCLL.

One of the more advanced methods is the EG method. It starts by building a face like in the Ortega method, but then solves the rest of the puzzle in one step. It requires knowing 128 algorithms, 42 of which are the CLL algorithms.

Top-level speedcubers may also 1-look the puzzle,
which involves inspecting the entire cube and planning out the best solution in the 15 seconds of inspection allotted to the solver before the solve.

==Notation==
Notation is based on 3×3×3 notation but some moves are redundant (All moves are 90°, moves ending with ‘2’ are 180° turns):

*R represents a clockwise turn of the right face of the cube
*U represents a clockwise turn of the top face of the cube
*F represents a clockwise turn of the front face of the cube
*R&#x27; represents an anti-clockwise turn of the right face of the cube
*U&#x27; represents an anti-clockwise turn of the top face of the cube
*F&#x27; represents an anti-clockwise turn of the front face of the cube

== World records ==
The world record for the fastest single solve time is 0.43 seconds, set by Teodor Zajder of Poland at Warsaw Cube Masters 2023.

The world record average of 5 solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 0.86 seconds set by Yiheng Wang (王艺衡) of China at Chengdu Spring Open 2025. An average of 0.78 seconds was set by Wang previously with times of 0.74, (0.70), (0.97), 0.78, and 0.81 seconds, but frame-by-frame analysis revealed his use of &#x27;sliding,&#x27; a technique breaking several of the World Cubing Association&#x27;s (WCA) regulations. After deliberation between the WCA&#x27;s Board of Directors and WCA Regulations Committee, Wang was retroactively penalized with additional seconds added to four of his solves.

<text>A shimmy is a dance move in which the body is held still, except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth. When the right shoulder goes back, the left one comes forward.

== History ==
In 1917, a dance-song titled &quot;Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble&quot; by Spencer Williams was published, as &quot;The Jazz Dance&quot;, which included the &quot;Shimmy-She&quot;, among others. 

Gilda Gray attributed to American Indians in a 1919 interview with &quot;Variety&quot; saying &quot;You may not believe it but the original shimmy dance has never been properly introduced in New York. I know, for I have studied the dancing characteristics of the Indians for a long time, and they are really responsible for the shimmy which they labelled the &#x27;Shima Shiwa&#x27;. There have been continual efforts on the part of this dancer and that one, with each declaring that his or her version is the &#x27;original.&#x27; There is no doubt but that the shimmy dance as it was constructed by the American Indian would have a greater popularity if done right.&quot;

&quot;I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate&quot; was an up-tempo jazz dance song, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron, and published in 1919 which has been popular ever since and performed and recorded by many artists. 

Flappers often performed the dance in the 1920s. The origin of the name is often falsely attributed to Gilda Gray, a Polish emigrant to America. An anecdote says that when she was asked about her dancing style, she answered, in heavy accent, &quot;I&#x27;m shaking my &quot;chemise&quot;&quot;. In an interview Gilda denied having said this, and earlier usages of the word are recorded. In the late 1910s, others were also attributed as being the &quot;inventor&quot; of the shimmy, including Hilda Ferguson, Bee Palmer and the jazz duo Frank Hale and Signe Paterson. Mae West, in her autobiography &quot;Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It&quot;, claimed to have re-titled the &quot;Shimmy-Shawobble&quot; as the Shimmy, after seeing the moves in some black nightclubs.

The dance was often considered to be obscene and was frequently banned from American dance halls during the 1920s.

The move is also known in Gypsy dances, done by gypsy female dancers to produce a chime of costume decorations made of the sewn-on coins.

In the early 1960s, several dance songs featuring the Shimmy became hits, including Bobby Freeman&#x27;s &quot;Shimmy, Shimmy&quot;, the Olympics&#x27; &quot;Shimmy Like Kate&quot;, and Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials&#x27; &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ko-ko Bop&quot;.

<doc id="599014" wikidata="Q7058078" url="?curid=599014" title="Northeastern coastal forests">
<text>The Northeastern coastal forests are a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion of the northeast and middle Atlantic region of the United States. The ecoregion covers an area of 34,630 sq miles (89,691 km2) encompassing the Piedmont and coastal plain of seven states, extending from coastal southwestern Maine, southeastern New Hampshire, eastern Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, southward through Connecticut, New York State, New Jersey, southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.

The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, it transitions to the New England-Acadian forests, which cover most of northern and inland New England. To the west, the ecoregion transitions to Allegheny Highlands forests and the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests of the Appalachian Mountains. To the south lie the Southeastern mixed forests and the Middle Atlantic coastal forests. The ecoregion surrounds the distinct Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion, which covers portions of New Jersey, Long Island and Cape Cod in southeastern Massachusetts.

==Climate==
The climate in this ecoregion is the broad transition from the humid continental in the north to the humid subtropical climate in the south.

==Flora==
Oak forests dominate this ecoregion. American chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;) was formerly important, but its population was devastated by the chestnut blight early in the 20th century.

===Dry-mesic oak forests===
Northeastern interior dry-mesic oak forests are found throughout this ecoregion. They cover large areas at low and middle elevations, typically on flat to gently rolling terrain. Red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot;), white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), and black oak (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;) are common oaks in this habitat. Other trees include hickories (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.), red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;), tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), black birch (&quot;Betula lenta&quot;), black tupelo (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), and American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;). Flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;) is a common understory tree.

Common shrubs are maple-leaved viburnum (&quot;viburnum acerifolium&quot;), spicebush (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;), and witch hazel (&quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot;). In sandier or more acidic soils are mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium pallidum&quot;), huckleberry (&quot;Gaylussacia baccata&quot;), and swamp azalea (&quot;Rhododendron viscosum&quot;).

Mayapple (&quot;Podophyllum peltatum&quot;) is a common herbaceous plant.

===Hemlock-northern hardwood forests===
Hemlock-northern hardwood forests occur in deep coves, moist flats, and ravines. They include sugar maple, yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;), and beech. These trees often form a deciduous canopy, but are sometimes mixed with hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;) or white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;). Other common trees include oaks (most commonly red oak), tuliptree, black cherry, and sweet birch. In the Northeast, red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) can be a minor canopy associate. Hophornbeam (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;) is frequent but not dominant.

===Dry oak-pine forests===
Central Appalachian dry oak-pine forests occur on dry sites with loamy to sandy soils. A mix of oak and pine tree species dominate the canopy, typically chestnut oak (&quot;Quercus prinus&quot;), Virginia pine (&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot;), and white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;), but sometimes white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;) or scarlet oak (&quot;Quercus coccinea&quot;). Varying amounts of oaks and pines result in oak forests, mixed oak-pine forests, or small pine forests. Shrubs such as hillside blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium pallidum&quot;), black huckleberry (&quot;Gaylussacia baccata&quot;), and mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;) are common in the understory and can form a dense layer.

===Pine-oak rocky woodlands===
Central Appalachian pine-oak rocky woodlands occur on lower-elevation hilltops, outcrops, and rocky slopes and have a patchy or open aspect. Pitch pine (&quot;Pinus rigida&quot;) and Virginia pine (&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot;) are common within their respective ranges. These pines are often mixed with dry-site oaks such as chestnut oak (&quot;Quercus prinus&quot;), bear oak (&quot;Quercus ilicifolia&quot;), northern red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot;), and scarlet oak (&quot;Quercus coccinea&quot;). Sprouts of chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;) can also be found. In the northeast, eastern red-cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;) or hophornbeam (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;) are sometimes important. In the understory, some areas have a fairly well-developed heath shrub layer, others a graminoid layer, the latter particularly common under deciduous trees such as oaks.

===Successional plant communities===
These occur in formerly cleared land, such as old farms, that have been abandoned. Eastern red cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;) are some of the first trees to occupy these lands.

===Freshwater wetlands===
Marshes occur where standing water is present for most of the year. Common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;) and cattails (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.) are often abundant.

Swamps and floodplains occur where standing water is present for only some parts of the year. Red maple is a common tree, and can be found with swamp tupelo, white ash, American elm, pin oak (&quot;Quercus palustris&quot;), swamp white oak (&quot;Quercus bicolor&quot;), and silver maple (&quot;Acer saccharinum&quot;). Spicebush is a common shrub. Skunk cabbage (&quot;Symplocarpus foetidus&quot;) is found here.

==Fauna==
Some of the animals that live in the Northeastern coastal deciduous forests are white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, red foxes, sparrows, chickadees, copperheads, rattlesnakes, northern water snakes, box turtles, snapping turtles, black rat snakes, garter snakes, snails, American toads, coyotes, black bears, bobcats, beavers, woodchucks, skunks, and raccoons. Chickadees, white-tailed deer, and eastern gray squirrels can be seen quite often. Eastern wolves and eastern cougars used to be quite common, but are extirpated, causing endemic growth in deer populations near suburban areas, with eastern coyotes generally taking their place by the mid-20th century.
Moose may also be seen in some of the northernmost regions of the Northeastern coastal forests, though this is very, very rare. Other fauna that occupy the area include bog turtles, ducks, rabbits, eagles, and (formerly) Canada lynx and sea mink.

<text>Kenneth Scott Rogers (born November 10, 1964) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher, with a 20-year career (1989 to 2008) for six different teams. He won the 1996 World Series with the New York Yankees over the Atlanta Braves, and played in the 2006 World Series with the Detroit Tigers. In addition to being known for his fielding (winning five Gold Glove Awards), he pitched the 14th perfect game in MLB history. In 2008, he was the oldest baseball player in the American League.

Rogers is nicknamed &quot;the Gambler&quot; after a song made famous by the singer who shares his name.

==Biography==
Rogers was born in Savannah, Georgia, and grew up on a farm in Dover, Florida.

Rogers and his wife, Rebecca Lewis, reside in Westlake, Texas, with their two children. He enjoys golf, fishing and building houses for Habitat for Humanity.

==Baseball career==
Rogers graduated from Plant City High School in Florida in 1982, where he played baseball only during his senior season, hitting .375 as a right fielder (he played shortstop in his senior league). He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 39th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft and signed for $1,000. He was converted into a pitcher on the strength of his throwing arm and left-handedness. Rogers spent seven years in the minor leagues before making it to the Rangers in 1989 as a reliever. He became a starting pitcher for the club in 1993.

During Rogers&#x27; career, he played for the: Texas Rangers (1989–95, 2000–02, 2004–05), New York Yankees (1996–97), Oakland Athletics (1998–99), New York Mets (1999), Minnesota Twins (2003), and Detroit Tigers (2006–08).

Rogers is one of only three pitchers in Rangers history through 2009 to win at least 17 games in 31 starts or fewer (set back in 1995), along with Scott Feldman (2009) and Ferguson Jenkins (18 wins in 30 starts in 1978).

===Oakland Athletics===
On November 18, 1997, Rogers was acquired by the Oakland Athletics from the Yankees for third baseman Scott Brosius in Billy Beane&#x27;s first trade as general manager. Rogers led the Oakland pitching staff in his first season in innings (238.7) and wins (16). The next season, he started 19 games, winning only 5 with a 4.30 ERA. He was traded at the deadline to the New York Mets for Terrence Long and a minor league player.

===New York Mets===
Rogers was traded by the Athletics on July 23, 1999, in exchange for Leo Vazquez and Terrence Long. During his short tenure with the team, Rogers started 12 games during the regular season, winning 5 and losing 1, compiling a 4.03 earned run average. He is best remembered in a Mets uniform for walking in the series winning run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 6 of the 1999 NLCS, giving the Braves the win on a walk-off walk. Rogers became a free agent following the 1999 season.

===Second stint with Rangers===
After the 1999 season, Rogers signed with the Texas Rangers.

===Minnesota Twins===
Rogers signed with the Minnesota Twins in March of 2003, filing the rotation slot vacated by an injured Eric Milton. Rogers went 13-8 with a 4.57 ERA during the regular season and made one appearance out of the bullpen in the ALDS against the New York Yankees.

===Third stint with Rangers===
Rogers rejoined the Rangers as a free agent in 2004.

On June 29, 2005, after walking out onto Ameriquest Field for a pre-game warmup against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Rogers shoved two cameramen, knocking one camera to the ground. One of the reporters resumed filming after picking up said camera, which angered Rogers into shoving him again, after grabbing and throwing the camera to the ground, kicking it. He was then led away by a teammate and later sent home by the club. Larry Rodriguez (the assaulted cameraman) of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Fox Network affiliate KDFW was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain. While in the hospital, Rodriguez made an official complaint of assault against Rogers.

Two days after the incident, Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the All-Star Game in Detroit. The suspension was subsequently upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later overruled by independent arbiter Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games. On July 18, 2005, Rogers was charged with a Class A misdemeanor assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class C misdemeanor assault charge with regard to FSN Southwest cameraman David Mammeli. Rogers was cited and released on $1,500 bond. The Class A charge was later reduced to Class C following Rogers&#x27; completion of an anger management course.

On August 11, 2005, Rogers returned to the mound against the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park. Rogers allowed 5 runs and 7 hits during 5 innings, on the way to a 16–5 Boston victory. He finished 2005 with a 3.46 ERA in 195 innings. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Rangers announced Rogers would not return to the team.

On October 5, 2005, Rodriguez filed a civil suit against Rogers and the Rangers, seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages.

===Signing with Detroit===

On December 8, 2005, Rogers signed a two-year, $16-million contract with the Detroit Tigers. In 2006, he won 17 regular season games and excelled in the post-season with 23 straight scoreless innings over his three starts. Rogers ended the 2006 regular season with a record of 17–8 and a 3.84 ERA. &quot;We&#x27;ve needed a guy like that for a long time. I&#x27;m glad we went out and got him...He means a lot to our team and to guys like me,&quot; said Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman on Rogers.

Rogers, on his first year in Detroit: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of benefits here, by far, that you wouldn&#x27;t know as a visiting player, and for me, I&#x27;ve been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the people. The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it&#x27;s not that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days that you could get off. There&#x27;s just more benefits, especially when you have the quality of people here like Dombrowski and like we have in Mr. Ilitch, those things that you can&#x27;t take for granted. You add in Jim Leyland and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place...Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was going to end up.&quot;

On March 30, 2007, ESPN reported that Rogers would miss three months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching shoulder. He made his return on June 22 against the Atlanta Braves, pitching six scoreless innings and allowing two hits while earning his first win of the season.

===2006 postseason===
On October 6, 2006, Rogers won his first postseason game, pitching 7 scoreless innings with 8 strikeouts in a 6–0 Tigers victory against the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series. At 41 years and 330 days old, he became the oldest starting pitcher to earn his first career postseason win.

A week later on October 13, Rogers retired 9 batters in a row, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, allowing only 2 hits and 2 walks in 7 scoreless innings, while striking out 6 and pacing the Tigers to a 3–0 victory, leaving the Tigers 1 win away from their first World Series appearance since 1984.

Rogers started Game 2 of the 2006 World Series on October 22, 2006. &quot;We wanted Kenny to pitch 2 games at home,&quot; Leyland said. He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3–0, pitching 8 shutout innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out 5, allowing only 2 hits and 3 walks, making him the oldest starting pitcher to win a World Series game, and 1 of only 2 pitchers over the age of 40 to do so (Curt Schilling would become the second in 2007).

During the first inning, Fox cameras caught a smudge on Rogers&#x27; pitching hand. Rogers said it was dirt mixed with rosin from the rosin bag and wiped it off. MLB spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, and the substance was described as dirt. Since dirt is not designated as a foreign substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game. In the process, Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images from previous games revealed similar smudges in two other games.

===Retirement===
After injuries shortened his 2007–08 seasons, Rogers ceased playing at the end of 2008. With 219 career victories, he became the 7th 200-game winner who never won 20 games in any single season, joining Milt Pappas, Jerry Reuss, Frank Tanana, Charlie Hough, Dennis Martínez and Chuck Finley. Tim Wakefield joined the group with his 200th win in 2011. Mike Mussina reached 200 wins without having a 20-win season, but recorded a 20-win season afterward.

In 2010, Rogers served as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers during spring training. According to remarks by Justin Verlander and Jim Leyland, his ability to coach pitchers on fielding would be particularly of interest to the team.

On August 6, 2011, Rogers was enshrined into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.

In 2011, Rogers threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Comerica Park in Game 3 of the ALDS.

Rogers reportedly never formally retired from Major League Baseball.

==Accomplishments==

===Perfect game===
Rogers pitched the 14th perfect game in MLB history on July 28, 1994, with the Rangers against the California Angels (the last no-hitter in Rangers history to date, and the only perfect game in franchise history). Soon after his feat, he appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on July 29, 1994, and on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on August 1, 1994.

He also met and appeared with musician Kenny Rogers at a function in Arlington, Texas, on August 13, 1994. Rogers&#x27; 1994 perfect game was caught by Iván Rodríguez, who in June 2007 caught the no-hitter of Roger&#x27;s future teammate Detroit Tiger Justin Verlander. The game took place exactly three years to the day of the previous perfect game, pitched by Dennis Martínez of the Montreal Expos on July 28, 1991.

===Gold Gloves===
Known as one of the finest fielding pitchers in baseball, Rogers won 5 Gold Glove Awards at pitcher, including 4 with the Rangers and 1 with the Tigers. He was honored with a Fielding Bible Award in 2008 as the top fielding pitcher in MLB. Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane stated that Rogers &quot;was the best fielding pitcher&quot; he ever saw. &quot;It&#x27;s like having an extra infielder.&quot;

===200 career wins===
On June 18, 2006, Rogers won his 200th game (against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field), during which Detroit set a club record with 8 home runs.

===Pickoffs===
Rogers is second all-time in pickoffs with 93 in his career. On May 9, 2008, against the New York Yankees, Rogers picked off Wilson Betemit in the second inning for his 92nd pick-off, passing Mark Langston.

<text>Lena Moncrieff Townsend (3 November 1911 – 17 November 2004) was a British Conservative politician in London and served briefly as Leader of the Inner London Education Authority.

She was born in Egypt, to an Irish father and a Scottish mother, both of whom were born in India. She studied at Oxford, and for a time worked as a fashion writer. She had three children.

During the Second World War she was an organiser for the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service and the Land Army. She married twice, firstly Henry Peat, and then John Townsend. In 1955 she was first elected to the London County Council for her home seat of Hampstead, and took a special interest in the Education Committee. She was chosen to be Leader of the Opposition on the Education Committee from the early 1960s.

Townsend was an unsuccessful candidate in the first Greater London Council election of 1964, being defeated in Camden. However, in 1967 she was more fortunate and won by about 4,000 votes. This brought with it membership of the LCC Education Committee&#x27;s successor body, the Inner London Education Authority, and it was there that Townsend concentrated. The Conservatives had won narrow control of ILEA and Townsend ran for the Leadership, but lost to Christopher Chataway who was the preferred candidate of the Conservative Party nationally.

Chataway did make Townsend his Deputy, and Chairman of the Schools Committee. Townsend supported &#x27;Schools Councils&#x27; for pupils to take some responsibility for the management of their schools. She was nominated as a member of the Race Relations Board Conciliation Committee for London in 1968. She was a founder member of the Conservative Group for Europe.

In 1969 Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in a byelection, and stepped down from the ILEA Leadership. Townsend was chosen as his successor, and largely continued his moderate policies. When Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse attacked a BBC sex education film, Townsend defended it. She was however faced with a strike of teachers in November that year over a national pay claim.

Fighting for re-election in 1970, Townsend promoted the record of three years of Conservative ILEA by pointing to the success in reducing class sizes by employing more teachers. However, there was a small swing to Labour, who regained control; Townsend lost her seat in Camden but was elected as an Alderman to the GLC and co-opted to ILEA&#x27;s Education Committee. She remained as Leader of the Opposition until February 1971 when she resigned, saying that she needed a paying job.

Townsend remained an Alderman of the GLC until 1977 when the Aldermanic system was abolished. She was a member of several bodies, most prominently as a Governor of the London College of Fashion (and Chair of Governors from 1967 to 1986). In Edward Heath&#x27;s Dissolution Honours list of 1974 she was appointed a CBE. Keeping the links with the country of her birth, she was President of the Anglo-Egyptian Association from 1961 until it was wound up in 1987.

<text>Fruition is a full service digital marketing agency based in Denver, Colorado that provides web design &amp; development and Internet marketing services to multiple international corporations. The company is also known for its Google Penalty Checker tool.

==History==
Founded in 2000 by current CEO Brad Anderson, Fruition initially began as an SEO company. It later expanded to the larger niche of digital marketing. The company&#x27;s core services now include SEO, website development &amp; design, app development, digital marketing, and brand &amp; reputation management. Fruition was first trademarked in 2002, and registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2007.

==Google Penalty Checker==
In 2013, Fruition released its Google Penalty Checker tool, which has notably been the subject of multiple news reports. It is a proprietary tool that uses statistical analysis and third-party data to determine if a website had been hit by a Google penalty, as well as which particular update caused it. Once the tool is granted access to a Google Analytics account, it uses algorithms involving bounce rates, organic traffic, new vs. repeat visits, and page views, among other data, to evaluate a possible Google penalty due to a recent update. It provides a graph of all the updates and the percentage of their effect on the site. The tool is free for up to two sites, after which pricing is applicable.
The tool has been noted to be beneficial for businesses that do not stay up to date with Google updates.

<doc id="599029" wikidata="Q11285362" url="?curid=599029" title="Andover Theological Seminary">
<text>Andover Theological Seminary (1807–1965) was a Congregationalist seminary founded in 1807 and originally located in Andover, Massachusetts on the campus of Phillips Academy. 

From 1908 to 1931, it was located at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It then collocated with Newton Theological Institution (NTI) in Newton, Massachusetts. Then, in 1965, Andover Theological Seminary and NTI formally merged in 1965 to form Andover Newton Theological School in Andover, Massachusetts. In its original and merged forms, it is the first and thus the oldest Protestant theological seminary in the United States. The seminary continues as Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School, which was launched in 2017.

==History==
Andover Theological Seminary traces its roots to the late 18th century and the desire for a well-educated clergy among Congregationalists in the United States. That desire was expressed in the founding of Phillips Academy in 1778 for &quot;the promotion of true Piety and Virtue&quot;.

In 1806, a growing split within the Congregational churches, known as the Unitarian Controversy, came to a full boil on the campus of Harvard College. The Hollis Chair of Divinity sat empty at Harvard for two years owing to tensions between liberal and more orthodox Calvinists. This theological battle soon divided many of the oldest churches in Massachusetts and began to impact church polity and the hiring of ministers. When the Harvard Board of Overseers appointed well-known liberal Henry Ware to the Hollis Chair in 1805, the Calvinists withdrew to organize and establish a new school in 1807, Andover Theological Seminary on the campus of Phillips Academy (est. 1778) in Andover, Massachusetts. This act, covered widely in the national press, was one of the significant events that contributed to the split in the denomination and to the eventual founding of the American Unitarian Association in 1825 (which joined the Universalists, founded in 1793, to become the Unitarian Universalist Association in 1961).

Andover was founded by the joint efforts of traditionalist, &quot;Old Calvinists&quot; and the adherents of the New Divinity (also known as New England theology) which was more revivalistic. Leonard Woods, Moses Stuart, and Edward Dorr Griffin were early faculty.
Between 1886 and 1892, a theological dispute known as the &quot;Andover Controversy&quot; broke out between the conservative &quot;New England Calvinism&quot; of the founders and the liberal theology of many on the faculty. President E. C. Smyth was investigated and dismissed for his liberal views in 1887, but in 1891 his dismissal was reversed, on technical grounds, by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, and the matter was dropped the following year.

=== Relocations and merger ===

In 1908, Harvard Divinity School and Andover attempted to reconcile, and the seminary moved its faculty and library to the Harvard campus (and soon into Andover Hall [1911]). Plans for a formal affiliation between the academies were made, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts disallowed the alliance since Andover&#x27;s endowment is designated for a Christian theological education. Andover, therefore, relocated to the campus of Newton Theological Institution in 1931.

Andover Theological Seminary and the Newton Theological Institution formally merged in 1965 as the Andover Newton Theological School (ANTS). Newton Theological Institution began instruction in 1825 at Newton Centre, Massachusetts as a graduate seminary formally affiliated with the group now known as American Baptist Churches USA, the oldest Baptist denomination in America. As the institution developed, it adopted Andover&#x27;s curricular pattern and shared the same theological tradition of loyalty to the evangelical Gospel and zeal for its dissemination.

In November 2015, ANTS announced that it would sell its campus and relocate to Yale Divinity School, after a presence of 190 years on that site.

=== Historical influence on Protestant missions ===
Prior to the founding of Andover and Newton, the model for the training of clergy was based on an undergraduate degree (actually the basis for the founding of most of the early colleges in the United States). The graduate model and the three year curriculum with a resident student body and resident faculty pioneered at Andover and Newton has become the standard for almost all of the 140 Protestant theological schools in the country.

Reflecting that zeal, the modern missionary movement began in this country through a group of Andover students known as the Brethren. Both Andover and Newton quickly assumed leadership in the modern mission movement, drawing the two schools into close association of people and ideas. Graduates such as Luther Rice and Hiram Bingham pioneered in Christian missions around the world. Adoniram Judson, an 1810 Andover alumnus, is best known for his work in Burma, where he translated the Bible into Burmese and produced the first Burmese-English dictionary.

==Notable alumni==
Alumni of Andover Theological Seminary include the following notables, listed in order of their last year at the Seminary.
* Adoniram Judson, class of 1810, one of the first U.S. missionaries sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions; later became a Baptist missionary to Myanmar, then known as Burma.

Both Oranmiyan (Oba of Benin) and Biritikolu first settled in Benin forests before disputes among their people led them to separate and Biritikolu sought a new home westward at Utamodi (Oke Papa). Ewi Biritikolu and one of his sons reigned there. It was Ewi Awamaro who migrated to Ilesun (Present day Ado-Ekiti) after staying briefly at Udoani (Ido Ani) and Agbado during the long migration. When Ewi Awamaro left Agbado, some elders remained behind to rest and gave the settlement the name Agba Ado (Elders&#x27; Camp) – Agbado-Ekiti as the town is known today.

<doc id="599040" wikidata="Q898637" url="?curid=599040" title="Propyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, a propyl group is a three-carbon alkyl substituent with chemical formula  for the linear form. This substituent form is obtained by removing one hydrogen atom attached to the terminal carbon of propane. A propyl substituent is often represented in organic chemistry with the symbol Pr (not to be confused with the element praseodymium).

An isomeric form of propyl is obtained by moving the point of attachment from a terminal carbon atom to the central carbon atom, named isopropyl or 1-methylethyl. To maintain four substituents on each carbon atom, one hydrogen atom has to be moved from the middle carbon atom to the carbon atom which served as attachment point in the &quot;n&quot;-propyl variant, written as .

Linear propyl is sometimes termed normal and hence written with a prefix &quot;n&quot;- (i.e., &quot;n-&quot;propyl), as the absence of the prefix &quot;n&quot;- does not indicate which attachment point is chosen, i.e. absence of prefix does not automatically exclude the possibility of it being the branched version (i.e. &quot;i&quot;-propyl or &quot;isopropyl&quot;).
In addition, there is a third, cyclic, form called cyclopropyl, or &quot;c&quot;-propyl. It is not isomeric with the other two forms, having a different chemical formula ( vs ), not just a different connectivity of the atoms.

==Examples==
&quot;n&quot;-Propyl acetate is an ester which has the &quot;n&quot;-propyl group attached to the oxygen atom of the acetate group.


=== Other examples ===
* Isopropyl alcohol
* Isopropylamine
