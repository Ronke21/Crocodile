<text>Thomas Philip de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, 3rd Baron Grantham, 6th Baron Lucas (born Robinson, later Weddell; 8 December 178114 November 1859), styled as The Hon. Thomas Robinson until 1786 and as Lord Grantham from 1786 to 1833, of Wrest Park in the parish of Silsoe, Bedfordshire, was a British Tory statesman. He changed his surname to Weddell in 1803 and to de Grey in 1833.

==Origins==

He was the eldest son of Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham (1738–1786) of Newby Hall, Newby-on-Swale, a deserted medieval village and of adjacent Rainton, both in the parish of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, by his wife Mary Yorke (1757–1830), the younger daughter of Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke by his wife Jemima Campbell, &quot;suo jure&quot; 2nd Marchioness Grey. His younger brother was the Prime Minister Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon, 1st Viscount Goderich, known to history as &quot;Lord Goderich&quot;.

==Inheritance==

In 1786 he succeeded his father as 3rd Baron Grantham. In 1792 he became the heir of his distant cousin William Weddell (1736–1792) of Newby Hall in Yorkshire, a notable art collector. Also in 1792 he became the 6th Robinson Baronet &quot;of Newby&quot;, succeeding his father&#x27;s first cousin Norton Robinson, 5th Baronet (died 1792). In 1833 he succeeded his maternal aunt Amabel Hume-Campbell, &quot;suo jure&quot; 1st Countess de Grey and 5th Baroness Lucas (1750–1833), as 2nd Earl de Grey (according to a special remainder) and as 6th Baron Lucas, of Crudwell. He also inherited her estate of Wrest Park in Silsoe, Bedfordshire.
==Career==
In 1798 he was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating MA in 1801. He was made Privy Counsellor in December 1834 while holding office as First Lord of the Admiralty till April 1835, and a Knight of the Garter in 1844. He was colonel-commandant of the Yorkshire Hussars, a part-time Yeomanry Cavalry regiment, for over forty years and was appointed yeomanry aide-de-camp to William IV and held similar position under Queen Victoria. Lord Grantham was nominated as Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire in 1818, an office which he held until his death. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from September 1841 to July 1844. During his time in Ireland he disagreed with Peel&#x27;s religious conciliation of Ireland, claiming that economic conciliation was a greater priority. He called for more legislation focused on Ireland whilst Peel pursued economic legislation aimed at benefitting the UK as a whole. Charles Read has argued that De Grey was also the key figure who politically defeated the Irish nationalist Repeal movement without any bloodshed, a rare achievement in an era that featured the very bloody Peterloo massacre and the 1848 Revolutions in Europe.

===Other public positions===
On the founding of the &quot;Institute of British Architects in London&quot; in 1834 he was invited to become its first president remaining so till his death in 1859. The institute received its Royal Charter in 1837 becoming Royal Institute of British Architects in London; he was also the first president of the Royal Architectural Museum. Earl de Grey was also a fellow of the Royal Society from 1841, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and served as one of the New Buckingham Palace Commissioners from 1848. He remodeled his London townhouse at No.4 St James&#x27;s Square (now the Naval &amp; Military Club) and between February 1833 and October 1839 rebuilt Wrest Park, his seat in Bedfordshire, in the French style, assisted by James Clephan. He redesigned the deer park and added decoration and several statues.

==Marriage and children==
In 1805 he married Lady Henrietta Cole, a daughter of William Cole, 1st Earl of Enniskillen, by whom he had two daughters and co-heiresses:
* Lady Anne Florence de Grey (Countess Cowper), eldest daughter and co-heiress, who married George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. She was &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Lucas, having inherited that title from her father. She also inherited her father&#x27;s main seat Wrest Park, near Silsoe, in Bedfordshire as well as his London home at 4 St James&#x27;s Square. 
* Lady Mary Gertrude de Grey, younger daughter and co-heiress. She married Henry Vyner (1805 - 1861) and she inherited one of her father&#x27;s secondary properties, Newby Hall in Yorkshire. The other family seats, namely Studley Royal Park and its neighbouring Fountains Hall in Yorkshire, together with the Earldom devolved upon Lord de Grey&#x27;s nephew, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, at whose death the estate - but not the title - passed to Lady Mary Vyner&#x27;s descendants at whose hands it remains today.

==Death and succession==
Lord de Grey died in November 1859, aged 77, having survived his wife by eleven years. He was succeeded in the Barony of Lucas of Crudwell by his daughter, Ann de Grey (Countess Cowper), who married George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. His other titles, unable to pass via a female line, passed to his heir male, namely his nephew, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, 2nd Earl of Ripon.

<doc id="603479" wikidata="Q1617371" url="?curid=603479" title="Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham">
<text>Admiral Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham, PC (14 October 172617 June 1813) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. As a junior officer he saw action during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Middleton was given command of a guardship at the Nore, a Royal Navy anchorage in the Thames Estuary, at the start of the American War of Independence, and was subsequently appointed Comptroller of the Navy. He went on to be First Naval Lord and then First Lord of the Admiralty.

==Early life==
Charles Middleton was born at Leith, Midlothian to Robert, a customs collector of Bo&#x27;ness, Linlithgowshire, and Helen, daughter of Captain Charles Dundas RN and granddaughter of Sir James Dundas of Arniston. He was a nephew of Brigadier-General John Middleton (1678–1739), a grandson of George Middleton DD, and a great-grandson of Alexander Middleton (younger brother of John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton), the last two having served as Principal of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen.

==Marriage and family==
On 21 December 1761, Charles married Margaret Gambier (c.1731 – 10 October 1792), daughter of James Gambier and Margaret Mead, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London. Margaret was the sister of Vice-Admiral James Gambier (1723–1789) and a niece of Captain Mead, captain of the Sandwich. Margaret&#x27;s first encounter with Charles was aboard the Sandwich some twenty years earlier. Margaret later moved to Teston in Kent, to be close to her friend Elizabeth Bouverie. After their marriage, Charles and Margaret made their home at Barham Court in Teston where they lived until their respective deaths. Charles and Margaret had one daughter, Diana, later Diana Noel, 2nd Baroness Barham, born 18 September 1762.

Charles and Margaret also raised Margaret&#x27;s nephew, James, later James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier, born 13 October 1756.

In 1786, Charles and Margaret adopted Charles&#x27;s nephew Robert Gambier Middleton (November 1774 – 21 August 1882), the eldest son of Charles&#x27;s elder brother Captain George Middleton (1724–1794) and Elizabeth Wilson. Robert Gambier Middleton attained the rank of Rear-Admiral on 9 June 1832.

==Naval career==
Middleton entered the Royal Navy in 1741 as captain&#x27;s servant aboard and HMS &quot;Duke&quot;, and later served aboard HMS &quot;Flamborough&quot; as midshipman and master&#x27;s mate. He became lieutenant in 1745, serving aboard the frigate HMS &quot;Chesterfield&quot;, after 1748 on the west Africa station.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, from 1754, Middleton was stationed aboard during her apprehension and capture of two French ships at Louisbourg, after which he was stationed in the Leeward Islands. In January 1757, an incident over rum rations, during which Middleton lost his temper and physically attacked a sailor ended with the sailor being court martialled and Middleton being transferred and promoted to command of the sloop HMS &quot;Speaker&quot;.

Promoted to post-captain on 22 May 1758, Middleton was given command of the frigate HMS &quot;Arundel&quot;. In 1761, while in command of , he distinguished himself in the West Indies, taking sixteen French ships and several privateers, and received the gratitude of the merchants in the British colony of Barbados. From March 1762 Middleton took command of the frigate &quot;Adventure&quot;, patrolling the coast of Normandy.

In 1763, after service aboard the &quot;Adventure&quot;, Charles moved to join Margaret Gambier, whom he had married in December 1761, at Teston, and for the next twelve years, he farmed the land belonging to Mrs Bouverie, taking on the role of a country gentleman.

In 1775, at the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Middleton was given a guardship at the Nore, a Royal Navy anchorage in the Thames Estuary, and was subsequently appointed Comptroller of the Navy in 1778, a post he held for twelve years. In 1781 was created a baronet, with a special remainder, failing any male issue, to his son in law, Gerard Noel.
In 1784, Sir Charles Middleton was elected Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochester, a seat he held for six years, and on 24 September 1787 he was promoted rear admiral. By 1786 he had become disillusioned with his role as Comptroller of the Navy, seeing it as beset by internal politics between the Admiralty and the Navy Board. In 1786 he prepared a letter to the First Lord of the Admiralty indicating he would &quot;contend no more for the public,&quot; and urging the appointment of a successor who could &quot;have more weight than I have had, and influence ministers to correct these evils.&quot; The letter was never sent, but Middleton resigned his position in 1790 and effectively retired from naval affairs.

Promotions based on seniority continued to be received, despite Middleton&#x27;s retirement from active service. On 1 February 1793 he was promoted to vice admiral, and in May 1794 he was appointed to the Board of Admiralty. He became First Naval Lord on 7 March 1795 and was promoted to full admiral on 1 June 1795. He was finally, in May 1805 (at the age of 79), appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. He was also created Baron Barham, of Barham Court and Teston in the County of Kent, with a special remainder, failing male issue, to his only child, his daughter, Diana Noel, 2nd Baroness Barham, and her male heirs. He resigned office in 1806 and died seven years later, aged 86, at his home of Barham Court.

==Abolitionist==

In addition to his service in the Royal Navy, Middleton played a crucial role in the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire. He had been influenced by a pamphlet written by Rev. James Ramsay, who served as a surgeon under Middleton aboard HMS &quot;Arundel&quot; in the West Indies, but later took holy orders and served on the Caribbean island of St Christopher (now St Kitts), where he observed first-hand how enslaved people were treated. In 1777, exhausted by the continuing conflict with influential planters and businessmen, Ramsay returned to Britain and briefly lived with Sir Charles and Lady Middleton at Teston. He later became vicar of Teston and rector of Nettlestead, Kent, the livings being in the gift of Middleton.

Ramsay&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies&quot;, published in 1784, especially affected Lady Middleton. Feeling inadequate to take up the issue of the slave trade in Parliament himself, and knowing that it would be a long, hard battle, Sir Charles Middleton suggested the young Member of Parliament William Wilberforce as the one who might be persuaded to take up the cause. (Whether this was the first time that the issue had been suggested to Wilberforce is debatable). In 1787 Wilberforce was introduced to James Ramsay and Thomas Clarkson at Teston, as well as meeting the Testonites, a growing group of supporters of abolition which also included Edward Eliot, Hannah More, the evangelical writer and philanthropist, and Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London.

Clarkson had first made public his desire to spend his life fighting for emancipation at Middleton&#x27;s home, Barham Court, overlooking the River Medway at Teston, Kent. In order to make a case for abolishing the slave trade, Clarkson did much research over many years, gathering evidence by interviewing thousands of sailors who had been involved in the slave trade.

Barham Court was effectively used for planning the campaign by Lord and Lady Barham, with numerous meetings and strategy sessions attended by Wilberforce, Clarkson, Eliot and Porteus before presenting legislation to Parliament. While Middleton never played a direct role in the effort to abolish the slave trade (finally accomplished in 1807) and slavery itself (in 1833) he played a very important part as a behind the scenes facilitator. His efforts were motivated by his evangelical faith.

==Legacy==
A key leader in the Royal Navy (1778–1807), he was an austere but politically liberal public official. As Comptroller of the Navy, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Commissioner, his success in handling the problems of supply, construction, inefficiency, and insubordination made a critical contribution to Britain&#x27;s naval victories in the Napoleonic wars, according to Bernard Pool.

Three warships of the Royal Navy have been named &quot;Barham&quot; in honour of Middleton including the battleship &quot;Barham&quot; launched in 1914. A fourth was planned but never completed. Barham Building at HMS Nelson, Portsmouth (HMNB Portsmouth), is also named after Middleton.

==Fictional portrayals==
Barham is a character in &quot;Treason&#x27;s Tide&quot; by Robert Wilton, set during the summer of 1805. He is also portrayed by the simple moniker of Admiral Barham in Naomi Novik&#x27;s alternative history fiction series, Temeraire, in the second novel, &quot;Throne of Jade&quot;, (published with Del Rey in 2006) in which he is depicted as arbitrating a dispute between the Chinese delegation and the British government over the possible return of Captain William Laurence&#x27;s dragon Temeraire to China. His political relationship with William Wilberforce and the Abolitionist movement in Britain is also referenced in the work.

==Education and career==
Jackson, a University of Memphis graduate (B.A., 1961) and University of Chicago alum (M.A., 1963; Ph.D., 1966), served three years in the United States Air Force, before joining Columbia as an assistant professor in 1968. At Columbia, he taught courses in urban, social, and military history, advancing to associate professor in 1971, professor in 1976, and Andrew W. Mellon Professor in 1987. He assumed the Barzun Professorship in 1990. In 1989, he was honored as Teacher of the Year by college students, receiving their 28th annual Mark Van Doren Award for &quot;humanity, devotion to truth, and inspiring leadership&quot;. Columbia President George Rupp appointed him Co-Chairman of the University&#x27;s 250th-anniversary commemoration in 1996. He received the annual Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 1999 and was honored as New York State Scholar of the Year by the New York Council in 2001. In November 2016, President Lee Bollinger granted him Columbia University&#x27;s highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Medal, during a black-tie dinner in Low Memorial Library. He retired from Columbia in 2020. Furthermore, he has served as a Fulbright Lecturer in Germany, Australia, and Japan, and as a visiting professor at Princeton, UCLA, and the George Washington University.

An advocate of history as the core of social studies, Jackson chaired the Bradley Commission on History in Schools from 1987 to 1990, aiming to enhance history teaching in America&#x27;s elementary and secondary institutions. Subsequently, he founded and served as the inaugural chairman of the National Council for History Education, an organization with a similar mission. Additionally, he directed seven National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Seminars for high school or college instructors and ten intensive summer programs for the Gilder-Lehrman Institute for American History. He also served on the New York State Social Studies Syllabus Review Committee in 1990 and the National Council for History Standards between 1992 and 1996. Alongside these roles, he served as the president of the Urban History Association (1994-1995), the Society of American Historians (1998-2000), the Organization of American Historians (2000-2001), the New York Historical Society (2001-2004), and the New York Academy of History (2014-2023).

==Publications and contributions==
Jackson was the general editor of the &quot;Columbia History of Urban Life&quot;, twenty volumes of which had appeared by 2020. From 1990 to 1996, he held the position of editor-in-chief for the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot;, followed by &quot;The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives&quot; from 1996 to 2005. Collaborating with Camilo J. Vergara, he co-authored &quot;Silent Cities: The Evolution of the American Cemetery&quot; (Princeton Architectural Press, 1989). Among his books are &quot;The Ku Klux Klan in the City&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1967), the revised edition of the &quot;Atlas of American History&quot; (Scribner’s, 1978), and &quot;Cities in American History&quot; (with Stanley K. Schultz: Alfred A. Knopf, 1972). Working alongside Leonard Dinnerstein, he produced seven editions of &quot;American Vistas&quot; from 1970 to 1998, and co-authored &quot;Empire City: New York Through the Centuries&quot; (Columbia, 2002) with David Dunbar. His publication &quot;Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States&quot; (Oxford, 1985) earned recognition from the History Book Club and was featured in special sessions at prominent historical conventions. It received prestigious accolades including the Francis Parkman and Bancroft Prizes, and was listed among the &quot;New York Times&quot; notable books of the year. 

In collaboration with Vergara, Jackson organized two public exhibitions. The first, titled &quot;Transformed Houses&quot;, was a project of the Smithsonian Institution focusing on domestic architecture in working-class neighborhoods. The second, sponsored by the Municipal Art Society in Manhattan, addressed physical devastation in ghetto areas. 

Jackson served as the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Encyclopedia of New York City&quot;, initially released in 1995 by Yale University Press. The encyclopedia, initially published in a single, 1373-page volume, underwent seven reprints and garnered recognition for its excellence in reference. The second edition, published in 2010, included over five thousand individual entries on various topics including neighborhoods, ethnic groups, schools, religious denominations, and media outlets. It was praised by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as indispensable for anyone interested in the city.

<text>Scandal&#x27;us (or Scandal&#x27;Us) were the winners of the Australian &quot;Popstars 2&quot; in 2001 (successors of Bardot, the winners of the first Australian &quot;Popstars&quot; in 2000). They won an ARIA chart award for their No. 1 debut single &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot;. Their second and final single, &quot;Make Me Crazy&quot;, only reached No. 30. Their debut album, &quot;Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot;, debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The group disbanded in 2002.

==Solo releases==
Tamara Jaber released two solo singles, &quot;Ooh Ahh&quot; and &quot;Hard for Me&quot; under the mononym Tamara. Both reached the ARIA Top 30. Tamara was the only person signed to her radio personality ex-husband Kyle Sandilands&#x27;s label King Kyle Records. He was criticised for promoting his girlfriend&#x27;s single on his popular radio show. A solo album was meant for release but never eventuated. In 2008, Tamara sought a record deal in Los Angeles.

Around 2003, Jason Bird recorded a single to be distributed through his dance workshop website. He performed the track on Channel Nine&#x27;s &quot;Mornings with Kerri-Anne&quot; show.

<text>Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury (died 1098), was an Anglo-Norman aristocrat and member of the House of Bellême. He was also known as Hugh the Red.

==Life==
He was the second surviving son of Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury of the House of Montgomery, and Mabel de Bellême of the House of Belleme. As was typical of the first post-Conquest generation, he inherited most of his father&#x27;s English possessions while his older brother Robert of Bellême inherited the vast lordship of Bellême. He was at the castle of Bures-sur-Dives in December 1079 when his mother was murdered and pursued the perpetrators but was unable to overtake them. In the summer of 1080, along with his brothers he attested a charter for the abbey of Troarn (Diocese of Bayeux) by their father &quot;for the redemption of his soul and [those] of his relatives, and especially of his wife Mabel lately deceased; and of his sons&quot;.

In 1094 at his father&#x27;s death he succeeded to his father&#x27;s English titles and honors as well as his Welsh lands, as Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1095 he joined in the conspiracy of those supporting Robert de Mowbray against William Rufus. In 1096 he was pardoned by William Rufus after a fine of £3,000. During his four years as earl, he spent most of his time in the Welsh Marches fighting against the Welsh. In 1098, he joined forces with Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester in an attempt to recover Anglesey, which had been lost in the Welsh revolt of 1094.

On or about 31 July 1098 Hugh was killed at the Battle of Anglesey Sound while fighting against a raid by King Magnus Barefoot of Norway at Anglesey, being shot dead by an arrow and falling into the sea. Among those in Magnus&#x27; party were Harold Haroldson, son of Harold Godwinson King of England. Several sources agree that it was Magnus himself who shot the arrow hitting Hugh through the eye slit in his armor while the earl was riding carelessly through the shallows.

==Succession==

Hugh died unmarried, and his English lands and titles passed to his older brother Robert of Bellême, who became the 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury.

Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, PC (3 September 1634 – 21 July 1705) was an English courtier, diplomat, and briefly a member of parliament, sitting in the House of Commons of England for part of 1660. He was also a noted Roman Catholic writer. His wife Barbara Villiers was one of Charles II&#x27;s mistresses.

==Early life==
Born into a Roman Catholic family on 3 September 1634, Roger was the son of Sir James Palmer of Dorney Court, Buckinghamshire, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber under King Charles I, and Catherine Herbert, daughter of William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis. He was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was admitted at the Inner Temple in 1656.

In March 1660, at the age of 25, Palmer was elected Member of Parliament for Windsor in the Convention Parliament. Following a double return, he was not seated until 27 April.

==Barbara Villiers==
On 14 April 1659, Roger Palmer married Barbara Villiers, the only child and heiress of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, a half-nephew of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and of his wife Mary Bayning, co-heiress of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning.

In 1660, Barbara Villiers, his wife of one year, became mistress to King Charles II. The king created Palmer both Earl of Castlemaine and Baron Limerick in 1661, as Barbara&#x27;s father had been Viscount Grandison of Limerick, but the title was limited to his children by Barbara (as opposed, that is, to any later wife he might have), which made it clear to the whole court that the honour was for her services in the King&#x27;s bedchamber, rather than for his in the King&#x27;s court. This made it more of a humiliation than an honour:

{{Blockquote|text=[...] and then to the Privy Seal, and sealed there the first time this month; and, among other things that passed, there was a patent for Roger Palmer (Madam Palmer&#x27;s husband) to be Earl of Castlemaine and Baron of Limbricke in Ireland; but the honour is tied up to the males got of the body of this wife, the Lady Barbara: the reason whereof every body knows.|author=Samuel Pepys |title=}}

Palmer did not want a peerage on these terms, but it was forced on him; and he never took his seat in the Irish House of Lords (although he did use the title). Lady Castlemaine would continue her affair with Charles II until 1665, giving birth to five illegitimate children:

* Lady Anne Palmer, later FitzRoy (1661–1722), probably daughter of King Charles II, although some people believed she bore a resemblance to Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield, another one of Lady Castlemaine&#x27;s lovers. She was claimed by Charles, Chesterfield, and Palmer. Palmer believed Anne to be his biological daughter, and became very attached to her, making her a trustee and the main beneficiary in his will until 1672, when Charles II formally claimed Anne and her sister, Charlotte, as his illegitimate daughters, giving them the surname &quot;FitzRoy&quot;. Anne later became the Countess of Sussex through her marriage to Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex.
* Charles Palmer, later FitzRoy (1662–1730), styled &quot;Lord Limerick&quot; and later Earl of Southampton, created Duke of Southampton (1675), later 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1709). Roger Palmer claimed the boy as his legitimate son and heir, having the child baptized as a Roman Catholic, but had a dispute with King Charles II, which saw the child re-baptized as an Anglican and renamed &quot;FitzRoy&quot; on the King&#x27;s orders.
* Henry FitzRoy (1663–1690), created Earl of Euston (1672) and Duke of Grafton (1675) by King Charles II.
* Lady Charlotte Palmer, later FitzRoy (1664–1718), later Countess of Lichfield through her marriage to Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield. She gave birth to at least 18 children, 12 of which survived to adulthood to marry and produce grandchildren.
* George FitzRoy (1665–1716), created Earl of Northumberland (1674) and Duke of Northumberland (1683) by King Charles II.

In addition to a sixth child; who, unlike her siblings, was not acknowledged by Charles II:
* Barbara (Benedicta) FitzRoy (1672–1737) – Barbara Villiers claimed that she was Charles&#x27;s daughter, but she was probably the child of her mother&#x27;s second cousin and lover, John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough

In June 1670, Barbara Villiers was created 1st Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine, and Baroness Nonsuch in her own right, inheriting the title from her husband.

==Career==
While on a prolonged tour in France and Italy, he served as an officer in the fleet of the Venetian Republic in 1664 before returning to England later that year. In 1665, he served under the Duke of York in the Royal Navy during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.

Palmer showed unwavering and public devotion to Roman Catholicism, in spite of heavy legal and social penalties, and also staunchly supported the Stuart monarchy. His loyalty to the throne and the Stuart succession in general and to the person of Charles II in particular forced his acquiescence to his wife&#x27;s position as the King&#x27;s mistress.

As a prominent Roman Catholic, Castlemaine came under suspicion at the time of the Popish plot alleged by Titus Oates and others. In the atmosphere of anti-Catholic hysteria of the time, Palmer was committed to the Tower of London and subsequently tried at the King&#x27;s Bench Bar in Westminster for high treason. He had to represent himself and, as shown by the verbatim account in the &quot;State Trials&quot;, secured his own acquittal with skilful advocacy in his own defence against Judge Jeffreys and Chief Justice Scroggs. {{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

He became a member of the English Privy Council in 1686, following James II&#x27;s accession to the throne. He was appointed Ambassador to the Vatican, where he was ridiculed as Europe&#x27;s most famous cuckold. 
As ambassador, he promoted James&#x27;s plan to have Pope Innocent XI make his Jesuit privy councillor, Edward Petre, a cardinal. Innocent declined to do so.

After the Revolution of 1688, Castlemaine fled for refuge to Llanfyllin near his ancestral home in Montgomeryshire and stayed for a while in the house of a recusant there, but he was arrested in Oswestry, Shropshire, and committed to the Tower, spending most of 1689 and part of 1690 there. After enduring almost 16 months in the Tower, he was freed on bail. He was arrested and sent to the Tower again in 1696 after failing to attend the Irish Parliament, but was released again 5 months later.

==Death==
He died quietly in Oswestry on 21 July 1705 at the age of 70, and was buried in the Herbert family vault at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Welshpool, Montgomeryshire. His estranged wife Barbara followed him to the grave four years later in 1709. Castlemaine&#x27;s heirs included his nephew, Charles Palmer of Dorney Court, to whom he left property in Wales which had come to him from his mother&#x27;s family, but it proved to be heavily encumbered and worth little.

His titles became extinct at his death. His wife&#x27;s sons might technically have claimed them, since they were all born while she remained married to him, and there is a presumption of legitimacy in marriage, but no-one ever contended that they were in fact legitimate, and no such claim was ever made. The sons had, in any event, all been granted titles of their own by King Charles II, who had openly acknowledged five of Barbara Villiers&#x27; children as his own.

The writings of Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemaine, include the &quot;Catholique Apology&quot; (1666), &quot;The Compendium [of the Popish Plot trials]&quot; (1679) and &quot;The Earl of Castlemaine&#x27;s Manifesto&quot; (1681).

<doc id="603497" wikidata="Q178434" url="?curid=603497" title="Black-rumped flameback">
<text>The black-rumped flameback (Dinopium benghalense), also known as the lesser golden-backed woodpecker or lesser goldenback, is a woodpecker found widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the few woodpeckers that are seen in urban areas. It has a characteristic rattling-whinnying call and an undulating flight. It is the only golden-backed woodpecker with a black throat and a black rump.

==Taxonomy==
The black-rumped flameback was described and illustrated by two pre-Linnaean English naturalists from a dried specimen that had been brought to London. In 1738 Eleazar Albin included the bird as the &quot;Bengall Woodpecker&quot; in his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot; and in 1751 George Edwards included the &quot;Spotted Indian Woodpecker&quot; in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. The black-rumped flameback was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Picus benghalensis&quot;. He cited the earlier descriptions by Albin and Edwards. This woodpecker is now placed in the genus &quot;Dinopium&quot; that was introduced by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1814.

Five subspecies are recognised:
*The nominate subspecies (&quot;D. b. benghalense&quot;) is found across India in the low elevations up to about 1000 m.
*The race in the arid northwestern India and Pakistan, &quot;D. b. dilutum&quot; (Blyth, 1852), has pale yellow upperparts, a long crest and whiter underparts than the nominate race of the Gangetic plains. The upperparts have less spots. It prefers to breed in old gnarled tamarisks, &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Dalbergia&quot; trunks.
*The Southern Peninsular form, &quot;D. b. puncticolle&quot; (Malherbe, 1845), has a black throat with small triangular white spots and bright golden-yellow upperparts.
*The subspecies found in the Western Ghats is separated as &quot;D. b. tehminae&quot; (Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1934), (named after the wife of Salim Ali) and is more olive above, has fine spots on the black throat and the wing-covert spots are not distinct.
*The northern Sri Lankan race, &quot;D. b. jaffnense&quot; (Whistler, 1944), has a shorter beak.

The Sri Lankan red-backed flameback (&quot;Dinopium psarodes&quot;) was formerly treated as a subspecies of the black-rumped flameback. It has a crimson back and all the dark markings are blacker and more extensive. It sometimes intergrades with &quot;D. b. jaffnense&quot; near Puttalam, Kekirawa and Trincomalee.

==Description==


The black-rumped flameback is a large species at 26–29 cm in length. It has a typical woodpecker shape, and the golden yellow wing coverts are distinctive. The rump is black and not red as in the greater flameback. The underparts are white with dark chevron markings. The black throat finely marked with white immediately separates it from other golden backed woodpeckers in the Indian region. The head is whitish with a black nape and throat, and there is a greyish eye patch. Unlike the greater flameback it has no dark moustachial stripes.
The adult male has a red crown and crest. Females have a black forecrown spotted with white, with red only on the rear crest. Young birds are like the female, but duller.

Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects.

The black-rumped flameback is the only golden-backed woodpecker with both a black throat and a black rump.

Leucistic birds have been recorded. Two specimens of male birds from the northern Western Ghats have been noted to have red-tipped feathers on the malar region almost forming a malar stripe. A female specimen from Lucknow has been noted to have grown an abnormal downcurved hoopoe-like bill.

==Distribution and habitat==
This flameback is found mainly on the plains going up to an elevation of about 1200m in Pakistan, India south of the Himalayas and east till the western Assam valley and Meghalaya, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is associated with open forest and cultivation. They are often seen in urban areas with wooded avenues. It is somewhat rare in the Kutch and desert region of Rajasthan.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This species is normally seen in pairs or small parties and sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks. They forage from the ground to the canopy. They feed on insects mainly beetle larvae from under the bark, visit termite mounds and sometimes feed on nectar. As they make hopping movements around branches, they often conceal themselves from potential predators. They adapt well in human-modified habitats making use of artificial constructions fallen fruits and even food scraps.

The breeding season varies with weather and is between February and July. They frequently drum during the breeding season. The nest hole is usually excavated by the birds and has a horizontal entrance and descends into a cavity. Sometimes birds may usurp the nest holes of other birds. Nests have also been noted in mud embankments. The eggs are laid inside the unlined cavity. The normal clutch is three and the eggs are elongate and glossy white. The eggs hatch after about 11 days of incubation. The chicks leave the nest after about 20 days.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka these woodpeckers go by the generic name of &quot;kæralaa&quot; in Sinhala. In some parts of the island, it is also called &quot;kottoruwa&quot; although it more often refers to barbets. This bird appears in a 4.50 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp. It also appears in a 3.75 Taka postal stamp from Bangladesh.

<text>George John Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, (1 September 1758 – 10 November 1834), styled Viscount Althorp from 1765 to 1783, was a British Whig politician. He served as Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents. He was also the father of the Venerable Father Ignatius of St Paul, a Roman Catholic convert to the priesthood.

==Background and education==

Lord Spencer was born at Wimbledon Park House, London, the son of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer, and his wife Margaret Georgiana Poyntz, daughter of Stephen Poyntz, and was baptised there on 16 October 1758. His godparents were King George II, the Earl Cowper (his grandmother&#x27;s second husband) and his great-aunt the Dowager Viscountess Bateman.

His sister Lady Georgiana Spencer married the Duke of Devonshire and became a famed Whig hostess. He was educated at Harrow School from 1770 to 1775 and he won the school&#x27;s &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; (an archery prize) in 1771. He then attended Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1776 to 1778 and graduated with a Master of Arts. He acceded to the earldom on the death of his father in 1783.

==Political career==
Lord Spencer was Whig Member of Parliament for Northampton from 1780 to 1782 and Whig MP for Surrey from 1782 to 1783. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1794 and served under William Pitt the Younger as Lord Privy Seal in 1794 and as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1794 to 1801. He was later Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 under Lord Grenville in the Ministry of All the Talents.

==Other public positions==
Lord Spencer was also High Steward of St Albans from 1783 to 1807, Mayor of St Albans in 1790, President of the Royal Institution from 1813 to 1825 and Commissioner of the Public Records in 1831. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1780 and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1785. He was appointed to the Order of the Garter in 1799. On 18 February 1793, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire.

==Book collecting==
Spencer was known for an interest in literature, particularly early examples of printing. He was the instigator and first President of the exclusive, bibliophilic Roxburghe Club founded in 1812.
Spencer&#x27;s tens of thousands of volumes included the most nearly complete collection of Aldine editions ever brought together. It was acquired in 1892 by Enriqueta Rylands for the John Rylands Library and catalogued by Alice Margaret Cooke. The manuscripts of Spencer&#x27;s collection are relatively few; one has pasted into it a St Christopher block print dated 1423.

From 1789 to 1818 Earl Spencer employed Tomaso d&#x27;Ocheda, an Italian, as his librarian; he had until 1789 been the librarian of Pierre-Antoine Bolongaro-Crevenna.

When Napoleon was in the process of the secularization of religious houses in southern Germany, Spencer used the local British agent and Benedictine monk, Alexander Horn, to acquire many of their rare books and manuscripts.

Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin, a Church of England clergyman and bibliographer, wrote the first of many bibliographical works: &quot;Introduction to the Knowledge of Editions of the Classics&quot; (1802), which brought him to the notice of Earl Spencer, to whom he owed important aid in his bibliographical pursuits. The rich library at Althorp was thrown open to him; he spent much time there and in 1814–1815 published &quot;Bibliotheca Spenceriana&quot;. As the library was not open to the public, the information was found useful, but as its author was unable even to read the characters in which the books he described were written, it was marred by errors, as were almost all his productions. In 1818 Dibdin was commissioned by Earl Spencer to buy books for him on the continent, an expedition described in his sumptuous &quot;Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany&quot; (1821). He also wrote &quot;Aedes Althorpianae&quot;, an account of Althorp giving many details of the library.

==Family==

Lord Spencer married Lady Lavinia Bingham (1762–1831), daughter of Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan, on 6 March 1781. They had nine children:
*John Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (1782–1845)
*Lady Sarah Spencer (1787–1870), who married William Lyttelton, 3rd Baron Lyttelton, and had issue
*Hon. Richard Spencer (1789–1791) died in infancy.
*Captain Hon. Sir Robert Cavendish Spencer (1791–1830), died unmarried at sea.
*Hon. William Spencer (born and died 1792), died in infancy.
*Lady Harriet Spencer (born and died 1793), died in infancy.

*Lady Georgiana Charlotte Spencer (1794–1823), married Lord George Quin, son of Thomas Taylour, 1st Marquess of Headfort, and had issue.
*Vice-Admiral Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer (1798–1857)
*Very Reverend Hon. George Spencer (later known as The Venerable Father Ignatius Spencer) (1799–1864), a Roman Catholic convert who was declared Venerable on 20 February 2021

Lady Spencer died in June 1831, aged 68. Lord Spencer survived her by three years and died in November 1834, aged 76, at Althorp, and was buried in the nearby village of Great Brington on 19 November of that year.

==Spencer jacket==
The Spencer, a type of short jacket from which the UK military mess jacket is derived, is named after George Spencer, reportedly because he had a tail-coat adapted after its tails were burned by coals from a fire.

<doc id="603499" wikidata="Q2545243" url="?curid=603499" title="Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers">
<text>Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers (1453 – 6 March 1491) succeeded his brother, Anthony Woodville, as the third Earl Rivers. He was the son of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and Jacquetta of Luxembourg. Richard was the brother of the English queen Elizabeth Woodville.

==Youth==
Richard was born in 1453. During the Readeption of Henry VI in 1470, he might have accommodated himself to the short-lived restoration of the Lancastrian regime, as Richard was pardoned by King Edward IV, the husband of his sister Elizabeth, on his return to power in 1471. Unlike his older brother Anthony, however, he was not given any special favours under Edward. J. R. Lander states that he was employed in a minor capacity on &quot;various embassies and commissions&quot;.

==As Earl Rivers==
When Richard III executed Richard&#x27;s brother Anthony and seized the throne, Richard Woodville became Earl Rivers. The king confiscated Richard&#x27;s lands but did not otherwise persecute him. Richard seems to have participated in some way in Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion in 1483, as he was attainted in that year. However, he was later pardoned. It is not known whether or not he joined Henry Tudor in 1485, but after Henry&#x27;s victory, his estates were restored. He served in a local capacity in Hereford, Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, but never held any major office.

Richard Woodville was the last of his family to hold the title of Earl Rivers. He died unmarried and the earldom became extinct. The estates attached to the earldom reverted to the crown. His personal lands were bequeathed to his nephew Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset.

<doc id="603510" wikidata="Q666115" url="?curid=603510" title="Carapace">
<text>A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron.

==Crustaceans==

In crustaceans, the carapace functions as a protective cover over the cephalothorax (i.e., the fused head and thorax, as distinct from the abdomen behind). Where it projects forward beyond the eyes, this projection is called a rostrum. The carapace is calcified to varying degrees in different crustaceans.

Zooplankton within the phylum Crustacea also have a carapace. These include Cladocera, ostracods, and isopods, but isopods only have a developed &quot;cephalic shield&quot; carapace covering the head.

==Arachnids==
In arachnids, the carapace is formed by the fusion of prosomal tergites into a single plate which carries the eyes, ocularium, ozopores (a pair of openings of the scent gland of Opiliones) and diverse phaneres.

In a few orders, such as Solifugae and Schizomida, the carapace may be subdivided. In Opiliones, some authors prefer to use the term carapace interchangeably with the term cephalothorax, which is incorrect usage, because carapace refers only to the dorsal part of the exoskeleton of the cephalothorax.

Alternative terms for the carapace of arachnids and their relatives, which avoids confusion with crustaceans, are prosomal dorsal shield and peltidium.

==Turtles and tortoises==
The carapace is the dorsal (back) convex part of the shell structure of a turtle, consisting primarily of the animal&#x27;s rib cage, dermal armor, and scutes.

<doc id="603513" wikidata="Q13222206" url="?curid=603513" title="Enemy of the state">
<text>An enemy of the state is a person suspected of political crimes against the state, such as treason. In designating certain persons and organizations as enemies of the state, the government can realize the political repression of political opponents, such as dissidents; thus a government can justify political repression as protecting the national security of the country and the nation.

==Examples==

===Political===
* In ancient Rome, some parties could be named an enemy of the state through specific public actions resulting in a formally recognized state of war. The Latin term proscription was used for official condemnation of enemies of the state.
* The term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; in the Soviet Union during the period of Stalinism.
* Communists were considered as enemies of the state in Indonesia since 1965. Displaying communist symbols or attempting to propagate the ideology is considered an act of high treason and terrorism punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment.
* Jews, Romani people, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, homosexuals, disabled, communists, social democrats and trade unionists were considered &quot;enemies of the state&quot; in Nazi Germany.
* Carlos Lamarca, a Brazilian Army Captain who deserted to become the leader of a left-wing guerrilla against the military dictatorship; Lamarca was the only man in the history of Brazil to receive the status of traitor, being considered an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;.
* Leaker of classified U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables Chelsea Manning was charged with &quot;aiding the enemy&quot; (identified as al-Qaeda).
* Edward Snowden, the American computer specialist who leaked details of top-secret United States and British government mass surveillance programs to the press, has been discussed by opinion writers as being persecuted as an enemy of the state.
* Human rights defenders working on behalf of communities affected by large-scale development projects are increasingly branded as enemies of the state.
* Clive Palmer, an Australian mining magnate, was labelled as such by Mark McGowan, the Premier of Western Australia, when Palmer sued the Western Australian government for not allowing him free entry into the state during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

===Biography===
* Justin Raimondo&#x27;s biography of Murray Rothbard, &quot;An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard&quot;.
* Bill Lueders&#x27; biography of Erwin Knoll, &quot;An Enemy of the State: The Life of Erwin Knoll&quot;.

===Fictional===
* The fictional character Peter LaNague in the novel &quot;An Enemy of the State (The LaNague Federation, Book 1)&quot; by F. Paul Wilson.
* The fictional character Emmanuel Goldstein in the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell.
* In &quot;Resident Evil: Damnation&quot;, special agent Leon S. Kennedy is accused of being an enemy of the state by President of the Eastern Slav Republic Svetlana Belikova who orders her guards to kill him right after she briefly spars in one-on-one combat with him.

Timothy Donald Eyman (born December 22, 1965) is an American anti-tax activist and businessman.

Since 1997, Eyman has become the most prolific sponsor of Washington ballot measures in its history, having qualified seventeen statewide initiatives. Eleven initiatives were passed by voters, though most of these in turn were later partially or wholly overturned by courts as unconstitutional. His first and most notable success was an initiative preventing affirmative action in Washington State.

Eyman&#x27;s most prominent ballot measures are part of an unsuccessful &quot;20 year tug-of-war&quot; with the state over lowering motor vehicle excise taxes, or &quot;car tabs&quot; to defund Sound Transit, under the slogan &quot;$30 Tabs&quot;, of which 2019&#x27;s Initiative 976 is the most recent. It was ruled unconstitutional in 2020.

In February 2021, Eyman was convicted of violations of campaign finance law and fined $2.6 million, and barred from &quot;managing, controlling, negotiating, or directing financial transactions&quot; for any kind of political committee. In April 2021, he was ordered to pay an additional $2.9 million to reimburse the Washington State Attorney General&#x27;s legal costs in pursuing civil penalties against him. He is currently bankrupt, and in December 2021 a court ordered sale of assets to meet $5.4m in legal liabilities to the State of Washington.

==Early life and education==
Timothy Donald Eyman was born in Yakima, Washington and adopted shortly after birth. He graduated from Yakima&#x27;s West Valley High School and went on to attend Washington State University (WSU) on an academic scholarship.

At WSU, he was initiated into Delta Tau Delta and competed on the university&#x27;s intercollegiate wrestling team, finishing third in the Pacific-10 Conference. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1988 in business management.

==Career==
===Mail order business===
After graduating from WSU, Eyman began a mail order business out of his home selling engraved wristwatches to members of Greek Letter Organizations.

=== Entry into politics ===
In 1995, while living in Seattle&#x27;s Green Lake neighborhood, a King County tax proposal before voters sought to raise $250 million for a new Seattle Mariners stadium. Eyman attended a public meeting where a Seattle radio host, Dave Ross, was speaking. There Eyman decided to help gather signatures at Green Lake while holding a cardboard sign reading, “Let the voters decide”, and gathered 100 signatures on his first day.

Voters ended up rejecting the tax package. Mariners&#x27; owner Nintendo of America insisted the city provide the $250 million funding, or the team would be sold. In an emergency session, Governor Mike Lowry and the legislature authorized King County to levy stadium bond taxes, which ended up being placed on restaurants and car rentals. Despite opposition from voters, the stadium now called T-Mobile Park was built and new taxes were imposed.

This experience drew Eyman into politics, and he often describes it as his “baptism of fire.” As he saw it, “They overruled what the voters did.” In 1997, Eyman sponsored his first ballot measure, Initiative 200, a Washington spin-off of California’s Proposition 209, which passed in 1996. Ward Connerly, an African-American businessman and Proposition 209&#x27;s sponsor, would become Eyman’s hero and inspiration for his own initiative activism. Initiative 200 was approved by voters in 1998, winning 58.2% of the vote.

=== Initiative 695 and &quot;$30 Car Tabs&quot; origin ===
Inspired by the 1998 &quot;No Car Tax&quot; campaign slogan of Virginia&#x27;s then future governor, Jim Gilmore, Eyman sponsored Initiative 695 in 1999. It was an Initiative to the People to lower the fee for &quot;car tabs&quot; (the common name in Washington for car taxes, or motor vehicle excise taxes / MVET) in the state of Washington to a flat fee of $30.

Eyman&#x27;s effort to circulate petitions and gather signatures resulted in 514,141 signatures total. Despite a broad institutional consensus in opposition – including &quot;politicians, governments, the media, business big and small, environmentalists, civic groups, and labor&quot; – voters approved the initiative with 56.16% of the vote, garnering nearly one million votes. Prior to the passage of Initiative 695, car tab fees were 2.2% of the value of the vehicle.

Initiative 695 not only cut car tabs to $30, but also required voter approval of all proposed taxes at the state or local level. After its passage, the initiative was immediately challenged by opponents, citing its effect on government budgets and its violation of a single-subject rule for initiatives. The Washington Supreme Court struck the provision for voter approval of taxes, but allowed the car tab cuts to remain.

While the court considered the constitutionality of the main provision, Democratic governor Gary Locke called a special session of the legislature to pass the $30 car tab flat fee provision into law, lay out budget cuts to account for the tax reduction, and Attorney General Gregoire defended it before the court. Despite &quot;Microsoft, Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, labor, and virtually every editorial page in the state opposing I-695&quot;, and more than $2.1 million spent in the campaign against it, the $30 car tab fee was formally signed into law on March 30 after a positive ruling by the courts.

A January 2001 assessment by the conservative Washington Policy Center of the measure&#x27;s effect claimed a net savings of $750 million in the first year, and twenty-one predictions made by opponents had not materialized. Eyman&#x27;s work on Initiative 695 in 2000 ($30 Car Tabs) was recognized by the Conservative Political Action Conference with its Ronald Reagan Award.

===Permanent Offense===
Following the success of that measure, Eyman established a political action committee called Permanent Offense to campaign for other anti-tax initiatives. In 2000 he began taking a salary as head of Permanent Offense, receiving $45,000 that year. According to Eyman, his decision to begin paying himself was due to the time he had invested into campaigning that had resulted in a loss of income from his watch business. He has since been described as a &quot;professional initiative filer&quot;.

Eyman has been the primary sponsor of ballot initiatives concerning taxes and transportation almost every year since the passage of Initiative 695. Of seventeen initiatives that qualified for the ballot, eleven were passed by vote, however, a majority of those were subsequently overturned or partially invalidated in subsequent court action.

==Political views==
Eyman has previously described himself as an &quot;independent Republican&quot;, also noting that he is an admirer of Ralph Nader and Rob McKenna. He has been variously described by others as a &quot;populist&quot; and a &quot;libertarian&quot;. Knute Berger once called him &quot;a political player on a par with Governor Christine Gregoire and House Speaker Frank Chopp&quot; and &quot;the most influential conservative in the state&quot;.

In a 2006 interview with the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, Eyman said &quot;...there are Democrats and Republicans that really respect the initiative process. It’s those particular elected officials I admire the most, because they realize that they don’t have all the answers&quot;. As of 2019, according to Eyman, he had no formal party affiliation and was &quot;equally frustrated by Republicans and Democrats at times&quot;. Writing in 2005, David S. Broder described Eyman as &quot;a personable young man who has made a cottage industry of organizing tax-limitation initiatives&quot;.

==Political activities after 1999==

=== 2000 ===
After the implementation of the I-695 tax cuts by the legislature, many local governments raised taxes and fees in 1999 to cover the shortfall. Stating local governments largely raised property taxes to cover deficits and the legislature&#x27;s use of the state budget surplus to cover shortfalls negated the need for tax increases a, Eyman sponsored Initiative 722 to reverse negate new property tax increases by capping yearly increases at 2%. Other taxes increases, like school levies, were not subject to I-722&#x27;s tax increase limits. The measure won 55.89% voter approval.

=== 2001 ===
Citing Washington as being the &quot;5th highest taxed state in the nation,&quot; with property taxes that &quot;double every 7 to 9 years&quot; from &quot;decades&quot; of yearly increases as high as 6%, Eyman filed Initiative 747 to limit property taxes in Washington. This measure sought to impose a 1% cap on annual property tax increases. It won with 57.6% voter approval. In 2007, after the initiative was declared unconstitutional by the Washington State Supreme Court, Governor Locke called a special session of the legislature to restore the 1% property tax increase limit. It passed 39–9 in the Senate, and 86–8 in the House.

=== 2002 ===
With Governor Locke&#x27;s $30 car tab law expiring, Eyman sponsored Initiative 776. It was a re-boot of Initiative 695 and continued the theme of $30 Car Tabs. It passed with 51.47%, gaining just over 900,000 votes.

=== 2005 ===
Frustrated by the passage of tax increases from Governor Gregoire despite promises not to raise them, Eyman introduced Initiative 900 to increase the power of the Washington state auditor to conduct performance audits. The initiative was approved by the voters by 56.4%, receiving nearly one million votes.

A 2009 report found a mixed reception by local officials to the performance audits. In December 2013, Democratic Washington state auditor Brian Sonntag said his office had identified almost $1.3 billion in potential five-year savings and increased revenue, after doing more than fifty performance audits and reviews.

===2006===
On January 30, Eyman filed an initiative and a referendum, both intended to repeal a measure which added sexual orientation to the list of categories against which discrimination in housing, lending, and employment is banned in the state of Washington. In addition to seeking to remove &quot;sexual orientation&quot; from the law, Eyman pushed an initiative that would prohibit state government from requiring quotas or other preferential treatment for any person or group &quot;based on sexual orientation or sexual preference&quot;. Eyman had announced he would be turning in the signatures for the gay-rights referendum on June 5. Instead, he showed up at the State Capitol dressed as Darth Vader and then announced he would turn in petitions the next day, at the deadline. He reportedly wasn&#x27;t carrying any of the signatures, but instead was carrying signed petitions for another car-tab measure unrelated to the referendum. The next day, June 6, Eyman announced he had fallen more than 7,000 signatures short of the 112,440 required to get the measure placed on the November ballot. The state law that he had attempted to put to a public vote took effect on the same day.

On January 9, Eyman filed an initiative to cap motor vehicle registration charges at $30 per year and repeal taxes and fees exceeding the $30 limit. On June 29, Eyman submitted 14,270 pages of signatures for this initiative to the secretary of state&#x27;s office. On July 7, Eyman submitted an additional 2,716 pages. While at the front desk, and prior to the counting of any signatures, Eyman requested that the receptionist date stamp a piece of note pad with the number 300,353 on it.

On July 23 Eyman charged the secretary of state&#x27;s office with &quot;... gross incompetence, purposeful sabotage, or blatant dishonesty&quot; for the discrepancy of 34,347 signatures. Along with the &quot;receipt&quot; with the number 300,353, Eyman claimed to have kept weekly logs of the number of signatures collected, and wrote the weight (although not the number of pages or signatures) of each box of petitions on the boxes themselves. The secretary of state&#x27;s office could not provide the boxes, as they were recycled upon the cataloging of the signatures. It also denied the credibility of Eyman&#x27;s receipt, noting that official counting had not even begun at that point, and calling attention to their own official receipts. Eyman has been completely unable to substantiate his claim of submitting 300,353 signatures, as he claims to have not made copies of the petitions. On July 28, the secretary of state&#x27;s office announced that it had conducted a random sample test of 4% of the signatures, finding an invalidation rate of 17.96%. Based upon this number, the initiative failed to make the ballot. A full check of all signatures collected confirmed this conclusion.

In August 2006 a Thurston County judge blocked a tongue-in-cheek initiative (I-831) proposed by Seattle-area computer programmer and blogger David Goldstein that would have allowed voters to criticize – or support – Tim Eyman by declaring, &quot;The citizens of the state of Washington do hereby proclaim that Tim Eyman is a horse&#x27;s ass.&quot;

===2007===
In 2007, Eyman spearheaded Initiative 960, requiring a 2/3 majority for the legislature to raise taxes and legislative approval for the state to raise fees . It passed with more than 51% of the vote. The automated public notification system the initiative created a &quot;political minefield&quot; for legislators who proposed bills that would raise taxes or fees by creating public awareness about those costs.

===2008===
In 2008, Eyman sponsored I-985, which had the purpose to reduce traffic congestion through various means including:
* Opening HOV/carpool lanes to all vehicles during non-peak hours, where &quot;non-peak&quot; is defined as any time outside of 6-9am and 3-6pm on Mondays through Fridays.
* Requiring local governments to synchronize traffic lights on heavily traveled arterials and streets.
* Clearing out accidents faster with expanded emergency roadside assistance, which would be funded by vehicle sales tax revenues.
* Restricting toll usage such that they can only be used on the freeway or bridge being tolled, with any surplus revenue to be redirected to other congestion relief efforts in the state.
Eyman submitted approximately 290,000 signatures to get the initiative on the ballot for the 2008 general election. The initiative claims to follow the recommendations of a congestion study by state auditor Brian Sonntag, but former state transportation secretary Doug MacDonald stated that there is &quot;no connection&quot; between the study&#x27;s findings and the initiative&#x27;s goals. Auditor Sonntag himself directly refuted the claim that I-985 implements the recommendations of the state congestion audit.

Critics argued that opening HOV lanes to more cars would not reduce congestion, due to induced demand, and in fact would likely cause worse congestion since rush-hour traffic typically lasts longer than 3 hours each morning and night during weekdays. I-985 would also have stalled funding for the replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, since the bridge&#x27;s construction is currently dependent on tolls that will come from both the current bridge and the I-90 floating bridge. Since both bridges cross Lake Washington, requiring tolls on only one bridge would serve only to push traffic to the other. The initiative also directed no funding toward mass transit, counteracting the desired goals of the revised Proposition 1, which sought funding for expansion of light rail, commuter trains, and bus service in the Puget Sound region. Proponents of I-985 pointed out that highways I-405 and SR 167 have opened their HOV lanes during non peak hours without any noticeable problems.

The initiative was defeated 60% to 40% with only one of the state&#x27;s 39 counties approving the initiative.

===2009===
In 2009, Eyman sponsored I-1033, which would apply a cap on revenue tied to the consumer price index and population. The bill is similar to TABOR which was enacted in 1992, and then placed on a five-year timeout in 2005 by referendum, in Colorado. The initiative was rejected by voters.

=== 2010 ===
Eyman joined BanCams, a local advocacy group opposed to traffic ticketing cameras, in pursuing local initiatives to ban their use in multiple Washington cities, including Monroe, Bellingham and his hometown of Mukilteo.

In 2010, the legislature exercised its power to suspend voter initiatives which have been in effect for two years and suspended 2007&#x27;s Initiative 960, which required a 2/3 majority in the legislature to raise taxes. In response, Eyman introduced Initiative 1053 to reinstate the 2/3 majority requirement for the legislature to raise taxes, an approach voters supported since it was first proposed in 1993. The initiative was approved by voters with the highest margin of any of Eyman&#x27;s previous initiatives with a 63.75% majority.

===2012===

Eyman sponsored 25 initiatives for 2012, of which only Initiative 1185 made it onto the November general ballot. It passed with 63.91% of the vote. Approximately 95% of the money to support the initiative was reportedly from &quot;corporate behemoths such as oil companies ... the national beer and soda-pop industries and big pharmaceutical firms.&quot;

===2013===

Eyman filed Initiative 517 on April 15, 2012, to &quot;set penalties for interfering with signature-gatherers or signers.&quot; It was referred to 2013 session of legislature, which declined to pass it, sending it to the general election for November 5, 2013. Among those opposing I-517 were former Republican attorney general of Washington, Rob McKenna, publishing on smartergovernmentwa.org: 
I-517 was also opposed by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, &quot;The Columbian&quot; newspaper, &quot;The Wenatchee World&quot;, &quot;The Everett Herald&quot;, &quot;The Olympian&quot;, Washington Research Council, &quot;The News Tribune&quot;, Northwest Progressive Institute, Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Sounders FC, Washington State Democratic Party and many local Democratic organizations.

The initiative lost by a margin of 63%-37%.

===2018===

On March 15, 2018, Eyman introduced two referendum measures with the intent to put all or portions of a recently passed law EHB2957 that effectively phases out non-native finfish aquaculture to a public vote. Eyman withdrew both referendum measures after Cooke Aquaculture, the only company farming nonnative Atlantic salmon in Washington, made it clear they did not want to be associated with his referendum campaign.

From Joel Richardson, Vice President of Public Affairs for Cooke Aquaculture, on the company&#x27;s involvement with the campaign--

:Our company had no affiliation with this individual... Our efforts remain focused on exploring operational options which are helpful and respectful to our employees, tribal, state and community partner.

=== 2019 ===
Initiative 976 again sought to cap car tabs at $30 and end transportation benefit districts and other local vehicle taxes. It passed with 53% of the vote. Like Eyman&#x27;s 1999 Initiative 695 on the same topic, Initiative 976 was reviewed by the Washington Supreme Court, but the current governor of Washington declined to let it become law as the governor in 2000 did.

In February 2020, the King County Superior Court largely upheld I-976, but kept the measure on hold pending a ruling from the Washington State Supreme Court. On October 15, 2020 the Washington State Supreme Court struck down the initiative by ruling it unconstitutional because it &quot;contains more than one subject and its subject is not accurately expressed in its title&quot;.

===2020===

In November 2019, Eyman announced that he was running for Governor of Washington in 2020, while making a public comment at a Sound Transit meeting, as a Republican. He formally entered the race as a Republican in a speech in his hometown Yakima, where he laid out his intention to run an aggressive campaign against Inslee, ignore his primary opponents, focus on conservative issues, and embrace the perceived similarities between him and President Donald Trump in terms of style, attitude and ability to weather attacks from the Left.

During Governor Jay Inslee&#x27;s 2020 shutdown of the state, Eyman used his campaign to challenge Inslee over numerous aspects of his restrictions and proclamations from his COVID-19 response, including distinguishing between “essential” and “non-essential” businesses and workers, the closure of schools and the requirement to wear masks. After Inslee ordered a statewide ban on gatherings of more than 250 people to prevent spread of COVID-19, Eyman promoted a public event for which he set a goal of 251 attendees.

Eyman finished fourth in the top-two primary, with 6.41 percent of the vote.

==Legal issues==
=== Payments from campaign contributions ===
In February 2002 the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; reported that Eyman paid himself $165,000 from campaign donations, while claiming to be working for free. Eyman initially denied receiving payments, but later admitted wrongdoing. The Washington State Public Disclosure Commission, the state equivalent of the Federal Election Commission charged Eyman with diverting $233,000 from his initiative campaigns. Eyman eventually settled with the Washington State Attorney General&#x27;s office, paying $50,000 and accepting a lifetime ban on involvement in any political committee&#x27;s financial accounts. Since the settlement, Eyman&#x27;s co-sponsors and chairmen in his Permanent Offense political committee became more actively involved; Monte Benham of Kennewick became the head of Permanent Offense, though Eyman remained involved politically.

===Campaign reporting omissions===
In March 2017, The Washington State Attorney General sued Eyman for $2.1M accusing Eyman of enriching himself with money donated to initiative campaigns. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2015 investigation by the Public Disclosure Commission into Eyman&#x27;s use of donations to different initiative campaigns.

In February 2020, Eyman was found to have been in violation of Washington campaign finance laws for at least the last seven years, concealing nearly $800,000 in political contributions.

On February 10, 2021, as a result of violating Washington campaign finance laws, Eyman was fined $2.6 million and barred from &quot;managing, controlling, negotiating, or directing financial transactions for any political committee.&quot; In April 2021, Eyman was ordered to also pay $2.9M in legal fees related to the case; the judge described Eyman&#x27;s violations as “numerous and particularly egregious” and said Eyman had used campaign contributions to enrich himself.

===Chair theft ===

On February 13, 2019, Eyman was accused of stealing a $70 office chair from an Office Depot in Lacey. On February 19 the Lacey city prosecutor filed one count of theft against Eyman related to the incident. Through his attorney, Eyman released a statement that the incident was caused by his being distracted by telephone call when he returned to the store to pay for services and merchandise. The charge was to be dismissed in March 2020, under the condition that Eyman committed no criminal activity for 9 months.

== Personal life ==
As of 2022, Eyman lives in Bellevue, Washington.

Divorced from his wife, the couple are the adoptive parents of three children. In 2018, Eyman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December 2021, after continuing to default on fines due to the State of Washington, his bankruptcy was converted by a court to chapter 7 and the court ordered sale of assets to meet $5.4m in liabilities.

<doc id="603521" wikidata="Q335642" url="?curid=603521" title="John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham">
<text>General John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham (9 October 1756 – 24 September 1835) was a British soldier and politician. He spent a lengthy period in the cabinet but is best known for commanding the disastrous Walcheren Campaign of 1809.

Chatham was the eldest son of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He was two and a half years older than his famous brother William Pitt the Younger, the future prime minister. After serving as a junior officer in the American War of Independence, he succeeded his father as Earl of Chatham in 1778. Politically he was a close supporter of his brother during the following decade, leading to his appointment as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1788. Despite overseeing the Royal Navy&#x27;s victory at the Glorious First of June in 1794, he faced criticism for his handling of the Admiralty and was demoted to the comparatively unimportant post of Lord Privy Seal. Although he continued to serve in William&#x27;s cabinet, the relationship between the two brothers never fully recovered after this point.

After serving in the 1799 Helder Campaign, he was promoted to be Master General of the Ordnance in 1801. This became a key role in the next few years when a French invasion appeared imminent, and he helped oversee Britain&#x27;s defences including the construction of a series of martello towers. He grew increasingly independent from his brother and did not resign from the cabinet when William Pitt left office in 1801. He held this post under Henry Addington and when his brother returned to office again in 1804. Following his brother&#x27;s death in 1806, he briefly went into opposition against the Ministry of All the Talents before returning as Master General in the new Tory government of 1807. He also continued his military career, being promoted to lieutenant general and appointed to several commands in charge of home defence.

Considered on at least two occasions as a possible prime minister, Chatham rejected these approaches due to poor health of his wife. He also turned down the prospect of commanding British troops in Portugal in 1808 at the beginning of the Peninsular War, a command that instead went to Arthur Wellesley. In 1809 he did accept command of an expedition to the island of Walcheren, as part of a plan to strike at a French fleet being assembled in nearby Antwerp. Despite overseeing the largest force Britain had despatched abroad during the war, the expedition became bogged down on the island and began suffering heavy casualty rates due to disease. Chatham was recalled and was subject to an inquiry that largely placed the blame on him.

After a number of years in the political wilderness, in 1820 Chatham was made Governor of Gibraltar. Although Europe was at peace by this time, Gibraltar remained a key strategic post, and he oversaw improvements to the defences while also dealing with a difficult diplomatic relationship with neighbouring Spain which was going through a period of political turbulence.

==Early life==
John Pitt was born on 9 October 1756 at Hayes Place in Kent, the home of his father William Pitt. He was the second child and eldest son of Pitt and his wife Hester Grenville. In his early years, his father was Secretary of State at the height of the Seven Years&#x27; War, winning great popularity with the public due to a string of victories over the French – particularly during the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 – until his dramatic resignation in 1761. At the age of five, John became heir to a peerage when his mother was made Baroness Chatham. In 1766 his father returned to office as Prime Minister, taking the title of Earl of Chatham which John also became heir to styled as Viscount Pitt.

As a child he was often in poor health, suffering frequent fevers. His parents chose not to send him to Eton, which his father had hated. Instead, he was educated at the family homes in Hayes and Burton Pynsent in Somerset by a tutor. By 1761 he had four siblings, two sisters Hester and Harriet and two brothers William and James. He was emotionally very close to his brothers and disliked whenever he was separated from them. He grew up to be something of a dandy in his dress and greatly enjoyed hunting. Already, however, despite his natural intelligence, he was beginning to show signs of laziness that were later to be sharply criticised during his political career. To the delight of his father, Pitt began showing interest in pursuing a military career.

==Early career==

Chatham joined the army as an ensign in the 47th Regiment of Foot on 14 March 1774. He served as aide-de-camp to General Guy Carleton in Quebec, where they made preparations to resist a planned invasion by American forces. In October 1775 he departed for London carrying dispatches, missing the Battle of Quebec that took place at the end of the year where Carleton successfully defended the city.

Back in Britain, under strong family pressure, Pitt resigned his commission in early 1776 in protest against the war with America, to which his father was vehemently opposed. He became effective head of the family due to his father&#x27;s ill health, and took an increasing interest in politics. It was rumoured, at one point, that he might stand for Parliament for Westminster.

He only returned to the army in March 1778, this time as a lieutenant in the 39th Foot. France had entered the American War of Independence the previous month, meaning that he was now able to serve without fighting against the Americans. He was due to sail to Gibraltar as aide-de-camp to the lieutenant governor, Colonel Robert Boyd. On 7 April he and his younger brothers were in attendance when their father rose in the House of Lords to give a speech, in which he called for defiance against the French. Shortly after finishing his speech, their father collapsed and died a few weeks later. In John Singleton Copley&#x27;s painting &quot;The Death of the Earl of Chatham&quot;, Pitt is portrayed in military uniform at his father&#x27;s side. His father&#x27;s last words at Hayes were reputedly &quot;Leave your dying father, and go to the defence of your country&quot;.

Having succeeded to the Earldom, Chatham spent the following year in Gibraltar before transferring to the West Indies with a newly raised regiment, the 86th Foot. By the end of 1781 he was back in Britain and in 1782 obtained a Captaincy in the London-based 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards. Although he was appointed colonel in October 1793 and major general in February 1795, Chatham does not appear to have undertaken any military duties for nearly fifteen years after the end of the War of American Independence in 1783.

==Political career==
=== Member of Parliament ===

For much of the 1780s and 1790s Chatham focused on a political career. As heir to his father, he was poised to be a natural leader of his political supporters, the Chathamites. However, during the years that Chatham had devoted to his military career these followers were led by Lord Shelburne and then, increasingly, by Chatham&#x27;s younger brother. Known as William Pitt the Younger, to distinguish him from his father, he had entered Parliament in 1781 and the following year became Chancellor of the Exchequer. By the time Chatham returned permanently to Britain, his brother was already the dominant political figure in the family. Their youngest brother James, a Royal Navy officer, died from fever in Antigua in 1780.

Already Chatham was struggling with debt, despite his inheritance, due both to his own overspending and the poor state their father had left the family finances in. Chatham often gambled and became involved in horsebreeding and racing, which turned into expensive pursuits for him. In July 1783, he married Mary, the second daughter of Thomas Townshend who had been a political ally of his father. It was a love match, rather than an arranged marriage. Mary was known as attractive and very fashionable in society, although she was to suffer from physical and mental illness throughout their marriage.

Chatham joined with Pitt and Shelburne to oppose the Fox–North coalition of 1783 but generally kept a low profile during these years. Pitt became prime minister in December 1783. Chatham supported his brother in the Lords but did not take office. In February 1784 on the way back from an event in the City of London, the brothers were attacked by a mob likely organised by supporters of their rival Charles James Fox. In the subsequent 1784 general election Pitt won a decisive victory, securing his government&#x27;s future. Due to his wife&#x27;s severe illness, Chatham did not consider himself able to join his brother&#x27;s government for the next few years, despite rumours linking him to various posts.

===First Lord of the Admiralty===

In July 1788 William offered Chatham the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. &#x27;I have had my doubts whether the public may not think this too much like monopoly,&#x27; Pitt confessed, &#x27;but that doubt is not sufficient to counterbalance the personal comfort which will result from it and the general advantage to the whole of our system&#x27;. 

Pitt&#x27;s cousin, William Wyndham Grenville, explained the reason for the appointment in more detail: Chatham would connect &#x27;the department of the Admiralty with the rest of the administration, which has never yet been the case under Pitt&#x27;s government, even in the smallest degree&#x27;.

In 1790, Chatham oversaw the mobilisation of the navy during the Nookta Sound Crisis with Spain. In gratitude for the successful resolution of the crisis in Britain&#x27;s favour, George III wanted to award the Order of the Garter to the Prime Minister. Pitt declined the offer but suggested it be awarded to his brother instead. Chatham accepted the honour, and was immensely proud of it, incorporating the image into the design of his crest, which featured on his carriage and cutlery.

Generally, Chatham&#x27;s tenure as First Lord of the Admiralty was not especially distinguished. Important reforms were shelved and Chatham soon acquired a reputation for disorganisation and laziness. Contemporaries noted &#x27;the inconvenience attending his in bed till the day is advanced, as officers &amp;c were kept waiting&#x27;. 

During the first major campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars Chatham&#x27;s Admiralty was blamed in part for the failure of the Siege of Dunkirk in 1793. Due to miscommunication between the Board of Ordnance and the Admiralty, the ships carrying siege weaponry and supplies for the besieging forces arrived two weeks late. Although in this instance Chatham does not seem to have been guilty of any neglect, his reputation was fatally compromised. A further disappointment took place during the Siege of Toulon, in which the Allies suffered a defeat. It was around this time that he earned his nickname of &#x27;the late Lord Chatham&#x27; due to his unpunctuality.

The Admiralty was also criticised in the national press for the failure of the Royal Navy to engage in a major fleet engagement against the French during the opening months of the war until the Glorious First of June in 1794. Even this was an ambivalent victory for Chatham, as the victorious British had been unable to prevent a major convoy arriving in France from West Indies, undermining the blockade. Chatham had grown increasingly frustrated by the interference at the Admiralty by colleagues, particularly Henry Dundas.

===Demotion===

Chatham had become a magnet for criticism of the government, something which his relationship to the Prime Minister did not help. After a further disagreement between Chatham and Dundas, Pitt was forced to choose between them. Dundas has become a trusted ally and advisor, and the Prime Minister chose to back him rather than his brother. In December 1794 Pitt finally responded to pressure and moved his brother to the less responsible post of Lord Privy Seal. He chose to demote Chatham by letter rather than in person as this &quot;must be unnecessarily distressing to us both&quot;. Chatham was furious about his dismissal and demanded to see Pitt in person, which eventually the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to. Their meeting was not productive and Chatham considered refusing his new office, shattering the image of unity in the cabinet that Pitt wanted to project. Eventually, Pitt persuaded the King to make the offer directly which Chatham reluctantly accepted. He believed that it would be thought that he had been removed from the Admiralty because the government had no confidence in his management of it. He was replaced by Lord Spencer. As he feared, almost immediately the opposition did launch attacks in the Commons on his alleged mismanagement.

After losing the Admiralty, Chatham&#x27;s relationship with his brother never fully recovered. Two years later Chatham was promoted to Lord President of the Council. Although he was tempted to reject the offer, he accepted what was intended as an olive branch by Pitt. The two publicly reconciled and Chatham visited Pitt at Holwood. Nonetheless, there was a lack of the old warmth between them, and Chatham increasingly took an independent line in the cabinet where he had previously been a close supporter of Pitt.

===Defence of Britain===

Here he stayed, remaining in office after Pitt&#x27;s resignation under Henry Addington, until a cabinet reshuffle in June 1801 moved him to the post of Master-General of the Ordnance. He continued in this post until May 1810, with only a short interval out of office in 1806–1807. He became the General Officer in Command of the Eastern District in 1806. Following the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens in 1803, the prospect of a French invasion of Britain by Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée seemed imminent. Chatham was closely involved in preparing Britain&#x27;s defences, particularly at likely landing points along the south coast of England.

A major defensive innovation of the period was the Martello tower, which British troops had first encountered in Corsica.

==Later military career==

In 1798 Chatham returned to the army. He was appointed to command a brigade in the Helder campaign in 1799. This was an expedition sent by Britain to the Batavian Republic, one of several attempts by Britain to liberate the Low Countries during the war. Commanded by the Duke of York, a younger son of the King, the British struggled to co-operate with their Russian allies and faced unexpectedly heavy French resistance.

He was wounded by a spent ball at the Battle of Castricum on 6 October. The Allied forces were evacuated following the Convention of Alkmaar. After this he served as commander of various military districts, but for some reason was passed over in favour of Arthur Wellesley for a command in the Peninsular War.

==Walcheren==
===Campaign===
In May 1809 the Secretary of State for War, Lord Castlereagh, offered Chatham the command of an amphibious assault aimed at destroying the French fleet and fortifications around Antwerp and the island of Walcheren. Chatham commanded the largest expeditionary force Britain had yet fielded in the war. Despite early success in taking the town of Flushing, the campaign was an unmitigated disaster. The army made slow headway and the French immediately withdrew their fleet to Antwerp, a tactic that should have been foreseen by the politicians, admirals and generals planning the campaign from the start. While Chatham quarrelled with the naval commander, Sir Richard Strachan, as many as 8,000 British troops succumbed to malaria and other diseases.

===Inquiry===
Chatham was recalled in disgrace. His appearance before a parliamentary enquiry did him no favours, particularly when it emerged that he had presented the King with a private memorandum which ought to have gone to the Secretary of State for War first. Spencer Perceval&#x27;s government withdrew its support from Chatham and he was forced to resign from the Ordnance in May 1810.

Chatham&#x27;s political and military reputation was ruined. A poem circulated making fun of his inactivity and the lack of co-operation between the army and navy:

==Later life==

Chatham did not serve actively again but was promoted to full General in January 1812. He continued to hold various ceremonial positions such as Lieutenant Governor of Jersey and High Steward of Colchester to which he had been appointed back in 1807. He prepared a dossier, outlining a defence of his actions during the Walcheren campaign.

During these years Arthur Wellesley made a great success of the command that Chatham had turned down, leading Allied forces to victory in the Peninsular War and invading southern France. Rewarded with a Dukedom, he became Britain&#x27;s premier military commander and oversaw the Allied victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, with Chatham playing no part in any of these campaigns.

===Gibraltar===
In 1820 he succeeded Duke of Kent as Governor of Gibraltar. His predecessor, the father of the future Queen Victoria, had not been on the Rock since a mutiny amongst his troops in 1803 and a series of acting Governors had performed duties on his behalf. Since 1814 this role had been performed by Sir George Don. Chatham initially intended to also hold the post in absence, but following political pressure from the opposition he agreed to take personal command in Gibraltar. After a long illness his wife died in May 1821, and he finally sailed for the Mediterranean that October.

It was more than forty years since Chatham had last visited Gibraltar as a junior officer. During that time it had survived a major Franco-Spanish siege and the civilian population had grown rapidly to over 13,000 living alongside a 4,000-strong garrison. Sir George Don, who had been acting command of the garrison for seven years, continued to serve as lieutenant governor under Chatham, and the two men enjoyed a good relationship. He took over his post at a time when neighbouring Spain was undergoing severe turbulence as Ferdinand VII was challenged by Spanish Liberal opponents.

He died at his house in Charles Street, London, on 24 September 1835, aged 78.

==Family==
Chatham married The Hon. Mary Elizabeth Townshend, daughter of the 1st Baron Sydney, on 10 July 1783. The couple had no children. Lady Chatham died on 21 May 1821. Chatham did not remarry and on his death the Earldom of Chatham became extinct.

==Legacy==
John Pitt was the namesake of Lord Chatham Island in the Galapagos, now San Cristobal. The name was bestowed by Captain James Colnett in 1793 while Pitt was still first lord of the Admiralty.

<text>Earl Rivers was an English title, which has been created three times in the Peerage of England. It was held in succession by the families of Woodville (or Wydeville), Darcy and Savage.

==History==
The first creation was made for Richard Woodville, 1st Baron Rivers, in 1466 and remained in this family until 1491. As borne by the Woodvilles the title was not derived from the name of a place, but from an ancient family name, Redvers, or Reviers, members of this family, whose arms are quartered on the Rivers shield, having been sometime Earls of Devon.

The second creation was made in 1626 for Thomas Darcy, 1st Viscount Colchester, who had succeeded as 3rd Baron Darcy of Chiche (created in 1551). In 1613, a reversion of the barony was granted to Sir Thomas Savage, Bt (created Viscount Savage in 1626 and son-in-law of Darcy); this creation and the earldom both had a remainder to Darcy&#x27;s heirs male of his body, with remainder to Savage and the heirs male of his body. Savage&#x27;s son John succeeded to the Savage baronetcy and viscountcy in 1635. In 1640 on the death of the 1st Earl, John succeeded to the 1613 reversion of the Darcy of Chiche barony, the Colchester viscountcy and the Rivers earldom; the 1551 creation of the Darcy of Chiche barony became extinct. The earldom and the subsidiary titles became extinct when John Savage, 5th Earl Rivers, died in 1737.

Elizabeth, Viscountess Savage, wife of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage, daughter of the 1st Earl Rivers and mother of the 2nd Earl, was created Countess Rivers in her own right in 1641. This title was for life only and became extinct at her death in 1650.

A new Rivers barony, held by the family of Pitt and its later representative, that of Pitt-Rivers, was in existence from 1776 to 1880.

<text>The greater flameback (Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus), also known as the greater goldenback or large golden-backed woodpecker, is a woodpecker species. It occurs widely in the northern Indian subcontinent, eastwards to southern China, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, western and central Java and northeast Borneo.

==Taxonomy==
It has been suggested to split the greater flameback into the following species:

*Greater flameback, (&quot;C. guttacristatus&quot;) (&quot;C. lucidus&quot; if taken as a group and not split)
*Crimson-backed flameback, (&quot;C. stricklandi&quot;) of Sri Lanka
*Javan flameback (&quot;C. strictus&quot;) of eastern Java, Bali, and Kangean Islands
*Luzon flameback (&quot;C. haematribon&quot;) of Luzon, Polillo, Catanduanes and Marinduque in the northern Philippines 
*Yellow-faced flameback (&quot;C. xanthocephalus&quot;) of Negros, Guimaras, Panay, Masbate and Ticao, Philippine Islands
*Buff-spotted flameback (&quot;C. lucidus&quot;) of Bohol, Leyte, Samar, Biliran, Panaon, Mindando, Basilan, and Samal, Philippine Islands
*Red-headed flameback (&quot;C. erythrocephalus&quot;) of Balabac, Palawan, Busuanga, and Calamian, Philippine Islands
*Malabar flameback (&quot;C. socialis&quot;) of southwestern India

==Description==

The greater flameback is a large woodpecker, at 33 cm in length. It is of typical woodpecker shape, and has an erect crest and a long neck. Coloration is highly variable between subspecies; it always has unmarked golden-yellow to dark brown back and wings. The rump is red and the tail is black. The underparts are white with dark markings (chevrons, stripes, or bands), or light brown. The head is whitish with a black pattern, or it is yellow, brown, or red. The straight-pointed bill is longer than the head, and the legs have four-toed zygodactyl feet (two toes pointing forward, two backward) and are lead-grey in color. The eyes&#x27; irises are whitish to yellow.

The adult male greater flameback always has a red crown. Females have a crown color varying between subspecies, such as black spotted with white, yellow, or brown with lighter dots. Young birds are like the females, but duller, with brown irises.

===Similar species===
White-and-black-headed greater flameback subspecies resemble some of the three-toed &quot;Dinopium&quot; flamebacks, but are not particularly closely related. Unlike the black-rumped flameback (&quot;D. benghalense&quot;) and the common flameback (&quot;D. javanense&quot;), the greater flameback&#x27;s dark moustache stripes are divided by white (making them inconspicuous at a distance); except in &quot;C. stricklandi&quot;, their hindneck is white (not black), and even in the Sri Lankan birds, the dark colour does not extend to between the shoulders as it does in &quot;Dinopium&quot;; consequently, when seen from behind, the black-and-white-headed greater flamebacks outside Sri Lanka show a white neck bordered with black on the sides, while the &quot;Dinopium&quot; species have a black neck and upper back, with thin, white borders to the neck. Those flamebacks are also smaller (though this is only reliable in direct comparison), have a bill that is shorter than the head, and dark irises.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This flameback is a species associated with a diversity of rather open forest habitat, such as found in the foothills of the Himalayas or in the Western Ghats; it also inhabits mangrove forest. It seems to be well-adapted to particular forest types, while the similar-looking common flameback (&quot;Dinopium javanense&quot;) is more of a generalist; thus, depending on what forests predominate in a region, &quot;C. lucidus&quot; may be more (e.g. in Thailand) or less common (e.g. in peninsular Malaysia) than &quot;D. javanense&quot;. In Malaysian mangrove forest, for example, the greater flameback has been found to prefer tall &quot;Avicennia alba&quot; for foraging, while the common flameback rather indiscriminately uses that species, as well as &quot;Bruguiera parviflora&quot; and &quot;Sonneratia alba&quot;.

Like other woodpeckers, the greater flameback uses its bill to dig out food from trees, and its zygodactyl feet and stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks. The long tongue can be darted forward to extract wood-boring arthropod prey; while mainly feeding on small invertebrates, greater flamebacks also drink nectar. They nest in tree holes, laying three or four white eggs.

== Conservation ==
Widely distributed and common in parts of its range, the greater flameback is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

== Evolution ==
Convergent evolution in plumage between a larger and a smaller species is found among other woodpeckers, such as the North American downy woodpecker (&quot;&quot;Picoides&quot; pubescens&quot;) and hairy woodpecker (&quot;&quot;P.&quot; villosus&quot;), the tropical American smoky-brown woodpecker (&quot;&quot;P.&quot; fumigatus&quot;) and certain &quot;Veniliornis&quot; species, or the striped woodpecker (&quot;V. lignarius&quot;) and checkered woodpecker (&quot;V. mixtus&quot;), and some South American &quot;Piculus&quot; and &quot;Picoides&quot;. In all of these cases, these birds are neither gregarious nor known to be bad-tasting, and due to their size difference and habitat preferences, do not compete much; hence the usual reasons for mimicry do not seem to apply. While the similar plumage may be due to sheer chance, perhaps as an atavism of plesiomorphic pattern, the facts that such cases are commonplace in the Picinae and that the species involved are usually sympatric suggests that some as yet undiscovered may benefit either some or all of the taxa involved.

<doc id="603532" wikidata="Q211313" url="?curid=603532" title="2002 AA29">
<text> (also written 2002 AA29) is a small near-Earth asteroid that was discovered on January 9, 2002 by the LINEAR &quot;(Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research)&quot; automatic sky survey. The diameter of the asteroid is only about . It revolves about the Sun on an almost circular orbit very similar to that of the Earth. This lies for the most part inside the Earth&#x27;s orbit, which it crosses near the asteroid&#x27;s furthest point from the Sun, the aphelion. Because of this orbit, the asteroid is classified as Aten type, named after the asteroid 2062 Aten.

A further characteristic is that its mean orbital period about the Sun is exactly one sidereal year. This means that it is locked into a relationship with the Earth, since such an orbit is only stable under particular conditions. As yet only a few asteroids of this sort are known, locked into a 1:1 resonance with the Earth. The first was 3753 Cruithne, discovered in 1986.

Asteroids that have a 1:1 orbital resonance with a planet are also called co-orbital objects, because they follow the orbit of the planet. The most numerous known co-orbital asteroids are the so-called trojans, which occupy the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points of the relevant planet. However, does not belong to these. Instead, it follows a so-called horseshoe orbit along the path of the Earth.

== Orbit ==
=== Orbital data ===
Shortly after the discovery by LINEAR, Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Athabasca University (Canada), the Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston (Ontario, Canada), the York University in Toronto and the Tuorla Observatory of the University of Turku in Finland determined the unusual orbit of , and through further observations at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii it was confirmed that:
* Its orbit lies for the most part inside Earth&#x27;s orbit. The orbits of most asteroids lie in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Through orbital disturbances by the gas giant planets, mainly Jupiter and the Kirkwood gaps, and through the Yarkovsky effect (force due to asymmetrical absorption and emission of infrared radiation) asteroids are diverted into the inner Solar System, where their orbits are further influenced by close approaches with the inner planets. has probably been brought in the same way from the outer Solar System into Earth&#x27;s influence. However, it is also suggested that the asteroid has always been on a near-Earth orbit and thus that it or a precursor body was formed near Earth&#x27;s orbit. In this case one possibility is that it could be a fragment from a collision of a middle-sized asteroid with Earth or the Moon.
* Its mean orbital period is one sidereal year. After it was diverted into the inner Solar System – or formed on a path near Earth&#x27;s orbit – the asteroid must have been moved into an orbit corresponding with Earth. In this orbit it was repeatedly pulled by Earth in such a way that its own orbital period became the same as that of Earth. In the current orbit, Earth thus holds the asteroid in synchronicity with its own orbit.
* The orbit of the asteroid is almost circular, with an eccentricity of 0.012 which is even lower than that of the Earth at 0.0167. The other near-Earth asteroids have on average a significantly higher eccentricity of 0.29. Also, all other asteroids in 1:1 resonance with Earth known before 2002 have very strongly elliptical orbits – e.g. the eccentricity of (3753) Cruithne is 0.515. At the time of its discovery the orbit of was unique, because of which the asteroid is often called the first true co-orbital companion of Earth, since the paths of previously discovered asteroids are not very similar to Earth&#x27;s orbit. The very low orbital eccentricity of is also an indication that it must always have been on a near-Earth orbit, or the Yarkovsky effect must have comparatively strongly caused it to spiral into the inner Solar System over billions of years, since as a rule asteroids which have been steered by planets have orbits with higher eccentricity.
* The orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic (orbital plane of Earth) of is a moderate 10.739°. Hence its orbit is slightly tilted compared with that of Earth.

=== Shape of the orbit ===

If one looks at the orbit of from a point moving with the Earth around the Sun (the reference frame of the Earth–Sun system), it describes over the course of 95 years an arc of almost 360°, which during the next 95 years it retraces in reverse. The shape of this arc is reminiscent of a horseshoe, from which comes the name &quot;horseshoe orbit&quot;. As it moves along the Earth&#x27;s orbit, it winds in a spiral about it, in which each loop of the spiral takes one year. This spiral motion (in the Earth–Sun reference frame) arises from the slightly lower eccentricity and the tilt of the orbit: the inclination relative to the Earth&#x27;s orbit is responsible for the vertical component of the spiral loop, and the difference in eccentricity for the horizontal component.

When is approaching the Earth from in front (i.e. it is moving slightly slower, and the Earth is catching it up), the gravitational attraction of the Earth shifts it onto a slightly faster orbit, a little nearer the Sun. It now hurries ahead of the Earth along its new orbit, until after 95 years it has almost lapped the Earth and is coming up from behind. Again it comes under the Earth&#x27;s gravitational influence; this time it is lifted onto a slower orbit, further from the Sun. On this orbit it can no longer keep pace with the Earth, and it falls behind until in 95 years it is once again approaching the Earth from in front. The Earth and chase each other in turn around the Sun, but do not get close enough to break the pattern.

On 8 January 2003, the asteroid approached the Earth from in front to a distance of , its closest approach for nearly a century. Since that date, it has been hurrying ahead (with a semi-major axis less than 1 AU), and will continue to do so until it has reached its closest approach from behind on 11 July 2097 at a distance of . As a result of this subtle exchange with the Earth, unlike other Earth orbit crossing asteroids, we need have no fear that it could ever collide with the Earth. Calculations indicate that in the next few thousand years it will never come closer than 4.5 million kilometres, or about twelve times the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
Because of its orbital inclination of 10.739° to the ecliptic, is not always forced by the Earth on its horseshoe orbit however but can sometimes slip out of this pattern. It is then caught for a while in the neighbourhood of the Earth. This will next happen in about 600 years i.e. in the 26th century. It will then stay within the small gap in the Earth&#x27;s orbit which it does not reach in its previous horseshoe orbit, and will be no further than 0.2 astronomical units (30 million km) away from the Earth. There it will slowly circle the Earth almost like a second moon, although it takes one year for a circuit. After 45 years it finally switches back into the horseshoe orbit, until it again stays near the Earth for 45 years around the year 3750 and again in 6400. In these phases in which it stays outside its horseshoe orbit it oscillates in the narrow region along the Earth&#x27;s orbit where it is caught, moving back and forth in 15 years. Because it is not bound to the Earth like the Moon but is mainly under the gravitational influence of the Sun, it belongs to the bodies called quasi-satellites. This is somewhat analogous to two cars travelling side by side at the same speed and repeatedly overtaking one another but which are however not attached to each other. Orbital calculations show that was in this quasi-satellite orbit for 45 years from about 520 AD but because of its tiny size was too dim to have been seen. It switches approximately cyclically between the two orbital forms, but always stays for 45 years in the quasi-satellite orbit. Outside the time frame from about 520-6500 AD, the calculated orbits become chaotic i.e. not predictable, and thus for periods outside this time frame no exact statements can be made. was the first known heavenly body that switches between horseshoe and quasi-satellite orbits.

== Physical nature ==
=== Brightness and size ===
Relatively little is known about itself. With a size of about it is very small, on account of which it is seen from the Earth as a small point even with large telescopes, and can only be observed using highly sensitive CCD cameras. At the time of its closest approach in January 2003 it had an apparent magnitude of about 20.4.

So far nothing concrete is known about the composition of . Because of its nearness to the Sun, it cannot however consist of volatile substances such as water ice, since these would evaporate or sublime; one can clearly observe this happening to a comet as this forms the visible tail. Presumably it will have a dark, carbon-bearing or somewhat lighter silicate-rich surface; in the former case the albedo would be around 0.05, in the latter somewhat higher at 0.15 to 0.25. It is due to this uncertainty that the figures for its diameter cover such a wide range.

A further uncertainty arises from radar echo measurements at the Arecibo Radio Telescope, which could only pick up an unexpectedly weak radar echo, implying that is either smaller than estimated or reflects radio waves only weakly. In the former case it would have to have an unusually high albedo. This would be evidence in support of the speculation that it, or at least the material of which it is composed, is different from most other asteroids so far discovered on near-Earth orbits, or represents a fragment thrown off by the collision of a medium-sized asteroid with the Earth or the Moon.

=== Rotational period ===
Using radar echo measurements at the Arecibo radio telescope the rotational period of could be determined. In this radar astronomy procedure radio waves of known wavelength are emitted from a radio telescope aimed at an asteroid. There they are reflected, and because of the Doppler effect the part of the surface that is moving towards the observer (because of the asteroid&#x27;s rotation) shortens the wavelength of the reflected waves, whilst the other part which is turning away from the observer lengthens the reflected wavelength. As a result, the wavelength of the reflected waves is &quot;smeared out&quot;. The extent of the wavelength smearing and the diameter of the asteroid allow the rotational period to be narrowed down. 33 minutes is thus calculated as the upper limit of the rotational period for ; it probably rotates more quickly. This rapid rotation together with the small diameter and therefore low mass leads to some interesting conclusions:

* The asteroid rotates so quickly that the centrifugal force on its surface exceeds its gravitational pull. It is therefore under tension and so cannot be composed of an agglomeration of loosely bound debris or of fragments circling each other – as is supposed for several other asteroids and for example has been determined for the asteroid (69230) Hermes. Instead the body must be made of a single relatively strong block of rock or of pieces baked together. However, its tensile strength is probably considerably lower than terrestrial rock and the asteroid also very porous.
* cannot possibly have been built up from individual small pieces, as these would be thrown apart by the rapid rotation. Therefore, it must be a fragment blown off in the collision of two heavenly bodies. J. Richard Gott and Edward Belbruno from Princeton University have speculated that might have formed together with Earth and Theia, the postulated planet that, according to the giant impact hypothesis, collided with Earth in its early history.

== Outlook ==
Because its orbit is very similar to the Earth&#x27;s, the asteroid is relatively easily reachable by space probes. would therefore be a suitable object of study for more precise research into the structure and formation of asteroids and the evolution of their orbits around the Sun. Meanwhile, further co-orbital companions of the Earth of this type on horseshoe orbits or on orbits as quasi-satellites have already been found, such as the quasi-satellite . Furthermore, it is assumed that there are small trojan companions of the Earth with diameters in the region of 100 metres located at the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points of the Earth–Sun system.

<doc id="603539" wikidata="Q5949661" url="?curid=603539" title="John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland">
<text>John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, (1 June 175915 December 1841), styled Lord Burghersh between 1771 and 1774, was a British Tory politician of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, who served in most of the cabinets of the period, primarily as Lord Privy Seal ultimately spending 33 years in office.

==Background==
Westmorland was the son of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland, and Lady Augusta Bertie, daughter of Capt. Lord Montagu Bertie (the seventh child of Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven). He succeeded in the earldom on the death of his father in 1774.

==Political career==
In 1789 Westmorland was appointed Joint Postmaster General by William Pitt the Younger and sworn into the Privy Council. Already the same year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Pitt, a post he held until 1794. On 18 February 1793, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire. From 1795 to 1798 he was Master of the Horse under Pitt. The latter year Pitt made him Lord Privy Seal, a position he would hold under five prime Ministers (Pitt, Addington, Pitt again, Portland, Perceval and Liverpool) for the next 35 years, except between 1806 and 1807 when Lord Grenville was in office.

Westmorland was a &quot;fierce&quot; defender of slavery, and in 1799 denounced efforts by British abolitionists to abolish Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. He also raised a British Volunteer Corps cavalry regiment in Northamptonshire in 1797, and was appointed its colonel on 20 April 1797. He was later Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire between 1828 and 1841. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1793.

==Family==

Lord Westmorland married Sarah Anne Child (28 August 1764 – 9 November 1793), the only daughter and heiress of wealthy banker, Robert Child, against her father&#x27;s wishes, at Gretna Green on 20 May 1782. Child consequently cut his daughter and her sons and their descendants out of his will, and made his daughter&#x27;s daughters his heirs to prevent the Fanes from benefitting from this elopement. Their eldest daughter, Lady Sarah Sophia Fane (1785–1867), having thus been made testamentary heiress of her maternal grandfather, married George Child-Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, her husband assuming the additional surname of Child. 
The Earl and Countess of Westmorland had one son and four daughters: 
*John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland (3 February 1784 – 16 October 1859), who succeeded his father.
*Lady Sarah Sophia Fane (4 March 1785 – 26 January 1867) who married in 1804 George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey and became heiress to the Child fortune.
*Lady Augusta Fane (1786–1871), who married firstly in 1804 (divorced 1809) Lord Boringdon, later Earl of Morley (by whom she was the mother of Henry Villiers Parker), and in 1809 Arthur Paget (1771–1840), a younger brother of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey.
*Lady Maria Fane (1787–1834) who in 1805 married Viscount Duncannon, later 4th Earl of Bessborough; their sixth son Spencer Ponsonby-Fane inherited Brympton d&#x27;Evercy from his half-aunt Lady Georgiana.
*Lady Charlotte Fane (1793–1822), died unmarried.

The Countess of Westmorland died relatively young in 1793, aged 29, from undisclosed causes. Lord Westmorland married secondly Jane, daughter of Richard Huck-Saunders, in 1800. After some years of marriage, they later separated and she lived at Brympton d&#x27;Evercy. By his second wife, he had three sons and two daughters, of whom only the eldest child Lady Georgiana Fane outlived both parents and inherited the Brympton estate.

*Lady Cecily Jane Georgiana Fane (25 January 1801 – 1875), died unmarried, leaving Brympton d&#x27;Evercy to her nephew Spencer Ponsonby-Fane
*Hon. Charles Saunders John Fane (1802–1810)
*Hon. Col. Henry Sutton Fane (1804–1857), died unmarried.
*Hon. Montagu Augustus Villiers Fane (1805–1857), died unmarried.
*Lady Evelina Fane (1807–1808)

Lord Westmorland died in December 1841, aged 82, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only son from his first marriage, John. The Countess of Westmorland died in March 1857.

<text>The Portrait of a Lady is a novel by Henry James, first published as a serial in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1880–81 and then as a book in 1881. It is one of James&#x27;s most popular novels and is regarded by critics as one of his finest.

&quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; is the story of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who, &quot;affronting her destiny,&quot; finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of scheming by two American expatriates. Like many of James&#x27;s novels, it is set in Europe, mostly England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of James&#x27;s early period, this novel reflects James&#x27;s continuing interest in the differences between the New World and the Old, often to the detriment of the former. It also treats in a profound way the themes of personal freedom, responsibility, and betrayal.

==Plot summary==
23-year-old Isabel Archer, from Albany, New York, is invited by her maternal aunt, Lydia Touchett, to visit Lydia&#x27;s rich husband, Daniel, at his estate near London, following the death of Isabel&#x27;s father. There, Isabel meets her uncle, her friendly invalid cousin Ralph Touchett, and the Touchetts&#x27; robust neighbor, Lord Warburton.

Isabel later declines Warburton&#x27;s sudden proposal of marriage. She also rejects the hand of Caspar Goodwood, the charismatic son and heir of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Although Isabel is drawn to Caspar, her commitment to her independence precludes such a marriage, which she feels would demand the sacrifice of her freedom.

The elder Touchett grows ill and, at the request of his son, Ralph, leaves much of his estate to Isabel upon his death. With her large legacy, Isabel travels the Continent and meets an American expatriate, Gilbert Osmond, in Florence. Although Isabel had previously rejected both Warburton and Goodwood, she accepts Osmond&#x27;s proposal of marriage, unaware that it has been actively promoted by the accomplished but untrustworthy Madame Merle, another American expatriate, whom Isabel had met at the Touchetts&#x27; estate.

Isabel and Osmond settle in Rome, but their marriage rapidly sours, owing to Osmond&#x27;s overwhelming egotism and lack of genuine affection for his wife. Isabel grows fond of Pansy, Osmond&#x27;s presumed daughter by his first marriage, and wants to support her wish to marry Edward Rosier, a young art collector.

The snobbish Osmond would prefer that Pansy accept the proposal of Warburton, who had previously proposed to Isabel. Isabel suspects, however, that Warburton may just be feigning interest in Pansy to get close to Isabel again, and the conflict creates even more strain within the unhappy marriage after Osmond demands that Isabel should leverage her supposed influence over Warburton to bring about his marriage to Pansy. 

Isabel then learns that Ralph is dying at his estate in England and prepares to go to him for his final hours, but Osmond selfishly opposes this plan, threatening revenge if she proceeds against his disapproval. After this dispute, Isabel learns from her sister-in-law that Pansy is actually the daughter of Madame Merle, who had had an adulterous relationship with Osmond for several years.

Isabel pays a final visit to Pansy, who was sent to a convent by Osmond as an implicit demonstration of his authority vis-à-vis his wife, and their meeting terminates with Pansy begging her to return some day, which Isabel reluctantly promises to do. A meeting with Madame Merle, who too had been visiting Pansy at the same hour, confirms Isabel&#x27;s suspicions of her relations to Osmond and Pansy. She then leaves, without telling her spiteful husband, to comfort the dying Ralph in England, where she remains until his death. While previously she had concealed the unhappiness of her marriage with Osmond to Ralph, Isabel discloses it to him on his deathbed. Ralph grieves that in delivering his father&#x27;s fortune to his cousin, he has ruined her, but urges that she may still, as she is yet young, regain the freedom that she had relinquished in marrying.

Goodwood encounters her at Ralph&#x27;s estate and begs her to leave Osmond and come away with him. He passionately embraces and kisses her, but Isabel flees. Goodwood seeks her out the next day but is told she has set off again for Rome.

The ending is ambiguous, and the reader is left to imagine whether Isabel will return to Osmond to endure her marriage in noble forbearance (perhaps for Pansy&#x27;s sake), or instead rescue Pansy and leave Osmond.

==Major themes==
James&#x27;s first idea for &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; was simple: a young American woman &quot;affronting her destiny,&quot; whatever it might be. Only then did he begin to form a plot to bring out the character of his central figure. This was the uncompromising story of the free-spirited Isabel losing her freedom—despite (or because of) suddenly coming into a great deal of money—and getting &quot;ground in the very mill of the conventional.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; has received critical acclaim since its first publication in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and it remains the most popular of James&#x27;s longer fictions. Contemporary critics recognise that James had pushed the analysis of human consciousness and motivation to new levels, particularly in such passages as Chapter 42, where Isabel meditates deep into the night about her marriage and the trap she seems to have fallen into. James gave an in-depth account of Isabel&#x27;s deepest terrors in his preface to the novel&#x27;s 1908 &quot;New York Edition&quot;.

More recent criticism has been levelled by feminists. In particular, Isabel&#x27;s final return to Osmond has fascinated critics, who have debated whether James sufficiently justifies this seemingly paradoxical rejection of freedom. One interpretation is that Isabel feels as honour-bound to the promise she has made to stepdaughter Pansy as she does to her marriage, and that she believes the scene her &quot;unacceptable&quot; trip to England will create with Osmond will leave her in a more justifiable position to abandon her marriage.

The extensive revisions James made for the 1908 &quot;New York Edition&quot; generally have been accepted as improvements, unlike the changes he made to other texts, such as &quot;The American&quot; or &quot;Roderick Hudson&quot;. The revision of the final scene between Isabel and Goodwood has been especially applauded. Edward Wagenknecht wrote that James &quot;makes it as clear as any modern novelist could make it by using all the four-letter words in the dictionary that [Isabel] has been roused as never before in her life, roused in the true sense perhaps for the first time in her life.&quot; James&#x27;s verbal magic allowed him to both obey and evade the restrictive conventions of his day for the treatment of sexuality in literature.

Critic Alfred Habegger has written that the main character of &quot;Portrait&quot; was inspired by Christie Archer, the protagonist of Anne Moncure Crane&#x27;s novel &quot;Reginald Archer&quot; (1871). Crane may have influenced James, who Habegger believes was interested in Crane&#x27;s female characters.

In the preface to the 1908 &quot;New York Edition&quot;, James referred to several of George Eliot&#x27;s female protagonists as possible influences. Habegger questions this and quotes others doing the same.

In another critical article, &quot;Rewriting Misogyny: &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; and the Popular Fiction Debate&quot;, Paul M. Hadella mentions the similarities to Crane.

==Adaptations for stage and screen==
In 1884, when the actor Lawrence Barrett wanted James to turn the novel into a play, James replied that he did not think it could be done. In his opinion, given in the preface to the New York Edition, the best scene in the book consists of Isabel sitting motionless in a chair.

The story was adapted as a Broadway play by William Archibald, which opened in December 1954, with Barbara O&#x27;Neil in the role of Madame Serena Merle.

In 1968 the BBC produced a television miniseries of &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, starring Suzanne Neve as Isabel and Richard Chamberlain as Ralph Touchett. 

&quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; was adapted in 1996 by New Zealand director Jane Campion, into a film starring Nicole Kidman as Isabel, John Malkovich as Osmond, and Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle.

It was also adapted into the Urdu language in 1976 by a Pakistani television drama &quot;Parchaiyan&quot;. It was translated into Urdu by Haseena Moin and the central characters were played by Rahat Kazmi, Sahira Kazmi, Talat Hussain and Shakeel.

<doc id="603557" wikidata="Q830556" url="?curid=603557" title="The Beast (1988 film)">
<text>The Beast (also known as The Beast of War) is a 1988 American war film directed by Kevin Reynolds and written by William Mastrosimone, based on his play &quot;Nənawā́te&quot;. The film starred Jason Patric, George Dzundza, Steven Bauer, Stephen Baldwin, Don Harvey and Erick Avari. The film follows the crew of a Soviet T-55 tank who became lost during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The film has enjoyed a cult-favorite status in spite of its low box office statistics.

==Plot==

In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. A couple of remaining mujahideen attack the tanks with Molotovs, and Daskal(George Dzundza) a ruthless tank commander executes a surviving member by running him over. Following the assault, Daskl&#x27;s tank takes a wrong turn through a mountain pass and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, and his father and brother killed—the latter by having been crushed under Daskal&#x27;s tank. As the new khan following his brother&#x27;s death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge and leads a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue Daskal&#x27;s tank (which they call &#x27;The Beast&#x27;), counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it.

Lost, isolated, and with their radio damaged in the village attack, the tank crew set out to find Kandahar Road and return to Soviet lines. While camping for the night, Afghan communist crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the reluctant tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the Pashtun people&#x27;s code of honour, &quot;Pashtunwali&quot;; particularly &quot;nanawatai&quot;, which requires that an enemy is to be given sanctuary if he asks.

En route, the crew suffer several setbacks and ambushes from Taj&#x27;s band. Suspecting Samad to be a traitor, Daskal murders him in front of his men; Koverchenko threatens to report Daskal for the illegal killing. At a brief stop, Koverchenko reports that their tank is breaking down; Daskal accuses him of mutiny and orders gunner Kaminski (Don Harvey) and loader Golikov (Stephen Baldwin) to tie him to a rock, and leave him with a grenade behind his head as a booby-trap for the mujahideen. Wild dogs eventually attack Koverchenko, but he is saved when the grenade rolls off the rock and explodes, scaring them off. Taj&#x27;s band reunite with several vengeful women from the village and find Koverchenko, who pleads for &quot;nanawatai.&quot; The mujahideen give him food and shelter. Koverchenko befriends Taj after fixing the band&#x27;s broken RPG-7, and agrees to help him destroy the tank.

Meanwhile, the remaining tank crew finally realize they are trapped in the valley, until a Soviet helicopter appears and offers to rescue them. Daskal refuses the offer, after getting told the tank would be disposed of if they left it. Daskal has the tank refueled, and the crew heads back towards the narrow mountain pass where they entered, which the helicopter pilot says is the only way out. The crew drives through the night and find the helicopter crew dead, who had drunk from a waterhole the tank crew poisoned earlier with cyanide. The mujahideen and Koverchenko charge at the tank which now has a dead battery. The tank&#x27;s .50 cal gun runs out of ammo and they finally get it running at the last second.

Koverchenko and Taj follow the leaking fuel trail from the tank leading to a chase in the pass. The tank runs out of rounds, and Koverchenko finally fires the RPG only to damage the tank&#x27;s main gun. Just as it seems the tank will escape, the village women (armed with grenades) blow up the cliff-side, dropping boulders onto the tank and disabling it. After the tank bleeds through the rest of the coaxial gun&#x27;s ammunition Koverchenko sets fire to the tank&#x27;s leaked fuel. Dascal wanting to die for the motherland gives the crew grenades to die as heroes. Golikov, and Kaminski retaliate leading to a brief struggle. The crew bail the tank, and an angered Taj rounds the crew up. Koverchenko pleads &quot;nanawatai&quot; on their behalf, and Taj reluctantly agrees. Koverchenko confronts Daskal over his brutality, and desires that he live to see the Soviets lose the war. 

Kaminski and Golikov flee on foot, but the women who realized they were being spared kill Daskal; they bring back his bloodied uniform to Taj as trophies. Horrified, Koverchenko waves down an arriving Soviet helicopter to be rescued. Koverchenko salutes Taj as he is hoisted by a harness, brandishing a jezail musket Taj had just gifted to him. The film ends with Koverchenko flying off with the helicopter over the Afghan landscape.

==Production==
===Filming===
The film was shot in Israel. Several actual T-55 tanks were used in the film; however, the helicopter used in the film was not a real Mi-8, but an Aerospatiale SA.321 Super Frelon. The tank in question in the movie is actually an Israeli modification of a Soviet T-55 captured by the Israelis from their Arab armies, redesignated as the Ti-67 and fitted with a 105mm main gun in place of the original 100mm gun, leading some to mistake it for a T-62. The Ti-67 tank in particular is more distinctly known as the Tiran 5Sh. Many of these conversions were used by the Israelis during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The film&#x27;s military advisor, Dale Dye, has written that he negotiated the purchase of the tanks over drinks with Israel Defense Forces officers in a Tel Aviv hotel. The language spoken by the Afghan characters is Pashto. The Pashto dialogue is subtitled but some television screenings have omitted the subtitles.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The original soundtrack music was released by CBS/Columbia Records shortly after the movie&#x27;s debut, written and performed entirely by Mark Isham. The back of the album suggests two tracks (&quot;Badal&quot; and &quot;Nanawatai&quot;), but there are, in fact, ten. Offered in 12-inch LP vinyl, CrO2 cassette and DDD-format compact discs. Used CD copies command rather high prices since limited numbers were released in spite of composer Mark Isham&#x27;s celebrity status.

In addition to the soundtrack, the song &quot;Троллейбус&quot; (&quot;Trolleybus&quot;) by the Russian rock band Kino is heard playing on the radio during a scene. However, &quot;Троллейбус&quot; was not released until 1983, two years after the events portrayed in the movie. The song was titled &quot;Streetcar Headed East&quot; in English-speaking countries.

<doc id="603558" wikidata="Q1261947" url="?curid=603558" title="White-naped woodpecker">
<text>The white-naped woodpecker (Chrysocolaptes festivus) is woodpecker which is a widespread but a scarce breeder in the Indian Subcontinent. 
It is associated with open forest and scrub with some trees. It nests in a tree hole, laying one or two white eggs.

==Taxonomy==
The white-naped woodpecker was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Goa, on the southwest coast of India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Picus festivus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The white-naped woodpecker is now placed in the genus &quot;Chrysocolaptes&quot; that was introduced by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1843. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;khrusos&quot; meaning &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;kolaptēs&quot; meaning &quot;chiseller&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;festivus&quot; is Latin for &quot;festive&quot; or &quot;cheerful&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. f. festivus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – central and south India
* &quot;C. f. tantus&quot; Ripley, 1946 – Sri Lanka

==Description==
The white-naped woodpecker is a large species at in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape. The white hind neck extends down the back, and the black shoulder patches also continue onto the back to form a V-shape bordering the white. The rest of the upperparts and wings are golden yellow. The rump and tail are black, and the underparts are white with dark chevron markings. The head is whitish with a dark moustache stripe and a black eye patch that extends down the neck sides. The adult male white-naped woodpecker has a red crown and females have a yellow crown. Young birds are colored like the female, but duller.

Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or &quot;yoked&quot; feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can dart forward to capture insects.

<text>The Androids are an Australian rock band. Fronted by guitarist Tim Henwood (originally from The Superjesus) with members Sam Grayson, Matt Tomlinson and Marty Grech. While their 2002 single, &quot;Do It with Madonna&quot;, was commercially their most successful release - peaking at #4 in the Australia ARIA Singles Chart and #15 in the UK Singles Chart; their second and third singles, &quot;Here She Comes&quot; and &quot;Brand New Life&quot; could not replicate &quot;Do It with Madonna&quot;&#x27;s success. Their self-titled album debuted and peaked at #36 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

Though not a huge success internationally, they are remembered for the music video for &quot;Do It with Madonna&quot;, which featured drag queens dressed as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Pink, Kylie Minogue and Madonna, the song&#x27;s namesake.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2003, The Androids won ARIA Award for Best Video for &quot;Do It with Madonna&quot;.

<doc id="603565" wikidata="Q18029644" url="?curid=603565" title="Otto">
<text>Otto is a masculine German given name and a surname. It originates as an Old High German short form (variants &quot;Audo&quot;, &quot;Odo&quot;, &quot;Udo&quot;) of Germanic names beginning in &quot;aud-&quot;, an element meaning &quot;wealth, prosperity&quot;.

The name is recorded from the 7th century (Odo, son of Uro, courtier of Sigebert III). It was the name of three 10th-century German kings, the first of whom was Otto I the Great, the first Holy Roman Emperor, founder of the Ottonian dynasty.

The Gothic form of the prefix was &quot;auda-&quot; (as in e.g. &quot;Audaþius&quot;), the Anglo-Saxon form was &quot;ead-&quot; (as in e.g. &quot;Eadmund&quot;), and the Old Norse form was &quot;auð-&quot;.

Due to Otto von Bismarck, the given name &quot;Otto&quot; was strongly associated with the German Empire in the later 19th century. It was comparatively frequently given in the United States (presumably in German American families) during the 1880s to 1890s, remaining in the top 100 most popular masculine given names in the US throughout 1880–1898, but its popularity decreased significantly after 1900 with increasing anti-German sentiment leading up to World War I; it fell below rank 200 in 1919, below rank 500 in 1947, and below rank 1000 in 1975. It re-entered the top-1000 most popular given names in the US in the 2010s, ranking 696th as of 2013.

The given name Otis arose from an English surname, which was in turn derived from &quot;Ode&quot;, a variant form of &quot;Odo, Otto&quot;.

<text>Joseph Paul Torre Jr. (; born July 18, 1940) is an American professional baseball executive and former player, manager, and television color commentator. He has served as a special assistant to the Commissioner of Baseball since 2020. He previously served in the capacity of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) chief baseball officer from 2011 to 2020. Torre ranks fifth all-time in MLB history with 2,326 wins as a manager. With 2,342 hits during his playing career, Torre is the only major leaguer to achieve both 2,000 hits as a player and 2,000 wins as a manager. From 1996 to 2007, he was the manager of the New York Yankees, and guided the team to six American League (AL) pennants and four World Series championships.

Torre&#x27;s professional baseball career began as a player in 1960 with the Milwaukee Braves, as a catcher and first baseman. He also played for the St. Louis Cardinals (for whom he played primarily third base) and the New York Mets, until becoming a manager in 1977, when he briefly served as the Mets&#x27; player-manager before retiring as a player. His managerial career covered 29 seasons, including tenures with the same three clubs for which he had played, and also stints with the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers, until 2010. From 1984 to 1989, he served as a television color commentator for the California Angels and for NBC. After retiring as a manager, he accepted a role assisting the Commissioner as the executive vice president of baseball operations.

A nine-time All-Star, Torre won the 1971 National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award after leading the major leagues in batting average, hits, and runs batted in. After qualifying for the playoffs just once while managing the Mets, Braves, and Cardinals (leading the Braves to the 1982 NL West title, before losing in the NLCS), Torre&#x27;s greatest success came as manager of the Yankees. His Yankee clubs compiled a .605 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs every year, winning four World Series titles, six AL pennants, and ten AL East division titles. In 1996 and 1998, he was the AL Manager of the Year. He also won two NL West division titles with the Dodgers, for a total of 13 division titles. In 2014, Torre was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Joseph Paul Torre Jr. was born July 18, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York City, New York to Italian immigrants Margaret and Joseph Sr., a plainclothes officer in the New York City Police Department. He was the youngest of five children, with two brothers, Frank (who also went on to play in the Major Leagues) and Rocco, and two sisters, Rae and Marguerite. Torre was raised in the Marine Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. Torre&#x27;s father Joseph abused Margaret until Torre was 13 years old, when Torre&#x27;s brother Frank convinced their father to move out. The couple would later divorce.

Torre played baseball at Saint Francis Prep and in the All-American Amateur Baseball Association for the Brooklyn Cadets. Heavyset as a teenager, Torre was not considered a viable professional prospect until he converted to catcher on the advice of his brother Frank. Torre worked briefly at the American Stock Exchange after high school.

==Professional playing career==
===Minor leagues===
Torre followed in his brother Frank&#x27;s footsteps when he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur free agent in 1959. In his first season in the minor leagues with the Class A Eau Claire Bears, he won the Northern League batting championship with a .344 batting average.

===Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1960–1968)===
Torre made his major league debut late in the season on September 25, 1960. For the season he was assigned to the Triple A Louisville Colonels, where the Braves planned to groom him as the eventual successor to their All-Star catcher, Del Crandall. However, those plans were changed when Crandall injured his throwing arm in May 1961, forcing the Braves to promote Torre to the major leagues with just over a year of minor league experience. Torre rose to the occasion, hitting for a .278 batting average with 21 doubles and 10 home runs. He finished the season ranked second to Billy Williams in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.

Crandall resumed his role as the starting catcher in 1962 while Torre stayed on as the back-up catcher. By the 1963 season, the Braves had begun to play Crandall at first base as Torre had taken over the starting catcher&#x27;s role. He ended the season with a .293 batting average with 14 home runs and 71 runs batted in, and earned a spot as a reserve for the National League team in the 1963 All-Star Game. In December , the Braves traded Crandall to the San Francisco Giants, leaving Torre as the undisputed number one catcher.

Torre had a breakout year in 1964 when he batted .321 (fourth highest in the National League) with 20 home runs and 109 runs batted in, and he led National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. He was selected as the starting catcher for the National League in the 1964 All-Star Game. Despite the fact that the Braves finished the season in fifth place, Torre ranked fifth in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.

In 1965, Torre won his first of two NL Player of the Month awards when he took the honor for May, batting .382, with 10 HR and 24 RBIs. Torre was once again the starting catcher for the National League in the 1965 All-Star Game, and he hit a two-run home run against Milt Pappas to help the National League to a 6–5 victory. He ended the season with a career-high 27 home runs and 80 runs batted in, though his batting average dipped to .291. Torre won his first and only Gold Glove Award in 1965; however, baseball historian Bill James later said the decision was influenced by his offensive statistics and that either John Roseboro or Tom Haller were more deserving of the award. In an article for the &quot;St. Petersburg Independent&quot; that year, Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac called Torre &quot;the best catcher since Roy Campanella.&quot;

For the 1966 season the Braves relocated to Atlanta and the new Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium which, due to its less dense atmosphere in the high elevation in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, made it favorable to home run hitters. This resulted in the stadium being nicknamed &quot;The Launching Pad&quot;. On April 12, 1966, Torre hit the first major league home run in the history of the Atlanta stadium. Torre produced a career-high 36 home runs with 101 runs batted in, a .315 batting average, a .382 on-base percentage, and led National League catchers with a 48.6% caught stealing percentage. He started behind the plate for the National League All-Star team for the third successive year. His offensive production tapered off in 1967, during which he compiled a .277 batting average with 68 runs batted in, though he still hit 20 home runs and won his fourth consecutive start in the 1967 All-Star Game. He posted another sub-par season in 1968 with a .271 batting average, 10 home runs, and 55 runs batted in; yet he led National League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage.

Before the 1969 season, Torre became embroiled in a feud with Braves General Manager Paul Richards over his salary. Eventually the Braves traded Torre to the St. Louis Cardinals for the Most Valuable Player Award winner, Orlando Cepeda.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1969–1974)===
The Cardinals had Tim McCarver as their starting catcher, so Torre replaced the departed Cepeda at first base for the 1969 season. His offensive statistics rebounded, and he ended the season with a .289 batting average, alongside 18 home runs and 101 runs batted in. In 1970, the Cardinals traded McCarver to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Curt Flood, Byron Browne, and Joe Hoerner, in return for Dick Allen, Jerry Johnson, and Cookie Rojas. Allen took over as the Cardinals&#x27; first baseman while Torre split his playing time between playing third base and sharing catching duties with young prospect Ted Simmons. His offensive statistics continued to improve, as he hit 21 home runs with 100 runs batted in and finished second to Rico Carty for the National League batting title with a .325 batting average.

The Cardinals made Simmons their full-time catcher in 1971, leaving Torre to concentrate on playing third base. Freed from the mentally challenging, strength-sapping job of catching, Torre had a career-season offensively. Torre won the National League batting championship, hitting career highs in batting average, .363, hits, 230, and an NL leading 137 RBIs along with 24 home runs, en route to winning the National League Most Valuable Player award. He also was voted to be the starting third baseman for the National League in the 1971 All-Star Game. He was named NL Player of the Month for the second and final time in August (.373, 5 HR, 27 RBI). Adapting to a new defensive position proved to be a challenge, as Torre led the league&#x27;s third basemen with 21 errors. In December, he was awarded the 1971 Hutch Award, given annually to the player who best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive desire of Fred Hutchinson.

In 1972, Torre won his second consecutive starting role as third baseman for the National League in the All-Star Game. However, his offensive numbers for the season dipped to a .289 batting average with 11 home runs and 81 runs batted in. After two more sub-par seasons, the Cardinals traded the 34-year-old Torre to the New York Mets for Ray Sadecki and Tommy Moore on October 13, 1974.

===New York Mets (1975–1977)===
With the Mets in , Torre became the third player in Major League history, and first in the National League, to hit into four double plays in one game. Felix Millán singled in all four of his at-bats hitting ahead of Torre, and at a post-game press conference, Torre joked about his own performance by saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank Felix Millán for making this possible.&quot; When Torre&#x27;s batting average fell to .247 in 1975, it appeared that his best years might be behind him. However, his average rebounded 59 points in 1976, and he finished the year with a .306 batting average. In May 1977, the Mets fired manager Joe Frazier and named Torre as their player-manager. Torre was the second of three player-managers in the 1970s, the other two being Frank Robinson in and with the Cleveland Indians, and Don Kessinger in with the Chicago White Sox. Because Torre believed he could not do the job of manager properly while still playing, he decided to retire at age 37. He served 18 days as a player-manager, having two at-bats. His final at-bat came on June 17, 1977, at Shea Stadium against the Houston Astros, when he put himself in as a pinch hitter. He flied out to right field, thereby ending his playing career.

==Managerial career==
===New York Mets (1977–1981)===
Torre managed the Mets from 1977 to 1981 season, but failed to improve the team&#x27;s record. He went 49–68 in his first season with the Mets, while the team finished 64–98 overall and in last place in the NL East. The next three seasons were similar, as the Mets went 66–96, 63–99, and 67–95, though avoiding last place in 1980. The strike-shortened season of 1981 was Torre&#x27;s last with the team, and he went 17–34 in the first half of the season and 24–28 in the second half, finishing fifth and fourth, respectively. After five years without a winning season, Torre was fired at the end of the strike-shortened season.

===Atlanta Braves (1982–1984)===

In 1982, Torre replaced Bobby Cox as the manager of the Atlanta Braves, and immediately guided the team to a Major League record 13 straight wins to open the season, a mark that was later tied by the 1987 Milwaukee Brewers and the 2023 Tampa Bay Rays. Atlanta subsequently went on to finish 89–73 and capture the National League West division title, its first playoff appearance since the 1969 National League Championship Series (NLCS). In Game 1 of the 1982 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, the Braves jumped out to a 1–0 lead before the game was delayed by rain after four innings. The rain persisted, and the game was wiped out just three outs short of an official game. St. Louis won the restaged Game 1, and went on to sweep the series. Torre was named the Associated Press (AP) Manager of the Year, becoming the first person to win both that and an MVP award.

The Braves slipped to second place in 1983, with an 88–74 record that was just one game off of the division-winning record of the previous season. This marked the first consecutive winning seasons for the team since moving from Milwaukee in 1966. In 1984, Atlanta slipped to 80–82, but again finished second in the division (tied with Houston Astros). Torre was fired after the 1984 season.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1990–1995)===

In 1990, Torre replaced the popular Whitey Herzog as Cardinals manager and posted a 351–354 record. Though the Cardinals were unable to reach the playoffs during Torre&#x27;s tenure, they had winning records in three of the four seasons he spent with the club. Despite a last-place prediction from many commentators, the Cardinals finished in second place and won 84 games in 1991, Torre&#x27;s first full season at the helm. His best record was 87–75 in 1993. Torre was fired in June 1995 for his poor record that year, and also as part of a rebuilding project while Anheuser-Busch prepared to sell the team.

===New York Yankees (1996–2007)===
After being hired on November 2 1995, Torre served as the Yankees&#x27; manager under owner George Steinbrenner. Torre lasted twelve full seasons, managing 1,942 regular-season games, with a won-loss record of 1,173–767. He took the team to the postseason in every one of his twelve seasons with the club, winning six American League pennants and four World Series. Torre had by far the longest tenure for a Yankees manager in the Steinbrenner era, and his time as manager is tied for the second-longest in club history with those of Miller Huggins and Casey Stengel, behind the sixteen-season run of Joe McCarthy. Torre is the only Yankees manager who was born in New York City.

====1996–2005====

Before his first game with the Yankees, Torre got off to a rough start. The New York City press (and fans) thought his hiring was a colossal mistake and greeted him with tabloid headlines such as &quot;Clueless Joe.&quot; Including his three previous jobs, he had been a combined 109 games below .500, and had never won a playoff game in 14 seasons. He had appeared in 2,209 games as a player and 1,901 as a manager for a total of 4,110 games without reaching a World Series, let alone winning it.

However, it was with the Yankees that he enjoyed the greatest success of his managerial career, leading the team to the playoffs in each of his twelve seasons (1996–2007) there. In , he was named Manager of the Year. Torre, building on the Yankees&#x27; Wild Card berth in 1995, made his first-ever trip to the World Series, leading the Yankees to their first Series since . After the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves, Steinbrenner tore up Torre&#x27;s contract and gave him a new, more lucrative, and longer contract as a reward.

On April 30, , Torre won his 1,000th game as manager, with a 2–1 victory over the Seattle Mariners. The Yankees went into the postseason for the third straight year, albeit as a Wild Card. They lost to the Cleveland Indians in the Division Series. After that, the team would win three straight World Series titles from to , and additional American League pennants in and .

The season was Torre&#x27;s most successful. Despite a slow start that included losing four of the first five games of the season, the Yankees set a then-American League record of 114 regular-season wins, including David Wells&#x27;s perfect game against the Minnesota Twins on May 17. It was in an August 11 victory over the Twins that Torre evened his career record win–loss record, making it 1168–1168. One other manager in Yankees&#x27; history, Stengel, had joined the team with a career record further below .500 than Torre, at 166 games; Stengel, too, reached .500 for his career during his time as Yankees manager.

During the 1998 playoffs, the Yankees easily bested the Texas Rangers, fought off the Cleveland Indians for the AL pennant, and swept the San Diego Padres in the World Series. His club set a major-league record of 125 total wins a season, including the regular season and the postseason, breaking the 1906 Chicago Cubs&#x27; record of 118. Torre won Manager of the Year honors, and the team is now widely regarded as one of the best teams of all time, along with the Yankee teams of 1927, and , the 1972–1974 Oakland Athletics, and the 1975–1976 Cincinnati Reds. 
When ESPN launched its &quot;Who&#x27;s#1?&quot; series on June 15, , the 1998 Yankees topped the network&#x27;s list of best teams over the years 1979 to 2003.

Torre presided over a second perfect game in 1999, this time behind starter David Cone, who defeated the Montreal Expos 6–0. This occurred on July 18, Torre&#x27;s 59th birthday. He thus became the first to manage his teams to two perfect game wins, while becoming just the fourth in MLB history to manage his club in two perfect games, joining Stengel (1–1), Walter Alston (1–1), and Tommy Lasorda (0–2). The Yankees also won their second consecutive World Series.

With a win over Minnesota on May 12, 2002, Torre became the 17th manager in Major League history to reach the milestone of 1,500 victories.

In , Torre suffered his greatest setback, marking the end of the Yankees&#x27; dominance. After building a 3–0 lead in the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, his team would go on to lose the next four games and the ALCS. This Red Sox victory was the first time that any team had come back from being down three games to none in a series, and such a comeback has not happened again since. The Red Sox would go on to win the 2004 World Series, their first title since , thereby ending the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, which had supposedly been inflicted on the team when Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees in early 1920.
After getting off to an 8−11 start in 2005, the Yankees played their last five months at 84−48. They won 14 of their last 18 on their way to employing a franchise record 51 players to overtake Boston and capture their eighth consecutive AL East title. Their season ended in a five-game ALDS loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

====2006–2007====
Despite pitching issues and injuries, the Yankees won another AL East title in 2006, but would go on to lose the ALDS to the Detroit Tigers in four games.

In 2007, Torre achieved his 2,000th win to become the first man to win 2,000 games as a Major League manager and also collect 2,000 hits as a Major League player. He later notched his 2,010th managerial win, overtaking Leo Durocher for ninth place on the MLB all-time managerial wins list. Next, he passed Stengel on the Yankees&#x27; all-time managerial wins list in 2007 with his 1,150th victory with the team. Torre led the Yankees to their 13th consecutive postseason appearance.
After two Yankees losses to the Cleveland Indians in the Division Series, Steinbrenner said in an interview that Torre&#x27;s contract would not be renewed if the Yankees did not defeat the Indians. The Yankees saved their season, and potentially Torre&#x27;s job, for one day, as they won Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. Following the Yankees&#x27; elimination the following night, earning them another first-round exit, Torre&#x27;s fate remained uncertain. That night, as he went out to make what would be his last pitching change with the team, the fans in Yankee Stadium chanted his name.

After the season, the Yankees met with Torre and offered him a one-year contract with a $5 million base pay and $1 million bonuses, to be paid for each of three benchmarks the team would reach: winning the American League Division Series; winning the American League Championship Series; and winning the World Series. Further, had the Yankees reached the World Series, that would have automatically triggered an option for a new contract the following year. In spite of a pay cut from an average of $6.4 million over the previous three seasons, the new terms would have kept him as the highest-paid manager in the game.

Yankee Global Enterprises chairman Hal Steinbrenner &quot;explained the rationale behind the offer, which was nonnegotiable.&quot; Yankees president Randy Levine commented, &quot;We thought we needed to go with a performance-based model. It&#x27;s important to motivate people based on performance.&quot; George Steinbrenner, on account of his advancing age and his deteriorating health, had noticeably less influence in the day-to-day operation of the club. Of the ultimatum he issued during the playoffs, his son Hal denied that his comments influenced the terms of the contract they presented to Torre.

The New York media portrayed the offer as an insult. Torre turned it down, ending his era with the Yankees. On October 19, 2007, he held a news conference to explain his decision. After first thanking George Steinbrenner, he remarked, &quot;I just felt the contract offer and the terms of the contract were probably the thing I had the toughest time with.&quot;

Of the aftermath, Wallace Matthews of &quot;Newsday&quot; commented, &quot;They are very slick, these thugs running the Yankees. ... They have been trying to figure out a way to whack Torre while making it appear as if Torre whacked himself. What they came up with was brilliant in its innovation and chilling in its cynicism, but ultimately transparent.&quot; Opined Mike Lupica, &quot;It was just the most famous disagreement we are ever likely to see in baseball, the most famous manager telling the people who run the most famous team to take their job and shove it. A manager finally fired the Yankees.&quot; Added Joel Sherman, &quot;Torre erred in turning down the Yankees&#x27; proposal to stay in the position that has made him rich and famous beyond what he could have dreamed a dozen years ago.&quot; He also walks &quot;away from that juice as much as the ownership.&quot;

On February 3, 2009, Torre released a book about his experiences with the Yankees, called &quot;The Yankee Years&quot;, co-authored by Tom Verducci.

Torre returned to Yankee Stadium for the first time since vacating the Yankees managerial job on September 20, 2010, to pay respect to George Steinbrenner on the night of the previous owner&#x27;s monument being unveiled in Monument Park.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2008–2010)===

On November 1, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced that Torre would be their manager beginning with the 2008 season, succeeding Grady Little, who had resigned the post two days before. This marked the return of Torre to the National League, the only league he had played or managed in prior to becoming the Yankees&#x27; skipper. According to ESPN, Torre&#x27;s contract was valued at $13 million over three years.
Torre brought two members of his 2007 Yankees coaching staff with him. Don Mattingly, who had served as Torre&#x27;s bench coach, was tabbed as the hitting coach; and third base coach Larry Bowa was brought in to fill the same position with the Dodgers. In January 2008, Mattingly was moved to the role of special assignment coach for the 2008 season due to family concerns. He was replaced as hitting coach by Mike Easler.

In addition, Torre brought in Bob Schaefer to be bench coach, and retained first base coach Mariano Duncan (whom he had managed with the Yankees) and pitching coach Rick Honeycutt from Little&#x27;s staff. Ken Howell was promoted from Triple-A pitching coach to bullpen coach, completing Torre&#x27;s staff. Torre had grown up in Brooklyn when the Dodgers played there, but he admitted to having been a New York Giants fan then, adding another twist to the longstanding rivalry between the two clubs.

On March 31, 2008, Joe Torre made his managerial debut with the Dodgers in a 5–0 victory. Ironically, he would be managing several former members of the 2003 Red Sox, such as Manny Ramirez, Derek Lowe, and Nomar Garciaparra. On September 25, 2008, the Dodgers clinched the National League West title, giving Torre his 13th consecutive postseason appearance. October 4, 2008 saw Torre managing the Dodgers to a 3–0 victory over the Chicago Cubs in the National League Division Series, earning the Dodgers their first post-season series victory since their championship season of 1988. Torre&#x27;s Dodgers were beaten in the NLCS four games to one by the eventual World Series-winning Phillies.

In 2009, Torre served as a coach on manager Charlie Manuel&#x27;s staff in the All-Star Game. The Dodgers achieved the National League&#x27;s best record (95–67), clinching the top seed. They faced the St. Louis Cardinals, in the National League Division Series, sweeping them in three games. However, they went on to lose to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS in five games, ending their second consecutive season with a loss to the Phillies, who would go on to lose to the Yankees in the World Series.

During the 2010 season, the Dodgers played against both the Yankees and the Red Sox. The Dodgers managed to only go 1–5 against the two teams. It was the first time Torre had faced either the Yankees or the Red Sox since leaving the Yankees.

On September 17, 2010, Torre announced he would step down as Dodgers manager after the 2010 season, with Mattingly being Torre&#x27;s replacement for 2011 campaign.

On October 3, 2010, the Dodgers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 3–1 at Dodger Stadium for Torre&#x27;s 2,326th and final career win. Torre stepped down as manager at the conclusion of the game.

==Broadcasting career==
From to , Torre worked as a television color commentator for the California Angels. Torre also worked as a color commentator for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Game of the Week&quot; telecasts alongside Jay Randolph. While working as a guest analyst for ESPN during the 1989 World Series, Torre was on hand for the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 17, ).

==Commissioner&#x27;s office (2011–present)==
With a desire to stay active after his managing career, and in spite of his advancing age, Torre accepted a position assisting Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig as the new Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations on February 26, 2011. His stated duties according to the MLB.com biography include serving as the primary liaison for all baseball and on-field activities between the office of the commissioner and the general managers and field managers of all 30 Major League clubs. Other duties include overseeing areas of major league operations, on-field operations, discipline, and umpiring. In December 2014, as part of an executive reorganization, MLB announced Torre&#x27;s title was modified to Chief Baseball Officer, though his duties remained unchanged.

Torre drew criticism when, during the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, MLB denied the New York Mets the right to wear tribute caps to first responders, as they had done in the month following the attacks.

Torre briefly resigned from his position with Major League Baseball in January 2012 amid speculation that he was interested in joining one of the groups seeking to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following March, he returned to his position with MLB after his group failed to buy the Dodgers.

Torre was the manager of the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. On September 22, 2013, he attended a Yankees pregame tribute to Mariano Rivera at Yankee Stadium.

In August 2015, Torre opened dialogue amid concerns about umpiring, the strike zone, and instant replay, by meeting with players and staff of all 30 Major League teams, after Red Sox manager John Farrell had noted an increasing trend of pitches below the strike zone being called strikes. Commented Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, &quot;It&#x27;s good leadership that he&#x27;s willing to initiate conversation, ... giving guys a chance [to express any issues they might have], it&#x27;s impressive. He wasn&#x27;t ... making excuses for anybody. He said, &#x27;Help me understand how we can help improve.&#x27;&quot;

In December 2015, Torre led an expedition to Cuba of MLB officials and players. It was the first of its kind since 1999, and it was intended as a step to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun to ease earlier in the year.

In February 2020, Torre was replaced as head of on-field operations by former pitcher Chris Young and was reassigned as special assistant to the Commissioner. Despite retaining a post in the commissioners result, Torre no longer determined fines and suspensions for on-field incidents.

==Achievements, highlights, honors, and awards==

Torre appeared in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game 15 total times as a player or as a manager, with his teams going 13–1–1. During his playing career, he was always on the National League squad, going 8–1. Each time he was manager, it was for the American League, with those teams going 5–0–1.

In 2011, Torre made his first appearance at the New York Yankees&#x27; Old Timers&#x27; Day. He also appeared in 2012, 2014, and 2015.

The Yankees retired Torre&#x27;s uniform number 6 on &quot;Joe Torre Day&quot;, August 23, 2014, and honored him with a plaque in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium.

On August 27, 2016, the Cardinals inducted Torre into the franchise Hall of Fame.

On July 30, 2022, the Atlanta Braves inducted Torre into the franchise Hall of Fame.

On August 27, 2022, Torre participated in the Mets&#x27; Old-Timers&#x27; Day (the team&#x27;s first since 1994) by managing one of the squads.

===Legacy===
In an 18-year major league career, Torre played in 2,209 games, accumulating 2,342 hits in 7,874 at bats for a .297 career batting average along with 252 home runs, 1,185 runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .365. He retired with a .990 fielding percentage in 903 games as a catcher, a .993 fielding percentage in 787 games as a first baseman, and a .951 fielding percentage in 515 games as a third baseman.

During his individual seasons, Torre batted over .300 five times, drove in more than 100 runs five times, and hit 20 or more home runs six times. A nine-time All-Star, he won a Most Valuable Player Award a batting title, and an RBI crown. He finished in the National League&#x27;s top ten four times each in batting average, on-base percentage, on-base plus slugging percentage, adjusted OPS+, hits, total bases, RBIs, and slugging percentage. Also a Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner at catcher, Torre led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage, and was in the top five in caught stealing percentage. In ten different seasons combined at catcher, first base, and third base, he finished in the top five in fielding percentage. Baseball historian Bill James ranked Torre 11th all-time among major league catchers.

===Managerial record===
Torre established a Major League record by guiding his clubs to 14 consecutive World Series wins from Game Three of the 1996 World Series through Game Two of the 2000 championship. He became the second manager to guide his club to 12 consecutive postseason appearances, with Bobby Cox having led the Braves to 14 straight postseason appearances from 1991 through 2005. (There was no postseason in .)

He also was a part-owner of Sis City, winner of the 2005 Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. Sis City was the dominant three-year-old filly that year until finishing fourth in the May 6 Kentucky Oaks. However, a few weeks later on June 26, Wild Desert, in which Torre is also a partner, won the $1.0 million Queen&#x27;s Plate, the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Wild Desert is also partially owned by Keith Jones, an NHL player. A horse named Torre and Zim, was named after Torre and his former bench coach Don Zimmer, as both love horse racing. Homeboykris, who had upset the field by a half-length and won the opening card of the Preakness Stakes on May 21, 2016, collapsed and died on his way back to the stall immediately after the race.

==Books==
In 1997, Torre&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Chasing the Dream&quot;, was released. Later, he authored an advice book, entitled &quot;Joe Torre&#x27;s Ground Rules for Winners&quot;. His third book, &quot;The Yankee Years&quot;, was released in February 2009. The book, co-authored by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Tom Verducci, details Torre&#x27;s tenure as manager of the New York Yankees.

==Joe Torre Foundation==
In 2002, Torre and his wife Ali established the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to establish the Foundation&#x27;s Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New Jersey&#x27;s José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. The Foundation&#x27;s mission is to educate about and to prevent domestic violence. Margaret&#x27;s Place is named after Torre&#x27;s mother, who was a victim of verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Torre&#x27;s New York City Police officer father when Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a &quot;bully&quot;, and, while Torre himself was not a target of his father&#x27;s violence, he has stated that he never felt safe at home, and that he grew up in fear for his mother, saying, &quot;I always felt responsible for it. I never thought I belonged anywhere. I never felt safe except on the ball field.&quot; Margaret&#x27;s Place is a comprehensive program that provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention in order to address their home situation and to educate them to understand the impact of domestic violence on the community. The children are also given the opportunity to read, play games, or talk about their experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp., also includes an anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and counselors. It has grown to eleven sites in the region, though Union City&#x27;s is the only such program in New Jersey.

Torre is also a supporter of other anti-domestic violence programs. In September 2008, he recorded a public service announcement and personal voice message in support of the RESPECT! Campaign against domestic violence.

==Personal life==
He has one son, Michael, by his first wife, Jackie, whom he married in 1963. He has two daughters, Lauren and Cristina, by his second wife, Dani, whom he married in 1968. Both of these marriages ended in divorce. On August 23, 1987, he married Alice (Ali) Wolterman, his third wife. They have a daughter, Andrea.

His older brother Frank was also a Major League Baseball player. Frank died in 2014. His eldest brother Rocco was a New York Police Department officer who died in 1996. His older sister Marguerite was a Roman Catholic nun and teacher, was the principal of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary School in Ozone Park, Queens until her death on May 29, 2022. His other sister Rae died in 2015.

Torre was treated for prostate cancer in 1999.

On December 14, 2005, Torre carried the Olympic Flame in Florence, Italy, as part of the torch relay of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, running it 405 meters, and ending up at the Ponte Vecchio.

, Torre and his wife live in Harrison, New York. Until February 2020, they also had a house in Mahopac.

<doc id="603567" wikidata="Q3013428" url="?curid=603567" title="Percival's sister">
<text>Percival&#x27;s sister is a role of two similar but distinct characters in the Holy Grail stories within the Arthurian legend featuring the Grail hero Percival (Perceval). The first of them is named Dindrane, the second is usually unnamed and is known today as the Grail heroine.

==Dindrane==
Dindrane (or &quot;Dandrane&quot;, &quot;Danbrann&quot;, &quot;Dandrenor&quot;, &quot;Dindraine&quot;, etc.) is a character in the Old French romance &quot;Perlesvaus, or The High Book of the Holy Grail&quot;, an anonymous prose altered adaptation of (and a sequel to) Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; unfinished poem &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;. A sister of King Arthur&#x27;s knight Percival, who rescues her from an evil bride kidnapper, Dindrane lives out her days as a maiden in the Grail Castle, together with her brother (Percival) and mother. The latter is Yglais, herself a sister of King Pelles and widow of Alain &quot;the Large&quot;, lord of the valley and castle of Kamaalot (Camelot).

The pre-cyclic version of the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; names her Heliabel, describing her as even more beautiful than Guinevere. Heliabel later evolved into the character of Galahad&#x27;s mother.

==Grail heroine==
Contrary to popular notion, Dindrane in the 13th-century &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; is not the sister of Percival who dies helping him (with Galahad and Bors) achieve the Holy Grail. This distinct latter character appears, unnamed, in the Vulgate &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; (Quest for the Holy Grail) and its successors—and in the same context as Agresrizia in the 14th-century Italian &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;.

Though frequently left unnamed, Perceval&#x27;s sister is a prominent figure in many of the Grail romances, sometimes dubbed the &quot;Grail heroine&quot;. According to Anna Caughey, Thomas Malory&#x27;s portrayal of Percival&#x27;s sister in his 15th-century &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; characterizes her with an unusual &quot;seizure of power and agency for a Malorian [good] woman that has previously been seen only in ambivalent or actively evil figures such as Nynyve or Morgan le Fay.&quot;

She is first encountered upon her brother (sometimes half-brother)&#x27;s return to their mother&#x27;s castle, where she tells him that their mother has died. Percival leaves her either in the care of their hermit uncle or (in other texts) at the Castle of Maidens. She later meets up with Percival, Galahad and Bors, telling them who she is (she does not mention her name prior to this). She proceeds to inform them of the Sword of the Strange Belt, the magical Ship of Solomon, the Tree of Life, and other aspects of her destiny. The travellers board the Ship of Solomon, intent to complete the mystical Grail quest. After leaving the ship, they encounter a castle with a leprous mistress; told that only the blood of a maiden princess can cure the chatelaine&#x27;s leprosy, Percival&#x27;s sister opts to donate hers, but succumbs to the blood loss and dies. As per her dying wish, the damsel&#x27;s body is set adrift in a boat (without a crew) to float to the holy city of Sarras. In some versions, Lancelot (Galahad&#x27;s father) finds her vessel and buries her in Palais Esperitel; in others, she is interred by Galahad and Bors when they land at the port of Sarras, after which they proceed to win the Grail.

<doc id="603569" wikidata="Q332972" url="?curid=603569" title="Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel">
<text>Admiral Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel, PC (25 April 17252 October 1786) was a British Royal Navy officer and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1755 to 1782. He saw action in command of various ships, including the fourth-rate , during the War of the Austrian Succession. He went on to serve as Commodore on the North American Station and then Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica Station during the Seven Years&#x27; War. After that he served as Senior Naval Lord and then Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet.

During the American Revolutionary War Keppel came into a notorious dispute with Sir Hugh Palliser over Palliser&#x27;s conduct as his second-in-command at the inconclusive Battle of Ushant in July 1778; the dispute led to Keppel and Palliser facing courts martial, which acquitted both of them. During the final years of the American Revolutionary War Keppel served as First Lord of the Admiralty.

==Early life==
A member of a leading Whig aristocratic family (which had come to England with William of Orange in 1688), Augustus Keppel was the second son of Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle and, Anne van Keppel, a daughter of the 1st Duke of Richmond (himself an illegitimate son of King Charles II). Educated briefly at Westminster School, Keppel went to sea at the age of ten, and had already five years of service to his credit when he was appointed to and sent with Lord Anson round the world in 1740. He had a very narrow escape from being killed at the capture of Paita (13 November 1741) and was promoted to acting lieutenant in March 1742. Also on this voyage, he made friends with John Campbell, and lost many of his teeth to the scurvy prevalent on the voyage. After their return from the circumnavigation, in November 1744, he was promoted to be commander and post-captain of the 14-gun sloop . He transferred to the sixth-rate
 in December 1744, to the fifth-rate in February 1745 and the fourth-rate in November 1745. In June 1747 he ran his ship, the &quot;Maidstone&quot;, ashore near Belleisle while chasing a French vessel, but was honourably acquitted by a court martial, and reappointed to another command, the fourth-rate . He was actively employed throughout the rest of the War of the Austrian Succession, until peace was signed in 1748.

Early in 1749, he was introduced by Lord Edgecombe to Sir Joshua Reynolds. When, on 11 May 1749, Keppel sailed from Plymouth to the Mediterranean, as Commodore commanding the Mediterranean Fleet, (with his pennant in his old ship HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; intending to persuade the Dey of Algiers to restrain the piratical operations of his subjects) Reynolds travelled with him as far as Menorca and there painted the first of his 6 portraits of Keppel, along with others of officers of the British garrison there. Keppel concluded an agreement with the Dey of Algiers which protected British commerce. After negotiating treaties at Tripoli and Tunis, Keppel returned to England in July 1751.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

During the Seven Years&#x27; War he saw constant service. He served as Commodore on the North American Station with his broad pennant in the fourth-rate from 1751 to 1755. He was on the coast of France in 1756 and was detached on an expedition to conquer Gorée, a French island off the west coast of Africa in 1758. His ship, &quot;Torbay&quot; (74), was the first to get into action in the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759.

In 1757 he had formed part of the court martial which had condemned Admiral John Byng, but was active among those who endeavoured to secure a pardon for him; but neither he nor those who had acted with him could produce any serious reason why the sentence should not be carried out. In March 1761, Keppel transferred to the third-rate and was put in command of a squadron to reduce Belle Isle, which was successfully completed in June 1761.

===Havana expedition===
When Spain joined France in 1762 he was sent as second in command with Sir George Pocock in the British expedition against Cuba which took Havana. His health suffered from the fever which carried off an immense proportion of the soldiers and sailors. The £25,000 of prize money which he received freed him from the unpleasant position of &quot;younger son of a family ruined by the extravagance of his father&quot;.

===Achievement of flag rank===

Promoted to rear admiral on 21 October 1762, Keppel became Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica Station late in the year. He was a member of the Board of Admiralty in the First Rockingham ministry from July 1765 and was Senior Naval Lord in the Chatham ministry from September 1766 until leaving the Admiralty Board in December 1766. In 1768 he acquired Elveden Hall in Suffolk. He was promoted to vice admiral on 24 October 1770. When the Falklands Crisis occurred in 1770 he was to have commanded the fleet to be sent against Spain, but a settlement was reached, and he had no occasion to hoist his flag.

==American War of Independence==
The most prominent period of his life belongs to the opening years of the American Revolutionary War. Keppel was a strong supporter of the Whig connection, led by the Marquess of Rockingham and the Duke of Richmond. The Whigs were then excluded from power by George III. As a member of Parliament, in which he had a seat for Chichester from 1755 until 1761, Windsor from 1761 until 1780, and then for Surrey from 1780 to 1782, Keppel was a Whig partisan, hostile to the King&#x27;s Friends. The Whigs believed that the king&#x27;s ministers, and in particular Lord Sandwich, then First Lord of the Admiralty, were capable of any villainy. When Keppel was promoted to full admiral on 29 January 1778 and appointed to command the Western Squadron, the main fleet prepared against France, he thought the First Lord would be glad for him to be defeated.

Prior to 1778 Keppel failed to persuade Sandwich to ignore technical difficulties and &quot;copper sheath only a few ships&quot;; he was later possibly unfairly to make political capital out of this in &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, March 1781. He had remarked that coppering &quot;gave additional strength to the navy&quot; and he reproached Lord Sandwich with having &quot;refused to sheath only a few ships with copper&quot; at his request, when he had since ordered the whole navy to be sheathed. The lack of coppering the Navy was one of the key reasons leading to Britain losing the Thirteen Colonies.

One of Keppel&#x27;s subordinate admirals was Sir Hugh Palliser, a member of the Admiralty Board, a member of parliament, and in Keppel&#x27;s opinion responsible with his colleagues for the bad state of the Royal Navy. The battle which Keppel fought with the French on 27 July 1778 (the First Battle of Ushant) ended badly. Reasons included Keppel&#x27;s own management, but also the failure of Palliser to obey orders. Keppel became convinced that he had been deliberately betrayed.

==Keppel–Palliser affair==

Though Keppel praised Palliser in his public despatch, he attacked him in private. The Whig press, with Keppel&#x27;s friends, began a campaign of calumny. The ministerial papers answered in the same style, and each side accused the other of deliberate treason. The result was a scandalous series of scenes in Parliament and of courts martial. Keppel was first tried and acquitted, and then Palliser was also tried and acquitted. Keppel left his post in March 1779. A column was built in the late 18th century to commemorate his acquittal, commissioned by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham and designed by John Carr.

==Political career==

When the North ministry fell in 1782 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, was raised to the peerage as Viscount Keppel, of Elveden in the County of Suffolk, and sworn of the Privy Council. His career in office was not distinguished, and he broke with his old political associates by resigning as a protest against the Peace of Paris. He finally discredited himself by joining the Coalition ministry formed by North and Fox, and with its fall disappeared from public life in December 1783. Keppel died unmarried on 2 October 1786. Burke, who regarded him with great affection, said that &quot;he had something high in his nature, and that it was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues&quot;. The peerage died with him.

==In popular culture==
Keppel appears in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; as a midshipman aboard the &quot;Centurion&quot;. He is often the comic relief, winding up bald and toothless due to the various privations of the voyage.

==Legacy==
Great Keppel Island and Keppel Bay in Australia, and Keppel Island in the Falkland Islands are named after Keppel. Keppel&#x27;s Column in Rotherham was constructed to mark his acquittal.

<doc id="603573" wikidata="Q5693825" url="?curid=603573" title="Heather Fong">
<text>Heather Jeanne Fong (, born 1956) is an American security official and the former chief of police for San Francisco, California, United States from 2004 to 2009. She is the first woman to lead the San Francisco Police Department, and the first Asian American woman to head a major metropolitan city police force. She is also the second Asian American police chief in SFPD history, the other being Fred Lau.

Fong served as the assistant secretary for state and local law enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security from July 31, 2023. to January 20, 2025. She previously served in the same role from November 17, 2014 through the end of the Obama administration.

==Early life and education==
Her ancestral roots are in Ho Chung village, Chung Shan County (now in Zhongshan City), Guangdong Province, China.

In high school, Fong joined the Police Athletic League&#x27;s cadet academy for two years. She graduated from St. Rose Academy in Western Addition, San Francisco in 1974.

Fong grew up in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of San Francisco and a Master of Social Work degree from San Francisco State University. In college, Fong was a member of the United States Air Force ROTC and worked as a police cadet.

Fong graduated from the police academy on August 15, 1977. At the time, the San Francisco Police Department was under pressure to hire more minorities and women, as they had only two Asian American officers and no female officers in 1974.

==Law enforcement career==
Shortly after graduating from the police academy, Fong was put on the Golden Dragon massacre case. She transferred to the police academy in 1979 as an instructor. She was placed as one of two female child abuse investigators in 1983 and then worked in the department&#x27;s planning and community outreach department starting in 1986. In 1992, she worked one year as a youth investigator. 

She was promoted to lieutenant in 1993, captain in 1994, commander in 1998, deputy chief in 2000, and assistant chief in 2003. In 1996, Chief Fred Lau assigned Fong to captain the department&#x27;s Central Station, which oversees Chinatown, North Beach, Union Square and the Financial District. 

Fong was assigned to the Special Operations Division in August 1998 when she was promoted to commander. While there, she was responsible for the Traffic, Tactical, and MUNI Transit companies. In June 2000, upon promotion to deputy chief, she was assigned to the Field Operations Bureau, where she managed the uniformed patrol personnel of the San Francisco Police Department. In August 2002, she was assigned to oversee the Administration Bureau. In May 2003, she was appointed assistant chief of police.

=== Chief of Police ===
Mayor Gavin Newsom was impressed with Fong&#x27;s performance during Fajitagate. After reassigning Alex Fagan Sr., Newsom appointed Fong acting chief of police on January 22, 2004, and chief of police on April 14, 2004.
Fong drew criticism in June 2008 for failing to complete firearm recertification for over five years though all San Francisco police officers are required to recertify annually by department regulations. Fong was quoted as saying that she was too busy to recertify. When the controversy erupted in the local media, she was recertified a week later.

In 2008, Fong became embroiled in a promotion scandal and faced pushback from SFPD rank and file over her controversial plan to cut the rank of Inspector (equivalent to Detective). About 53 San Francisco police officers filed a complaint with the Civil Service Commission. They tested for Q-35 jobs as inspectors 10 years prior, but Fong has decided to eliminate that position, and fill those investigative roles with Q-50 sergeants. 40 to 50 percent of the knowledge and abilities needed for an inspector were not covered by the sergeants test. The San Francisco Police Commission subsequently determined that Fong had acted improperly, and that personnel from the 1998 Q-35 inspectors list should have been hired instead of sergeants. Litigation is presently ongoing for the plaintiff officers, 39 in total and many part of the original Civil Service Commission complaint who are now retired.

=== Retirement ===
Fong announced in December 2008 that she would be stepping down in April 2009, after serving five years as San Francisco&#x27;s police chief.

Fong receives some $264,000 annually in pension payments. The high amount of pension payments to Fong and other retired top officials in San Francisco&#x27;s police and fire departments has prompted critical comment.

<text>Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool, PC (26 April 172917 December 1808), known as Lord Hawkesbury between 1786 and 1796, was a British statesman. He was the father of Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool.

==Early years, family and education==
He was born in Winchester, the eldest son of Colonel Charles Jenkinson (1693–1750) and Amarantha (daughter of Wolfran Cornewall). The earl was the grandson of Sir Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Baronet, of Walcot, Oxfordshire. The Jenkinson family was descended from Anthony Jenkinson (died 1611), who was a sea-captain, merchant, and traveller and the first known Englishman to penetrate into Central Asia. Liverpool was educated at Charterhouse School and University College, Oxford, where he graduated Master of Arts in 1752.

==Political career==
In 1761, Liverpool entered parliament as member for Cockermouth and was made Under-Secretary of State by Lord Bute. He won the favour of George III, and when Bute retired Jenkinson became the leader of the &quot;King&#x27;s Friends&quot; in the House of Commons. In 1763, George Grenville appointed him joint Secretary to the Treasury.

In 1766, after a short retirement, he became a Lord of the Admiralty and then a Lord of the Treasury in the Grafton administration. In 1772, Jenkinson became a Privy Councillor and Vice Treasurer of Ireland, and in 1775 he purchased the lucrative sinecure of Clerk of the Pells in Ireland and became Master of the Mint of Ireland.

From 1778 until the close of Lord North&#x27;s ministry in 1782 he was Secretary at War. From 1786 to 1804, he was President of the Board of Trade and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and he was popularly regarded as enjoying the confidence of the king to a special degree.
In 1786 he was created Baron Hawkesbury, of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, and ten years later, Earl of Liverpool. He also succeeded his cousin in 1790 as the 7th Baronet of Walcot and to the family estates. He lived at Addiscombe Place, Surrey and in Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire. He died in London on 17 December 1808.

==Family==
Liverpool was twice married. In 1769 he married first Amelia, daughter of William Watts, governor of Fort William, Bengal, and of his wife, better known as Begum Johnson. Amelia died in July 1770, a month after the birth of her only child, Robert.

Liverpool married secondly Catherine, daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet, and widow of Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet, on 22 June 1782 at her house in Hertford Street, London. They had one son, Charles, who became 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and one daughter, Charlotte, who married James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam.

On Lord Liverpool&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Robert, who became a prominent politician and eventually Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The Countess of Liverpool died in October 1827, aged 82.

==Legacy==
Liverpool wrote several political works, but according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, other than for his &quot;Treatise on the Coins of the Realm&quot; (1805) these are &quot;without striking merits&quot;.

The Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia and Hawkesbury, Ontario, Canada were named after Jenkinson shortly after he was created Baron Hawkesbury.

At least two ships were named after Jenkinson under his title of Lord Hawkesbury: one launched in America in 1781—presumably under another name—but entered in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Register&quot; from 1787 as the &quot;Lord Hawkesbury&quot;, sailing as a whaler; and the East Indiaman &quot;Lord Hawkesbury&quot;, launched in 1787.

<text>The lesser yellownape (Picus chlorolophus) is a type of woodpecker which is a widespread and often common breeder in tropical and sub-tropical Asia, primarily the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It ranges from India, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka eastwards to Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Much of the scientific knowledge gathered about this species is sourced from formal studies in various parts of India.

==Ecology==
This is a jungle species which nests in a tree hole, laying two to four white eggs. Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or “yoked&quot; feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects.

==Description==
The lesser yellownape is a largish species at 27 cm in length. It has a typical woodpecker shape. The upperparts are green apart from the bright yellow tufted nape. The neck and breast are green and the belly is whitish, finely barred with green. The rump and tail are blackish.

The adult male lesser yellownape has a green head with a white throat. He has red markings above the eye and above the nape, and red moustachial stripes. Females have only a red patch above the ear coverts. Young birds are like the female, but duller. The subspecies occurring in peninsular India has a greyer head.

==Subspecies==
Three subspecies are known. 
*&quot;chloropus&quot; - Himalayan 
*&quot;chlorigaster&quot; - Peninsular 
*&quot;wellsi&quot; - Sri Lanka.

<doc id="603582" wikidata="Q2113046" url="?curid=603582" title="Prophecy (Soulfly album)">
<text>Prophecy is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Soulfly, released in 2004. It is noteworthy for three guest artists – the completely different line-up for the album apart from leader Max Cavalera, the world music influence from a stint that Cavalera spent in Serbia, and explicit spirituality themes on the album. The album has gone on to sell over 275,000 copies.

==Lineup change==
Cavalera recruited a whole new line-up for the &quot;Prophecy&quot; album. Joe Nunez was back behind the drum kit having worked on the &quot;Primitive&quot; album with former Ill Niño lead guitarist Marc Rizzo. There are two bassists playing as members of Soulfly on &quot;Prophecy&quot; – Megadeth&#x27;s David Ellefson and Primer 55&#x27;s Bobby Burns. Cavalera took this decision to have a mixture of old school metal and death metal on the album.

Max Cavalera explained on Roadrunner Records&#x27; website that he wanted to use different musicians as part of the group for each album. &quot;This is an approach that I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a while. I never wanted Soulfly to be a band like Metallica, with the same four guys. On every Soulfly album, we&#x27;ve changed the line-up and it will probably continue that way. In order to do that, I had to start from the inside out and bring in people who caught my attention, that I had never played with before, and create this.&quot; However, with the exception of Ellefson, Soulfly retained this lineup for four consecutive studio albums, with Burns and Nunez departing following the release of &quot;Omen&quot;, in 2010.

==World music influences==
In Sepultura, Cavalera had shown an interest in world music as shown on the 1996 &quot;Roots&quot; album featuring elements of the music of Brazil&#x27;s indigenous peoples. This approach continues on the &quot;Prophecy&quot; album with Cavalera travelling to Serbia to record with traditional musicians. On the track &quot;Moses&quot;, an explicit statement of his religious beliefs, he works with Serbian band Eyesburn and includes reggae influences. Other tracks on the album employ instruments from the Middle Ages, sheepskin bagpipes and Serbian Gypsies.

==Spirituality influences==
On the band&#x27;s website, Max Cavalera said that he founded the band &quot;with the idea of combined sounds and spiritual beliefs.&quot; The Prophecy album contains the clearest statement of his beliefs with &quot;I Believe&quot; containing a spoken part in the middle where Cavalera expresses his faith.

==Critical reception==

According to CMJ from 3/22/04 pg. 18, &quot;[T]he tracks on Prophecy have worldly textures and a distinct vibe that furthers Soulfly&#x27;s status as a fluid musical tribe.&quot; John Serba of AllMusic praised Cavalera for their most well-done album possibly since his career with Sepultura. He also praised that there are many organic influences, the album was tagged the &quot;Bob Marley of metal.&quot; Don Kaye of Blabbermouth says this album is &quot;a strong, if disjointed effort, yet SOULFLY itself sounds more and more like a project searching for new ground, instead of a growing and developing rock act.&quot; Vik Bansal of musicOMH noted that the album serves as testaments to legendary metal bands from the 1980s. According to Cavalera, &quot;Prophecy&quot; is dedicated &quot;to God, the Most High&quot;, and is littered with religious art and professions of faith. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; says &quot;Although a bit inconsistent for about half an hour in the album&#x27;s second half, the magic is indeed back.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Prophecy&quot; was ranked number 306 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Summers was born Marc Berkowitz in Indianapolis, Indiana, to a Jewish family. He attended Westlane Middle School and North Central High School in Indianapolis and Grahm Junior College in Boston. 

After consulting with Rabbi Weitzman of Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation about whether to pursue a career as a rabbi or as an entertainer, Rabbi Weitzman told Summers, &quot;As a rabbi, you can help a small congregation a lot, but as a performer you can help a lot of people a little.&quot; Summers decided he preferred to help a lot of people, which set his path to becoming a performer. 

He moved out to Los Angeles in 1972, taking a job as a page at CBS Television City. There, he got to do a variety of tasks on different shows, including filling in as announcer on &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, assisting with the audience warm-up on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and helping with production on &quot;The New Price is Right&quot;. 

In the beginning of his career he was a radio DJ and a stand-up comedian; although he held various television production jobs before a career boost in 1986, when he worked as the co-announcer with Gene Wood on ABC&#x27;s short lived game show &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot;. 

==&quot;Double Dare&quot;==

Summers&#x27; work on &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot; garnered the attention from Nickelodeon, which hired him as the host of &quot;Double Dare&quot; from 1986–1993. 

According to Summers, a ventriloquist friend was called for an interview at &quot;Double Dare&quot;, but having never heard of Nickelodeon, sent Summers for the interview in his place. Summers was the first to interview for the job and was hired as both the host and producer. 

&quot;Double Dare&quot; was syndicated within two years and had a brief broadcast network run in prime time as &quot;Fox Family Double Dare&quot; in 1988.

==Later career==

In 1989, he auditioned to host the CBS daytime version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;; however, Bob Goen was hired instead.

&quot;Double Dare&quot;″s popularity led Summers to other hosting jobs including the syndicated &quot;Couch Potatoes&quot; in 1989, and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; in 1991. 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Summers appeared on television talk shows, including a stint on ABC television&#x27;s &quot;Home Show&quot;. 

Summers also had a rare dramatic performance in the Nickelodeon-produced Halloween program &quot;Mystery Magical Special&quot;, which also highlighted his skills as a stage magician. 

Summers also made celebrity guest rounds on other game shows including &quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, &quot;Talk About&quot;, &quot;Lingo&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. 

After &quot;Double Dare&quot;″s cancellation in 1993, Summers co-hosted &quot;Our Home&quot;, a daily talk show aimed at homemakers, on Lifetime. Summers left &quot;Our Home&quot; after a couple of seasons to co-host another Lifetime talk show, &quot;Biggers &amp; Summers&quot;.

In 1993, Summers hosted a special episode of &quot;Nova&quot;, called &quot;The NOVA Quiz&quot;, celebrating the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary season on PBS. Contestants answered science questions and participated in science experiments, for a chance to go on a science expedition.

Summers made an appearance on the &quot;Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on October 17, 1994, where he sat next to Burt Reynolds. The two traded jabs before Reynolds dumped water from his mug onto Summers&#x27; lap; the two ended up pieing each other. Regarding the experience, Summers later recalled: &quot;Burt Reynolds was going through a bad divorce with Loni Anderson. This was not planned, it was all real. Jay called me afterward and asked, &#x27;What&#x27;s going on between you and Burt?&#x27; It was like survival of the fittest. I was a comic. You wait your entire life to get on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, I wasn&#x27;t going to let this guy fuck it up for me.&quot;

During the 1990s, Summers continued work on television shows, each with varying success. He created and hosted the short-lived children&#x27;s game show &quot;Pick Your Brain&quot;, co-hosted &quot;Great Day America&quot; on the PAX Network, produced &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe You Said That&quot;, and hosted &quot;It&#x27;s a Surprise&quot; on Food Network.

Summers returned to Nickelodeon in 2000 as the executive consultant for &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, an updated version of the original show. Two years later, he was the executive producer for another Nickelodeon resurrection, &quot;Wild and Crazy Kids&quot;.

GSN chose Summers to host its original program &quot;WinTuition&quot; in 2002. 

On March 28, 2008, the Communication and Journalism Club of Coastal Carolina University presented Summers with the first annual Peach Cobbler Award, an honor modeled after Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Award. The Peach Cobbler Award recognizes an individual and their accomplishments in the communication field. The Communication and Journalism Club also declared that same day as &quot;Marc Summers Day&quot;. After the ceremony, Summers hosted a mock version of &quot;Double Dare&quot; on the university&#x27;s campus.

He returned to television as the host of more shows, including &quot;History IQ&quot; with his old announcer Harvey on the History Channel; the Food Network series &quot;Unwrapped&quot;; the &quot;Unwrapped&quot; spin-off game show, &quot;Trivia Unwrapped&quot;; and the Game Show Network series &quot;WinTuition&quot;. In 2005, Summers became the host of Food Network&#x27;s reality series &quot;The Next Food Network Star&quot;. Summers joined Chef Guy Fieri as co-host of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Recipe Showdown&quot; in 2008. In late 2006, Sony Pictures Television and KingWorld planned a new game show called &quot;Combination Lock&quot;, with Summers hosting the first pilot. It was to be paired with a revival of the classic game show, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;. However, a deal could not be reached between KingWorld and station groups. Off the screen, Summers has been involved as an executive producer on the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Summers currently splits his time between homes in Los Angeles and Philadelphia where his company Marc Summers Productions has a branch.

Summers has hosted stage versions of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and credits Bob Barker and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; for helping him pursue a game-show career. Summers was a young page at CBS when &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; premiered with &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;Gambit&quot; in 1972, and he often asked advice of Barker, Jack Barry and Wink Martindale—the shows&#x27; respective hosts—about a hosting career. He claims it was the best possible education and training in the game show field, and it was during this time that Summers got his first on-air experience, as a fill-in announcer on &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;.

Summers served as host of &quot;Drunk Double Dare&quot; during Drunk Day, an annual episode of the Philadelphia-based &quot;Preston &amp; Steve&quot; radio show on WMMR, held directly before the Fourth of July weekend. The show reunited Summers with his &quot;Double Dare&quot; cohorts Harvey and Robin Marrella. He has also hosted &quot;Dunkel Dare&quot; during the annual Beer Week in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Summers appears in the Good Charlotte music video for their song &quot;Last Night&quot;, which uses &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; as the motif for the video. He has also played himself on &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Workaholics&quot;, and &quot;Sanjay &amp; Craig&quot;, and appeared in special segments on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Chew&quot;.

He is the subject and executive producer of &quot;On Your Marc&quot;, a documentary that chronicles his life and development of his one-man theater show, featuring interviews with Neil Patrick Harris, Ryan Seacrest, Guy Fieri and Seth Green, and was directed by Mathew Klickstein. He hosted a number of early preview screenings and live events as part of a nationwide promotional tour of the film in October 2017.

Summers returned to host a 30th anniversary of &quot;Double Dare&quot; at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con. Summers also appeared in a commemorative half-hour special in honor of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary that aired on Nickelodeon on November 23, 2016.

In 2018, Summers provided color commentary along with his vast knowledge of the game on the revival of &quot;Double Dare&quot; with Liza Koshy, produced by RTL Group / FremantleMedia, and served as executive producer. In 2019, Summers hosted &quot;Double Dare Live&quot;, a non-broadcast, national touring version of the show.

Summers began hosting the &quot;Marc Summers Unwraps&quot; podcast in 2023.

His one-man show &quot;The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers&quot; played off-Broadway at New World Stages from February to June 2024.

Summers starred in the Hallmark Original Movie &quot;Hanukkah on the Rocks&quot;, which premiered on Hallmark Channel in December 2024.

==Health==
During an interview with Dr. Eric Hollander on &quot;Biggers &amp; Summers&quot;, Summers revealed that he has obsessive–compulsive disorder. Summers went public about his condition on various television shows, including &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;. In 1999, Summers produced a VHS video box set with Hollander about his experience, called &quot;Everything in Its Place: My Trials and Triumphs with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder&quot;. Summers also participated in a series of VHS videos for Freedom from Fear, a non-profit organization with the goal of addressing anxiety disorders and other related behavioral disorders. Despite his OCD, he was able to interact fully with his fans and contestants on &quot;Double Dare&quot; to the point of even allowing himself to get slimed, as well as shaking hands with contestants. Going public with his OCD cost Summers a job as host of a &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; revival, and he was replaced by Tom Bergeron.

In August 2012, Summers suffered severe head injuries in an accident in a Philadelphia taxicab equipped with a partition.

In a 2015 interview on the Philadelphia-based &quot;Preston &amp; Steve&quot; radio show on WMMR, Summers revealed that six years before, in 2009, he had &quot;stomach problems&quot; and had been in a lot of pain. Exploratory surgery revealed that he had chronic lymphatic leukemia. The initial doctor recommended chemotherapy, but fearing the pain and illness involved, Summers sought the opinion of another oncologist in Chicago. The oncologist promptly misdiagnosed him with mantle cell lymphoma and told him that he only had six months to live. Summers went back to his initial doctor in a panic; ultimately the original diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia was confirmed. Chemotherapy would go on for the next two years, which he described as &quot;brutal&quot;. Summers has had PET scans ever since his chemo finished, and is in remission. On April 10, 2018, Summers was again a guest on &quot;Preston &amp; Steve&quot;, and discussed flying to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center from his home in Santa Barbara for further treatment.

In late 2019, in an in-person interview on KTLA&#x27;s morning show, Summers revealed that he is again battling cancer. He did not volunteer which type of cancer he had, only saying that he was taking medication, and added, &quot;I feel good, it&#x27;s all going to be fantastic&quot;.

<text>Max the Mighty is a young adult novel by Rodman Philbrick. Published in 1998, it is the sequel to &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot;.

== Plot ==
Max Kane helps Rachel, nicknamed &quot;Worm&quot; because of her love of reading, run away from her overly religious and abusive stepfather, whom Max nicknames &quot;The Undertaker&quot; because he drives a hearse and wears black clothing. The Undertaker accuses Max of kidnapping Worm, so Max and Worm run away with Dippy Hippie on his bus, the Prairie Schooner. Along the way, they meet two con artists, Frank and Joanie, who read about Max and Worm and a money reward for finding them. Frank then tries to turn them in, and Max and Worm have to leave the Prairie Schooner. To take them the rest of the way they hop a train with Hobo Joe and arrive in Chivalry, Montana on a different train. They go into a mining tunnel and Max discovers that Worm&#x27;s birth father had died in a mining accident. The Undertaker arrives there with the police and Max and Worm run away in the tunnels. They meet Dip, and Max&#x27;s grandfather, Grim. The police catch them, and Worm runs back into the tunnel. She thinks about committing suicide to be with her father and away from her stepfather, but Max talks her out of it. A support beam in the mine falls over, pinning the Undertaker to the ground. This prompts Worm to finally confront the Undertaker about all the abuse he has been doing to her and her mother, revealing the truth to the police. Before anything else can happen, the mine starts to collapse, forcing everybody to run for the exit. However, Max cannot bear to leave the Undertaker behind, even after everything he&#x27;s done, so he lifts up the beam to free the Undertaker. The Undertaker gets out of the mine in time, but Max couldn&#x27;t. Fortunately, emergency services manage to rescue Max, who winds up with a broken shoulder and a broken leg as a result. Afterward, Worm&#x27;s mother finally works up the courage to stand up to her abusive husband and testify about what really happened, getting the Undertaker convicted of domestic abuse and locked up in prison for a long time. The book ends with Max and his grandparents insisting that Worm and her mother live with them, which they gladly do. Max frequently mentions his old friend Kevin, also nicknamed Freak, throughout the book.

<text>The Critique of Practical Reason () is the second of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s three critiques, published in 1788. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;second critique&quot;. It follows on from Kant&#x27;s first critique, the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, and is one of his major works on moral philosophy. While Kant had already published one significant work in moral philosophy, the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (1785), the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; was intended to develop his account of the will as determinable by (or able to act from) the moral law alone, place his ethical views within the larger framework of his system of critical philosophy, and expand on certain themes in his moral philosophy such as the feeling of respect for the moral law and the concept of the highest good.

== Context ==
Kant did not initially plan to publish a separate critique of practical reason. He published the first edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in May 1781 as a &quot;critique of the entire faculty of reason in general&quot; (viz., of both theoretical and practical reason) and a &quot;propaedeutic&quot; or preparation investigating &quot;the faculty of reason in regard to all pure &quot;a priori&quot; cognition&quot; to set up for a metaphysics of nature and a metaphysics of morals. 

Next, Kant began work on a metaphysics of morals by writing the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, published in 1785. Certain remarks in that work show that Kant had changed his mind about the idea of a critique of practical reason. In the Preface, Kant distinguished between a &quot;critique of pure practical reason&quot; and a &quot;critique of pure speculative reason&quot;. He also came to think that a metaphysics of morals could only really be founded on the former critique just as a metaphysics of nature needed the latter critique. A critique of pure practical reason, Kant thought, was less necessary than a critique of pure speculative reason since &quot;in moral matters human reason can easily be brought to a high degree of correctness and accomplishment, even in the most common understanding&quot;. The third section titled &quot;Transition from metaphysics of morals to the critique of pure practical reason&quot; was written to accomplish what he originally thought was at least partially needed in a critique of pure practical reason to properly set up a metaphysics of morals. 

However, Kant then changed his mind again and planned the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; as an appendix to the second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; to respond to some of the criticisms made by reviewers and commenters against the latter work. He declared his plan in an announcement he published in the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung in November 1786, but shortly abandoned it and completed the second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, published in April 1787, without an appended critique of practical reason. 

Finally, in June 1787, Kant sent the completed manuscript of his new &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; to printers in Halle where it was finally published in December 1787 but listed as published in 1788.

== Structure of the work ==
The work&#x27;s structure is based on his earlier text, the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. After a preface and an introduction, the second Critique is split into a Doctrine of Elements and a Doctrine of Method. The former part is further separated into an &quot;Analytic&quot; and a &quot;Dialectic&quot; of pure practical reason. 
* The &quot;Analytic&quot; establishes Kant&#x27;s theory of practical rationality. There he outlines and analyzes the principles of morality, shows that pure reason is practical (viz. that reason can drive or motivate our actions independently of any empirical conditions lying in the senses and feeling), discusses the object or aim of pure practical reason (the good), and deals with the non-empirical/pure incentives or &quot;motivating springs&quot; (&quot;Triebfeder&quot;) of morals. 
* The &quot;Dialectic&quot; is &quot;the exposition and resolution of illusion in the judgments of practical reason&quot;, about topics like the highest good and the errors previous philosophers made by putting it as the &quot;basis&quot; and motivation of morality. It also discusses how the existence of God and the soul&#x27;s immortality as &quot;postulates of practical reason&quot; fit into the idea of the highest good. 
The Doctrine of Method discusses moral education and how &quot;one can provide the laws of pure practical reason with access to the human mind and &quot;influence&quot; on its maxims&quot;.

&quot;Conclusion&quot;

==Preface and Introduction==
Kant sketches out here what is to follow. Most of these two chapters focus on comparing the situation of theoretical and of practical reason and therefore discusses how the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; compares to the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

The first Critique, &quot;of Pure Reason&quot;, was a criticism of the pretensions of those who use pure theoretical reason, who claim to attain metaphysical truths beyond the ken of applied reasoning. The conclusion was that pure theoretical reason must be restrained, because it produces confused arguments when applied outside of its appropriate sphere. However, the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a critique of &quot;pure&quot; practical reason, but rather a defense of it as being capable of grounding behavior superior to that grounded by desire-based practical reasoning. It is actually a critique, then, of the pretensions of &quot;applied&quot; or &quot;empirical&quot; practical reason.

Kant informs us that while the first Critique concluded that God, freedom, and immortality are unknowable on theoretic grounds, the second Critique will mitigate the force this claim on practical grounds. Freedom is revealed by the actuality of practical life because it is revealed by the moral law. God and immortality are also knowable (only on practical grounds), but practical reason now requires belief in these &quot;postulates of reason&quot;. Kant once again invites his dissatisfied critics to actually provide a proof of God&#x27;s existence and shows that this is impossible because the various arguments (ontological, cosmological and teleological) for God&#x27;s existence all depend essentially on the idea that existence is a predicate inherent to the concepts to which it is applied.

Kant insists that the &quot;Critique&quot; can stand alone from the earlier &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, although it addresses some criticisms leveled at that work (e.g., Pistorius&#x27; objection that Kant established the moral principle before the concept of the good). This work will proceed at a higher level of abstraction.

While valid criticisms of the Groundwork are to be addressed, Kant dismisses many criticisms that he finds unhelpful. He suggests that many of the defects that reviewers have found in his arguments are in fact only in their brains, which are too lazy to grasp his ethical system as a whole. As to those who accuse him of writing incomprehensible jargon, he challenges them to find more suitable language for his ideas or to prove that they are really meaningless. He reassures the reader that the second Critique will be more accessible than the first.

Last, a sketch of the second Critique is then presented in the Introduction. It is modeled on the first Critique: the &quot;Analytic&quot; will investigate the operations of the faculty in question; the &quot;Dialectic&quot; will investigate how this faculty can be led astray; and the &quot;Doctrine of Method&quot; will discuss the questions of moral education.

==Analytic: Chapter One==
Practical reason is the faculty for determining the will, which operates by applying a general principle of action to one&#x27;s particular situation. For Kant, a &quot;practical principle&quot; can be either a mere &quot;maxim&quot; if it is based on the agent&#x27;s desires or a &quot;law&quot; if it applies universally. Any principle that presupposes a previous desire for some object in the agent always presupposes that the agent is the sort of person who would be interested in that particular object. Anything that an agent is interested in can only be contingent, however, and never necessary since it is only valid for that agent alone. Therefore, it cannot be a law, but only a maxim.

To say that the law is to seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number or the greatest good, always presupposes some interest in the greatest happiness, the greatest number, the greatest good, and so on. This cannot be the basis for any universal moral law. Kant concludes that the source of the nomological character of the moral law derives not from its &quot;content&quot; but from its &quot;form&quot; alone. The content of the universal moral law, the categorical imperative, must be nothing over and above the law&#x27;s form, otherwise it will be dependent and based on the desires that the law&#x27;s possessor has. The only law whose content consists in its form (viz., the form of universality), according to Kant, is the statement: 

Kant then argues that a will which acts on the practical law is a will which is acting on the idea of the form of law, an idea of reason which has nothing to do with the senses. Hence the moral will is independent of the world of the senses, the world where it might be constrained by one&#x27;s contingent desires. The will is therefore fundamentally free. The converse also applies: if the will is free, then it must be governed by a rule, but a rule whose content does not restrict the freedom of the will. The only appropriate rule is the rule whose content is equivalent to its form, the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;. To follow the practical law is to be , whereas to follow any of the other types of contingent laws (or &quot;hypothetical imperatives&quot;) is to be and therefore unfree. The moral law expresses the positive content of freedom, while being free from influence expresses its negative content.

Kant then lists and examines six classical moral principles as practical &quot;material&quot; determinants of morality:
He concludes that all of these doctrines fail precisely because deducing or basing morality from various ultimate objects, such as happiness or perfection, is impossible. This makes these principles heteronomous and therefore fundamentally inadequate to reason.

Kant next argues that we are conscious of the operation of the moral law on us and it is through this consciousness that we are conscious of our freedom and not through any kind of special faculty. Though our actions are normally determined by the calculations of &quot;self-love&quot;, we realize that we can ignore such contingencies when moral duty is at stake. Consciousness of the moral law as such is &quot;a priori&quot; and unanalysable.

He ends this chapter by discussing Hume&#x27;s denial of the claim that the concept of causation possesses any objective validity. Hume argues that we can never see one event cause another, only the constant conjunction of events. It is subjective necessity (habit), according to Hume, that makes us view events that occur repeatedly alongside or after one another as being causally connected. Kant suggests that if Hume&#x27;s view were universally accepted, then Kant could not have distinguished causality as being both conditioned and objectively valid. Thus he would lack the necessary empty conception of unconditioned causation necessary to prevent the conflating of the phenomenal and noumenal worlds. Since we are autonomous, Kant subsequently claims that we can know something about the noumenal world as unconditioned, namely that we are in it and play a causal role as unconditioned moral agents. This standpoint, however, remains &quot;exclusively practical&quot;. Consequently, his views advanced do not challenge our limited theoretical knowledge of the things in themselves; theoretical speculation on the noumenal world is avoided.

==Analytic: Chapter Two==
Kant begins by explaining how, for practical reason, every motive one has intends some effect on the world, whose realization is the production of its object. In contrast, the concept of an object of &quot;pure&quot; practical reason is one whose possibility is distinguished from impossibility in virtue of its capacity to be brought about by a willing of the necessary action independently of one&#x27;s material conditions for doing so. When it is desire that is driving us, we first examine the possibilities that the world leaves open to us, selecting some effect at which we wish to aim. Acting on the practical moral law does not work in this way. The only possible object of the practical law is the Good, since the Good is always an appropriate object for the practical law.

It is necessary to avoid the danger of understanding the practical law simply as the law that tells us to pursue the good, and try to understand the Good as that at which the practical law aims. If we do not understand the good in terms of the practical law, then we need some other analysis by which to understand it. The only alternative is to mistakenly understand the Good as the pursuit of pleasure and evil as the production of pain to oneself.

This sort of confusion between the Good and pleasure also arises when we confuse the concepts of &quot;good versus evil&quot; with the concepts of &quot;well-being versus bad.&quot; Well-being, when contrasted with the bad, is merely pleasure. But this is not the case with the good, in the sense of &quot;morally&quot; good. A morally good person may suffer from a painful disease (bad), but he does not therefore become a bad (evil) person. If a morally bad person is punished for his crimes, it may be bad (painful) for him, but good and just in the moral sense.

Past philosophical investigations into morality have erred in that they have attempted to define the moral in terms of the good rather than the other way around. As a result, they have all fallen victim to the same error of confusing pleasure under one guise or another with morality. If one desires the good, one will act to satisfy that desire, that is in order to produce pleasure.

The moral law, in Kant&#x27;s view, is equivalent to the idea of freedom. Since the noumenal cannot be perceived, we can only know that something is morally right by intellectually considering whether a certain action that we wish to commit could be universally performed. Kant calls the idea that we can know what is right or wrong only through abstract reflection &quot;moral rationalism&quot;. This is to be contrasted with two alternative, mistaken approaches to moral epistemology: &quot;moral empiricism&quot;, which takes moral good and evil to be something we can apprehend from the world and &quot;moral mysticism&quot;, which takes morality to be a matter of sensing some supernatural property, such as the approbation of God. Although both positions are mistaken and harmful, according to Kant, moral empiricism is much more so because it is equivalent to the theory that the morally right is nothing more than the pursuit of pleasure.

In this chapter, Kant makes his clearest and most explicit formulation of the position he adopts with respect to the question of the fundamental nature of morality. Kant&#x27;s position is that moral goodness, which consists in following the rule of the categorical imperative, is more fundamental to ethics than good consequences, and that it is the right motivations—an obligation to duty—which is criterial for defining a person as good. Hence, Kant is a deontologist, in the terminology of contemporary philosophy, particularly that of analytic philosophy. Hence, he concludes that we can never have sure insight into whether one has witnessed a genuinely moral act, since the moral rightness, or lack thereof, consists in the will&#x27;s having been determined to action in the right way from the noumenal world, which is by definition unknowable. For this reason among others, he is categorized as a &quot;moral rationalist&quot;.

==Analytic: Chapter Three==
Acting morally requires being directly motivated by the moral law. If the person complies with what the moral law requires, but only because of a presupposed feeling rather than for the sake of the moral law alone, then their action has &quot;legality&quot; but not &quot;morality&quot;. For Kant, moral actions must also be done out of the incentive of the moral law. An incentive or motivating spring (&quot;Triebfeder&quot;) is defined as the &quot;subjective determining ground of the will of a being whose reason does not by its nature necessarily conform with the objective law&quot;, viz., the basis of action for the subject&#x27;s will whose reason does not always conform to acting from the moral law.

As a free will, the will must act solely from the law and even push aside any inclinations and desires that might go against the moral law. We have a natural propensity to follow self-love and strive to please ourselves by satisfying our desires. We are also inclined to self-conceit and to think that we are the center of everything and deserve to do whatever we wish. The moral law restricts the &quot;influence of self-love on the supreme practical principle&quot; and shoots down our self-conceit insofar as it has us make ourselves an unconditional practical rule for action over and above the moral law. Thus, the moral law humiliates us and produces in us respect for the moral law, which is a feeling that does not arise in us from sensual (empirical) impulses, but rather from pure reason through the awareness and recognition of the moral law&#x27;s validity.

Kant ends this chapter by comparing the structure of the second critique with the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. In comparing the former with the latter critique, Kant refers to the different structures of the analytical parts between the two works. Kant states that the Analytic of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; begins by analyzing the a priori elements of sensibility (space and time), then examines the most fundamental and essential concepts of the human mind with regard to theoretical knowledge (the categories), and lastly ends with principles. The train of thought in the second critique is reversed. Since the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; deals with a will which acts according to certain principles (the moral law), it had to search for a principle that gives instructions for moral action and thus start from the possibility a priori principles for moral action or conduct. From there, it proceeded to concepts (the purely rational concepts of absolutely good and evil), and lastly ended with how pure practical reason related to sensibility with regard to moral feeling (respect for the moral law). Additionally, Kant also discusses his solution to the compatibility of natural determinism and human freedom against philosophers such as Leibniz (whose solution Kant calls &quot;the freedom of a turnspit&quot;) and Hume.

==Dialectic: Chapter One==
Pure reason, in both its theoretical and practical forms, faces the fundamental problem that things in the phenomenal realm of experience are conditional (i.e. they depend on something else) but pure reason always seeks for the unconditional. The solution to this is that the unconditional, according to Kant, is only to be found in the noumenal world. Pure theoretic reason, when it attempts to reach beyond its limits into the unconditional is bound to fail and the result is the creation of antinomies of reason.

Antinomies are conflicting statements both of which appear to be validated by reason. Kant exposed several such antinomies of speculative reason in the first Critique. In the second Critique, he finds an antinomy of pure practical reason whose resolution is necessary in order to further our knowledge.

In this case, the antinomy consists in the fact that the object of pure practical reason must be the highest good (&quot;Summum bonum&quot;). Good actions depend on the highest good to make them worthwhile. However, assuming the existence of a highest good leads to paradox and assuming the non-existence of a highest good also leads to paradox.

==Dialectic: Chapter Two==
Kant posits two different senses of &quot;the highest good.&quot; On one sense (the &quot;supreme&quot;), it refers to that which is always good and which is required for all other goods. This sense is equivalent to &quot;dutifulness&quot;. In another sense (the &quot;perfect&quot;), it refers to the best of good states, even if part of that state is only contingently good. In this latter sense, the highest good combines virtuousness with happiness.

The highest good is the object of pure practical reason, so we cannot use the latter unless we believe that the former is achievable. However, virtue obviously does not necessarily lead to happiness in this world and vice versa. To aim at one is not to aim at the other and it seems to be a matter of chance whether the rest of the world will fill in the gap by rewarding us for our virtuous behavior.

But Kant&#x27;s solution is to point out that we do not only exist phenomenally but also noumenally. Though we may not be rewarded with happiness in the phenomenal world, we may still be rewarded in an afterlife which can be posited as existing in the noumenal world. Since it is pure practical reason, and not just the maxims of impure desire-based practical reason, which demands the existence of such an afterlife, immortality, union with God and so on, then these things must be necessary for the faculty of reason as a whole and therefore they command assent.

The highest good requires the highest level of virtue as the supreme moral condition for being worthy of happiness. We can know by self-examination that such virtue does not exist in us now, nor is it likely to exist in the foreseeable future. In fact, the only way in which the fallible human will can become similar to the holy will is for it to take an eternity to achieve perfection. Therefore, we can postulate the existence of immortality. This postulate allows us to conceive how it is possible for us in some way to achieve a will that is completely adequate to the moral law, viz., a will similar to the holy will. If we do not postulate it, we will be led to either soften the demands of morality in order to make them achievable here and now or we will make the absurd demand on ourselves that we must achieve the holy will now.

The highest good also requires the highest level of happiness, in order to reward the highest level of virtue. We therefore need to postulate that there is an omniscient and omnipotent God who can order the world justly and reward us for our virtue. However, this does &quot;not&quot; mean that God is to be the &quot;basis&quot; for our moral action. Rather, this postulate of God&#x27;s existence gives us a way to understand &quot;for a practical aim&quot; how the highest level of happiness proportionate to the highest level of virtue could be &quot;possible&quot;.

==Doctrine of method==
In the first Critique, the Doctrine of Method plans out the scientific study of the principles of pure theoretical reason. Here, however, the Doctrine of Method will instead be a discussion of how the principles of practical reason can be brought to bear on the mind. In other words, the Doctrine of Method in the second Critique is fundamentally concerned with moral education: the question of how we can make people live and act morally.

Kant has shown that truly moral behavior requires more than just the outward show of good behavior; it also requires the right inner motivations. The cynic or skeptic might be doubtful as to whether it is truly possible for human beings to act out of an &quot;obligation to duty.&quot; In his view, even if we could produce a simulacrum of a moral society, it would all be an enormous theater of hypocrisy, since everyone would inwardly, privately continue to pursue his or her own advantage. Moreover, this outward show of morality would not be stable, but dependent on its continuing to be to the advantage of each individual. Fortunately, Kant believes, such doubts are misguided.

Almost any time there is a social gathering of some sort, the conversation will include gossip and argumentation which entails moral judgments and evaluations about the rightness or wrongness of the actions of others. Even people who normally do not enjoy intricate arguments tend to reason acutely and precisely when they are caught about in the justification or condemnation of the moral worth of the actions of their next-door neighbor or the deceased.

Although moral education will first begin with &quot;preparatory guidance&quot; to bring the child onto the path of morals by attracting them through gain and scaring them with harm, it should soon abandon this practice altogether and make use of this natural human tendency for moral evaluation. This is done by a moral catechism and presenting the students with historical examples of good and evil actions. Through debating and discussing the worth of these examples on a case-by-case basis, the students will be given the opportunity to experience for themselves the admiration we feel for moral goodness and the disapproval that we feel for moral evil.

However, it is necessary to select the right sorts of examples in order to demonstrate genuine moral goodness. And here, Kant says, we are liable to error in two ways. The first type of error consists in trying to attract students into being moral by providing them examples in which morality and self-love coincide. The second type of error consists in trying to emotionally arouse the students about morality by providing examples of extraordinary moral heroism, above what morality normally requires. The examples we choose should stress dutifulness and purity of intention.

The first of these methods, argues Kant, is destined to fail because students will not come to understand the unconditional nature of duty. The examples will also not be very inspiring. When we see extraordinary self-sacrifice in the name of following a principle independently of any advantage or gain, we are inspired and moved. But when we see someone following a principle with hardly any sacrifice or cost to himself, we are not equally impressed.

The second method will also fail because it appeals to the emotions rather than to reason. Only reason can produce firm long-lasting changes in a person&#x27;s character. This method also leads students to associate morality with the impossible theatrics of melodrama, and therefore to disdain the everyday obligations they should be fulfilling as beneath them.

Kant ends the second Critique on a hopeful note about the future of ethics, stating that &quot;[t]wo things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence, the more often and more steadily one reflects on them: &quot;the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me&quot;&quot;. The wonders of both the physical and the ethical worlds are not far for us to find: to feel awe, we should only look upward to the stars or inward to the moral law which we carry within us. The study of the physical world was dormant for centuries and wrapped in superstition before the physical sciences actually came into existence. We are allowed to hope that soon the moral sciences will replace superstition with knowledge about ethics.

== Influence ==
The second Critique exercised a decisive influence over the subsequent development of the field of ethics and moral philosophy beginning with Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of Science&quot;. Fichte felt that studying Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy in 1790 helped him overcome his crisis of metaphysical determinism. He wrote a letter in late 1790 to Friedrich August Weisshuhn about his excitement after reading the second Critique and says that &quot;[p]ropositions which I thought could never be overturned have been overturned for me. Things have been proven to me which I thought could never be proven—for example, the concept of absolute freedom, the concept of duty, etc.— and I feel all the happier for it&quot;. Later, during the 20th century, it became the principal reference point for deontological moral philosophy and Kantian ethics.

In his &quot;A Commentary on Kant&#x27;s Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (1961) The American philosopher Lewis White Beck asserted that Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; has unfortunately been neglected by some modern scholars and sometimes even supplanted in their minds by Kant&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. He further argued that students can also acquire a complete understanding of Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy by reviewing Kant&#x27;s analysis of the concepts of both freedom and practical reason as presented in the &quot;second critique&quot;. Beck asserts that Kant&#x27;s &quot;second critique&quot; serves to weave each of these divers strands into a unified pattern for a comprehensive theory on moral authority in general.

<doc id="603602" wikidata="Q953021" url="?curid=603602" title="Neverland Ranch">
<text>Sycamore Valley Ranch, formerly Neverland Ranch or Neverland Valley Ranch, is a developed property in Santa Barbara County, California, on the edge of Los Padres National Forest. From 1988 to 2005, it was the home and private amusement park of the American singer Michael Jackson. The ranch is about 5 miles (8 km) north of unincorporated Los Olivos, and about eight miles (13 km) north of the town of Santa Ynez.

Originally named Zaca Laderas Ranch, the estate was renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch shortly after it was purchased by the property developer William Bone in 1981. In 1988, the ranch was sold to Jackson, who renamed it after Neverland, the fantasy island in the story of Peter Pan, a boy who never ages. Jackson first visited the ranch when he visited Paul McCartney, who was staying there during their filming of the &#x27;Say Say Say&#x27; music video in 1983. According to Jackson&#x27;s sister La Toya, he expressed interest in someday owning the property.

Jackson left Neverland Ranch in 2005, shortly after his acquittal of child sexual abuse charges, and never returned; he owned it until his death in 2009. After the property had depreciated for several years, the American billionaire businessman Ronald Burkle, a friend of the Jackson family, purchased it in 2020 for US$22 million.

==Background==
The estate was originally known as the Zaca Laderas Ranch at the time of its purchase by the property developer William Bone in 1981. Bone renamed the estate the Sycamore Valley Ranch and moved there with his family. Bone commissioned the architect Robert Altevers to design the principal buildings on the ranch, and the pair spent two and a half years researching potential designs and ideas. The main house was completed in 1982, based on a design by Altevers, with formal gardens, a stone bridge, and a lake with a waterfall. Bone later said that in building the house he had &quot;...a desire to express everything I had learned in 15 years of home building...I achieved here all the things I wanted to do in my business but could not&quot;. He had considered converting the property to a country club but did not do so.

==Residence of Michael Jackson==
Prior to taking up residence at the ranch, Jackson lived with his family at Hayvenhurst. He purchased the estate from Bone in March 1988 for an unknown amount. Some sources indicate $19.5 million while others suggest it was closer to $30 million. The property was initially purchased by a trust with Jackson&#x27;s lawyer, John Branca, and his accountant, Marshall Gelfand, as trustees, for reasons of privacy. The arrangement was later rescinded by Jackson in April 1988 and he became the ultimate owner of the property. It was Jackson&#x27;s home as well as his private amusement park, with numerous artistic garden statues, amusement rides, and a petting zoo.

The property included three railroads: one narrow gauge named &quot;Neverland Valley Railroad&quot;, with a steam locomotive named &quot;Katherine&quot; after his mother (Crown (2B), built-in 1973), and two coaches. The other was a narrow gauge, with a C. P. Huntington replica locomotive made by Chance Rides. There was also a custom-made private electric train that was purchased by Jackson for his own children, Michael Jr., Paris, and Prince II. The train was manufactured in 2001 by a German company Elektro-Mobiltechnik. The train was set up in the yard at Neverland behind the main house and had of track.

There was also a Ferris wheel, carousel, zipper, octopus, pirate ship, wave swinger, Super Slide, roller coaster, bumper cars, and an amusement arcade. The master closet also contained a secret safe room for security.

Some of the events that took place at the Ranch included the wedding of Elizabeth Taylor and Larry Fortensky in 1991 and the live Oprah Winfrey interview of Jackson in 1993. In 1995, Jackson and his then-wife Lisa Marie Presley hosted children from around the world for a three-day World Children&#x27;s Congress, a series of seminars and workshops on issues facing kids around the globe, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the United Nations.

On November 18, 2003, a search warrant was executed at Neverland Ranch in connection with the &quot;People v. Jackson&quot; trial after Jackson was charged with multiple counts of molesting a minor. Jackson was acquitted of all charges. However, Jackson stated he would never live at the property again as he no longer considered the ranch a home and did not return to Neverland. Jackson&#x27;s sister, La Toya, wrote of her experience staying at the ranch during her brother&#x27;s trial in her 2012 memoir &quot;Starting Over&quot;. The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Sheik Abdullah, the ruler&#x27;s son.

Neverland Ranch had a central role in the allegations against Jackson of alleged child sexual abuse; it is one of the main sites where Jackson&#x27;s accusers have said the alleged sexual abuse took place. The ranch&#x27;s association with alleged sexual abuse allegations was described as a possible reason for a significant depreciation.

==Financial status==
Reports of foreclosure proceedings against Neverland Ranch were published in 2007. A spokesperson for Jackson said that the loan was merely being refinanced and Jackson (later his estate) remained the majority stake holder, with a legal retention of 87.5% of the ranch.
On February 25, 2008, Jackson received word from Financial Title Company, the trustee, that unless he paid off $24,525,906.61 by March 19, a public auction would go forward of the land, buildings, and other items such as the rides, trains, and art. On March 13, 2008, Jackson&#x27;s lawyer L. Londell McMillan announced that a private agreement had been reached with the private investment group, Fortress Investment, to save Jackson&#x27;s ownership of the ranch. Before the agreement, Jackson owed three months&#x27; arrears on the property. McMillan did not reveal the details of the deal.

On May 12, 2008, a foreclosure auction for the ranch was canceled after Colony Capital, an investment company run by billionaire Tom Barrack, purchased the loan, which was in default. The selling price was $22.5 million. In a press release, Jackson stated, &quot;I am pleased with recent developments involving Neverland Ranch and I am in discussions with Colony and Tom Barrack with regard to the Ranch and other matters that would allow me to focus on the future.&quot;

On November 10, 2008, Jackson transferred the title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company, LLC, and neighbors reported immediate activity on the property, including the amusement rides being trucked along the highway. Jackson still owned an unknown stake in the property, since Sycamore Valley Ranch was a joint venture between Jackson (represented by McMillan) and an affiliate of Colony Capital. The Santa Barbara County Assessor&#x27;s Office stated Jackson sold an unknown proportion of his property rights for $35 million. Subsequent news reports however, indicated that Colony Capital had invested only $22.5 million in the property. In any event, reliable sources indicate that Colony was the majority owner.

Kyle Forsyth, Colony&#x27;s project manager, described the estate&#x27;s Tudor-style buildings and savanna-like grasslands as &quot;English country manor meets Kenya.&quot; Colony hoped to sell the ranch, located in Santa Barbara County, in its entirety. Subdividing it, said Forsyth, &quot;would destroy it&quot;.

The Zipper, Lolli Swing and Spider rides were purchased by Helm and Sons Amusements which also purchased rides for Jackson while Neverland&#x27;s private amusement park was in operation. Butler Amusements, of Fairfield, California purchased six of the rides. Since their sale, these rides have appeared at county and state fairs across California, Oregon and Washington, sometimes with signs describing their Neverland origin. Archway Amusements Corp of Imperial, Missouri purchased the ferris wheel which was originally custom made for Jackson in 1990 for $215,000 by the manufacturer Eli Bridge Company of Jacksonville, Illinois.

Some rides were more permanently installed. The Dragon Wagon children&#x27;s roller coaster is in operation at Coney Island, New York City. The Sea Dragon swinging ship ride was purchased in 2008 by Beech Bend Park in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The bumper cars were permanently installed at CalExpo, site of the California State Fair. In 2013, the billionaire British businessman Jo Bamford made plans to buy the ranch, but never finished the deal.

==Death of Michael Jackson==


Following Jackson&#x27;s death, press reports during June 28–29, 2009, claimed that his family intended to bury him at the Neverland Ranch, eventually turning it into a place of pilgrimage for his fans, similar to how Graceland has become a destination for fans of Elvis Presley. Jackson&#x27;s father Joseph Jackson later denied the reports. Construction equipment and gardeners entered the grounds on July 1, prompting speculation that preparations were being made for something related to Jackson&#x27;s death, but local officials stated that a burial there would be only allowed if the owners of the ranch would go through a permitting process with county and state government before establishing a cemetery at the site. Jackson&#x27;s 2002 will gives his entire estate to a family trust.

The ranch was the setting for two media appearances on July 2, 2009. Jermaine Jackson took &quot;The Today Show&quot;&#x27;s Matt Lauer on a tour of the main house, and he was interviewed on the grounds of the house by Larry King for his show. In January 2013, musical artist Lady Gaga announced her willingness to help Jackson&#x27;s children in keeping the ranch by investing in the property.

==Restoration==

The amusement rides and animals–excluding the llamas–were gone by 2009, replaced with a meditative zen garden and a section decorated with Peter Pan, Jackson&#x27;s favorite fictional hero.

In May 2015, it was announced that the Neverland Ranch, renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, would be put up for sale with an initial asking price of $100 million. By that time, Colony NorthStar had completed extensive renovations to the property. Many people, including fans, protested and disagreed with the decision. Jermaine Jackson, elder brother of Michael, wrote an open letter to Colony NorthStar expressing his disagreement with their decision.

As of May 2016, the ranch, jointly owned by the Jackson estate and Colony NorthStar, was put up for sale by Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty with an asking price of $100 million. The price included the six bedroom Normandy-style mansion, the four-acre lake with a waterfall, a pool house, three guest houses, a tennis court, and a movie theater and stage. The train station and railway tracks were also included. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the owners were seeking a buyer who did not plan to turn the ranch into a Jackson museum.

Due to a lack of interest, the asking price of the ranch had fallen to $67 million by February 2017. The property was still on the market in early 2018, at the same price, with Coldwell Banker. In February 2019, the asking price was reduced to $31 million. The listing agent for the ranch said nothing had changed except the price. The structures and landscaping are still maintained.

In December 2020, the billionaire businessman Ronald Burkle, a friend of the Jackson family, purchased the property for $22 million as a &quot;land banking opportunity&quot;. The ranch was evacuated as the Lake fire burned nearby in 2024.

<text>Wang Jin-pyng (; born March 17, 1941) is a Taiwanese politician. He served as President of the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2016, which makes him Taiwan&#x27;s longest-serving legislative speaker. Once a leading figure of the Kuomintang (KMT), Wang is considered to be soft-spoken and a conciliatory figure who has often brokered deals between the KMT and opposition DPP. Due to his longevity, experience and influence in political scene, he is a widely respected figure in Taiwanese politics. He was replaced by Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s Su Jia-chyuan as president of the Legislative Yuan after a decisive victory for the DPP in the 2016 election.

==Early life==
Wang was born in a simple rural community in Rochiku Village, Takao Prefecture, Taiwan, Empire of Japan (modern-day Luzhu, Kaohsiung). Living a villager&#x27;s life, Wang gained positive mental and physical condition. Wang excelled in sports during his school years. His teachers encouraged him to enter the physical education department in university.

Wang finished his elementary school in Tainan Municipal Dashe Elementary School. He finished his junior and senior high school from the Tainan First Senior High School in Tainan. In this school, Wang had always become the team leader of the school&#x27;s tennis team.

He finally graduated from the Teacher&#x27;s College of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1965.

Wang said that he never put extra efforts in academic studies since childhood and he does not believe in renowned star schools. However, his grades have always been good and his education went smoothly throughout his school years.

==Early career==
Upon graduation, Wang worked as a mathematics teacher for a year at the Provincial Ging-Der Senior High School in Changhua County. After his mandatory military service in the Republic of China Military Police was completed, Wang returned home to work for the family-run food processing company dealing with export and import trade.

In early 1975, he represented his family business in the founding of Kaohsiung Industrial Association. He was elected as the director-in-chief of the association. His job involved travelling throughout Taiwan to inspect member factories and led to his entry into politics later that year.

==Political career==

===Legislative Yuan===
Following his victory in the 1975 supplementary legislative election for the Kaohsiung County constituency, Wang took his seat in the Legislative Yuan on 1 February 1976 from being held by Huang Tung-shu previously. He has since been reelected eight times.

From 1976 until 1990, he was a member of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan. In 1980, 1987 and 1990, Wang acted many times to assemble members of the Financial Committee and put his efforts forward in making some possible historical policies, such as introducing innovative tax system, opening up the establishment of security firms, lifting prohibition of setting up private banks, removing foreign exchange control schemes and other policies.

===Kuomintang===
On 10 April 1990, Wang was appointed as the vice chairman of the Central Policy Committee of the KMT, and then on 17 November 1990, he was appointed as the chairman of the Central Policy Committee&#x27;s Finance Commission. Wang became the KMT&#x27;s first director-general of the Committee on Coordination between Party and Government and the KMT caucus convener in the Legislative Yuan in 1992 following the retirement of all of Legislative Yuan first senior members on 31 December 1991. During that time, Wang was posted as KMT supervisor and started to search for a mechanism to make cross party negotiation possible.

On 27 August 1993, Wang was elected to become the member of KMT Central Committee, and subsequently the member of Central Standing Committee during the 14th nationwide representative meeting of the party.

===China-Japan Parliamentary Member Interactions Association===
In 1993, Wang was appointed as the director of China-Japan Parliamentary Member Interactions Association, where he became more active in promoting parliamentary diplomacy.

===Taiwan Foundation for Democracy===
In 2003 Wang was elected as the chairman of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, which was a democracy developing project set up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ROC.

===Other organizations===
Wang also holds other public welfare positions, such as the president of the Council for Taiwan Major League Baseball Association, board chairman of the Formosa Cancer Foundation, President of the Council for National Volunteer Fire Fighters&#x27; Association, honored board chairman of the Charity Mothers Association and honored board chairman of the National No-Barrier Space Development Association.

==Legislative Yuan vice presidency==
On 1 February 1993, Wang became the KMT candidate for the nomination of vice president post of the Legislative Yuan. Supported by the majority, he secured his post and started to lead the congress. He renewed his three-year post in 1996, serving the post consecutively from 1 February 1993 until 31 January 1999.

During his office term, Wang successfully completed the passing of many important laws, such as the Self-governance Law for Provinces and Counties, Municipal Self-governance Law, National Health Insurance Law, February 28 Incident Disposition and Compensation Act, Joint Development Law, Presidential and vice presidential Election and Recall Law, Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance Law, Government Procurement Law, Three Laws Pertaining to National Security, Three Laws Pertaining to Communication.

Wang was also actively involved in promoting congress diplomacy. He had represented the Legislative Yuan as vice president visiting abroad and also as representative to receive guests from foreign countries.

==Kuomintang vice chairmanship==
Wang had been the vice chairman of KMT in 2000–2005.

===ROC presidential election===
During the 2004 presidential election, he served as campaign manager for the Lien Chan and James Soong ticket. Considered part of the pro-localization faction in the KMT, his strong support and active campaigning for the Lien-Soong ticket was considered very significant as it blunted criticism that Lien-Soong were anti-Taiwan. There were calls, which he ignored, from many figures such as Lee Teng-hui for him to abandon Lien and join the Taiwan Solidarity Union before the election.

Prior to July 2005, he was, along with Ma Ying-jeou touted as possible presidential candidates for 2008. As a southerner, a native Hoklo speaker, and a legislator and person identified with the pro-localization faction of the Kuomintang, he was expected to provide balance to Ma Ying-jeou, who was rooted in northern Taiwan, and someone more identified with the unification-leaning parts of the party.

===2005 KMT chairmanship election===
However, on 16 July 2005, Ma defeated Wang in the first competitive election for KMT chairmanship by a 72% to 28% margin, a margin larger than anticipated by either camp or news sources, despite Wang&#x27;s receiving a last-minute endorsement by People First Party chairman James Soong, who had retained significant following within the KMT. Immediately after the election, Ma stated repeatedly that he wished Wang to remain as first-ranked deputy chairman. Wang, however, has so far rebuffed the gesture, instead stating that he wishes to serve as &quot;permanent volunteer,&quot; and snubbed Ma by refusing to meet with him. Wang has, indeed, accepted a party post that is incompatible with vice chairmanship, effectively ending the possibility that he would be vice chairman, although after meeting with Wang, Ma said that he would &quot;leave the position open&quot; for Wang.

Most political commentators believe the KMT chairmanship election definitively put Ma Ying-jeou as the front-runner for the KMT nomination in 2008; this was proved correct as Ma won the KMT nomination for 2008 president on 2 May, virtually uncontested. Although Wang did not join the primary election, Wang has also not ruled out running as an independent. Though Ma had offered Wang the nomination as the KMT&#x27;s vice presidential candidate, Wang recently declined the offer, saying that the pressure of being legislative Speaker was too great for him to be able to consider the offer. After weeks of talks and discussions among the Pan-Blue heavy weights including Lien, Wang, Wu and Ma, there was no agreement made to field a Ma-Wang President-Vice President ticket. At the end, Wang decided to turn down Ma&#x27;s offer of Vice Presidency, but stated that he would do his utmost to support Ma in the upcoming election.

==Legislative Yuan presidency==
===4th Legislative Yuan===
Due to his easygoing nature and willingness to listen to differing perspectives, Wang was elected as president of the 4th Legislative Yuan on 1 February 1999 with a majority vote of 135 out of 225 seats. Within just one year after taking his new post, Wang promoted adjustments in organization, reinforced staff members, crossed party negotiation according to the five major Legislative Reorganization Act. By doing so, he opened a model in congress reform and contributed to the completion of discussion by the end of the 4th session.

During the first half of the session, Wang had passed a total of 60 new laws, confirming the plan to move Legislative Yuan to a new place. In the second half of the session, a total of 96 laws were passed, the second highest in ROC history when 148 laws were passed in 1948.

===5th Legislative Yuan===
The KMT lost its majority for the first time in the 2001 legislative election, but through the narrow Pan-Blue Coalition majority, he was reelected president for the 5th Legislative Yuan on 1 February 2002. As Legislative Yuan President, Wang has gained a reputation of being a soft-spoken figure capable of reaching across party lines.

===6th Legislative Yuan===

====2005 Busan APEC====
In the APEC meeting at South Korea in late 2005, President Chen Shui-bian nominated Wang as the representative for Chinese Taipei, the designated name for ROC in APEC. The KMT approved of the nomination. This nomination did not become a reality, however, as the PRC pressured South Korea to ask for a second nomination. Despite lobbying by former South Korean president Kim Young-sam, who visited Chen in that time period, Chen was forced to name another person. This cat fight actually exacerbated Taiwan&#x27;s image, as the summit yearbook did not even mention Taiwan&#x27;s presence. The host explanation was that the second nomination was submitted well past the deadline for the yearbook.

===7th Legislative Yuan===
Until 2011, Kuomintang legislators were barred from seeking an at-large third term. The restriction was lifted that year, for politicians who made &quot;special contributions to the party, meet the needs of the party and have served as legislative speaker,&quot; and Wang continued serving as Yuan President.

During the final plenary session of the 7th Legislative Yuan on 14 December 2011, Wang said that the Yuan had passed a total of 896 bills and resolutions over the past four years, including the Special Statute for Distributing Consumption Vouchers for Revitalizing the Economy, Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement and legislation regarding the 2G national health insurance program, gender equality and justice in housing. Wang encouraged the yuan to continue its oversight functions on behalf of the public in the future as a power to promote the development of Taiwan.

===8th Legislative Yuan===

====Influence peddling====

On 7 September 2013, according to information gathered through wiretap recordings, President Ma Ying-Jeou accused Wang of influence peddling, a move that damages KMT reputation. The move came during Wang&#x27;s trip to Malaysia to attend his daughter&#x27;s wedding. Wang was officially expelled from the KMT on 11 September, disqualifying his eligibility to serve as a KMT legislator and ending his 14-year speakership tenure in the Legislative Yuan. The Special Investigation Division of the ROC Supreme Prosecutor Office accused Wang of illegally lobbying for Democratic Progressive Party caucus whip Ker Chien-ming in a breach of trust case by asking the then-minister of justice Tseng Yung-fu and the head prosecutor of Taiwan High Prosecutors Office Chen Shou-huang (陳守煌) to use their influence to stop an appeal of a not-guilty verdict for Ker.

On 11 September 2013, Wang sent an attorney to the Taipei District Court to file for an injunction for his KMT membership revocation. On 13 September 2013, the court approved Wang&#x27;s request for which Wang had to put NT$9.38 million as a bail. This move ruled that Wang is still the member of Kuomintang and the president of Legislative Yuan until further notice. This court decision, however, is rejected by KMT chairman and president Ma Ying-jeou and announced that the party will file for a counter-appeal against the decision.

Many support movements around Taiwan were shown to support Wang. After the disciplinary action against Wang, 11 neighborhood wardens in Wang&#x27;s hometown in Lujhu, Kaohsiung gave up their KMT membership. Wang called upon them to stay within they party. Upon Wang&#x27;s arrival in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport from Malaysia, thousands of supporters awaited him, including lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu. People First Party Chairman James Soong criticized Ma regarding the allegation, citing that politics should have some humanity.

Support for President Ma Ying-jeou came from Wang Chien-shien, President of Control Yuan. He said that despite KMT legislators comprising about three-quarters, or 84 members out of total 113 seats in the Legislative Yuan, the KMT was still being held hostage by opposition Democratic Progressive Party, adding that KMT had accomplish nothing from 2008 until 2012 due to Wang Jin-pyng&#x27;s inability to deal with people and negotiate.

The KMT officially lifted at large term limits for affiliated politicians who had previously served as leader of the legislature in October 2015.

==Later political career==
On 7 March 2019, Wang announced his intention to contest the Kuomintang nomination for the 2020 Taiwan presidential election. He withdrew from the 2019 Kuomintang presidential primary on 6 June 2019. On 17 June, Wang reiterated, &quot;I will run [for president] to the end, although it is difficult to explain how I will do that,&quot; though he would not consider leaving the Kuomintang or a vice presidential candidacy.

In November 2024 Wang opened a think tank focusing on publishing research on achieving peace between both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The think tank, named the Middle Way Peace Alliance, has board members including Kuomintang Vice Chairperson Andrew Hsia, Taiwan Democracy Foundation Director Liao Ta-chi, and others. The think thank aims to achieve cross-stait peace, peace generally, and Great Unity.

==Personal life==

At the age of 28, on 26 March 1969 Wang met his then-future wife Chen Tsai-lien during the anniversary celebration of Shih Chien Home Economics College at the Feng-Lin Restaurant. It was love at the first sight and both felt a deep connection towards one another. They held their engagement ceremony at Mandarina Crown Hotel.

In 2021, Wang received Japan&#x27;s Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, for his contributions to &quot;enhancing mutual friendship and understanding between Taiwan and Japan.&quot;.

<text>Bruny Island (Nuenonne: Lunawanna-alonnah) is a island located off the southeastern coast of Tasmania, Australia. The island is separated from the Tasmanian mainland by the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel, and its east coast lies within the Tasman Sea. Located to the island&#x27;s northeast Storm Bay, is the river mouth to the Derwent River estuary, and serves as the main port of Hobart, Tasmania&#x27;s capital city. Both the island and the channel are named after French explorer, Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux. Its traditional Aboriginal name is lunawanna-allonah, which survives as the name of two island settlements, Alonnah and Lunawanna.

==History==
Bruny Island was originally inhabited by Aboriginal Tasmanians, and there is still a large community of people living on the island who identify as Aboriginal. Abel Tasman was the first recorded European to sight the island in November 1642.

On 11 March 1773, Tobias Furneaux was the first British explorer to reach the island, and anchored at Adventure Bay (named after his ship) for four days; four years later on 26 January 1777 James Cook&#x27;s two ships, the &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; stayed in the bay area for two days. Cook carved his initials in a tree that was destroyed in a 1905 bushfire and is now commemorated by a plaque. In 1788 and again in 1792 (with Matthew Flinders), William Bligh stayed in the Adventure Bay area.

The island itself, however, is named after the French explorer Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux, who explored the Channel region and discovered it to be an island in 1792. It was known as Bruni Island until 1918, when the spelling was changed to Bruny.

Whaling was conducted off the coast of Bruny Island in the first half of the 19th century. The British whaler, &quot;Alexander&quot;, was reported to be whaling in Adventure Bay in 1804. In 1805, the British whalers &quot;Richard and Mary&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot; and the Sydney whaler &quot;King George&quot; were reported there in the winter months. The American whaler &quot;Topaz&quot; was there in 1807. Colonial entrepreneurs also operated shore-based whaling stations there. Bethune and Kelly had a station operating in Adventure Bay by August 1826. Kelly and Lucas had another at Bull Bay. Young and Walford had one at Trumpeter Bay. Alexander Imlay applied for a site as a whaling station at Cloudy Bay in 1837, and Brown and Rogers did the same in 1842. These stations had all ceased operating by 1850, although whaling vessels sometimes anchored offshore in the second half of the century.

Even though &quot;Cooktown&quot; was marked on maps as early as the 1840s, the island was not officially opened up to European settlement until the late 1800s when the timber industry took off. South Bruny was opened up by numerous tramways and haulages, some horse-drawn and some using modified locomotives. The longest and best-preserved tramway runs from Adventure Bay to the far southeast corner of the island. Almost all settlements on South Bruny were originally opened as timber ports, owned by the different timber companies operating on the island. Lunawanna (formerly Daniels Bay), Alonnah (formerly Mills Reef) and Adventure Bay were some of the largest ports operating on the island. At Daniels Bay, the settlement was separated from the timber jetty as the tramway was forced to trace along the south side of the bay in order to reach deep water, as most of Daniels Bay was too shallow to bring boats in. Most settlements of South Bruny now serve as shack towns or holiday locations.

Since the 1920s, the island has become known as a holiday location with surfing beaches, National Parks and historical sites. In more recent history the Bruny Island was the site of a land transfer by the state government to local Aboriginal people.

==Geography==
Geologically, Bruny Island actually consists of two land masses—North Bruny and South Bruny—that are joined by a long, narrow, sandy isthmus, often referred to as &quot;The Neck&quot;. The island has a total length of approximately . The holiday village of Dennes Point is located in North Bruny, while South Bruny is the site of the towns of Alonnah, Adventure Bay, and Lunawanna.

Outside its settlements, the island is covered with grazing fields and large tracts of dry eucalyptus forest. Inland forests have been logged, but other large sections—mostly along the southeastern coast—are preserved as the South Bruny National Park. While the seaward side of the island features two long beaches—Adventure Bay and Cloudy Bay—it is for the most part extremely rugged, with cliffs of dolerite over in altitude. Bruny&#x27;s channel side is more sheltered and a favourite fishing and recreational boating area for local and interstate visitors. Adventure Bay is located on the eastern side of the isthmus, while Isthmus Bay is located on the western side.

Access to the island is by vehicular ferry, funded by the State Government. Since 1954, four vessels have operated the Bruny Island Ferry service between the island and Kettering on the mainland. The service currently uses the vessel, &quot;Mirambeena&quot;, which is plied by a Voith-Schneider propulsion system rather than a conventional propeller. There is a public Airfield, Bruny Island Airport located on North Bruny, just north of The Neck, however the small runway is mostly suited to small planes, and there are no scheduled flights.

The d&#x27;Entrecastaux Channel region, sheltered by Bruny Island, is increasingly subject to foreshore erosion. Some areas have begun sandbagging to reduce the effects.

=== Climate ===
Cape Bruny has a cool oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool to mild, relatively dry summers and chilly, wet winters with snowfalls. The island is near-constantly buffeted by cold fronts off the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot;, even through the height of summer. The island is very windy with a mean 3 pm wind speed of ; cloud cover is likewise great, with 242.0 cloudy days and 19.2 clear days annually. 

An extreme event on 15 November 2021 saw a fall of snow to beach level on the island, though historical temperature data indicate this may have also happened prior to that event − and perhaps even in the high summer months. 


==Environment==
Bruny Island is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the world&#x27;s largest population of the endangered forty-spotted pardalote, up to a third of the world population of the swift parrot, all 12 of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic bird species, and up to 240,000 breeding pairs of the short-tailed shearwater (or Tasmanian muttonbird). In March 2021, awareness increased concerning the feral cat population on the island, which had been steadily growing over the last decade. Local residents opened an inquiry into the sudden large number of feral cats, concerned this spike in numbers may have adverse affects on the environment and wildlife. Initial findings suggest the feral cats migrated from the Eastern Shore of Tasmania, namely the Howrah/Tranmere region.

An alternative view taken by some wildlife ecologists is that cats are a naturalized alien species in much of Australia, and the best approach available at present to conserve species on which they predate is to ensure adequately large and intact habitats. Invasive cats may be eradicated on small islands, but some believe complete eradication is impractical at present on islands the size of Bruny. Control methodologies alternative to complete eradication are currently being investigated.

Multiple vegetation types are seen across the island, including wet sclerophyll forest, coastal healthland and dry sclerophyll forests.

== Tourism ==
A key contributor to Bruny Island&#x27;s economy is its growing tourism industry. Being home to the South Bruny National Park, tourism on the island centres on the showcase of its natural assets.

The Cape Bruny Lighthouse, first lit in 1838, is an iconic Australian lighthouse. It was the third lighthouse built in Tasmania, and the fourth in all of Australia, and was the longest continuously staffed lighthouse in the country until it was automated in 1993. It was removed from service in 1996, and became part of the South Bruny National Park in 2000. Guided tours of the structure are available.

In 2010/11, overall visitors to Bruny Island increased 4% to 74,600. The island is primarily a day-trip destination with only 21,800 visitors staying on the island overnight. There are a growing number of tourism businesses on the island including a cheese factory, oyster farm, vineyard, smoke-house, lighthouse, museum, art gallery, two eco-cruises along with various accommodation properties and cafes.

== Localities ==
Bruny Island is divided into eleven bounded localities. The two largest by area are North Bruny and South Bruny which consist of national park, state forest and some grazing areas and do not have postcodes.

On North Bruny there are five populated coastal enclaves: Apollo Bay, Barnes Bay, Dennes Point, Great Bay and Killora. On South Bruny there are four: Adventure Bay, Alonnah, Lunawanna and Simpsons Bay.

<doc id="603618" wikidata="Q11871447" url="?curid=603618" title="Killing Heidi">
<text>Killing Heidi are an Australian rock band, formed in Violet Town, Victoria in 1996, initially as a folk-pop duo by siblings Ella and Jesse Hooper. The band has released three studio albums: &quot;Reflector&quot; (March 2000), which reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, &quot;Present&quot; (October 2002) and &quot;Killing Heidi&quot; (August 2004). Their top 20 singles are &quot;Weir&quot; (October 1999), &quot;Mascara&quot; (November, No. 1 on ARIA Singles Chart), &quot;Live Without It&quot; (April 2000), &quot;Outside of Me&quot; (September 2002) and &quot;I Am&quot; (July 2004). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 they were nominated in seven categories and won four trophies: Album of the Year, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Rock Album for &quot;Reflector&quot;. At the APRA Music Awards of 2001 Ella and Jesse Hooper won Songwriter of the Year. The group disbanded in 2006, with Ella and Jesse taking a lower profile with an acoustic folk duo, The Verses. In 2016, it was announced that the band would be reforming to celebrate its 20th anniversary, and the band have continued to tour since.

Outside of the band, Ella also has a career as a solo performer, radio presenter and TV personality. Jesse, meanwhile, has a career as a music teacher, producer and community arts developer.

==History==

===Early years (1996–1999)===

Killing Heidi were formed in Violet Town in 1996 as an acoustic folk duo by siblings, Ella Hooper on lead vocals and her older brother, Jesse Hooper, on lead guitar. Violet Town is a small Victorian country town, about 175 km northeast of Melbourne with a population of 1084 (in 2011), where their parents were music, English and drama teachers.

In 1996 Ella and Jesse played an early gig at the Violet Town Arts Festival, when Ella was 13 years old and Jess was 15. This gig was supported by the future recipient of the 2001 C.A.S Hawker Scholarship and attorney Stephen Michelson. Ella later described their group as an &quot;acoustic, folky duo with an edge.&quot; The name, Killing Heidi, came from using two lists, before their first gig: one filled with &quot;soft&quot; words (Heidi was selected), one with &quot;harsh&quot; words (Killing). Ella recalled in January 2015 that the name was &quot;a play on the end of innocence and embracing imperfection&quot;: it was chosen to have something to fill in on the Unearthed entry form. Jamie Durrant of Benalla&#x27;s Bent Records caught the festival gig and offered them time in his recording studio.

With two schoolmates as the rhythm section: Aaron Hart on drums and Rowen Murphy on bass guitar; Killing Heidi recorded &quot;Morning&quot; and &quot;Kettle&quot;. These were included on a Bent Records sampler album, &quot;Two Bent&quot;, with additional tracks by the label&#x27;s other artists Spudgun, Stealth and Michael Meeking. Killing Heidi also submitted their recordings to the national radio station, Triple J&#x27;s Unearthed competition in 1996: &quot;Kettle&quot; won the competition for the Goulburn Valley region, alongside a track by Stealth. &quot;Kettle&quot; was written by Ella, Jesse and Brian Walton. The group re-recorded the track at ABC&#x27;s Southbank studios for inclusion on another various artists&#x27; album, &quot;Triple J Unearthed 4&quot;. After winning their section of the Unearthed competition, &quot;Kettle&quot; was placed on high rotation by Triple J.

The group had a gig at the Melbourne Push Over concert in 1996. Paul Kosky, a Melbourne-based engineer-producer, who had worked with Crowded House, Rage Against the Machine, Kate Ceberano, and The Clouds, was looking for a new band to manage and record. Kosky had heard &quot;Kettle&quot; on the radio and decided to check them out at Push Over. In March 2000 Kosky recalled that their rhythm section were musically weak, although the siblings showed &quot;a raw talent I knew could be turned into a global appeal.&quot; The group signed to his management company in 1997 and his new recording label, Wah Wah Music (established with US-based investor, Chris Robinson) in the following year. Kosky helped develop the band for two years and, as their manager, arranged a distribution deal with Roadshow Music (which also had a contract with Savage Garden) for his own label.

By the end of 1997 Killing Heidi had acquired a new rhythm section with Warren Jenkin on bass guitar (Rick Price, Merril Bainbridge, Deborah Conway) and Adam Pedretti on drums (ex-Non-Intentional Lifeform aka NIL). Pendretti described his recruitment, &quot;[Kosky] had worked with NIL as producer, so he knew I could play a little bit off the wall... [he] dropped off a Killing Heidi demo and I started learning the songs. It just took off from there.&quot; Killing Heidi recorded the rest of their first studio album, &quot;Reflector&quot;, throughout 1998 and into 1999. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Kosky was &quot;meticulously shaping the band&#x27;s début album&quot;; he worked as their engineer, producer, talent manager and record label co-owner.

===Commercial success (1999–2003)===

In July 1999 Killing Heidi performed at the Grounded Festival and then launched their first national tour. To coincide with the festival gig they issued their début single, &quot;Weir&quot;, which eventually reached No. 6 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as a &quot;winning mix of quiet/loud acoustic/churning electric guitars, adolescent angst and sing-along pop with a funky mid-section.&quot; Music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt it was &quot;a tale of life after high school.&quot; It was certified platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies by the end of that year.

The second single &quot;Mascara&quot;, about self-image and individuality, was released in November 1999. A five-track maxi-single version, &quot;Mascara&quot;/&quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, followed in January 2000. This version reached the top of the national charts, on 30 January, which was Ella&#x27;s 17th birthday. It stayed at No. 1 for three weeks, and was certified platinum at the end of that year. &quot;Mascara&quot; was accompanied by a music video, which was directed by Kosky. He recalled, &quot;There was some very straight commercial radio that said, &#x27;We will never play this song,&#x27;... I hear that station play it [now] and... We&#x27;ve made a difference, and we&#x27;ve educated them.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot;″s Christie Eliezer reported that Killing Heidi were one of three &quot;major domestic breakouts&quot; in 1999 in Australia, &quot;all released on independent labels&quot;. The other two musical acts were Vanessa Amorosi and Sister2Sister – all three &quot;were still in high school when their records first entered the charts.&quot; Eliezer noticed that Killing Heidi had a &quot;flamboyant, outspoken appeal [that] gained pop, rock, and fashion media coverage.&quot;

&quot;Reflector&quot; was released in March 2000 and had a début at No. 1; it spent seven weeks at the top of the ARIA charts. McFarlane opined that it was &quot;one of the most highly anticipated Australian releases in recent years, it was a remarkably assured début, a mix of spirited pop, big rock riffs and adolescent energy.&quot; Jon Azpri of AllMusic rated it as two out of five stars, he felt their first two singles were &quot;catchy pop hits with just enough of a grrl-rock edge to mollify young audiences. The rest of the album is all over the map.&quot; By the end of 2001, &quot;Reflector&quot; had shipped over 280,000 copies in Australia, being certified 4× platinum. It provided two further singles: &quot;Live Without It&quot; (April 2000) and &quot;Superman Supergirl&quot; (September). The album also charted on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No. 19 with three of its tracks reaching the related singles chart&#x27;s top 50.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 held in October, Killing Heidi received seven nominations and won four categories: Album of the Year, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Rock Album for &quot;Reflector&quot;. The three other nominees were: Single of the Year for &quot;Mascara&quot;, Best Cover Art for Kosky&#x27;s effort on &quot;Reflector&quot; and Highest Selling Album for the latter. At the APRA Music Awards of 2001 Ella and Jesse Hooper won Songwriter of the Year. The group &quot;played a handful of club showcases&quot; in the United States by May 2001, with &quot;Reflector&quot;, appearing in the North American market in March that year. Pendretti opined &quot;It&#x27;d be great to break anywhere, but I don’t think we&#x27;re going to be an overnight success there. I think we&#x27;ve got a lot of hard work to put in, in the states. There&#x27;s a lot of great bands there.&quot;

From mid-2001 the band&#x27;s momentum was reduced when a cyst was found on Ella&#x27;s vocal cords and she underwent throat surgery late that year. Her voice was slow to recover, which &quot;destroyed any confidence she had in her voice.&quot; In November of the following year she said, &quot;I have a rule – no singing before 10am. Nothing comes out, even if I wanted it to. If I&#x27;m on at 10am I have to be up by 8.30am, because it takes a while for my voice to sound human. It&#x27;s like a croaky 80-year-old lady.&quot; The group&#x27;s official website announced in August 2001 that Wah Wah Music had joined with Sony Music Entertainment Australia for their releases. The band continued to work on its second studio album, &quot;Present&quot; (October 2002), which peaked at No. 12. It was co-produced by Kosky and Robinson with Andy Baldwyn and issued on Wah Wah Music/Sony Music Australia. It was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 units in December.

Craig Mathieson of &quot;The Age&quot; saw that &quot;Present&quot; was &quot;a comparative commercial failure&quot;. Peter Holmes of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the album, &quot;a dose of punchy, melodic rock embellished with keyboards, strings, horns, scratching and drum loops. Arguably, however, the highlight is &#x27;Sweet&#x27;, a sunny semi-acoustic singalong.&quot;

&quot;Heavensent&quot; (December 2001), the first single from the album, reached the top 30 in early 2002 even though &quot;live promotion for the track was limited&quot; as Ella recovered. She had had problems, &quot;I knew they would push me to sing... They told me the whole project couldn&#x27;t stop for a year. That much time out was not allowed career-wise. I wanted to say, &#x27;Stop. I know we can do this right, but not now.&#x27; But then we went and did it anyway.&quot; Its second single, &quot;Outside of Me&quot;, which reached a peak of No. 12, appeared in September 2002. A third song from the album, &quot;Ammyl (Say What You Wanna Say)&quot;, was a radio-only release in 2003 – not issued as a physical single.

In 2003 Paul Kosky and the band had an &quot;acrimonious&quot; split; which &quot;almost spelt the end&quot; for the band. According to Mathieson &quot;the band were starting to bristle at the extent of Kosky&#x27;s involvement in every aspect of their stalled career.&quot; Kosky felt he was a scapegoat for problems with the second album including its poorer commercial performance: &quot;Everyone was looking for a fall guy. It happened to be me and I left gracefully. I put my life into it for five years and I gambled a lot. Like any relationship, you find a time when you move on.&quot; Chris Robinson bought out Kosky&#x27;s share of their partnership in Wah Wah Music and became the band&#x27;s new manager.

===Self-titled album (2003–2005)===

In late 2003 the band spent three months in Los Angeles recording their third studio album, &quot;Killing Heidi&quot;. It was produced by John Travis – Mathieson described how &quot;[Travis] proved to be easygoing, and sessions ran much faster because he favoured recording the three instrumentalists playing live and using entire tracks, as opposed to recording each separately and editing together numerous takes to make one technically perfect but often coldly sterile piece.&quot; Tim Cashmere of Undercover felt it was &quot;a huge step in their sound and [they] returned with an album that can compete on a worldwide scale... [by] a band growing into its full potential and while they&#x27;re not quite there yet, they&#x27;ve come a long way, baby!&quot;

Its first single, &quot;I Am&quot;, was released in July 2004, which entered the charts at No. 16. It spent three months in the Top 50 and achieved gold certification. It was used on the Australian version of the feature film soundtrack for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. Matt Holt of &quot;Light of the Quasar&quot; caught their gig in Traralgon: they were &quot;an effervescent and popular group... their music would be to call it poetically rocking. This band performs stadium rock out songs just as well as ballads.&quot;

In late August 2004 the self-titled album appeared with a less styled and more sonically expressive sound. It had a début at No. 7 on the charts, and achieved a gold certification. In September 2004, the second single, &quot;Calm Down&quot;, was issued, which reached No. 23. Early in 2005 a third song, &quot;Running Underwater&quot;, was released to radio, but not as a physical single and received little radio airplay. Later in 2005 Killing Heidi left Sony BMG.

===Hiatus (2006–2016)===

In mid-2006 Killing Heidi&#x27;s MySpace page described the group as taking a break. In July Andrew Tijs of &quot;Undercover.fm News&quot; reported that the group had disbanded. The siblings formed a folk duo, the Verses, and started writing and performing new material for that project. Pedretti formed a heavy metal group, Monster Truck Extravaganza; Jenkin returned to work with Merril Bainbridge as well as &quot;generating electronic music with computers, synthesisers and keyboards.&quot;

In May 2013 Ella reflected on her time with Killing Heidi and the likelihood of any reunion, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could sing such youthful, and youth based songs convincingly any more. It really did just run its natural course and I think it would be very unnatural to start it up again now.&quot; Aside from the Verses, Ella has a career as a solo performer, radio presenter and TV personality. Her brother Jesse would go on to a career as a music teacher, producer and community arts developer.

===Reunion (2016–present)===

In September 2016 it was announced that Killing Heidi would be reuniting to play a series of shows to celebrate their 20th anniversary. The band would perform at the Handpicked Festival, the Kickstart Summer festival and the Queenscliff Music Festival. Although the Hooper siblings and drummer Adam Pedretti participated in the reunion, bassist Warren Jenkin did not. He was replaced by James Gilligan; with the quartet being joined by keyboardist Lena Douglas.

In February 2017, Killing Heidi appeared at Taronga Zoo, Sydney, as part of the annual &quot;Twilight at Taronga&quot; concert series. This was followed by a national Australian tour in June.

In early 2020, Killing Heidi took part in the Australian-wide Red Hot Summer Tour as one of the major performers.

<text>An executor is someone who is responsible for executing, or following through on, an assigned task or duty.
The feminine form, executrix, is sometimes used.

==Executor of will==
An executor is a legal term referring to a person named by the maker of a will or nominated by the testator to carry out the instructions of the will. Typically, the executor is the person responsible for offering the will for probate, although it is not required that they fulfill this. The executor&#x27;s duties also include handing over property to the beneficiaries as designated in the will, obtaining information of potential heirs, collecting and arranging for payment of debts of the estate and approving or disapproving creditors&#x27; claims.

An executor makes sure estate taxes are calculated, necessary forms are filed, and the corresponding payments are made. They also assist the attorney with the estate. Additionally, the executor acts as a legal conveyor who designates where the donations will be sent using the information left in &quot;bequests, &quot;whether they be sent to charity or other organizations. In most circumstances, the executor is the representative of the estate for all purposes, and has the ability to sue or be sued on behalf of the estate.
The executor holds legal title to the estate property, but must not use the title or property for their own benefit, unless permitted by the terms of the will.

A person who deals with a deceased person&#x27;s property without proper authority is known as an executor &quot;de son tort&quot;. Such a person&#x27;s actions can subsequently be ratified by the lawful executors or administrators if the actions do not contradict the substantive provisions of the deceased&#x27;s will or the rights of heirs at law.

If there is no will, a person is said to have died intestate—&quot;without testimony&quot;. As a result, there is no tangible &quot;testimony&quot; to follow, and hence there can be no executor.
If there is no will or the executors named in a will do not wish to act, an administrator of the deceased&#x27;s estate can instead be appointed.
The generic term for executors or administrators is personal representative. In England and Wales, when a person dies intestate in a nursing home, and has no family members who can be traced, those responsible for their care automatically become their executors.

In Scots law, a personal representative of any kind is referred to as an executor, using &quot;executor nominate&quot; to refer to an executor in the English sense and &quot;executor dative&quot; to an administrator in the English sense.

Any person designated as an executor can choose not to administer the estate. In the UK, upon making that choice the designated person can execute a &quot;power reserved&quot; letter, which allows the person to later act as executor if the person named on the grant of probate is removed or is no longer able to act.

===Executor pay===
In some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services, although this amount varies dramatically by jurisdiction. Unless specifically set by the will, this compensation is often determined by what is considered &quot;reasonable&quot; for the effort involved, although in a number of jurisdictions, the amount is instead set as a percentage of the overall estate. For example, in California the executor is entitled to 4% of the first $100K of estate value, 3% of the next $100K, and so on. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the executor is &quot;not&quot; automatically entitled to compensation, although compensation can be directed within the will or on application to a court.

<text>Lucie Désirée Arnaz (born July 17, 1951) is an American actress and singer. She is the daughter of actors Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, and the older sister of actor and musician Desi Arnaz, Jr.

== Early life ==
Lucie Arnaz was born at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of actors Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, and is the sister of actor Desi Arnaz Jr.
She lived for a few years in New York City from the age of 10, and attended St. Vincent Ferrer School, along with her brother, and later attended the Roman Catholic Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
=== Television ===
Having had walk-on roles on her mother&#x27;s previous television series &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, Arnaz made her acting debut in a major role in the series &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; from 1968 to 1974. She played Kim Carter, the daughter of the eponymous Lucy Carter, played by her mother.

Arnaz branched out into television roles independent of her family from the mid-1970s. In 1975, she played murder victim Elizabeth Short in an NBC telefilm of &quot;Who Is the Black Dahlia?&quot;, and she starred with Lyle Waggoner and Tommy Tune in &quot;Welcome to the &quot;World&quot;,&quot; &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; special commemorating the grand opening of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. In 1978, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as Toni Elgin, a woman desperately trying to save her marriage. She has continued to make appearances in a number of popular television series over the years, including &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; (CBS, 1991), and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

Arnaz also had a short-lived series of her own, &quot;The Lucie Arnaz Show&quot;, on CBS in 1985. A reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the show as &quot;the always ingratiating Miss Arnaz as a psychologist who not only writes an advice column, but also takes calls from listeners on her own radio program.&quot;

Another eponymous series, this one a late-night-style talk show, aired for one season from 1995 to 1996. It was unsuccessful, but &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; would use the same format a year later to much greater success, prompting Arnaz&#x27;s agent to pitch a revival that would not be picked up.

Arnaz won an Emmy Award in 1993 for Outstanding Informational Special for her documentary about her parents, &quot;Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie&quot; at the 45th Primetime Emmy Awards.

=== Theatre ===

Arnaz has had a lengthy career in musical theatre. In June 1978 she played the title role of Annie Oakley in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; at the Jones Beach Theatre on Long Island, New York. This was the first production at Jones Beach Theatre after the death of longtime producer Guy Lombardo. In 1981, she played the lead female role of Rita White in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; at The Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts.

She made her Broadway debut in February 1979 in the musical &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;. Arnaz won the Theatre World Award
 and the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Sonia Walsk. In 1986, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her tour with Tommy Tune in the international company of the musical &quot;My One and Only&quot;.

She has numerous other theater credits, both in the United States and abroad: &quot;Seesaw&quot; (first national company, 1974), &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;The Guardsman&quot; (Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, January 1984), &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot; (Concert at Lincoln Center, 1995, televised), &quot;Sonia Flew&quot; (Coconut Grove Playhouse, Florida, April 2006), &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (London, Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, June 2000), &quot;Vanities&quot; (Mark Taper Forum, Los Angeles, 1976 as Kathy), Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; (Broadway), &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (Broadway, May 23, 2006, to September 3, 2006), and Terence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Master Class&quot; (Seacoast Repertory Theatre, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, April to May 1999).

In 2010, Arnaz performed (along with Raúl Esparza and Valarie Pettiford) in and directed &quot;Babalu: A Celebration of the Music of Desi Arnaz and His Orchestra&quot;. A Miami, Florida performance was given in July 2010.

She toured in &quot;Pippin&quot; in 2014, playing the role of Berthe, the title character&#x27;s grandmother. She appeared on Broadway in &quot;Pippin&quot;, from October 9, 2014, to November 9, 2014.

=== Film ===
Arnaz made feature-film appearances, including &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1980) in which she co-starred with Neil Diamond and Laurence Olivier. She earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture at the 38th Golden Globe Awards. She also appeared in the 1982 comedy drama &quot;One More Try&quot; opposite her future husband, Lawrence Luckinbill.

== Other works ==
* Arnaz was a Trustee on the Board of the American Theatre Wing for 15 years (1999–2014).
* In October 2008, Arnaz and longtime family friend, Hollywood columnist and Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne participated in a tribute to Arnaz&#x27;s mother, Lucille Ball, at the Paley Center For Media in New York City. The program, &quot;Lucie and Lucy: Lucie Arnaz Shares Treasures From The Family Video Collection&quot;, included a discussion between Osborne and Arnaz about Ball, and also focused on Ball&#x27;s last long-running series, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (which was celebrating its 40th anniversary), as well as several of Ball&#x27;s television specials and guest appearances during the 1970s, which Arnaz had donated to the Paley Center for Media.

== Preserving Lucille Ball&#x27;s legacy ==
* From about 2002 to 2007, Arnaz was the president of the board of directors of the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center in Jamestown, New York. She resigned over a dispute with the executive director over the future direction of the Center.
* Arnaz appeared live on stage in Jamestown at the Reg Lenna Center for the Arts on August 3, 2012, to promote the Lucille Ball Festival of New Comedy in which new comedians are invited to perform. She gave tribute to both her parents and expressed a desire to further expand the Festival of New Comedy and expand the Jamestown, New York, Lucy Fest. Comedians who performed at the 2012 Festival of New Comedy included Billy Gardell, Paula Poundstone and Tammy Pescatelli. She gave the history behind the Lucy-Desi Museum and Lucy-Desi Playhouse, and the 2011 birthday centenary for Lucille Ball (which was recorded in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the highest number of people dressed like Lucille Ball in one place at one time).
* At that time, Arnaz announced intent to start using the recently renovated Jamestown Train Station to further the mission and vision of the Lucille Ball Festival of New Comedy. Lucie Arnaz praised and appeared on stage with the new executive director of the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center and applauded her work and dedication to the festival. This work culminated in the opening of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown on August 1, 2018.

*In 2021, Arnaz, along with her brother Desi Arnaz Jr., served as an executive producer of the biopic &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin focusing on her parents (played by Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem)&#x27;s professional and personal relationship during the time of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.
== Personal life ==
Arnaz was married to Philip Vandervort Menegaux from July 17, 1971, to April 1976. On June 22, 1980, she married actor-writer Laurence Luckinbill. Luckinbill and Arnaz live in Palm Springs, California.

Arnaz and Luckinbill have three children: Simon, Joseph and Katharine Luckinbill. Luckinbill also has two sons from his previous marriage: Nicholas and Benjamin Luckinbill.

Arnaz attended an all-girls Catholic high school, mainly because of its drama program. She is a member of Unity.

<text>Pnau (stylised in all caps) is an Australian dance music trio originating from Sydney. The trio, a duo before 2016, consists of the musicians Nick Littlemore (vocals, production), Peter Mayes (guitar, production) and Sam Littlemore (production), with the latter joining in 2016. Pnau first gained recognition through their 1999 debut album &quot;Sambanova&quot;, which later won an ARIA Music Awards for Best Dance Release. Their third album, &quot;Pnau&quot; (2007), brought them further critical acclaim and success. Pnau is also recognised for a heavily publicised apprenticeship under the musician Elton John, who signed the duo after listening to the &quot;Pnau&quot; album. Several of Pnau&#x27;s later projects have had John&#x27;s involvement, such as the album &quot;Soft Universe&quot; and an album of Pnau recreations of Elton John&#x27;s hits called &quot;Good Morning to the Night&quot;.

Apart from being a member of Pnau, Nick Littlemore also appears as one half of the project Empire of the Sun. In November 2016, the new line-up released &quot;Chameleon&quot;, the first single from their album &quot;Changa&quot;.

==Biography==
===1990s: Beginnings===
Pnau formed in Sydney, New South Wales by Littlemore and Mayes. The two met at secondary school at the age of 12 and began performing together in the mid-1990s, initially playing acid, house music, and trance music. Littlemore recalled meeting Mayes when he was 10; &quot;He tripped me over. We hated each other for a couple years and then we started sneaking out and going to raves when we were about 13 and we formed a bond over intense music.&quot; Littlemore and Mayes created their first album when they were in their mid-teens. &quot;It was called Fractal Geometric Spaces Made of Light,&quot; Littlemore remembers, &quot;Which is probably why it was never picked up.&quot;

The duo&#x27;s first commercially available tracks were a pair of nine-minute tracks, &quot;Frisk&quot; and &quot;Anthropophagi&quot;, that led off &quot;doof@cybersonic.aust.com&quot; – an underground acid trance compilation album distributed by cult electronic label Creative Vibes in 1996. Pnau would then feature on another Creative Vibes project, 1998&#x27;s compilation record &quot;Evolutionary Vibes III: The Evolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, with the song &quot;Discone&quot;.

===1999–2002: &quot;Sambanova&quot;===

In July 1999, Pnau released their debut album &quot;Sambanova&quot; under the independent label Peking Duck. It was recorded in a bedroom studio and they state they only expected it to sell &quot;a few thousand copies&quot;. The album was pulled from record stores for using uncleared samples, but re-released in June 2000 and peaked inside the ARIA top 40. In October 2000, at the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, the album won Best Dance Release. In a 2003 interview with &quot;The Age&quot;, Mayes said that they had no understanding of sample clearances due to their naïveté in the music business. Mayes claimed that the album&#x27;s recall did seriously affect their commercial sales. Littlemore later contested, &quot;They screwed us over for $300,000. Warners didn&#x27;t; another third party did. But that happens. We&#x27;re still here, we&#x27;re still doing it.&quot;

Pnau went on to make many live appearances at music festivals like Big Day Out in 2001 and Homebake in 2002. During this time, they garnered a reputation for their lively performances.

===2003–2007: &quot;Again&quot;===

In October 2003, Pnau released their second studio album, &quot;Again&quot;. The album was not a commercial success and Littlemore was later quoted as &quot;Again&quot; being &quot;the worst record I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. Littlemore has since retracted the statement. When asked if he still considered &quot;Again&quot; to be his worst record, Littlemore responded, &quot;Well next to &quot;Soft Universe&quot;. They&#x27;re sort of on par.&quot; Littlemore further explained that his opinions are influenced by the albums&#x27; commercial success, which is an easy headspace for him to get into since &quot;everyone loves Empire of the Sun, it&#x27;s sold 1.1 million records.&quot; Despite the seemingly unfavourable album response, several tracks received considerable acclaim - the most noteworthy being &quot;We Love the Fresh Kills&quot; which was a significantly popular single for the duo at the time. However, because of &quot;Again&quot;&#x27;s lackluster success the pair parted ways for some time to work with other artists such as Robbie Williams, Van She, and Lost Valentinos.

===2007–2009: &quot;Pnau&quot; and Empire of the Sun===

In 2007, the duo reunited and wrote over two-hundred songs together and started to lay down an entire album with Littlemore&#x27;s brother Sam as producer. They sent a work-in-progress track to long-time friend and collaborator Luke Steele, who sent back the track with his own vocals. After receiving the track, the Littlemore brothers and Mayes agreed to scrap almost everything they had laid down to focus on a more vocally centred album. The track became known as &quot;With You Forever&quot; and the finalised album was released under the self-titled name &quot;Pnau&quot;. The album not only featured vocal work from Steele and Littlemore, but also had many guest appearances such as Ladyhawke, Feadz, Nik Yannika from Lost Valentinos and Michael DeFrancesco from Van She. The album was released to high critical acclaim and gained unexpected favorable attention from John, declaring it to be the greatest record he&#x27;d heard in ten years.

Inspired by their track &quot;With You Forever&quot;, Pnau began work on a collaboration with Steele, which would call themselves Empire of the Sun. Originally titled Steelemore, Empire of the Sun released its debut single in August 2008 titled &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot; and its debut album in October 2008 with &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot;. Littlemore and Steele took the roles of bandmates, while Mayes assumed the role of producer. Some critics were quick to note that the band sounded more like a work of Pnau than Steele&#x27;s band The Sleepy Jackson. Empire of the Sun has achieved international success having been certified 2× Platinum in Australia and gold in the United Kingdom, as well as winning eleven ARIA awards. PNAU makes it clear on their Myspace numerous times that not only is Empire of the Sun a side project of theirs, but that they are also the producers. Regarding Empire of the Sun, in early 2009 news began appearing that Littlemore had disappeared. The reality had been that Nick Littlemore had left Empire of the Sun to begin work on the fourth Pnau album along with John.

===2010–2011: &quot;Soft Universe&quot;===

In 2010, Pnau&#x27;s track &quot;Baby&quot; (remixed by Breakbot) appeared in the release of Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, in the Background Music (BGM) playlist.

In February 2011, Pnau released &quot;The Truth&quot;, the lead single from their forthcoming fourth studio album, &quot;Soft Universe&quot;. &quot;Soft Universe&quot; was released in June 2011 and peaked at number 13 on the ARIA Charts. Littlemore has described it as a very &quot;emotional&quot; album, inspired by the breakup with his long-time girlfriend. With input from John, the album features Littlemore singing all the vocals on the album along with tracks co-written with fellow Aussie artist Martin Craft and producer Mark Saunders. The album was positively received, although mainly critics expressed discontent with the lack of the &quot;endearing weirdness of previous Pnau and Empire releases.&quot; The &quot;Soft Universe&quot; album received the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Best Independent Dance/Electronica Album.

===2012–2015: &quot;Good Morning to the Night&quot;===

On 10 March 2012, the first remix track from the anticipated, upcoming John rework album commissioned for Pnau was leaked, initially airing on Pete Tong&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 broadcast. In July 2012 two singles were released from the album, &quot;Good Morning to the Night&quot; and &quot;Sad&quot;, while the album &quot;Good Morning to the Night&quot; was released and reaching number 1 on the UK Albums Chart.

In November 2013 French duo Faul &amp; Wad Ad released &quot;Changes&quot; credited to, vs Pnau. The song samples Pnau&#x27;s &quot;Baby&quot; and reached the top ten in numerous countries across Europe.

===2016–2018: &quot;Changa&quot;===

In November 2016, Pnau released &quot;Chameleon&quot; as the lead single from the upcoming fifth studio album. The song peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts and was certified 4× platinum. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2017, the song won the groups their second ARIA Award for Best Dance Release. &quot;Changa&quot; was released in November 2017 and peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts. The album spawned two more singles &quot;Go Bang&quot; and &quot;Changa&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, &quot;Go Bang&quot; won the group&#x27;s third ARIA Award for Best Dance Release.

===2019–present: &quot;Hyperbolic&quot; ===

The band released the single &quot;Solid Gold&quot; on 2 May 2019. The song continues Pnau&#x27;s collaboration with Kira Divine on vocals, and also features additional vocals by Marques Toliver. The band hosted a live chat on their Facebook page to support the release. In August 2019, the band released the single &quot;All of Us&quot;. In December 2020, the band worked with Ladyhawke again and released the single &quot;River&quot;.

In August 2021, Pnau produced a remix medley of several John songs along with Dua Lipa, titled &quot;Cold Heart (Pnau remix)&quot;. The single charted in many countries worldwide, becoming their 3rd top 10 in Australia and their second in the UK, as well as their first song to chart in the US. Over the next few years, Pnau released singles with Budjerah, Troye Sivan, Khalid, Bebe Rexha and Ozuna.

In October 2023, Pnau released &quot;AEIOU&quot; with Empire of the Sun and announced the titled of their sixth studio album, &quot;Hyperbolic&quot;, scheduled for release in March 2024.

<text>Mapai (, an abbreviation for , &quot;Mifleget Poalei Eretz Yisrael&quot;, ) was a Labor Zionist and democratic socialist political party in Israel, and was the dominant force in Israeli politics until its merger into the Israeli Labor Party in January 1968. During Mapai&#x27;s time in office, a wide range of progressive reforms were carried out, as characterised by the establishment of a welfare state, providing minimum income, security, and free (or almost free) access to housing subsidies and health and social services.

==History==
The party was founded on 5 January 1930 by the merger of the Hapoel Hatzair founded by A. D. Gordon and the original Ahdut HaAvoda (founded in 1919 from the right, more moderate, wing of the Zionist socialist Poale Zion led by David Ben-Gurion). In the early 1920s, the Labor Zionist movement had founded the Histadrut Union, which dominated the Hebrew settlement economy and infrastructure, later making Mapai the dominant political faction in Zionist politics. It was also responsible for the founding of Hashomer and Haganah, the first two armed Jewish groups which secured the people and property of the new and emerging Jewish communities. By the early 1930s, Ben-Gurion had taken over the party, and had become de facto leader of the Jewish community in Palestine (known as the Yishuv). It was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1930 and 1940.

The party was Jewish-only until the late 1960s, with a succession of satellite parties for Israeli Arabs, including the Democratic List of Nazareth, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Agriculture and Development, Progress and Work, Cooperation and Brotherhood, Progress and Development and Cooperation and Development. It supported the policy of subjecting Arab citizens to martial law, which included confining them to the towns of their residence, and allowing them to exit only with a permit granted by the Israeli authorities.

==Politics and government==

Due to its role in emerging victorious and independent from the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the party won large support in Israel&#x27;s first elections in 1949, receiving 36% of the vote (well ahead of second-placed Mapam&#x27;s 15%) and winning 46 of the 120 seats. Ben-Gurion became Prime Minister and formed a coalition with the United Religious Front, the Progressive Party, the Sephardim and Oriental Communities and the Democratic List of Nazareth (an Israeli Arab party associated with Mapai). A notable piece of legislation enacted during Mapai&#x27;s first term in office was an educational law in 1949 which introduced compulsory schooling for all children between the ages of 5 and 14. Mapai&#x27;s years in office also witnessed the passage of the National Insurance Act of 1953 and the Social Welfare Service Law of 1958, which authorised a broad range of social welfare programmes, including special allowances for large families, workers&#x27; compensation provisions, maternity insurance, and old age and survivors&#x27; pensions.

In the second elections in 1951 Mapai increased its vote share to 37% (and 47 seats) despite the country&#x27;s economic problems. Ben-Gurion again formed the government with the support of Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, Agudat Yisrael, Poalei Agudat Yisrael and the three Israeli Arab parties associated with Mapai, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. However, he shocked the nation by resigning on 6 December 1953 in order to settle in the small Negev kibbutz of Sde Boker, and was replaced by Moshe Sharett.

The 1955 elections saw a drop in the party&#x27;s support to 32% (and 40 seats), though still well ahead of the second-placed Herut (13%). Ben Gurion returned as Prime Minister, and formed a coalition with the National Religious Front (which later changed its name to the National Religious Party), Mapam, Ahdut HaAvoda, and the three Israeli Arab parties, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. Later the Progressive Party was also added.

In contrast to the previous one, the 1959 election saw a surge in support, as the party recorded its best electoral performance, taking 38% of the vote and 47 seats. Ben-Gurion again invited the National Religious Party, Mapam, Ahdut HaAvoda, the Progressive Party and the three Israeli Arab parties, Progress and Development, Cooperation and Brotherhood and Agriculture and Development to form the coalition.

The inquiry into the Lavon Affair which brought down the government in 1961 probably contributed to the party&#x27;s relatively poor performance in the elections in the same year, as it picked up only 35% of the vote and 42 seats. Although Ben-Gurion formed a strong coalition with the National Religious Party, Ahdut HaAvoda, Agudat Yisrael Workers, Cooperation and Brotherhood and Progress and Development, two events during the fifth Knesset led to Mapai&#x27;s reducing dominance.

Firstly, Ben-Gurion resigned as head of the party citing personal reasons, though in reality he was upset at a perceived lack of support from colleagues. He set up a new party, Rafi, taking with him seven other Mapai members. Secondly, the two major right-wing opposition parties, Herut and the Liberal Party had merged into Gahal. This meant by the end of the Knesset session, Mapai had only 34 seats to Gahal&#x27;s 27.

The party&#x27;s response to the unprecedented strength of the opposition was to seek support from other parties with similar ideologies. The result was an alliance with Ahdut HaAvoda to form the Labor Alignment before the 1965 election. The new party received 37% of the vote and won 45 seats, and comfortably beat Gahal (26 seats). On 23 January 1968 Mapai, Ahdut HaAvoda and Rafi merged into the Israeli Labor Party and ceased to exist as individual entities.

==Party leaders==
===General Secretaries===
*1930–1954 – David Ben-Gurion
*1954–1955 – Moshe Sharett
*1955–1963 – David Ben-Gurion
*1963–1968 – Levi Eshkol

===Selection of party leaders===
Until 1963, the party had no formal rules to govern the selection of its leader. From the party&#x27;s establishment, David Ben-Gurion was long the unchallenged leader of the party. Even in his brief 1954–1955 retirement (during which Moshe Sharett served as the official party leader), Ben-Gurion was still largely considered the de facto party boss. After Ben-Gurion retired again in 1963, informal consultations by the party&#x27;s leading figures resulted in an informal consensus to appoint Levi Eshkol as leader, and this choice was ratified by the party&#x27;s Central Committee. Soon after becoming party leader, Eshkol successfully pushed the party to amend its constitution to state that the party&#x27;s candidate for the office of prime minister (its leader) would be selected by the party&#x27;s Central Committee. Thus, when Ben-Gurion unsuccessfully attempted to retake party leadership in 1965, there was a formal leadership election held by a vote of the party&#x27;s Central Committee.

<text>Ğabdulla Möxəmmətğərif ulı Tuqay () was a Volga Tatar poet, critic, publisher, and towering figure of Tatar literature. Tuqay is often referred to as the founder of modern Tatar literature and the modern Tatar literary language, which replaced Old Tatar.

==Early life==
Ğabdulla Tuqay (Tuqayev) was born in the family of the hereditary village mullah of Quşlawıç, Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire (current Tatarstan, Russia) near the modern town of Arsk. His father, Möxəmmətğərif Möxəmmətğəlim ulı Tuqayev, had been a village &quot;mandative mullah&quot; since 1864. In 1885 his wife died, leaving him a son and a daughter, and Möxəmmətğarif married second wife, Məmdüdə, daughter of Öçile village mullah Zinnətulla Zəynepbəşir ulı. On 29 August O.S. Möxəmmətğərif died when Ğabdulla was five months old. Soon Ğabdulla&#x27;s grandfather also died and Məmdüdə was forced to return to her father and then to marry the mullah of the village of Sasna. Little Ğabdulla lived for some time with an old woman in his native village, before his new stepfather agreed to take Tuqay into his family. Tuqay&#x27;s relatively happy childhood did not last long: on O.S. 18 January 1890 Ğabdulla&#x27;s mother Məmdüdə also died, and Tuqay was removed to his poor grandfather Zinnətulla. Lacking enough food even for his own children, his grandfather sent Ğabdulla to Kazan with a coachman. There the coachman took Tuqay to a market-place, Peçən Bazaar, hoping to find someone willing to adopt the child. A tanner named Möxəmmətwəli and his wife Ğəzizə from the Yaña-Bistə area of Kazan decided to take care of him. While living in Kazan, Tuqay was taken ill with walleye. In 1892, when both of Ğabdulla&#x27;s adoptive parents became sick they had to send him back to his grandfather. This time, Ğabdulla&#x27;s grandfather sent the child for further adoption to the village of Qırlay, where Ğabdulla stayed with the family of a peasant Səğdi. During his stay with this family, Ğabdulla was sent to the local madrassah (religious school), for the first time in his life, where, in his own words, his enlightenment began.

In the fall of 1895, the Ğosmanovs, Tatar merchants living in Uralsk, decided to adopt their distant relatives, because their own children had died. Ğaliəsğar Ğosmanov and his wife Ğəzizə, Ğabdulla&#x27;s aunt, asked a peasant from Quşlawıç to bring them Ğabdulla. The peasant took ten-year-old Tuqay away from Səğdi, threatening him with Russian papers and the village constable. Living in Uralsk, Ğabdulla attended to &quot;Motıyğiya&quot; madrassah. Simultaneously, in 1896, he started to attend a Russian school. There, for the first time in his life, he became acquainted with the world of Russian literature and started to write poetry. In 1899 the anniversary of Alexander Pushkin was widely celebrated in Uralsk, an event which inspired Tuqay&#x27;s interest in Russian poetry, especially works by Pushkin.

Ğosmanov tried to interest Ğabdulla in his work, but Tuqay stayed indifferent to the merchant&#x27;s lot, preferring to develop his education. On 30 July 1900 Ğaliəsğar Ğosmanov died of &quot;stomach diseases&quot;, so Tuqay moved into the madrassah itself, living first in common room, and two years later in a &quot;khujra&quot;, an individual cell. In the madrassah Tuqay proved himself a diligent student, completing in ten years a program intended for fifteen. However, he continued to live in poverty.

By 1902, Ğabdulla, age 16, had changed his nature. He lost interest in studying the Qur&#x27;an, and showed criticism to all that was taught in madrassah. He didn&#x27;t shave his hair, he drank beer and even smoked. At the same time, he became more interested in poetry.

==Literary life==

===Uralsk period===
Beginning in his madrassah years, Tuqay was interested in folklore and popular poetry, and he asked shakirds, coming for different jobs all over Idel-Ural during summer vacations, to collect local songs, examples of &quot;bəyet&quot;, i.e. epic poem and fairy-tales. In the madrassah itself he became familiar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish poetry, as well as poetry in the Old Tatar language of the earlier centuries. In 1900 &quot;Motıyğiya&quot; graduate, a Tatar poet Mirxəydər Çulpani visited the madrassah. Ğabdulla met him and Çulpaní became the first living poet to impress Tuqay. Çulpaní wrote in &quot;elevated style&quot;, using &quot;aruz&quot;, an Oriental poetic system, and mostly in Old Tatar language, full of Arab, Persian and Turkish words, and rather distant from the Tatar language itself. In 1902–1903 he met a Turkish poet Abdülveli, concealed himself there from Abdul Hamid II pursuits. Thus, Tuqay adopted Oriental poetic tradition.

Young teacher, the son of headmaster, Kamil &quot;Motıyği&quot; Töxfətullin, organized wallpaper &quot;Məğarif&quot; (&quot;The Education&quot;) and hand-written journals. The first odes of Tuqay were published there, and he was referred as &quot;the first poet of the madrassah&quot;.

In 1904 Motíğí founded his own publishing company, and Tuqay became clerk there. He combined this job with teaching younger shakirds in the madrassah. He introduced new methods, typical for the Russian school.

After the October Manifesto of 1905 it became possible to publish newspapers in the Tatar language, which was strictly forbidden earlier. However, Motıyği wasn&#x27;t enough solvent to open his own newspaper, so he bought the Russian language newspaper &quot;Uralets&quot; with typography, to print also a Tatar newspaper there. Tuqay became a typesetter. The newspaper was named &quot;Fiker&quot; (&quot;The Thought&quot;). Then Motıyği started to issue &quot;Əlğəsrəlcadid&quot; (&quot;The New Century&quot;) magazine. Tuqay sent his first verses there to be published. At the same time he started writing for a newspaper and began participating in the publishing of several Tatar magazines. At day Tuqay worked in typography (he was already a proofreader), but by nights he wrote verses, so every issue of &quot;Fiker&quot;, &quot;Nur&quot; and &quot;Əlğəsrəlcadid&quot; contains his writing. More over, he wrote articles, novels and feuilletons for those periodicals, he translated Krylov fables for the magazine. It is also known that Tuqay spread social-democratic leaflets and translated social-democratic brochure to the Tatar language.

Despite social-democrats&#x27; negative attitude towards the Manifesto, in his verses Tuqay admired with Manifesto, believing in the progressive changes of the Tatar lifestyle. During that period he shared his views with liberals, as the long-standing tradition of the Tatar enlightenment didn&#x27;t distinguish national-liberation movement from the class struggle and negated the class struggle within Tatar nation. The most prominent writings of that period are &quot;Millətə&quot; (&quot;To the Nation&quot;) poem and &quot;Bezneñ millət, ülgənme, əllə yoqlağan ğınamı?&quot; (&quot;Has our nation dead, or just sleeps?&quot;) article. Since the satirical magazine &quot;Uqlar&quot; (&quot;The Arrows&quot;) appeared in Uralsk, Tuqay renowned himself as satirist. The main target of his jeers was Muslim clergy, who stayed opposed to progress and Europeanization. As for the language of the most of his verses, it still stayed the Old Tatar language and continued the Oriental traditions, such as in &quot;Puşkinə&quot; (&quot;To Pushkin&quot;). However, in some of them, directed to the Tatar peasantry a pure Tatar was used, what was newly for the Tatar poetry.

In January 1906 police conducted a search of the typography, as rebellious articles were published in the newspaper. The First State Duma was dismissed, the revolution came to naught. The ultra-right Russian nationalists from the Black Hundred proposed that Tatars emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. That period his most prominent verses devoted to the social themes and patriotism were composed: &quot;Gosudarstvennaya Dumağa&quot; (&quot;To the State Duma&quot;), &quot;Sorıqortlarğa&quot; (&quot;To the Parasites&quot;) and &quot;Kitmibez!&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t leave!&quot;). Tuqay was disappointed in liberalism and sympathized with socialists, especially Esers. In &quot;Kitmibez!&quot; he answered to the Black Hundred that the Tatars are a brother people of the Russians and immigration to Turkey is impossible.

On 6 January 1907, Tuqay left madrassah, as his fee permitted him to live independently, and settled in a hotel room. He became an actual editor of &quot;Uqlar&quot;, being the lead poet and publicist of all Motıyği&#x27;s periodicals. That time liberal &quot;Fiker&quot; and Tuqay himself was in confrontation with Qadimist, i.e. ultraconservative &quot;Bayan al-Xaq&quot;, which even called for pogrom of liberal press activists. However, that year he was surprisingly discharged, as the result of the conflict with Kamil Motıyği and instigation of the typography workers for a strike to raise a salary. On 22 February 1907, Motıyği was deprived of publishing rights and his publishers was sold to merchant, who attracted Tuqay to the work again, but sonly dismissed the periodicals.

That time Tuqay departed from the social-democrats and politics generally, preferring to devote himself to poetry. Since mid-1906 to autumn 1907 more than 50 verses were written, as well as 40 articles and feuilletons. That time he turned to a pure Tatar, using a spoken language. Impressed by Pushkin&#x27;s fairy-tale poem &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;, Tuqay wrote his first poem, &quot;Şürəle&quot;.

It is known, that Motıyği tried to establish another newspaper, &quot;Yaña Tormış&quot; (&quot;The New Life&quot;) in Uralsk, with Tuqay as one of constitutors, but that time Ğabdulla was already so popular in the Tatar society, that chief editors from Kazan, the Tatar cultural capital, offered him job. Moreover, Tuqay should be examined by a draft board in his native uyezd, and he left Uralsk anyway. The admiration with the future trends of his life in Kazan is expressed in &quot;Par at&quot; (&quot;The Pair of Horses&quot;), which consequently became the most associated with Kazan Tatar verse.

===Kazan period===

Just after the arrival to Kazan, Tuqay stayed at &quot;Bolğar&quot; hotel and met Tatar literature intelligentsia, such as playwright and &quot;Yoldız&quot; newspaper secretary Ğəliəsğar Kamal and prominent Tatar poet and &quot;Tañ yoldızı&quot; newspaper chief editor Səğit Rəmiev. Several days after he left Kazan to be examined by a draft board, assembly point being in Ətnə village. There he was discarded due his poor health and walleye and freed up of serving in the Imperial Russian Army. He returned to Kazan and renowned his literature and publishing activity.

He was adopted to the editorial staff of democratically oriented &quot;Əl-İslax&quot; gazette, led by Fatix Əmirxan and Wafa Bəxtiyərev. However, the newspaper had a little budget. Tuqay had got fixed up as a forwarding agent in &quot;Kitap&quot; publishers, to provide guaranteed wage. Moreover, he refused offer from &quot;Əxbar&quot;, an organ of Ittifaq al-Muslimin, a political party, close to Kadets, as well as other offers from rich, but right-wing newspapers. He also continued self-education: read Russian classics, critiques, and studied German language. He was interested in studying the life of common people by visiting bazaars and pubs.

Tuqay&#x27;s room in &quot;Bolğar&quot; hotel was frequently visited by admirers from &quot;gilded youth&quot;. As he wrote, their boozing-up impeded him and his creation. Nevertheless, in the end of 1907–1908 he wrote nearby sixty verses and twenty articles in &quot;Əl-İslax&quot; and satirical journal &quot;Yäşen&quot; (&quot;The Illumination&quot;), and also published two books of verses. The most prominent satire of that period was &quot;Peçən Bazarı yaxud Yaña Kisekbaş&quot; (&quot;The Hay Bazaar or New Kişekbaş&quot;), deriding problems of the Tatar society of the period, clergy and merchant class.

As for Tuqay&#x27;s personal life, there is known little about it. As usual he avoided women in his circle. It is known that he was enamored of Zəytünə Məwlüdova, his 15-year-old admirer. Several verses were devoted to Zəytünə and their feelings, such as &quot;A Strange Love&quot;. However, later Tuqay did not develop their relations, and the possible reason was inferiority complex, attributed to his health and financial position.

In May 1908 an article, comparing Tuqay&#x27;s, Rəmiev&#x27;s and Majit Ghafuri&#x27;s poetries was published in Russian-language &quot;Volzhsko-Kamsky Vestnik&quot;. In August 1908 Kamal founded satirical journal &quot;Yəşen&quot; under Tuqay&#x27;s pressure. The most of published works were written by Tuqay, of course. In August 1908 Kamal and Tuqay visit the Makaryev Fair, placed in Nizhny Novgorod. There Tuqay temporarily joined the first Tatar theatre troupe, &quot;Səyər&quot;, singing national songs and declaiming his verses from scene. On 14 October Ğabdulla Tuqay presented his new satirical poem &quot;The Hay Bazaar or New Kisekbaş&quot;, based on classical Old Tatar poem &quot;Kisekbaş&quot;. In own poem he derided nationalism among Tatars, as well as Wəisi sect&#x27;s fanatics, associating sect&#x27;s leader, Ğaynan Wəisev with Diü, an evil spirit from &quot;Kisekbaş&quot;.

===1909–1910 crisis===

In 1909–1910 all freedoms, gained by 1905 revolution came to naught under Stolypin&#x27;s policy. As a result, leftist sympathized Ğabdulla Tuqay was nearly disappointed in his activity and was in depression. Another reason was in his friends, moved to rightist newspapers, like Kamal and Rəmiev. The most of his verses were depressive, however, Tuqay stayed productive, he published nearby hundred verses, two fairy tale poems, autobiography, and an article about Tatar folklore (&quot;Xalıq ədəbiəte&quot;, i.e. &quot;Folk Literature&quot;), wrote thirty feuilletons and printed twenty books, not only with own poems, but also compiled of folk songs.

In those years Tuqay became staunch leftist, despite his staying with a bourgeois family for some time: &quot;Əl-İslax&quot; became a leftist political newspaper only, Tuqay criticized all his former friends, turned to the right or liberal newspapers: Zarif Bəşiri from Oremburgean &quot;Çükeç&quot; and Səğit Rəmiev from &quot;Bəyənelxaq&quot;. He called them bourgeoisie&#x27;s stooges, in response their stigmatized Tuqay Russophile. The same time Okhrana reported his poems as Russophobic. Also Tuqay became closer to the first Tatar Marxist, Xösəyen Yamaşev.

In June 1909 &quot;Yəşen&quot;, was closed due to financial problems as well as censorship requirement, as well as &quot;Əl-İslax&quot;. Being at the top of his crisis, he thinks about suicide, but since March 1910 a new satirical magazine, &quot;Yal-Yolt&quot; (&quot;The Lightning&quot;) was published in Kazan under Əxmət Urmançiev.

Being interested in Leo Tolstoy ideas and legacy, Tuqay felt keenly the death of the Russian genius. Pointing out a high role of children&#x27;s education, he prepared two books for children, and two schoolbooks of Tatar literature. In total, he composed more than fifty verses and seven poems for children.

=== Ufa – Saint-Petersburg – Troitsk ===

In 1911 Qadimist forces allied with Okhrana fulminated &quot;İj-Bubí&quot;, the most progressive Tatar madrassah. This fact filled with indignation all Tatar intelligentsia. But it was only a beginning of campaign drive against Tatar democracy, which became Tuqay&#x27;s tragedy again. However, as it known from Tuqay&#x27;s letters to his friend Səğit Sönçələy, he decided to write the Tatar Eugene Onegin, but he had to recover his health. He planned a trip to the southern regions to receive kumiss therapy there.

In April he left Kazan and had a voyage by the Volga to Astrakhan. There he met Rämiev and became reconciled with him. Three weeks later he moved to Kalmyk Bazary village and stayed with schoolteacher Şahit Ğayfi there. As Ğayfi was interested in photography, they shot a series of cards, devoted to Tuqay&#x27;s poems and the Tatar theatre. Returning to Kazan, he published, &quot;Miyəwbikä&quot; (&quot;Pussycat&quot;), his prominent poem for children. There he applied new poetic methods, and was criticized therefore. He also was interested to publish his prohibited verses in the newspaper of the Russian Muslims, published in Paris, but later he refused of this idea, as the newspaper propagated pan-Islamist ideas.

In autumn 1911 a famine stroke Idel-Ural. &quot;The Autumn Wind&quot; was devoted to the famine and hard lot of peasantry. Tuqay felt ill with malaria and unfortunately moved to cold hotel number. So, he abandoned all and moved to Öçile, to his relatives. There he passed winter, writing o recomposing his verses, sometimes sending new feuilletons to the editors. Possible, another reason of his departure was a trial of his book, published as early as in 1907. He returned in February 1912. In March 1912 his friend, Yamaşev dead of infarction and Tuqay devoted a feeling poem (&quot;Xörmətle Xösəyen yədkâre&quot;, i.e. &quot;Of Blessed Memory of Xösəyen&quot;) to the first Tatar Marxist.

In April Ğabdulla Tuqay went on a tour again. First he arrived to Ufa, where he met Məcit Ğafuri. Then he left Ufa and moved to Saint-Petersburg. He stayed with Musa Bigiev. In Saint Petersburg he met with local Tatar diaspora&#x27;s youth, many of whom were students and leftist activists. The impression of them is expressed in &quot;The Tatar Youth&quot; (&quot;Tatar yəşläre&quot;) verse, full of optimism. However, he didn&#x27;t know that he has the last stage of tuberculosis: a doctor, examined him in Saint Petersburg, preferred to keep diagnosis back. He was advised to take a course in Switzerland, but he refused and after farewell party moved to Ufa again, and then to Troitsk. There he lived till July 1912 among the Kazakh nomads in the steppe, receiving kumiss therapy.

===Death===
His last year he began full of optimism: the revolutionary tendencies rose, and social theme appeared in his poetry again. In &quot;Añ&quot; (&quot;The Consciousness&quot;) and &quot;Dahigə&quot; (&quot;To the Genius&quot;) he wrote that his struggle, as well as the 1905 revolution, was not vain. Many verses were devoted to the peasantry&#x27;s problems, resembling Nekrasov&#x27;s poetry. More and more verses were banned; some of them were only published after the October Revolution. However, Tuqay was criticized by Ğəlimcan İbrahimov, that now his poetry worsened.

In summer 1912 he published his last book, &quot;The Mental Food&quot;, a collection of 43 verses and one poem. But then his health deteriorated. In spite of this, he found energy to write for the new literature magazine &quot;Añ&quot; and the democratic newspaper &quot;Qoyaş&quot; (&quot;The Sun&quot;), edited by Fatix Əmirxan. As Əmirxan was paralyzed, they stayed in neighboring rooms of the Amur Hotel, where the editorial board was situated. In the first days of 1913 he wrote &quot;The Frost&quot;, a witty poem depicting how Kazaners of different social classes behave during frost. The next notable poem was devoted to the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. The poem was rather panegyrical, as was the vulgar-sociological critique of the early 1920s, based on this poem, proclaimed Tuqay to be a pan-Islamist and Tsarist. However, the end of the verse is written not about Tsar&#x27;s dynasty, but about internationalism within Russian and eternal friendship of Tatars and Russians.

On 26 February 1913, Ğabdulla Tuqay was hospitalized due to a severe case of tuberculosis. Even in the Klyachkinskaya hospital he never stopped writing poems for Tatar newspapers and magazines. Those poems were both social and philosophical. In March he wrote his literary testament, &quot;The First Deed after the Awakening&quot;. In hospital Tuqay became interested in Tolstoy&#x27;s legacy again, devoting to him two verses. He read more about Volga Bulgaria&#x27;s history as well as all Kazan periods.
On 15 April of the same year, Ğabdulla Tuqay died at the age of 26 and was buried in Tatar cemetery. 

==Legacy==
Despite the denial of Tuqay&#x27;s genius during the early Soviet years, he soon became known as the greatest Tatar poet. His name transcended across the arts, with the Tatar State Symphony Orchestra dedicated to Tuqay&#x27;s name. During the Soviet rule his most cited were his social poems, whereas now the most popular are poems about Tatarstan nature, Tatar national culture, music, history and, of course, the Tatar language. 26 April, his birthday, is celebrated as &quot;The Day of Tatar Language&quot;, and his poem &quot;İ, Tuğan tel&quot; (&quot;Oh My Mother Tongue!&quot;) is the unofficial hymn of the Tatar language.

In 2019 Kazan International Airport was renamed to commemorate Ğabdulla Tuqay.

One of the most famous works after Almaz Monasypov, &quot;In the rhythms of Tuqay&quot; (1975) (, ) is written on Tuqay&#x27;s poems.

Mintimer Shaymiev, the former President of Tatarstan, remembers Tuqay as follows: &quot;Holding A. Pushkin and M. Lermontov, classics of the high Russian literature, as his teachers and using his poetic language, Tuqay managed to bring to the Tatars timeless cultural values that join and unite our nations. Over one hundred years since first Tuqay&#x27;s works were published his poetry has become the treasure of not only Tatar and Russian but also world culture&quot;.

Professor Michael Friedrich: &quot;Tatar literature was a model for other Russia’s Turkic nations too. Even poets Abai and Gafur Gulom were idolized with implied reference to Tuqay. Russia’s Turkic nations perceived Russian and European literature through interaction with the Tatars&quot;.

<text>Gerling were an Australian electronica, alternative rock trio formed in 1993. From early 1997 the members were Darren Cross on guitar and lead vocals, Presser (real name Paul Towner) on drums and Burke Reid on guitar and vocals. Their second album, &quot;When Young Terrorists Chase the Sun&quot; (September 2001), reached the ARIA Albums Chart top50. It provided a top50 single, &quot;Dust Me Selecta&quot; (August 2001). The group disbanded in 2007.

==History==
Gerling were formed as a guitar pop trio in 1993 in western Sydney with the line-up of Darren Cross (aka Darren E. Spielberg-Cross) on guitar and lead vocals, Presser (real name Paul Towner) on drums and Brad Herdson on guitar and vocals. With only two guitars and drums, the group initially played cover versions of W.A.S.P. material. Then they focussed on creating experimental guitar pop, with their debut single, &quot;Sedatives for Dead Radars&quot;, issued in 1995 on Steven Stavrakis&#x27; Fellaheen label.

It was followed by a seven-track extended play, &quot;A Day of Research&quot;, in 1996. It reached No.13 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was a &quot;mix of early Pavement-style lo-fi guitar pop and idiosyncratic backing, it garnered widespread interest among the indie cognoscenti.&quot; Some of its tracks received high rotation on national youth radio station, Triple J.

Early in 1997 Herdson left to form Sonic Emotion Explosion, with Liz Payne from Spdfgh. He was temporarily replaced in Gerling by Ben Lee for their gig at Big Day Out, Sydney, in late January. Herdson&#x27;s long-term replacement, on guitar, was Canadian-born, Burke Reid. In February 1998 the group issued a four-track 7-inch EP, &quot;Bachelor Pad&quot; on the Trifekta label. The label had been partly established in the previous year by Towner.

In October 1998 they issued, &quot;Death to the Apple Gerls&quot;, on Festival&#x27;s in-house indie label Reliant – which was set up by Bruce Milne (former CEO of Au Go Go Records). In the following month they released their debut album, &quot;Children of Telepathic Experiences&quot;, which peaked at No.21 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. McFarlane noticed &quot;an entertaining mix of Gerling&#x27;s live punky-pop sound and a background of layered electronica.&quot; For the first time the group incorporated electronica in their music, they also built a recording studio, Gerlog, in Alexandria where band members produced and remixed tracks.

Their next single, &quot;Enter, Space Capsule&quot; (April 1999), provided four versions of the song, including one at Gerlog by band members and one mixed by Josh Abrahams. McFarlane saw this as the group&#x27;s &quot;move deeper into the realms of abstract electronica.&quot; At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 Gerling were nominated in three categories: Breakthrough Artist – Album and ARIA Award for Best Alternative Release for &quot;Children of Telepathic Experiences&quot; and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Enter, Space Capsule&quot;. Another single, &quot;Ghost Patrol&quot;, followed in September, which featured guest lead vocals by Naoko Matsumoto of Sydney-based group Funky Terrorist.

During 2000 they toured the United Kingdom where they recorded, &quot;G-House Project&quot;, with lead vocals provided by Kylie Minogue. Gerling issued a single late in the year, &quot;The Deer in You&quot;, which peaked at No.12 on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart. Cameron Webb of Oz Music Project described as &quot;Hovering somewhere between the frantic mesh of screaming and guitars of &#x27;Death to the Apple Gerls&#x27; and electro blips and beats of &#x27;Enter, Space Capsule&#x27;, &#x27;The Deer in You&#x27; provides an enticing glimpse at their new recordings. The single doesn&#x27;t suggest any great departure musically, just a reminder of what Gerling do best – pop music.&quot; At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 they were nominated for Best Video for Paul Butler and Scott Walton&#x27;s directorial work on &quot;The Deer in You&quot;.

Gerling&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;When Young Terrorists Chase the Sun&quot;, was released on 24 September 2001 after being postponed due to the September 11 attacks earlier that month and a title change to the less controversial, &quot;Head2Cleaner&quot;, for international markets. It peaked in the ARIA and New Zealand Albums Chart Top50s. Oz Music Project&#x27;s Nick Coppack felt it was a &quot;stunning follow-up&quot;, which &quot;blends the band&#x27;s love for electronic sounds and dance music with fuzzy guitars and aggressive vocals, which stem from the band&#x27;s early punk roots.&quot; Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll declared it his Album of the Week, &quot;[they are] forging a new path for contemporary music by embracing technology to go where technology is leading, but at the same time using the freedom technology brings to head off into other areas of interest.&quot;

The band became increasingly electronic they had success in the dance scene and mainstream charts with the earlier single, &quot;Dust Me Selecta&quot; (August 2001), which reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top50. Lou Lou of Oz Music Project praised it as &quot;Keeping it fresh and funky... just when you’ve got your head around this disco funk, the booming synth voice jumps in, slaps you in the face and reminds you that it is indeed Gerling @ the controls.&quot; At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 they received three more nominations: Best Dance Release and Best Video (directed by Jolyon Watkins) for &quot;Dust My Selecta&quot;, and Producer of the Year for &quot;When Young Terrorists Chase the Sun&quot; (by Gerling and Magoo).

On 18 August 2003 they released their third studio album, &quot;Bad Blood!!!&quot;, which peaked in the Top60. They had recorded it at Gerlog with Magoo producing. Oz Music Project&#x27;s Semone Maksimovic felt the group were &quot;dipping their hand into the increasingly popular electro clash, disco punk bucket to fill their hands with both dirt and glitter to throw our way... [it is] more indicative of their capricious live shows, danceable, loud, catchy, energetic and easy to digest, it&#x27;s a record that will go down well in clubs or to help liven up a party, even a good driving record, but one rule remains, it has to be up loud!&quot; The album marked a return to form as guitars returned to the mix, whilst still retaining an electronic edge. The lead single, &quot;Who&#x27;s Ya Daddy?&quot; (March 2003), reached the Top100. Maksimovic described it as &quot;a mighty fine slice of sexy, trashy disco punk for us all to enjoy... [it] brings to mind The Detroit Grand Poobah&#x27;s &#x27;Sandwiches&#x27; am&quot;

Their fourth studio album, &quot;4&quot;, was released on 20 March 2006, which reached the Top100. The original recording was carried out in the function room of the Annandale Hotel, Sydney, before being re-recorded and mastered in Los Angeles. It was produced by Ethan Johns, who also worked on &quot;Aha Shake Heartbreak&quot; with Kings of Leon. &quot;Turning the Screws&quot; was the iTunes featured download of the week in February 2006.

The band have been on an indefinite hiatus since September 2007.

==Post-hiatus==
After disbandment, Cross spent four years (from 2007 to 2010) as the E.L.F., writing and performing dance music. From 2012 he turned to folk and alt-country traditional song writing structures and styling, releasing and touring as a solo artist. He received a positive review from &quot;No Depression&quot; for his album, &quot;No Damage&quot;. He also performed and recorded in a folk Noir duo, Jep and Dep (2012–2019), with Jessica Cassar. Jep and Dep&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Word Got Out&quot; received 4 out of 5 stars from &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Bernard Zuel and &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; As of 2024, Cross has released five instrumental guitar albums under the moniker D.C Cross, &quot;Ecstatic Racquet&quot; (2019),&quot;Terabithian&quot; (2020),&quot;Hot-wire the Lay-low&quot; (2022),&quot;WIZRAD&quot; (2023) and &quot;Glookies Guit&quot; (2024) . &quot;Tone Deaf&quot;″s Tyler Jenke observed &quot;&quot;Terabithian&quot; is a high watermark of instrumental music&quot;. 

In 2012 Cross also launched music and film production company, Bernstein Studios (Sydney) and has co-written songs with Jagwar Ma.

Towner produces visual art under the moniker, Dead Galaxy, and Reid has a career in music production.

<text>Ivan Danilovich Chernyakhovsky (; ; – 18 February 1945) was the youngest-ever Soviet General of the army. For his leadership during World War II he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union twice. He died from wounds received outside Königsberg at age 37 while in command of the 3rd Belorussian Front.

==Early life==
Ivan Chernyakhovsky was born on 29 June 1907 in , Russian Empire (now Uman Raion, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine). His father was a railwayman who died of typhus when his son was nine. He was a railway worker until joining the Red Army in 1924. In 1928 he finished the officer school in Kiev. Due to the rapid pre-war expansion of the military and 1937–1938 military purges, he quickly rose in rank. In 1938 he became commander of the 9th Light Tank Brigade. In March 1941 he became the commander of the 28th Tank Division in the Baltic Military District.

== World War II ==
Chernyakhovsky left the 28th Tank Division in late August, but returned to the division on 13 December after it had been converted to the 241st Rifle Division. In June 1942 he was promoted to commander of the 18th Tank Corps defending Voronezh, and only a month later assumed command of the 60th Army.

===Battle of Kursk===
On 8 February 1943, elements of Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s 60th Army hoisted a victorious Red Banner over the city of Kursk after a fast advance to the city from Voronezh, which was retaken some two weeks before.

===Battles for Belarus===

Operation Bagration was launched after a four-month break in activities because of the spring thaw. The Soviets launched their attack on June 22 on four fronts with 146 infantry and 43 armored division. General Bagramyan&#x27;s 1st Baltic Front and General Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s 3rd Belorussian Front struck to the north and south of Vitebsk and took the city on June 27. Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s left wing then took Orsha – this meant that the Moscow–Minsk highway could now be used to threaten the German rear. To the south, General Zakharov&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front, north of the Pripet Marshes, destroyed a force of 70,000 at Babruysk on that day. Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s army now headed for Minsk. On July 2 his mobile forces reached Stolbtsy within pre-war borders of Poland, 40 miles away. General Rotmistrov&#x27;s tanks entered Minsk on 3 July and by 10 July, twenty-five of Army Group Centre’s thirty-three divisions were encircled.

The offensive pressed on to Baranavichy (8 July) and to Grodno (13 July). In the south Konstantin Rokossovsky cleared the Pripet Marshes taking Pinsk and Kovel on 5 July. In the north Bagramyan turned to the Baltic States and took Vilnius in Lithuania and Daugavpils in Latvia on 13 July. This split the Army Group North in two (East Prussia and the Baltic States). The Soviets arrived on the current Polish border within 24 days and, after 68 days, claimed to have taken 158,000 men, 2,000 tanks, 10,000 guns, and 57,000 motor vehicles. They also claimed to have killed 381,000 Germans. It was a colossal defeat for the Germans and Hitler dismissed Busch from the command of Army Group Centre, replacing him with Model. The Soviets had swept the Germans from Belorussia by mid-July 1944 and they pressed their advantage by attacking Poland. In the north Generals Chernyakhovsky and Zakharov joined to take Białystok on 18 July.

===Arrest of Polish anti-Nazi resistance in Vilnius===

On 17 July 1944, as part of a covert operation aimed at disarming Armia Krajowa (AK), Chernyakhovsky, along with the General Ivan Serov, sent by the NKVD, held talks with the leadership of the Wilno Branch of the AK. Under the false pretenses of discussing the further fight against the Nazis, Polish resistance officers were invited to a briefing in the headquarters of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Front. The meeting was attended by Polish resistance officers Lieutenant Colonel Aleksander Krzyżanowski, nom de guerre &quot;Wolf&quot;, and the Chief of Staff Major Teodor Cetys, codename &quot;Fame&quot;. Both were immediately disarmed and arrested. On the same day in the village of Bogusze, a similar meeting was announced to brief commanders of other Polish partisan units in the presence of both Krzyżanowski and Chernyakhovsky. However the &#x27;briefing&#x27; ended with the disarming and arrest of the Polish officers by the NKVD. In this period, up to 8,000 Polish resistance fighters were arrested. They were either press-ganged into the Soviet Army, sent to the Gulag, or executed.

===In Germany===

In summer 1944 Chernyakhovsky pressed the Germans on the frontiers of their own land in East Prussia. His 3rd Belorussian Front drove across the Neman River, taking Kaunas on 1 August, and pressed the eastern border of East Prussia. The center thrust took Suwalki on July 26 and General Bagramyan occupied the Tukums junction on the Gulf of Riga.

Prior to his death in 1945, Chernyakhovsky launched the Soviet East Prussian Offensive against stiff resistance from the 3rd Panzer Army. He was part of the drive on Berlin. Together with Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front, which attacked East Prussia from the south and then headed north-westwards towards the Baltic coast around Danzig (Gdańsk), the 3rd Belorussian Front, commanded by General Chernyakhovsky was ordered to attack from the east towards Königsberg, even though this meant throwing his armies against heavy German defence works. These two fronts mustered 1,670,000 men with 28,360 guns and heavy mortars and 3,300 tanks.

Marshal Rokossovsky&#x27;s front made contact with Marshal Zhukov&#x27;s forces at Grudziadz (German: Graudenz) and they wheeled north towards Danzig to cut off East Prussia. More than 500,000 Germans were caught in a pocket, but many were evacuated. On 10 February, Rokossovsky reached the coast near Elbing (Elbląg) and East Prussia was under siege from the south and east by the 3rd Byelorussian Front. From January 1945 until his death, he served as the Soviet Supreme Commander of East Prussia.

On 1 February Chernyakhovsky split the pocket by attacking between Elbing and Königsberg. Just over two weeks later, on 18 February he was killed by shrapnel from artillery fire while inspecting preparations for an offensive.

==Legacy==

Chernyakhovsky was buried in Vilnius, Lithuania, near a square named in his honor. After Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 and following the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991, Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s remains were reburied at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow in 1992. A monument to Chernyakhovsky, dismantled by the authorities of Vilnius, was reinstated in the Russian city of Voronezh that was defended in the fall of 1942 and liberated in January 1943 by the 60th Army under his command.

After World War II, due to the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union annexed northern East Prussia and expelled the Germans, the town of Insterburg was renamed Chernyakhovsk in his honor.

In September 2015, a statue of Chernyakhovsky erected after the war in Pieniężno, Poland (former German name: Mehlsack), near where he was killed, was removed by local Polish authorities, prompting protests from the Russian government. From 2013 to 2023, the National Defense University of Ukraine was named in his honor.

<text>The following is a list of modernist composers.

In music, modernism is an aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred around the turn of the 20th century, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that led to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is &quot;innovation&quot;. Its leading feature is a &quot;linguistic plurality&quot;, which is to say that no one music genre ever assumed a dominant position.

 Examples include the celebration of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s rejection of tonality in chromatic post-tonal and twelve-tone works and Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s move away from metrical rhythm.

<text>Archibald Fenner Brockway, Baron Brockway (1 November 1888 – 28 April 1988) was a British socialist politician, humanist campaigner and anti-war activist.

==Early life and career==
Brockway was born to Rev. William George Brockway and Frances Elizabeth Abbey in Calcutta, British India. He developed an interest in politics while attending the School for the Sons of Missionaries, then in Blackheath, London (now Eltham College), from 1897 to 1905. In 1908, Brockway became a vegetarian. Several decades later, during a debate in a House of Lords on animal cruelty, he said: &quot;I am a vegetarian and I have been so for 70 years. On the whole, I think, physically I am a pretty good advertisement for that practice.&quot;

After leaving school, he worked as a journalist for newspapers and journals including &quot;The Quiver&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Christian Commonwealth&quot;. In 1907, Brockway joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and was a regular visitor to the Fabian Society. He was appointed editor of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; (the newspaper of the ILP, later called the &quot;New Leader&quot;) and was, by 1913, a committed pacifist. He opposed sending troops to France during the First World War and, through his position as editor of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, was outspoken in his views about the conflict.

On 12 November 1914, he published an appeal for men and women of the military age to join him in forming the No-Conscription Fellowship to campaign against the possibility of the government attempting to introduce conscription in Britain. Brockway acknowledged his wife, Lilla Brockway, had the foresight &quot;that those who intended to refuse military service should band themselves together&quot;. Lilla acted as provisional secretary at their cottage in Derbyshire until the beginning of 1915, when the membership had grown so large that it had become necessary to open an office in London. In London, Catherine Marshall became the Fellowship&#x27;s political secretary since she was adept at political strategy as the Parliamentary Secretary of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies. The No-Conscription Fellowship produced a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Tribunal&quot;, which was suppressed; through the activity of Joan Beauchamp it continued production, although her refusal to divulge the name of the printer caused her to be charged with contempt of court and held in custody for 10 days. The offices of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; were raided in August 1915 and Brockway was charged with publishing seditious material. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court. In 1916 Brockway was again arrested, this time for distributing anti-conscription leaflets. He was fined, and after refusing to pay the fine, was sent to Pentonville Prison for two months.

Shortly after his release, Brockway was arrested for a third time for his refusal to be conscripted, after being denied recognition as a conscientious objector. He was handed over to the Army and court-martialled for disobeying orders. As if a traitor, he was held for a night in the Tower of London, in a dungeon under Chester Castle and in Walton Prison, Liverpool, where he edited an unofficial newspaper, the &quot;Walton Leader&quot;, for conscientious objectors in the prison. This led to his being disciplined, which in turn led to a 10-day prison strike by conscientious objectors before he was transferred to Lincoln Jail, where he spent some time in solitary confinement until finally released in 1919. In October 1950 he revisited the jail with Éamon de Valera, the Irish statesman.

Following his release, Brockway became an active member of the India League, which advocated Indian independence. He became secretary of the ILP in 1923 and later its chairman. Years later, the Government of India honoured him with the third highest civilian award of the Padma Bhushan in 1989.

==Political activities, 1924–1935==
Brockway stood for Parliament several times, including at Lancaster in 1922 and against Winston Churchill at Westminster Abbey in a 1924 by-election. In 1926, he became the first chairperson of War Resisters&#x27; International, serving in this post until 1934. Brockway was a member of the League against Imperialism created in Brussels in 1927.

As the Nazi Party was getting more and more popular support, Brockway arrived in Poland after being invited there by The Independent Socialist Party of Poland, with Joseph Krok as one of its leaders. Brockway tried to warn the public of the Nazi threat, but he was instructed by the British Embassy in Warsaw NOT to mention &quot;the minority issue&quot; of Poland. Later Brockway met with Antonov Obisenko, USSR ambassador to Poland.

At the 1929 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leyton East as a Labour Party candidate. He polled 11,111 votes and, immediately after the election, the Liberal candidate announced that Brockway had converted him to socialism. His convictions brought him into difficulties with the Labour Party. He was also outspoken in Parliament, and was once &quot;named&quot; (suspended) by the Speaker while demanding a debate on India at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions.

In 1931 Brockway lost his seat and the following year he disaffiliated from the Labour Party along with the rest of the ILP. He stood unsuccessfully for the ILP in the 1934 Upton by-election (Upton was a division of West Ham), placed a remote third with only a 3.5% share of the votes cast, and in Norwich in the 1935 election. He also wrote a book on the arms trade, &quot;The Bloody Traffic&quot;, published by Gollancz Ltd in 1934. According to David Howell, after 1932 Brockway &quot;sought to articulate a socialism distinct from the pragmatism of Labour and the Stalinism of the Communist Party&quot;.

In Brockway&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;Purple Plague&quot; (1935), a sea liner is quarantined for a decade as a result of a plague. An egalitarian society emerges.

==Spanish Civil War==
Despite Brockway&#x27;s previous pacifist commitment, he resigned from War Resisters&#x27; International, explaining:

He assisted in the recruitment of British volunteers to fight the fascist forces of Francisco Franco in Spain through the ILP Contingent. He sailed to Calais in February 1937 and was believed to have been destined for Spain. Among those who went to Spain was Eric Blair (better known as George Orwell), and Brockway wrote a letter of recommendation for Blair to present to the ILP representatives in Barcelona. Following the Spanish Civil War, Brockway advocated public understanding of the conflict. He wrote a number of articles about the conflict and was influential in getting Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; published.

Notwithstanding his support for British participation in the Second World War, Brockway served as chair of the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors throughout the war, and continued to serve as chair until his death. He also sought to re-enter Parliament, unsuccessfully contesting wartime by-elections for the ILP at Lancaster in 1941 and Cardiff East in 1942.

==After the Second World War==

In May 1946, Brockway toured the British occupation zone in Germany as an accredited war correspondent, meeting German socialists and reporting on living conditions there; he wrote about the visit in &quot;German Diary&quot;, published by the Left Book Club.

Brockway appeared in Hitler&#x27;s Black Book that contained a list of British subjects and residents who would have been subject to arrest had the Nazis successfully invaded the UK. The contents of the book were not publicly known until after the Second World War.

Brockway later rejoined the Labour Party. After the 1950 general election he returned to the House of Commons, following an absence of more than 18 years, as the MP for Eton and Slough.

On 28 March 1950, he forced a debate in the House of Commons on the decision by the Labour government of the UK to banish Seretse Khama from his homeland, the British protectorate which became Botswana. The British government also withheld recognition of Khama as the Chief of the Bamangwato people, because he had married an Englishwoman. The marriage was an affront to the apartheid South African minority government under D. F. Malan, which, it became very clear, the UK government wished to appease.

In 1951, Brockway was one of the four founders of the charity War on Want, which fights global poverty. He helped establish the Congress of Peoples Against Imperialism (est. 1945), an organisation he continued to work with throughout the 1950s. His activities there included protesting against the response of the government to the Mau Mau Uprising in the British Kenya Colony. In this area, he was a part of the larger Movement for Colonial Freedom. From the late 1950s he regularly proposed legislation in Parliament to ban racial discrimination, only to be defeated each time. He strongly opposed the use or possession of nuclear weapons by any nation and was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

On 18 July 1961, Brockway was chosen by Speaker Harry Hylton-Foster to ask the first question at the very first Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the current format.

Brockway was a prominent member of the British Humanist Association and South Place Ethical Society where he became an Appointed Lecturer during the 1960s. He gave the 1986 Conway Memorial Lecture on 21 May 1986. The Lecture was titled &quot;M D Conway: His Life and Message For Today&quot; and was chaired by Michael Foot. The Brockway Room at Conway Hall in London is named after him.

Former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky, who defected to the UK in 1985, alleged that Brockway had been a &quot;confidential contact&quot; of the KGB and had &quot;accepted a great deal of hospitality from Soviet intelligence&quot;.

==House of Lords==
Brockway narrowly lost his seat in the House of Commons at the 1964 election, despite the national swing to Labour at that election, as he was portrayed by his opponents as being the principal cause of immigrants from the West Indies settling in Slough. He subsequently was created a life peer on 17 December 1964, taking the title Baron Brockway, &quot;of Eton and of Slough in the County of Buckingham&quot;, and took a seat in the House of Lords.

==Last years==
Brockway continued to campaign for world peace and was for several years the chairman of the Movement for Colonial Freedom. Other important posts held by him include the Presidency of the British Council for Peace in Vietnam, and membership of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association. The World Disarmament Campaign was founded by Brockway in 1979, together with Philip Noel-Baker, to work for the implementation of the policies agreed at the 1978 Special Session on Disarmament of the UN General Assembly.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Brockway, in April 1980, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; Brockway discusses his introduction to socialism, through Keir Hardie, and his interest in women&#x27;s suffrage. 

Brockway died on 28 April 1988, aged 99. He was some six months shy of his centenary. Brockway had been twice married: firstly in 1914 (divorced 1945) to Lilla, daughter of the Rev. W. Harvey-Smith; secondly in 1946 to Edith Violet King. By his first marriage, he had four daughters, and by his second, he had a son.

==Writings==
While he was in prison, Brockway met the prominent peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse, and in 1922 they co-authored &quot;English prisons to-day: being the report of the Prison system enquiry committee&quot;, a devastating critique of the English prison system which resulted in a wave of prison reform that has continued to this day. Brockway wrote more than twenty other books on politics and four volumes of autobiography.

==Tributes==

Brockway&#x27;s life and legacy are celebrated in his old constituency of Slough with the now annual FennerFest, a community arts and culture festival.

A statue of Brockway stands at the entrance to Red Lion Square Park in Holborn, London; it was funded by many involved in the Commonwealth independence movements he supported and was expected to be unveiled after his death. However, he achieved such longevity that it was likely that the original Planning Permission to erect it would run out, causing problems to renew the process. It was decided to ask him to unveil it, he being one of the few private individuals, as opposed to Heads of State to do so. It was damaged (an arm was broken off) by a falling tree in the Great Storm of 1987. The refurbished and insured statue was installed shortly after his death.

A close in the town of Newport in southern Wales is named after him.

<text>Pia Zadora (born Pia Alfreda Schipani; May 4, 1954) is an American actress and singer. She debuted a child actress on Broadway, in regional theater, and in the film &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; (1964). She came to national attention in 1981 when, following her starring role in the highly criticized &quot;Butterfly&quot;, she won a Golden Globe Award as New Star of the Year while simultaneously winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress and the Worst New Star for the same performance.

In the 1980s, her film career failed to achieve critical success, so she focused on music. As a singer, she has released several albums featuring popular standards, often backed by a symphonic orchestra. She was nominated for a Grammy in 1984.

==Early life==
Zadora was born in Hoboken, New Jersey. Her father, Alphonse Schipani, was an Italian-American violinist, and her mother, Saturnina Schipani (née Zadorowski), was a Polish-American theatrical wardrobe supervisor for Broadway productions, the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera.

She adapted part of her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her stage name. She appeared as a child actress with Tallulah Bankhead in &quot;Midgie Purvis,&quot; and played the youngest sister (Bielke) in the Broadway production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1964–66).

==Career==
===Film===
Zadora got her first film role at the age of nine portraying Girmar, a young Martian girl, in 1964&#x27;s &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot;, widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made.

Zadora&#x27;s acting career made little progress until, while touring with a musical production in 1972, she met Meshulam Riklis, 30 years her senior. They married on September 18, 1977. Not long after her marriage, Zadora had a breakthrough as the Dubonnet Girl, appearing in print and television commercials for the apéritif wine, in whose American distributor Riklis was a shareholder. 

She starred with Stacy Keach and Orson Welles in the 1982 film of James M. Cain&#x27;s novel &quot;Butterfly&quot;, whose plot involved father-daughter incest. The score features Zadora singing &quot;It&#x27;s Wrong for Me to Love You&quot;. She won that year&#x27;s Golden Globe Award as Best New Star of the Year amid charges that Riklis had purchased the award with a promotional campaign that included Zadora&#x27;s image on Sunset Boulevard billboards, an appearance in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and entertaining Golden Globe voters. Most critics responded negatively to her performance (for example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Vincent Canby described Zadora&#x27;s performance in the film as &quot;spectacularly inept&quot;), and she received the 1982 Razzies awards for both Worst New Star and Worst Actress.

Zadora next starred in the 1982 film &quot;Fake-Out&quot;, also called &quot;Nevada Heat&quot;, a women in prison B-movie comedy co-starring Telly Savalas and Desi Arnaz Jr. In 1983, she appeared in the film adaptation of the Harold Robbins novel &quot;The Lonely Lady&quot;, as an aspiring screenwriter who achieves success after surviving sexual assault. For this performance she received the 1983 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. On the basis of multiple nominations by the Golden Raspberry Awards, Zadora was named Worst New Star of the Decade (1980–89) and nominated as Worst Actress of the 1980s.

In 1985, Zadora starred as the object of an extraterrestrial&#x27;s affections in the musical comedy &quot;Voyage of the Rock Aliens&quot;. In addition to displaying her comedic side, it showcased her musical talents and featured half of the songs from her 1984 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance Tonight&quot;. In 1988 she appeared as a beatnik in John Waters&#x27;s film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, about which the film critic Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;If nothing else is worth the price of admission to this movie, perhaps you will be persuaded by the prospect of Zadora reading from Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;.&quot;

In 2000, Zadora was nominated at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards as Worst Actress of the Century, ultimately losing to Madonna.

===Music===
Zadora&#x27;s cover of the Shirley Ellis hit &quot;The Clapping Song&quot;, recorded for the film score of &quot;The Lonely Lady&quot; in 1983, reached the U.S. top 40 (her only Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), and in 1984 she had a hit duet with Jermaine Jackson titled &quot;When the Rain Begins to Fall&quot; from the movie &quot;Voyage of the Rock Aliens.&quot; In 1985, she received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the song &quot;Rock It Out,&quot; losing to Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Better Be Good to Me.&quot; Also in 1985, Zadora released &quot;Pia &amp; Phil,&quot; an album of standards with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and recorded a follow-up album in 1986 titled &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;.

In 1988, Zadora worked with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on an album titled &quot;When the Lights Go Out.&quot; The album was released only in Europe, and the single &quot;Dance Out of My Head&quot; did not chart despite the top producers and club remixes by Shep Pettibone and Ben Liebrand. In 1989, Zadora recorded the album &quot;Pia Z&quot; with producer Narada Michael Walden; this album also failed to chart. The single &quot;Heartbeat of Love&quot; included club remixes by Robert Civillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory. &quot;Pia Today!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Only for Romantics&quot; (1991), two additional albums/CDs of standards, received only limited promotional release. &quot;Pia—The Platinum Collection,&quot; a three-CD compilation, was released in 1993 and sold in the United States via infomercials. The album included repackaged versions of &quot;Pia &amp; Phil,&quot; &quot;I Am What I Am,&quot; and &quot;Pia Today!&quot;.

In 1994, Zadora had a cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult.&quot; In her segment of the film, Zadora performed the Steve Allen–penned &quot;This Could Be the Start of Something Big&quot; during a parody of an Academy Awards musical number.

===Cabaret===
In 2011, Zadora began a small attempt at a comeback with a cabaret show titled &quot;Pia Zadora: Back Again, and Standing Tall.&quot; In February, she performed at the Eissey Campus Theatre in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and the Kaye Auditorium in Boca Raton. She took the show to The Rrazz Room in San Francisco on June 8 where it ran for five performances until June 12. 
Zadora appeared at San Francisco&#x27;s Rrazz Room&#x27;s 3rd annual Rrazziversary Gala Celebration and Benefit for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital on March 17, 2011, and at the Nevada Children&#x27;s Center&#x27;s Great Gatsby Gala on April 3, 2011.

In 2012, Zadora performed with the Desert Symphony Orchestra at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert, California, and appeared on the TV show &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories.&quot;

, Zadora has hosted and performed &quot;Pia&#x27;s Place&quot; at Las Vegas restaurant Piero&#x27;s Italian Cuisine since 2013.

==Personal life==
Zadora married businessman Meshulam Riklis in 1977, when she was 23 and he was 54. She was a marquee headliner at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas during the early 1970s owing to her association with Riklis and Sinatra. Zadora and Riklis bought the Beverly Hills mansion Pickfair Manor in January 1988 from Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss for almost million (equivalent to almost $million in ). They demolished most of the structure while keeping the guest houses, claiming that termites and time had made repairs difficult.

The house, once the shared home of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, was demolished and a new house was built on the property. Zadora later claimed on a September 2012 episode of BIO&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; that Pickfair was razed owing to a troubling apparition that appeared to her and children when her husband was away on business. Riklis commissioned a nude oil portrait of Zadora, which greeted visitors.

With first husband Riklis, she had two children.

Zadora and Riklis divorced in 1993, and Zadora remained in the mansion until late 2005 or early 2006, when she sold it to Korean businessman Corry Hong for US$17.65million (equivalent to $million in ).

Zadora&#x27;s second husband was writer-director Jonathan Kaufer. They were married from August 1995 to November 2001, and had one child, Jordan Maxwell Kaufer. In 2010 Kaufer brought a defamation lawsuit against Zadora, alleging that she falsely accused Kaufer of sexually molesting their son. It was dismissed because the presiding judge found Zadora&#x27;s comments to be protected speech.

Zadora has been married to Michael Jeffries, a detective with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, since 2005 and currently resides in Summerlin, Nevada. They met when Zadora contacted the Las Vegas Police to report a stalking incident.

In June 2013, following an altercation with her teenage son, Zadora was charged with domestic violence, battery and coercion, and jailed after a SWAT team surrounded her home. Zadora, who admitted to drinking alcohol before the incident, was ordered by the presiding judge to &quot;stay out of trouble for a year, attend impulse control counseling and follow recommendations of [an] alcohol evaluation.&quot;

In September 2014, Zadora was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of University Medical Center of Southern Nevada due to head and leg injuries sustained in a golf cart accident. By December, she was back to work.

<doc id="603683" wikidata="Q7785007" url="?curid=603683" title="Third Way (UK organisation)">
<text>The Third Way is a think tank and former political party in the United Kingdom, founded on the 17 March 1990. Third Way has supported a system of federalism for the UK with the possibility of a future break-up, an isolationist foreign policy, environmentalism, the wide use of Swiss-style citizens&#x27; initiatives and distributism.

It should not be confused with the Third Way ideology promoted by Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Gerhard Schröder, which it condemns as a revised form of social democracy. It is not related to the Christian &quot;Third Way&quot; magazine.

==Ideology==
Third Way describes itself as:

a think-tank dedicated to creating a society based on Justice, Community and Individual freedom against one that is based on Greed, Globalisation and Tyranny.
Third Way stands against all forms of social injustice, racism and religious bigotry. Third Way is for everyone. We promote positive ideas and apart from this website also publish printed material. We advocate Direct Democracy along Swiss lines using referenda and citizens’ initiatives.
We support small business and co-operative ownership.

The former Northern Ireland wing of the party, Ulster Third Way (U3W) advocated for Northern Irish independence from both the UK and Republic of Ireland before its dissolution in 2005. U3W also supported the re-establishment of the Confederate States of America and neo-confederatism, although it is not clear if this opinion was shared with the rest of the Third Way.

==Leading members==
*Patrick Harrington, founder 
*David Kerr (until 2006), has stood for election as an Ulster Third Way candidate in Belfast. He is now a part of the offshoot National Liberal Party

==Affiliations==
Third Way supported the English Lobby, a pressure group and electoral coalition founded in 2004 that campaigns for the recognition of St George&#x27;s Day and the creation of an English parliament.

Third Way supporters assisted in the foundation of the trade union Solidarity – The Union for British Workers.

==Associated publications==
The Third Way has operated, or is closely associated with, various publications and websites, including:
* &quot;Ulster Nation&quot; magazine and website
* &quot;Counter-Culture&quot; magazine and website 
* &quot;Liverpool Newsletter&quot;, a distributist publication formerly edited by Anthony Cooney and now published by Third Way.

==National Liberal party==

In 1999, new electoral organisation the National Liberal Party was formed by Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson and registered as National Liberal Party – The Third Way with the Electoral Commission. It fought parliamentary elections in Hornchurch (in 2001 and 2005), Belfast West (2001, as Ulster Third Way), Upminster (2005) and Eastleigh (2010) but obtained below 1% of the vote in each case.

In the 2014 European elections, the National Liberal Party stood with 8 candidates in the London constituency, gaining 6,736 votes.

<doc id="603689" wikidata="Q7443793" url="?curid=603689" title="Secondary School Certificate">
<text>The Secondary School Certificate (SSC) is a public examination in Bangladesh taken by students in the 10th grade. It is a significant milestone in the country&#x27;s education system and marks the completion of secondary education.

== History ==
The SSC examination system in Bangladesh traces its roots to the colonial period under British rule. The system has evolved over time, and since Bangladesh&#x27;s independence in 1971, the examination has been administered by multiple regional education boards.

== Examination structure ==
The SSC examination in Bangladesh is held annually by the DSHE. Students must take exams in various subjects.

=== Subjects ===
Compulsory subjects: Students are required to study a set of core subjects, including: Bangla (1st and 2nd paper), English (1st and 2nd paper), general mathematics, information and communication technology, religion and moral education (Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Christianity based on the student&#x27;s faith). These subjects are mandatory for all students and form the foundation of the SSC curriculum.

Group-specific subjects: Students are divided into three groups: science, humanities, and commerce. Each group has specific subjects in addition to the core subjects.

Science: physics, chemistry, biology, higher mathematics, Bangladesh and global studies.

Humanities: history, geography, civics, economics, general science.

Commerce: accounting, business studies, economics, Finance, general science.

Optional subjects, such as agriculture or home science, may also be chosen based on student preferences.

There are two additional subjects, physical education and career education. Marks for these subjects are awarded based on continuous assessments conducted during 9th and 10th grade.

== Boards of education ==
The SSC exam is conducted by various regional education boards across Bangladesh. Those are:

* Dhaka Education Board
* Rajshahi Education Board
* Chattogram Education Board
* Jashore Education Board
* Barishal Education Board
* Sylhet Education Board
* Dinajpur Education Board
* Comilla Education Board
* Mymensingh Education Board
* Madrasah Education Board (Exceptional)
* Vocational Education Board (Excaptional)

Each board is responsible for organizing the examinations, publishing results, and ensuring the smooth conduct of SSC exams in its jurisdiction.

== Grading system ==
The SSC results are based on a grading system, as follows:

The grades are awarded based on the overall performance in the examinations, and the results determine students&#x27; eligibility for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam. Students who fail in one or more subjects are required to retake the examination for those subjects in the following year&#x27;s SSC examination.

== Importance ==
The SSC exam plays a vital role in the educational system of Bangladesh. Students who pass the SSC exam are eligible to pursue higher secondary education, which is the prerequisite for university admission. SSC results also serve as a foundation for career opportunities in various fields, such as engineering, medical, and business.

<text>The voltage clamp is an experimental method used by electrophysiologists to measure the ion currents through the membranes of excitable cells, such as neurons, while holding the membrane voltage at a set level. A basic voltage clamp will iteratively measure the membrane potential, and then change the membrane potential (voltage) to a desired value by adding the necessary current. This &quot;clamps&quot; the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the voltage clamp to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in charge to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential. Cell membranes of excitable cells contain many different kinds of ion channels, some of which are voltage-gated. The voltage clamp allows the membrane voltage to be manipulated independently of the ionic currents, allowing the current–voltage relationships of membrane channels to be studied.

==History==

The concept of the voltage clamp is attributed to Kenneth Cole and George Marmont in the spring of 1947. They inserted an internal electrode into the giant axon of a squid and began to apply a current. Cole discovered that it was possible to use two electrodes and a feedback circuit to keep the cell&#x27;s membrane potential at a level set by the experimenter.

Cole developed the voltage clamp technique before the era of microelectrodes, so his two electrodes consisted of fine wires twisted around an insulating rod. Because this type of electrode could be inserted into only the largest cells, early electrophysiological experiments were conducted almost exclusively on squid axons.

Squids squirt jets of water when they need to move quickly, as when escaping a predator. To make this escape as fast as possible, they have an axon that can reach 1 mm in diameter (signals propagate more quickly down large axons). The squid giant axon was the first preparation that could be used to voltage clamp a transmembrane current, and it was the basis of Hodgkin and Huxley&#x27;s pioneering experiments on the properties of the action potential.

Alan Hodgkin realized that, to understand ion flux across the membrane, it was necessary to eliminate differences in membrane potential. Using experiments with the voltage clamp, Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley published 5 papers in the summer of 1952 describing how ionic currents give rise to the action potential. The final paper proposed the Hodgkin–Huxley model which mathematically describes the action potential. The use of voltage clamps in their experiments to study and model the action potential in detail has laid the foundation for electrophysiology; for which they shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Technique==
The voltage clamp is a current generator. Transmembrane voltage is recorded through a &quot;voltage electrode&quot;, relative to ground, and a &quot;current electrode&quot; passes current into the cell. The experimenter sets a &quot;holding voltage&quot;, or &quot;command potential&quot;, and the voltage clamp uses negative feedback to maintain the cell at this voltage. The electrodes are connected to an amplifier, which measures membrane potential and feeds the signal into a feedback amplifier. This amplifier also gets an input from the signal generator that determines the command potential, and it subtracts the membrane potential from the command potential (Vcommand – Vm), magnifies any difference, and sends an output to the current electrode. Whenever the cell deviates from the holding voltage, the operational amplifier generates an &quot;error signal&quot;, that is the difference between the command potential and the actual voltage of the cell. The feedback circuit passes current into the cell to reduce the error signal to zero. Thus, the clamp circuit produces a current equal and opposite to the ionic current.

==Variations of the voltage clamp technique==

=== Two-electrode voltage clamp using microelectrodes ===

The two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique is used to study properties of membrane proteins, especially ion channels. Researchers use this method most commonly to investigate membrane structures expressed in &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes. The large size of these oocytes allows for easy handling and manipulability.

The TEVC method utilizes two low-resistance pipettes, one sensing voltage and the other injecting current. The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a dielectric as well as a resistor, while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as capacitors. The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications.

This technique is favored over single-microelectrode clamp or other voltage clamp techniques when conditions call for resolving large currents. The high current-passing capacity of the two-electrode clamp makes it possible to clamp large currents that are impossible to control with single-electrode patch techniques. The two-electrode system is also desirable for its fast clamp settling time and low noise. However, TEVC is limited in use with regard to cell size. It is effective in larger-diameter oocytes, but more difficult to use with small cells. Additionally, TEVC method is limited in that the transmitter of current must be contained in the pipette. It is not possible to manipulate the intracellular fluid while clamping, which is possible using patch clamp techniques. Another disadvantage involves &quot;space clamp&quot; issues. Cole&#x27;s voltage clamp used a long wire that clamped the squid axon uniformly along its entire length. TEVC microelectrodes can provide only a spatial point source of current that may not uniformly affect all parts of an irregularly shaped cell.

==== Dual-cell voltage clamp ====
The dual-cell voltage clamp technique is a specialized variation of the two electrode voltage clamp, and is only used in the study of gap junction channels. Gap junctions are pores that directly link two cells through which ions and small molecules flow freely. When two cells in which gap junction proteins, typically connexins or innexins, are expressed, either endogenously or via injection of mRNA, a junction channel will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional conductance, the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in Vm for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied.

=== Single-electrode voltage clamp ===
This category describes a set of techniques in which one electrode is used for voltage clamp. Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) technique is often used with patch-clamp recording. Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) technique is used with penetrating intracellular recording. This single electrode carries out the functions of both current injection and voltage recording.

==== Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) ====
The &quot;patch-clamp&quot; technique allows the study of individual ion channels. It uses an electrode with a relatively large tip (&gt; 1 micrometer) that has a smooth surface (rather than a sharp tip). This is a &quot;patch-clamp electrode&quot; (as distinct from a &quot;sharp electrode&quot; used to impale cells). This electrode is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied to pull the cell&#x27;s membrane inside the electrode tip. The suction causes the cell to form a tight seal with the electrode (a &quot;gigaohm seal&quot;, as the resistance is more than a gigaohm).

SEV-c has the advantage that you can record from small cells that would be impossible to impale with two electrodes. However:
#Microelectrodes are imperfect conductors; in general, they have a resistance of more than a million ohms. They rectify (i.e., change their resistance with voltage, often in an irregular manner), they sometimes have unstable resistance if clogged by cell contents. Thus, they will not faithfully record the voltage of the cell, especially when it is changing quickly, nor will they faithfully pass current.
#Voltage and current errors: SEV-c circuitry does not actually measure the voltage of the cell being clamped (as does a two-electrode clamp). The patch-clamp amplifier is like a two-electrode clamp, except the voltage measuring and current passing circuits are connected (in the two-electrode clamp, they are connected &quot;through the cell&quot;). The electrode is attached to a wire that contacts the current/voltage loop inside the amplifier. Thus, the electrode has only an indirect influence on the feedback circuit. The amplifier reads only the voltage at the top of the electrode, and feeds back current to compensate. But, if the electrode is an imperfect conductor, the clamp circuitry has only a distorted view of the membrane potential. Likewise, when the circuit passes back current to compensate for that (distorted) voltage, the current will be distorted by the electrode before it reaches the cell. To compensate for this, the electrophysiologist uses the lowest resistance electrode possible, makes sure that the electrode characteristics do not change during an experiment (so the errors will be constant), and avoids recording currents with kinetics likely to be too fast for the clamp to follow accurately. The accuracy of SEV-c goes up the slower and smaller are the voltage changes it is trying to clamp.
#Series resistance errors: The currents passed to the cell must go to ground to complete the circuit. The voltages are recorded by the amplifier relative to ground. When a cell is clamped at its natural resting potential, there is no problem; the clamp is not passing current and the voltage is being generated only by the cell. But, when clamping at a different potential, series resistance errors become a concern; the cell will pass current across its membrane in an attempt to return to its natural resting potential. The clamp amplifier opposes this by passing current to maintain the holding potential. A problem arises because the electrode is between the amplifier and the cell; i.e., the electrode is &quot;in series&quot; with the resistor that is the cell&#x27;s membrane. Thus, when passing current through the electrode and the cell, Ohm&#x27;s law tells us that this will cause a voltage to form across both the cell&#x27;s and the electrode&#x27;s resistance. As these resistors are in series, the voltage drops will add. If the electrode and the cell membrane have equal resistances (which they usually do not), and if the experimenter command a 40mV change from the resting potential, the amplifier will pass enough current until it reads that it has achieved that 40mV change. However, in this example, half of that voltage drop is across the electrode. The experimenter thinks he or she has moved the cell voltage by 40 mV, but has moved it only by 20 mV. The difference is the &quot;series resistance error&quot;. Modern patch-clamp amplifiers have circuitry to compensate for this error, but these compensate only 70-80% of it. The electrophysiologist can further reduce the error by recording at or near the cell&#x27;s natural resting potential, and by using as low a resistance electrode as possible.
#Capacitance errors. Microelectrodes are capacitors, and are particularly troublesome because they are non-linear. The capacitance arises because the electrolyte inside the electrode is separated by an insulator (glass) from the solution outside. This is, by definition and function, a capacitor. Worse, as the thickness of the glass changes the farther you get from the tip, the time constant of the capacitor will vary. This produces a distorted record of membrane voltage or current whenever they are changing. Amplifiers can compensate for this, but not entirely because the capacitance has many time-constants. The experimenter can reduce the problem by keeping the cell&#x27;s bathing solution shallow (exposing less glass surface to liquid) and by coating the electrode with silicone, resin, paint, or another substance that will increase the distance between the inside and outside solutions.
#Space clamp errors. A single electrode is a point source of current. In distant parts of the cell, the current passed through the electrode will be less influential than at nearby parts of the cell. This is particularly a problem when recording from neurons with elaborate dendritic structures. There is nothing one can do about space clamp errors except to temper the conclusions of the experiment.

==== Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) ====

A single-electrode voltage clamp — discontinuous, or SEVC-d, has some advantages over SEVC-c for whole-cell recording. In this, a different approach is taken for passing current and recording voltage. A SEVC-d amplifier operates on a &quot;time-sharing&quot; basis, so the electrode regularly and frequently switches between passing current and measuring voltage. In effect, there are two electrodes, but each is in operation for only half of the time it is on. The oscillation between the two functions of the single electrode is termed a duty cycle. During each cycle, the amplifier measures the membrane potential and compares it with the holding potential. An operational amplifier measures the difference, and generates an error signal. This current is a mirror image of the current generated by the cell. The amplifier outputs feature sample and hold circuits, so each briefly sampled voltage is then held on the output until the next measurement in the next cycle. To be specific, the amplifier measures voltage in the first few microseconds of the cycle, generates the error signal, and spends the rest of the cycle passing current to reduce that error. At the start of the next cycle, voltage is measured again, a new error signal generated, current passed etc. The experimenter sets the cycle length, and it is possible to sample with periods as low as about 15 microseconds, corresponding to a 67 kHz switching frequency. Switching frequencies lower than about 10 kHz are not sufficient when working with action potentials that are less than 1 millisecond wide. Note that not all discontinuous voltage-clamp amplifier support switching frequencies higher than 10 kHz.

For this to work, the cell capacitance must be higher than the electrode capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much less than that of the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.

SEVC-d has a major advantage over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it to undershoot the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (“ringing”); this usually results in the destruction of the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the electrode voltage decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to “tune” the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to “back off” the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.

== Mathematical modeling ==
From the point of view of control theory, the voltage clamp experiment can be described in terms of the application of a high-gain output feedback control law to the neuronal membrane. Mathematically, the membrane voltage can be modeled by a conductance-based model with an input given by the applied current formula_1 and an output given by the membrane voltage formula_2. Hodgkin and Huxley&#x27;s original conductance-based model, which represents a neuronal membrane containing sodium and potassium ion currents, as well as a leak current, is given by the system of ordinary differential equations

formula_3

formula_4

where formula_5 is the membrane capacitance, formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8are maximal conductances, formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11 are reversal potentials, formula_12 and formula_13 are ion channel voltage-dependent rate constants, and the state variables formula_14, formula_15, and formula_16 are ion channel gating variables.

It is possible to rigorously show that the feedback law

formula_17

drives the membrane voltage formula_2 arbitrarily close to the reference voltage formula_19 as the gain formula_20 is increased to an arbitrarily large value. This fact, which is by no means a general property of dynamical systems (a high-gain can, in general, lead to instability), is a consequence of the structure and the properties of the conductance-based model above. In particular, the dynamics of each gating variable formula_21, which are driven by formula_22, verify the strong stability property of exponential contraction.

<text>David Hillel Gelernter (born March 5, 1955) is an American computer scientist, artist, and writer. He is a professor of computer science at Yale University.

Gelernter is known for contributions to parallel computation in the 1980s, and for books on topics such as computed worlds (&quot;Mirror Worlds&quot;). Gelernter is also known for his belief, expressed in his book &quot;America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats)&quot;, that liberal academia has a destructive influence on American society. He is in addition known for his views against women in the workforce, and his rejection of the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change and evolution.

In 1993 Gelernter was sent a mail bomb by Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber. He opened it and the resulting explosion almost killed him, leaving him with permanent loss of use of his right hand as it destroyed four fingers, and permanent damage to his right eye.

== Early life and education ==
Gelernter grew up on Long Island, New York. His father Herbert Gelernter was a physicist who, in the late 1950s and 1960s, became a pioneer in artificial intelligence and taught computer science at State University of New York at Stony Brook. Gelernter&#x27;s grandfather was a rabbi, and Gelernter grew up as a Reform Jew; he later became a follower of Orthodox Judaism.

He received his Bachelor of Arts in computer science from Yale University in 1976 and received a Master of Arts in Classical Hebrew literature from the same university. He earned his Ph.D. from State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1982.

== Career ==

=== Computer science ===
In the 1980s, Gelernter made seminal contributions to the field of parallel computation, specifically the tuple space coordination model, as embodied by the Linda programming system he and Nicholas Carriero designed (which he named for Linda Lovelace, the lead actress in the porn movie &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, mocking the naming of the programming language Ada in tribute to the scientist and first attributed computer programmer, Ada Lovelace). Bill Joy cited the Linda system as the inspiration for many elements of JavaSpaces and Jini.

In January 1993 in his book &quot;Mirror Worlds: or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox...How It Will Happen and What It Will Mean&quot;, Gelernter wrote: &quot;...people and software work hand-in-glove – and sometimes hand-in-hand.&quot;

On June 24, 1993, Gelernter was severely injured opening a mail bomb sent to him by the Unabomber. He recovered from his injuries, but his right hand (which he covers with a glove) and eye were permanently damaged. Some in the press suggested that there were parallels between his thoughts on the need for a human element to computers and those of the Unabomber. He chronicled the ordeal in his 1997 book &quot;Drawing Life: Surviving the Unabomber&quot;. Two years after the bombing, the Unabomber sent Gelernter a letter, writing: &quot;People with advanced degrees aren&#x27;t as smart as they think they are.&quot;

Gelernter helped found the company Mirror Worlds Technologies, which in 2001 released Scopeware software using ideas from his 1992 book &quot;Mirror Worlds&quot;. Gelernter believed that computers can free users from being filing clerks, by organizing their data. The product never took off, however, and the company ceased operations in 2004. In 2013, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, a related company that had purchased its patents, filed a complaint of patent infringement against Apple, Best Buy, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo (United States), Lenovo Group, Microsoft, Samsung Electronic, and Samsung TeleCommunications in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Ultimately, the company lost at the trial level and on appeal. A petition for writ of certiorari to have the case considered by the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2013. In 2016, the case was dismissed with prejudice.

In July 2019, Gelernter, along with three other co-founders, started Revolution Populi: A blockchain-powered crypto clearing house and social network. The team also includes Rob Rosenthal, a 19-year veteran of Goldman Sachs.

=== Writing and art ===
Gelernter&#x27;s paintings have been exhibited, sold, stolen and recovered in New Haven and Manhattan.

Gelernter has critiqued what he perceives as cultural illiteracy among students. In 2015, he commented, &quot;They [students] know nothing about art. They know nothing about history. They know nothing about philosophy. And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don&#x27;t rise to the level of atheists, insofar as they&#x27;ve never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God. It has never occurred to them. They know nothing about the Bible.&quot; In 2016 he said: &quot;The [Yale] faculty and the students don&#x27;t have a clue what&#x27;s going on in the world.&quot;

== Politics ==
He is a former national fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and senior fellow in Jewish thought at the Shalem Center. In 2003, he became a member of the National Council on the Arts. &quot;Time&quot; magazine profiled Gelernter in 2016, describing him as a &quot;stubbornly independent thinker. A conservative among mostly liberal Ivy League professors, a religious believer among the often disbelieving ranks of computer scientists...&quot;

Endorsing Donald Trump for president, in October 2016, Gelernter wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; calling Hillary Clinton &quot;as phony as a three-dollar bill&quot;, and saying that Barack Obama &quot;has governed like a third-rate tyrant&quot;. In his capacity as a member of the Trump transition team, Peter Thiel nominated Gelernter for the Science Advisor to the President position; Gelernter met with Trump in January 2017, but did not get the job.

In 2018, he said that the idea that Trump is a racist is &quot;absurd&quot;. In October 2020 he joined in signing a letter stating: &quot;Given his astonishing success in his first term, we believe that Donald Trump is the candidate most likely to foster the promise and prosperity of America.&quot;

Gelernter has spoken out against women in the workforce, saying working mothers were harming their children and should stay at home. Gelernter has also argued for the U.S. voting age to be raised, on the basis that 18-year-olds are not sufficiently mature.

===Positions on science===
&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, profiling him in early 2017 as a potential science advisor to Donald Trump, called Gelernter &quot;a vehement critic of modern academia&quot; who has &quot;condemned &#x27;belligerent leftists&#x27; and blamed intellectualism for the disintegration of patriotism and traditional family values.&quot; Shortly thereafter, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; published a rebuttal of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; profile, saying it was &quot;hard to imagine a more misleading treatment&quot; of the &quot;pioneering polymath&quot; Gelernter.
Gelernter has &quot;expressed skepticism about the reality&quot; of anthropogenic climate change,&quot; rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus in the field.

In July 2019, in a review of Stephen Meyer&#x27;s book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design&quot;, which Gelernter wrote for the &quot;Claremont Review of Books&quot;, he also rejected the scientific consensus of evolutionary biology. On the other hand, Gelernter stipulates he &quot;cannot accept&quot; intelligent design either, saying that &quot;as a theory, it would seem to have a long way to go.&quot; In &quot;A Response to David Gelernter&#x27;s Attack on Evolution&quot;, &quot;Patheos&quot;, August 26, 2019, Bob Seidensticker writes: &quot;Let&#x27;s subtitle this story, &#x27;Guy who made his career in not-biology is convinced by other not-biologists that Biology&#x27;s core theory is wrong. Computer scientist and mathematician Jeffrey Shallit wrote: &quot;Gelernter&#x27;s review was not published in a science journal, but in a politics journal run by a far-right think tank. His review cites no scientific publications at all, and makes claims like &#x27;Many biologists agree&#x27; and &#x27;Most biologists think&#x27; without giving any supporting citations. So, not surprisingly ... Gelernter makes a fool of himself in his review, which resembles a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; of creationist misconceptions and lies.&quot;

==Books and book reviews==

Gelernter&#x27;s book &quot;Mirror Worlds&quot; (1991) &quot;prophesied the rise of the World Wide Web.&quot; Bill Joy, founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, said Gelernter was &quot;one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him a computer science &quot;rock star&quot;.

In &quot;The Muse in the Machine&quot; (1994), Gelernter theorized that creativity is based on the degree to which people focus their attention, arguing that &quot;low focus&quot;, when attention is wandering or emotions interfere with rationality, is when people are creative. His book was harshly criticized. Psychologist Stuart Sutherland, writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, called the theory wrong. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, director of the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, wrote: &quot;It makes a great story, but if you look at the contemporary records and autobiographies, it doesn&#x27;t work that way.&quot;

In his 2009 book &quot;Judaism: A Way of Being&quot;, Gelernter wrote that God has withdrawn from the modern world, that Reform and Conservative Judaism do not work, that the purpose of life is to marry and rear a family, and that the feminist effort for male and female equality &quot;is an act of aggression against both sanctity and humanity.&quot;

In his 2012 book &quot;America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats)&quot;, Gelernter argued that American higher education no longer cares about producing well-rounded and cultured students; academics instead believe that their role is to dictate how other Americans live and think. Scottish columnist Stephen Daisley wrote in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine that Gelernter portrayed Obama&#x27;s presidency as a symbol of the failure of American education and the success of its replacement with a liberal indoctrination system. As a solution, Gelernter proposed moving all of human knowledge to online servers so that the in-person college experience can be replaced by user-driven self-education. Daisley wrote, &quot;&quot;America-Lite&quot; is lean, incisive, convincing, delightfully indelicate, and, in a break from the conventions of the literature on education, honest. It is a fine dissection—de-construction, if you must—of the corruption of higher education and the resulting debasement of political culture. If it makes its way on to a single college reading list, Hell will have frozen over.&quot;

Historian Russell Jacoby was critical in his review of Gelernter&#x27;s book &quot;America-Lite&quot;, saying it contained insufficient arguments. Jacoby wrote that Gelernter blamed Jews for causing the breakdown of patriotism and the traditional family, writing, &quot;Gelernter is Jewish, and it is not likely that a non-Jew would airily argue that obnoxious leftist Jews have taken over elite higher education.&quot;

<text>The kamancheh (also kamānche or kamāncha) (, , , ) is an Iranian bowed string instrument used in Persian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, Kurdish, Georgian, Turkmen, and Uzbek music with slight variations in the structure of the instrument. 

The kamancheh is related to the rebab which is the historical ancestor of the kamancheh and the bowed Byzantine lyra. The strings are played with a variable-tension bow.

In 2017, the art of crafting and playing with Kamantcheh/Kamancha was included into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists of Azerbaijan and Iran.

== Name and etymology ==
The word &quot;kamancheh&quot; means &quot;little bow&quot; in Persian (&quot;kæman&quot;, bow, and &quot;-cheh&quot;, diminutive). The Turkish word kemençe is borrowed from Persian, with the pronunciation adapted to Turkish phonology. 

It also denotes a bowed string instrument, but the Turkish version differs significantly in structure and sound from the Persian kamancheh. 

There is also an instrument called &quot;kabak kemane&quot; literally &quot;pumpkin-shaped bow instrument&quot; used in Turkish music which is only slightly different from the Iranian kamancheh.

== Structure ==
The kamancheh has a long neck including fingerboard which kamancheh maker shapes it as a truncated inverse cone for easy bow moving in down section, pegbox in both side of which four pegs are placed, and finial Traditionally kamanchehs had three silk strings, but modern instruments have four metal strings. 

Kamanchehs may have highly ornate inlays and elaborately carved ivory tuning pegs. 

The body has a long upper neck and a lower bowl-shaped resonating chamber made from a gourd or wood, usually covered with a membrane made from the skin of a lamb, goat or sometimes a fish, on which the bridge is set.

From the bottom protrudes a spike to support the kamancheh while it is being played, hence in English, the instrument is sometimes called the &quot;spiked fiddle&quot;. 

It is played sitting down held like a cello though it is about the length of a viol. The end-pin can rest on the knee or thigh while the player is seated in a chair.

Kamancheh is usually tuned like an ordinary violin (G, D, A, E).

<doc id="603709" wikidata="Q7146663" url="?curid=603709" title="Patrick Harrington (activist)">
<text>Patrick Antony Harrington (born 24 May 1964) is a far-right British political activist and writer of Irish Catholic family origins, who has published pamphlets by the Social Credit advocate and former editor of the &quot;Liverpool Newsletter&quot;, Anthony Cooney, about prominent Catholic writers such as G. K. Chesterton, J.R.R. Tolkien and Hilaire Belloc. He is currently general secretary of Solidarity – The Union for British Workers and a director of the Third Way, a think tank (since 1989).

He is a committed and lifelong vegetarian. He has two children and lives in Edinburgh.

==Early years and education==

Harrington was born in Kennington, London, and his secondary education was at the Pimlico Comprehensive School and Tenison&#x27;s School, both also in London. His further and higher education were at City of Westminster College of Further Education (1980–82), Polytechnic of North London (1982–85), Edinburgh&#x27;s Telford College (1994–95), West London Technology Centre (1993), Kensington &amp; Chelsea College (1992–93), College of the Distributive Trades (1991–93), University of Greenwich (1997–99) and the University of Northumbria (2011–14).

He has described himself as a &quot;life-long vegetarian and pagan&quot;.

==Ideological development and political position==
Although he first came to prominence as a leading member of the National Front in the 
1980s, Patrick Harrington claims he has undergone substantial ideological change since he voted to disband the NF in 1989. In his profile on the Third Way website, he cites Rabbi Mayer Schiller as a particular influence on this development. Schiller is the subject of a biography on the Third Way website, although his role in the party is unclear.

In an interview with Wayne John Sturgeon of &quot;Alternative Green&quot; magazine, Harrington said:&quot;I voted for the disbandment of the National Front in 1989 which I think speaks for itself. Since that time I have worked with my Third Way colleagues for harmony and progress in our country. There are aspects of my involvement with the NF which I deeply regret. I wasted a lot of time trying to move people to more positive, inclusive positions. I should have broken with them earlier. The past, however, is gone and cannot be changed. I have rethought, rejected or refined many of my past positions. This is a process which has led me to where I am now. I hope that people would judge me on my current ideas and actions rather than re-fight the battles of the past.

Sturgeon has been closely associated with Troy Southgate&#x27;s various nationalist-anarchist groups, from the National Revolutionary Faction (NRF) to the New Right, which describes itself as &quot;opposed to liberalism, democracy and egalitarianism&quot;.

In &quot;I Rejected National Front&quot;, an article written for &quot;The Voice&quot; (a publication aimed at the British Afro-Caribbean community) and apparently published on 13 February 2006 (but reproduced on Third Way&#x27;s website), Harrington wrote:&quot;Third Way, which I helped form in 1990, advocates harmonious relationships between all communities. Third Way welcomes the vibrant contribution that this variety brings but we are also aware that there can be friction between communities.&quot;We must be honest about these difficulties and work to solve problems together in a spirit of unity. Third Way policy is very different from that of the BNP which we have stood against in elections.&quot;

==General Secretary of Solidarity 2006 to present==
In January 2006, Harrington was appointed General Secretary of Solidarity. In November 2007, following independently scrutinised elections, he was returned unopposed for a five-year period. He has since been returned unopposed for a second five-year term.

The Union Executive elected in 2012 consists of Harrington (General Secretary), Michelle Harrington, Glen Nicklasson, Graham Williamson, Clive Jefferson and David Kerr (President).

===Expulsion from RMT===
Harrington was expelled from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) on 27 June 2003 and ascribes his involvement in Solidarity to this. The RMT claimed in a press release that he had joined under a false name and was expelled when his identity was discovered; Harrington responded that he joined under his married name and that he was known to the union by both names and challenged the grounds for expulsion.

He has claimed that the reasons given for his expulsion were a pretext to cover a political motive and accused the RMT of supporting a &quot;New McCarthyism&quot;.

==Directorship of the Third Way 1990 to present==
The Third Way think tank (not be confused with the ideas associated with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton) advocates direct democracy along Swiss lines using referendums and citizens&#x27; initiatives, and is strongly influenced by Distributism and Social Credit. It supports small business and co-operative ownership, while opposing over-centralised government and promoting decision making at the lowest practical level. It recruits from all religious and ethnic communities. According to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission, in 2004 Third Way had 20 members and a cash flow of approximately £1,400.

In the 2005 general election it fielded two candidates who received 376 votes between them. According to the Electoral Commission searchable database, the registration of Third Way Publications Ltd lapsed and Ulster Third Way was &quot;voluntarily deregistered&quot; in 2005.

The National Liberal Party (NLP) was founded in 1999 by Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson. In 2006, the Third Way registered the name National Liberal Party – The Third Way. Its constitution distinguishes between &quot;Members&quot;, &quot;Registered Supporters&quot; and &quot;Supporting Subscribers&quot;. It also operates through a number of Limited Companies and Associations.

The 2012 accounts filed with the Electoral Commission do not mention Harrington and reveal membership income of about £400 and total income of about £950.

==Membership of the National Front 1979 to 1989==
===Polytechnic of North London protests===
In 1984, Harrington was the subject of protests by students at the Polytechnic of North London (later the University of North London, now part of London Metropolitan University), who picketed his lectures to protest against his being able to study philosophy while a prominent member of the National Front (NF), which he joined in 1979, and deputy editor of its publication &quot;NF News&quot;. Students argued that his presence made life intolerable for ethnic minority students. Harrington disputed this and insisted on his right to attend lectures. He obtained a court injunction to stop the picketing; the protestors, backed by their students&#x27; union, ignored this. Two student leaders were sent to jail for 16 days for contempt of a court order preventing them from barring Harrington from college.

In December 1984, Dr David MacDowall, the Polytechnic&#x27;s director, resigned after pressure from the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) to make a complaint against Harrington for remarks he made in a radio interview. ILEA said the remarks were racist, which Harrington denied. In his resignation letter, MacDowall admitted that he had acted &quot;in a totally fascistic manner&quot; over the issue, and wished &quot;all the picketing students the best of luck with their campaign&quot;. Harrington subsequently faced a college hearing for a television interview in which, in line with NF policy, he questioned the right of black people to citizenship.

In January 1985, with final exams approaching, the students&#x27; union, Harrington and the Polytechnic administration agreed a deal in which all of Harrington&#x27;s classes would be taught in an annexe away from the main building. His fellow students boycotted these lectures and many lecturers taught them informally. Harrington eventually graduated with a philosophy degree.

===Official National Front===
In the late 1980s, the National Front underwent a schism. Harrington sided with the Political Soldier group that included Nick Griffin (who later became leader of the British National Party) and Derek Holland. This group eventually termed itself the Official National Front. The ideas of Harrington and his allies led to alienation of some NF supporters with the Flag Group splitting off to follow more traditional NF ideas. Harrington was involved in one of the manifestations of these divisions in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election when, as a candidate, one of his opponents was Ted Budden of the Flag Group. In September 1988, the three men visited Libya as a guest of the Gaddafi regime. In October, the Political Soldier NF was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Disciples of Chaos&quot; in which Harrington was interviewed.

There was another schism in 1989 when Harrington and Graham Williamson parted company with Griffin and Holland. The ONF had opened dialogue with groups like the Nation of Islam and the Pan-Afrikan International Movement. According to Harrington&#x27;s account of the split, when he opened discussion with Jewish nationalist and anti-Zionist rabbi Mayer Schiller (see section on Harrington&#x27;s ideological development below) and advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, he was attacked as a &quot;Zionist&quot;. Harrington and Williamson attended pro-Palestinian demonstrations such as the 1988 Quds Day march in London, as part of an ONF strategy to show support for Muslim anti-Zionists.

For their part, Griffin and Holland claimed that Harrington&#x27;s refusal to condemn the IRA had been the cause of many problems. Party members in Ulster sided with Harrington. In late 1989, Harrington voted for the disbandment of the Official National Front and joined with others to form the Third Way in 1990. Griffin and Holland formed the International Third Position. Later Griffin left this group and joined the BNP.

===Relationship with Skrewdriver/Blood &amp; Honour===
As an official of the NF, Harrington was involved in administering the White Noise Club, which organised white power music concerts featuring, among others, Skrewdriver. In 1987, the Political Soldier group fell out with Ian Stuart, the lead singer of Skrewdriver. Stuart responded by setting up his own group, Blood &amp; Honour, whose eponymous publication openly attacked his former NF associates. They in turn denounced Stuart. Harrington and Holland are allegedly the subjects of the Skrewdriver song &quot;A Time of Change&quot;, included on their 1988 album &quot;After the Fire&quot;.

===Allegations of links with state security===
In February 1990, &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine alleged that Harrington had ongoing connections to Special Branch and MI6. Harrington has denied any such links.

===Connection to Nick Griffin and the BNP===
Harrington has had previous links with Nick Griffin and has provided legal services in the past to the British National Party, but he denies that these associations imply ideological agreement. He worked for Nick Griffin as a European Parliamentary local assistant during the MEP&#x27;s term of office.

In September 2005, he edited, and Third Way published, a pamphlet entitled &quot;Taking Liberties&quot;, with an article by Griffin. In the editorial Harrington wrote, &quot;Let me nail my colours to the mast. I believe that speech (and other forms of expression) should be protected regardless of content or viewpoint. I am against any law that seeks to discriminate against any religious, racial or political group. I&#x27;m also against any law that favours one such interest group over another.&quot;

Harrington defends his decision to publish an article from Griffin on civil liberties grounds. His role as general secretary of Solidarity, and its association with the BNP, is discussed above.

===Change in position?===
Harrington has argued that he has moved away from many of his previous positions. Before the 2019 general election, he told members of Solidarity that he would be voting Labour, and wrote, &quot;[L]ooking at the domestic economy and rights for workers Labour&#x27;s promises are unmatched. I want to see re-Nationalisation and I want to see attacks on the rights of ordinary workers reversed. I want ordinary people to have more control over their working lives.&quot; After the election, Harrington stated, &quot;I made it clear during the election campaign that I, as an individual, supported and would vote Labour because of the pro-worker policies in their manifesto. I always feared, however, that the many fine domestic policy offerings from Labour, which I as someone left-leaning, pro-union and pro-worker approved of, would be overshadowed by Brexit.&quot;

<doc id="603717" wikidata="Q1381985" url="?curid=603717" title="John Gardner (American writer)">
<text>John Champlin Gardner Jr. (July 21, 1933 – September 14, 1982) was an American novelist, essayist, literary critic, and university professor. He is best known for his 1971 novel &quot;Grendel&quot;, a retelling of the Beowulf myth from the monster&#x27;s point of view.

==Early life and education==
Gardner was born in Batavia, New York. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught third grade at a small school in a nearby village. Both parents were fond of poetry, and would often recite their favorite poetry and poetry they wrote about life on the farm at friends&#x27; homes. Gardner was active in The Boy Scouts of America and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. The young Gardner attended public school and worked on his father&#x27;s farm.

In April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a cultipacker. Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother&#x27;s death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks. The incident informed much of Gardner&#x27;s fiction and criticism — most directly in the 1977 short story &quot;Redemption,&quot; which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.

Gardner began his university education at DePauw University, and received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1955. He received his MA (1956) and PhD (1958) from the University of Iowa. He was a distinguished visiting professor at the University of Detroit in 1970.

==Fiction==
Gardner&#x27;s best-known novels include &quot;The Sunlight Dialogues&quot;, about a disaffected policeman asked to engage a madman fluent in classical mythology; &quot;Grendel&quot;, a retelling of the Beowulf legend from the monster&#x27;s point of view, with an existential subtext; and &quot;October Light&quot;, about an embittered brother and sister living and feuding with each other in rural Vermont (the novel includes an invented &quot;trashy novel&quot; that the woman reads). This last book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976.

==&quot;The Life and Times of Chaucer&quot;==
In 1977, Gardner published &quot;The Life and Times of Chaucer&quot;. In a review in the October 1977 issue of &quot;Speculum&quot;, Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation. Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer Peter Prescott, writing in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, cited the &quot;Speculum&quot; article and accused Gardner of plagiarism, a claim that Gardner met &quot;with a sigh.&quot;

==&quot;On Moral Fiction&quot;==

In 1978, Gardner&#x27;s book of literary criticism, &quot;On Moral Fiction&quot;, sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; (July, 1979). His judgments of contemporary authors—including John Updike, John Barth and other American authors—harmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, &quot;Mickelsson&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;, although literary critics later praised the book. Gore Vidal found &quot;On Moral Fiction&quot;, as well as Gardner&#x27;s novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the &quot;late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university.&quot;

==Teaching==
Gardner was a life-long teacher of fiction writing. He was associated with the Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference. He wrote two books on the craft of writing fiction: &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; and &quot;On Becoming a Novelist.&quot;

Gardner inspired and, according to Raymond Carver, sometimes intimidated his students. At Chico State College (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;Blackberry Winter,&quot; Gardner said, &quot;You&#x27;d better read it again.&quot; &quot;And he wasn&#x27;t joking&quot;, said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;On Becoming a Novelist&quot;. In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor.

In addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at Oberlin College (1958–1959), San Francisco State College (1962–1965), Southern Illinois University Carbondale (1965–1974), Bennington College, and Binghamton University (1974–1982).

==Family life==
Gardner married Joan Louise Patterson on June 6, 1953; the marriage, which produced children, ended in divorce in 1980. Gardner married poet and novelist Liz Rosenberg in 1980; this marriage ended in divorce in 1982.

==Death==
Gardner died in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, on September 14, 1982. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna. The crash was four days before his planned marriage to Susan Thornton He was buried next to his brother Gilbert in Batavia&#x27;s Grandview Cemetery.

<text>Pickfair is a mansion and estate in the city of Beverly Hills, California. The original Pickfair was an estate designed by architect Horatio Cogswell for attorney Lee Allen Phillips of Berkeley Square as a country home. Phillips sold the property to actor Douglas Fairbanks in 1918. Dubbed &quot;Pickfair&quot; by the press, it became one of the most celebrated houses in the world. &quot;Life&quot; described Pickfair as &quot;a gathering place only slightly less important than the White House... and much more fun.&quot;

== History ==
Located at 1143 Summit Drive in San Ysidro Canyon in Beverly Hills, the property was a hunting lodge when purchased by Fairbanks in 1919 for his bride-to-be, Mary Pickford. In the 1920s, the newlyweds extensively renovated the lodge, transforming it into a four-story, 25-room mansion complete with stables, servants quarters, tennis courts, a large guest wing, and garages.

Remodeled by Wallace Neff in a mock Tudor style, it took five years to complete. Ceiling frescos, parquet flooring, wood paneled halls of fine mahogany and bleached pine, gold leaf and mirrored decorative niches, all added to the authentic charm of Pickfair. The property was said to have been the first private home in the Los Angeles area to include an in-ground swimming pool, in which Pickford and Fairbanks were famously photographed paddling a canoe.

Pickfair featured a collection of early 18th-century English and French period furniture, decorative arts and antiques. Notable pieces in the collection included furniture from the Barberini Palace, the Baroness Burdett-Coutts estate in London, and Louis XVI furniture from the Countess Rodezno and Lord Leverhulme collections. The highlight of any visit to Pickfair was a large collection of Chinese objets d&#x27;art collected by Fairbanks and Pickford on their many visits to the Orient. The Pickfair art collection was wide and varied and included paintings by Philip Mercier, Guillaume Seignac, George Romney, and Paul de Longpré.

The mansion also featured an Old West-style saloon complete with an ornate burnished mahogany bar obtained from a saloon in Auburn, California, as well as paintings by Frederic Remington. In the 1970 Volume 2, Number 10 issue of &quot;Mankind Magazine&quot; it states there were twelve Remingtons from 1907 purchased from the Cosmopolitan Publishing Company that &quot;were Mary Pickford&#x27;s gift to her husband, Charles &#x27;Buddy&#x27; Rogers&quot;. The interior of Pickfair was decorated and updated throughout the years by Marilyn Johnson Tucker, Elsie De Wolfe, Marjorie Requa, Tony Duquette, and Kathryn Crawford.

During the 1920s the house became a focal point for Hollywood&#x27;s social activities, and the couple became famous for entertaining there. An invitation to Pickfair was a sign of social acceptance into the closed Hollywood community. In 1928, Will Rogers said &quot;My most important duty as mayor of Beverly Hills is directing people to Mary Pickford&#x27;s house&quot;.

Dinners at Pickfair became legendary; guests included Charlie Chaplin (who lived next door), the Duke of Windsor and Duchess of Windsor, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, Mildred Harris, Greta Garbo, George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H.G. Wells, Lord Louis Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Tony Duquette, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joan Crawford, Noël Coward, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, Pearl S. Buck, Charles Lindbergh, Max Reinhardt, Arthur Conan Doyle, Thomas Edison, Gloria Swanson, the Duke and Duchess of Alba, the King and Queen of Siam, Austen Chamberlain, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, the spiritual teacher Meher Baba, and Sir Harry Lauder. Lauder&#x27;s nephew, Matt Lauder Jr., a professional golfer whose family had a property at Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California, taught Fairbanks to play golf.

Fairbanks and Pickford divorced in January 1936, but Pickford continued to reside in the mansion with her third husband, actor and musician Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers, until her death in 1979. Pickford received few visitors in her later years, but continued to open up her grand home for charitable organizations and parties, including an annual Christmas party for blind war veterans, mostly from World War I.

In 1976, Pickford received a second Academy Award for contribution to American film. The Academy Honorary Award was presented to her in the formal living room of Pickfair, and televised on the 48th Academy Awards. Introduced and narrated by Gene Kelly, it provided the public a very rare glimpse inside the fabled mansion.

== Sale, demolition, and rebuild ==
Empty for several years after Pickford&#x27;s death in 1979, Pickfair was eventually sold to Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss, who continued to care for the home, updating and preserving much of its unique charm. In 1988, it was purchased by actress Pia Zadora and her husband Meshulam Riklis. They announced they were planning renovations to the famous estate, but revealed in 1990 that they had in fact demolished Pickfair and a new larger &quot;Venetian style palazzo&quot; was going to be constructed in its place. In 1990, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that all but the guest wing and part of the living room had been razed.

Faced with harsh criticism from a nostalgic public, including Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Zadora defended her family&#x27;s actions, stating that the house was allegedly in a poor state of repair and was infested by termites. In the &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, Fairbanks was quoted as saying, &quot;I regret it very much. I wonder, if they were going to demolish it, why they bought it in the first place.&quot;

In 2012, Zadora claimed on the BIO channel&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; that the real reason she demolished Pickfair was not due to termite infestation but because it was haunted by the laughing ghost of a woman who allegedly died there while having an affair with the elder Fairbanks. Defending her actions, Zadora explained, &quot;If I had a choice, I never would have torn down this old home. I loved this home, it had a history, it had a very important sense about it and you can deal with termites, and you can deal with plumbing issues, but you can&#x27;t deal with the supernatural.&quot;

Remaining artifacts from the original Pickfair include the gates to the estate, the kidney-shaped pool and pool house, remnants of the living room, as well as the two-bedroom guest wing that played host to visiting royalty and notable film celebrities for over half a century. The guest wing was once used as a honeymoon suite for Lord Louis and Lady Mountbatten.

Located at 1143 Summit Drive in Beverly Hills, UNICOM Global bought the mansion on April 19, 2005, for $15,000,000. The property included a gym, disco room, and sits on . UNICOM Global now uses it for meetings, conferences and events.

== In popular culture ==
Zadora&#x27;s purchase and subsequent demolition of Pickfair is referenced in Deborah Harry and Iggy Pop&#x27;s version of &quot;Well, Did You Evah!&quot;. Pop claims he was invited to Pia Zadora&#x27;s house but didn&#x27;t go, later saying &quot;I hear they dismantled Pickfair... wasn&#x27;t elegant enough&quot;, to which Harry replies &quot;probably full of termites&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Krusty the Klown&#x27;s mansion is named &quot;Schtickfair&quot; in an homage.

Lucille Ball stated that she and husband Desi Arnaz were inspired by the combination of names in Pickfair to name their own estate (and later studio) Desilu.

<text>The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called British New Guinea. There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened &quot;on or about&quot; 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, which accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of New Guinea were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of Papua at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity; it was a Possession of the Crown whereas the Territory of New Guinea was initially a League of Nations mandate territory and subsequently a United Nations trust territory. This legal and political distinction remained until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea in 1975.

Papua made up the southern half of what is today Papua New Guinea and contained the territory&#x27;s capital, Port Moresby, which then became the capital of the independent country.

==History==
===Background===
Archeological evidence suggests that humans arrived on New Guinea at least 60,000 years ago. These Melanesian people developed stone tools and agriculture. Portuguese and Spanish navigators sailing in the South Pacific entered New Guinea waters in the early part of the 16th century and in 1526–27, Don Jorge de Meneses came upon the principal island, which the locals called &quot;Papua&quot;. In 1545, the Spaniard Íñigo Ortiz de Retez gave the island the name &quot;New Guinea&quot;, because he saw a resemblance between the islands&#x27; inhabitants and those found on the African region of Guinea. European knowledge of the interior of the island remained scant for several centuries after these initial encounters.

===Annexation===

In 1883 Sir Thomas McIlwraith, the Premier of Queensland, ordered Henry Chester (1832–1914), the police magistrate on Thursday Island, to proceed to Port Moresby and annex the eastern half of New Guinea. The reason given for annexation was the apparent German interest in annexing the area, evidenced by an article in the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. Chester made the proclamation on 4 April 1883, but the imperial British government disapproved of the annexation: the British Colonial Secretary Lord Derby emphasised in a despatch to the Queensland government that such an action was beyond Queensland&#x27;s constitutional powers as a British colony.

On 6 November 1884, after the Australian colonies had promised financial support, the territory became a British protectorate. On 4 September 1888 the protectorate was annexed by Britain, together with some adjacent islands, which were collectively named British New Guinea. In 1902, the British parts of Papua were effectively transferred to the authority of the new Commonwealth of Australia. With the passage of the Papua Act 1905, the area was officially renamed the Territory of Papua, and Australian administration formally began in 1906.

Meanwhile, the northern part of New Guinea was under German commercial control from 1884, and from 1899 was directly ruled by the German government as the colony of German New Guinea, then known as &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelmsland&quot;. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Australia invaded Kaiser-Wilhelmsland on 11 September 1914 with 2000 volunteers of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. After several skirmishes, the Australians succeeded in capturing the German colony, which they occupied for the rest of the war. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 transferred German New Guinea to Australia, which administered it as the Territory of New Guinea.

===World War II===

Shortly after the start of the Pacific War, the island of New Guinea was invaded by the Japanese. Papua was the least affected region. Most of West Papua, at that time known as Dutch New Guinea, was occupied, as were large parts of the Territory of New Guinea (the former German New Guinea, which was also under Australian rule after World War I), but Papua was protected to a large extent by its southern location and the near-impassable Owen Stanley Ranges to the north. Civil administration was suspended during the war and both territories (Papua and New Guinea) were placed under martial law for the duration.

The New Guinea campaign opened with the battles for New Britain and New Ireland in the Territory of New Guinea in 1942. Rabaul, the capital of the Territory, was overwhelmed on 22–23 January and was established as a major Japanese base from where the Japanese landed on mainland New Guinea and advanced towards Port Moresby and Australia. Having had their initial effort to capture Port Moresby by a seaborne invasion disrupted by the U.S. Navy and Australian navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted a landward attack from the north via the Kokoda Track. From July 1942, a few Australian reserve battalions, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action against the Japanese attack, over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges. The militia, worn out and severely depleted by casualties, held out with the assistance of Papuan porters and medical assistants, and were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force, returning from action in the Mediterranean Theatre.

In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay, near the eastern tip of Papua. They were beaten back by the Australian Army, and the Battle of Milne Bay was the first outright defeat of Japanese land forces during World War II. The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943–44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces. The Supreme Commander of operations was the United States General Douglas Macarthur, with Australian General Thomas Blamey taking a direct role in planning, and operations being essentially directed by staff at New Guinea Force headquarters in Port Moresby. Bitter fighting continued in New Guinea between the largely Australian force and the Japanese 18th Army based in New Guinea until the Japanese surrender in 1945.

===Administrative unification with New Guinea===
After the war, the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949 united the Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. However, for the purposes of Australian nationality a distinction was maintained between the two territories. The act provided for a Legislative Council (which was established in 1951), a judicial system, a public service, and a system of local government.

Under Australian Minister for External Territories Andrew Peacock, the territory adopted self-government in 1972 and on 15 September 1975, during the term of the Whitlam government in Australia, the Territory became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.

<text>28 Days are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1997, by mainstay members Jay Dunne as lead vocalist, guitarist Simon Hepburn, and bassist Damian Gardiner. Their second studio album &quot;Upstyledown&quot; (July 2000), peaked at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart. Their singles, &quot;Rip It Up&quot; (May 2000), &quot;Say What?&quot; (November 2001) and &quot;What&#x27;s the Deal?&quot; (October 2002), all reached the associated ARIA Singles Chart top 40. After declining popularity following their 2004 album, &quot;Extremist Makeover&quot;, the band released a greatest hits album &quot;10 Years of Cheap Fame&quot; (March 2007) before separating later that year. They reformed in 2009 to support long time friends Bodyjar on their End is Now Tour. 28 Days have released no new material since &quot;Unmarked Graves&quot; (April 2015). Their drummer, Scott Murray, died after being struck by a car in November 2001, aged 22.

==History==

===1997–1999: Formation to &quot;Kid Indestructible&quot;===

28 Days were formed in Frankston, Victoria in October 1996 by James &quot;Jay&quot; Dunne on lead vocals, Simon Hepburn on lead guitar (the pair had worked together both on graffiti and in several punk and hardcore bands including Mindsnare, S.I.C., and Self Reliance), Damian Gardiner on bass guitar and Adam Nanscawen ( Adam Bomber) on drums.

Their self-titled debut album, was released independently in March 1998 via Stubble Records. Music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, observed it gained, &quot;a wave of encouraging reviews from journalists worldwide, including a 4K rating from &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in the U.K.&quot; Within a year they were signed by Festival Mushroom Records for a new imprint, Sputnik. During 1998 the band added Jay Howard on turntables and then replaced Bomber on drums by Scott Murray. In May 1999 the group released &quot;Kid Indestructible&quot;, a five-track extended play, which was engineered by Kalju Tonuma. The EP peaked number 69 on the ARIA Charts. National youth radio Triple J played its tracks, &quot;Kool&quot; and &quot;La Tune&quot;, on high rotation. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, Tonuma was nominated for Engineer of the Year for his work.

===2000–2002:&quot;Upstyledown&quot; and &quot;Stealing Chairs&quot;===

28 Days released another five-track EP, &quot;Here We Go&quot; (February 2000), which included the single, &quot;Sucker&quot;. The EP debuted at number 21 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Rip It Up&quot; was released in May and peaked at number 12. In July they released their second studio album, &quot;Upstyledown&quot;, which debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts and was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70000 copies. It also reached the top 40 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. Two further singles were released from the album, &quot;Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Song for Jasmine&quot;.

The group issued a DVD, &quot;When Dickheads Snap&quot; (2001), featuring tour shots, and behind-the-scenes footage from concerts in Europe, Japan and Australia. In November 2001 the band released, &quot;Say What?&quot;, a collaboration with British electronic group, Apollo 440, which reached number 23 on the ARIA Charts. On 18 November 2001 Scott Douglas Murray died, aged 22, after being struck by a car while walking home after band practice.

Vince Jukic joined in August 2002 as Murray&#x27;s replacement on drums. The band released &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, in that month, as the lead single from their third studio album, &quot;Stealing Chairs&quot; (September 2002). The album peaked at number six and was certified gold. &quot;What&#x27;s the Deal?&quot; was released in October and appeared at number 32.

===2003–2007: &quot;Extremist Makeover&quot; and hiatus===

In February 2003, the band received negative publicity when they and their fans were accused of causing damage worth $4,500 at a concert by rival Sydney-based alt-rock band, the Drugs. The damage was allegedly in response to an open letter that the Drugs&#x27; lead singer, Ian Baddley (Matt Downey), had posted on his band&#x27;s website. Baddley wrote that, at 28 Days&#x27; 2003 Big Day Out performance in Sydney, Dunne had provided &quot;improper, unhealthy and bigoted messages of hate and vilification [which] are far worse then [sic] anything I&#x27;ve ever heard from a member of Rammstein.&quot; A report in &quot;The Age&quot; concluded that Baddley was &quot;accusing [Dunne] of being homophobic and using hateful labels.&quot; Dunne did not reply to Baddley, and denies being homophobic; he described the situation as &quot;a bit gay&quot;. 28 Days were not charged by police despite the Drugs&#x27; accusations.

28 Days issued a single, &quot;Like I Do&quot; (March 2004), followed by &quot;Use It&quot; (August) and &quot;Birthday&quot; (October), but none reached the top 50. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Extremist Makeover&quot; (October 2004), peaked at number 31 and the group left Festival Mushroom in the following month. A month before the album appeared, Matt Bray was replaced by Adrian Griffin on drums. In March 2006, the band self-released a six-track EP, &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back&quot;, and another DVD, &quot;When Dickheads Snap 3&quot; which was only available at 28 Days shows. The band announced their 10 Years of Cheap Fame Tour and a compilation album of the same name appeared in March 2007. The band retired late in 2007.

===2009–2018: Reformation and &quot;Lost Songs&quot;===

28 Days reformed in 2009 with the line-up of Dunne, Gardner, Hepburn and Griffin. In May they released a new demo on their MySpace page. They supported Bodyjar&#x27;s farewell tour in November of that year and played the Fistful of Awesome showcase at Melbourne&#x27;s Hi Fi Bar, with up and coming rock acts. In April 2010, 28 Days released a single, &quot;Sing It to Me&quot;. In 2013 they issued, &quot;Amber Afternoons&quot;, and another six-track EP, &quot;Lost Songs&quot;, which is a collection of rare tracks. Their final single, &quot;Unmarked Graves&quot;, appeared in April 2015. Subsequently no new material and their official website has not been updated since mid-2013. They continue to play live regularly despite no new music being in the works.

<doc id="603746" wikidata="Q964937" url="?curid=603746" title="Capital Punishment (Big Pun album)">
<text>Capital Punishment is the debut studio album by American rapper Big Pun, released by RED, Loud Records and Fat Joe&#x27;s Terror Squad Productions. Released on April 28, 1998, it is the only album released during his lifetime and is regarded as a hip-hop classic, described by Black Thought of the Roots as &quot;super groundbreaking&quot; upon release. The album peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts and number one on the Top R&amp;B Albums chart for two weeks. It was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards, but lost to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot;. It was also the first solo Latin hip hop record to go Platinum.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; said that &quot;as a character, Punisher often falls into routine street posturing but the personality is as solid as big body that accompanies it.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated: &quot;Everything about this Bronx-bred Puerto Rican rapper is generous, his 400-pound girth, his multiple rhyming within each line, and his talent for spewing out verses without stopping for breath.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; wrote: &quot;Displaying huge lyrical prowess and the requisite &#x27;sensitive&#x27; side...[the album] established Pun as a serious rival to Biggie Smalls and something of a ladykiller to boot... Outrageously good.&quot; &quot;The Source&quot; determined that &quot;he&#x27;ll rhyme every possible word in a line because he wants to be twice as nice... &quot;Capital Punishment&quot;&#x27;s all about execution.&quot; &quot;Rap Pages&quot; concluded that &quot;Big Pun is at his best with all barrels firing bullets lacing the air like embroidery on grandmama&#x27;s quilt.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Capital Punishment&quot; on its list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time&quot;, at 128.

<doc id="603757" wikidata="Q745358" url="?curid=603757" title="Downtown Seattle">
<text>Downtown is the central business district of Seattle, Washington. It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the U.S. West Coast due to its geographical situation, being hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as &quot;Uptown&quot;), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is Capitol Hill to the northeast and Central District to the east; on the south by S Dearborn Street, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay, a part of Puget Sound.

==Neighborhoods==

Belltown, Denny Triangle, the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of First Hill west of Broadway make up downtown Seattle&#x27;s chief neighborhoods. Near the center of downtown is the Metropolitan Tract which is owned by the University of Washington; prior to 1895 it served as the location of the university&#x27;s campus. Downtown is Seattle&#x27;s financial and commercial maritime hub as well as its center of nightlife and shopping. The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by a monorail.

==Landmarks==
Downtown Seattle&#x27;s Columbia Center has 76 floors, a greater number than any other building west of the Mississippi River (although there are taller buildings in Texas and California). Smith Tower, in the Pioneer Square area, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi. Other notable buildings are the 1201 Third Avenue (formerly the Washington Mutual Tower), Two Union Square, Nordstrom&#x27;s flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi. Downtown parks include Westlake Park, Freeway Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park. The Olympic Sculpture Park was completed on the Belltown waterfront in January 2007. Downtown is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market, the oldest continually operating farmers&#x27; market in the United States and the core of activity in the area.

The neighborhood had dozens of street clocks in the early 20th century to advertise businesses; by 1950, only 24 were left in the entire city. , downtown has four remaining street clocks.

==History==

After abandoning &quot;New York Alki&quot;, the Denny Party moved across the then-named Duwamish Bay in April 1852 to a low level marsh situated with a safe deep water harbor, located roughly in the city&#x27;s Pioneer Square district. They named this new frontier &quot;Duwamps&quot;. In the late 1850s, present day downtown Seattle became the main residential outskirts of the city. After the Great Seattle Fire, the business district was moved to the area. Several of the city&#x27;s hills around downtown were regraded starting around 1876.

==Expansion==
With about 65,000 people living in Seattle&#x27;s core neighborhoods as of 2015, the downtown area&#x27;s population is growing. Downtown saw a 10 percent increase in the number of occupied housing units and an 8 percent increase in population between 2010 and 2014, outpacing growth in the city as a whole. As of the end of 2014, there were 32 apartment and 2 condominium projects under construction, representing over 5,000 units.

In 1989, building heights in Downtown and adjoining Seattle suburbs were tightly restricted following a voter initiative. These restrictions were dramatically loosened in 2006, leading to the increase in high-rise construction. This policy change has divided commentators between those who support the increased density and those who criticize it as &quot;Manhattanization.&quot;

, Downtown Seattle has 82,000 residents and 300,000 jobs, including 48,000 added since 2010 in the Denny Triangle area. The downtown area has of office space, representing 79 percent of citywide inventory and 55 percent of commercial properties in the city. Office construction continues apace in Downtown Seattle, with planned to open in 2019, along with 161 projects.

==Economy==

Downtown Seattle is the largest employment center in the Puget Sound region, with an estimated employee population of 243,995 in 2013, accounting for half of the city&#x27;s jobs and 21 percent of King County jobs. Several Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Downtown Seattle include Amazon, Nordstrom, and Expeditors International. South Korean online retailer Coupang moved their headquarters from Seoul to Downtown Seattle in 2022.

==Government and infrastructure==

The United States Postal Service operates the Seattle Main Post Office (also known as the Midtown Post Office) at 301 Union Street at Third Avenue. Seattle City Hall is located at 600 4th Ave, adjacent to the King County Courthouse. Downtown is serviced by the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which carries Link light rail trains between Westlake and Chinatown–International District. The terminus for the Seattle Center Monorail is located at Westlake Center. A large number of bus lines also run through; those operated by Metro were previously free of charge while in the now-defunct Ride Free Area. Other buses from the suburbs operated by Sound Transit Express and Community Transit also terminate in downtown.

<doc id="603768" wikidata="Q7522965" url="?curid=603768" title="Singapore Expo">
<text>Singapore Expo (stylised as Singapore EXPO) is the largest convention and exhibition venue in Singapore with over 100,000 square metres of column-free, indoor space spread over 10 halls. The center was designed by Cox Richardson Rayner, built by PSA International, and funded by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

The S$220 million building (excluding the cost of the 40,000 m² expansion) is located in Tampines, Singapore.

Singapore Expo was officially opened on 4 March 1999. It has since been managed by Constellar Venues Private Limited (formerly known as SingEx Venues Private Limited), a fully owned subsidiary of Temasek Holdings and Singapore Press Holdings.
==Facilities==
Singapore Expo Convention and Exhibition Center is the largest meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) venue in Singapore and is one of the largest and most completely equipped centre in the whole of Asia. There are ten large multipurpose halls, each being 10,000 square metres in size, giving a total floor space of over 100,000 square metres. All available spaces are interconnected, column-free and on the ground level.

Ten conference halls are also available, ranging in size from 89 to 844 square metres, suitable for accommodating 150 to 1,000 people. In addition, there are meeting rooms which can seat 15 to 125 members.

The original Singapore Expo building comprised six interconnected halls of 10,000 square metres each, with column free-spaces and ceiling heights of up to 16 metres. Each hall is self-contained and is linked to the other halls by air-conditioned walkways. An additional 40,000 square metres (four new halls) were completed on 15 September 2005 and linked to the original building across Expo Drive via a sheltered walkway.

In addition, the MAX Atria @ Singapore Expo opened on 22 March 2012 as part of Singapore Expo&#x27;s expansion. It caters for changing needs of meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions participants and is an environmentally-friendly building. In addition, it is the first venue to provide free WiFi for participants.

A carpark for 2,200 vehicles is also available, which can be converted into 25,000 square metres of outdoor exhibition space. It is connected to the MRT train network through the nearby Expo MRT station, allowing access via East West MRT line and Downtown MRT line.

==History==
With the exhibition space at the World Trade Centre slated for redevelopment, a replacement venue that could exceed the 34,000 square metres of indoor space was needed. The initial phase of the construction on the building thereby commenced on 30 May 1997, in spite of the impact the Asian financial crisis had on the economy, and it was completed two years later when the building was officially opened on 4 March 1999. Critics predicted that the halls would be under-utilised and further worsened by its relatively remote location, compared to the old World Trade Centre, or the Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre which had opened earlier in 1995. Bus (Services 12 and 24) and taxi services were the primary mode of transportation commuters took to reach Singapore Expo, both of which were overwhelmed during peak hours. This led to a pressing need for an MRT station connecting to the MRT route to both Changi Airport and the town, together with the merger of bus service 220 and 290 to form 38, running from Tampines to Bedok.

The initial years almost proved the critics right, although the venue made a quick turnaround within a few years. The opening of the Expo MRT station on 10 January 2001 was a boost to the venue, which was experiencing increasing usage for functions including conventions, exhibitions, rock concerts, New Year parties, beauty pageants, musicals, and even as examination halls for educational institutions.

By 2003, demand for ever bigger exhibition space prompted the Singapore Expo to proceed with its expansion plans, especially in response to the needs of IMTA Asia, which was slated to be held from 17 to 21 October 2005. With the inaugural show already occupying the full 60,000 square metres of space, pressure was on the venue to expand, or the prestigious event may have to move somewhere else since there is no other bigger venue available in Singapore. In response, a new 40,000 square metre expansion comprising a further four halls was constructed adjacent to the existing halls across Expo Drive in double quick time to meet the expected exhibition period, and was completed on 15 September that year.

Since 2001, the Bethesda Community church has been renting the Singapore Expo Meeting Rooms for weekly services. Since December 2005, the largest church in Singapore, City Harvest Church, used Hall 8 of the Singapore Expo on a weekly basis, while the 10,000-member Faith Community Baptist Church used Hall 10 (The Max Pavilion) till the Urban Redevelopment Authority imposed their terms of religious organisations leasing venues of not more than in February 2011.

Another expansion was done to cater for the changing needs of MICE participants with the MAX Atria @ Singapore Expo, which opened on 22 March 2012. The building has environmentally-friendly features and provides free WiFi for participants, the first in Asia to do so.

===Downtown line connection===

Singapore Expo has been connected to the Downtown line after the Downtown line portion of Expo MRT station began operations.

=== Use as community care facility during COVID-19 pandemic ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the Singapore Expo was temporarily converted to an isolation facility to house COVID-19 patients who were recovering or displayed mild symptoms only, and had been operational since 10 April 2020. Cubicles were set up across two halls, with each cubicle featuring everyday necessities for daily living such as beds, chairs, lamps, charging points and WiFi coverage, on top of communal facilities such as shared toilets and food distribution points. In addition to staff from healthcare providers Parkway Pantai and Woodlands Health Campus, about 100 soldiers (comprising regulars, full-time national servicemen and operationally ready national servicemen) from the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corps were also deployed at the Singapore Expo to look after the patients.

Since 10 April 2020, patients were transferred to Singapore Expo as it had already been set up as a Community Isolation Facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Treaty of Knäred (, ) was signed on 21 January 1613 and ended the Kalmar War (1611–1613) between Denmark-Norway and Sweden. The peace negotiations came about under an English initiative. The peace was guaranteed by King James I of England and VI of Scotland.

The treaty was named after the village of Knäred in Halland, where it was signed at a border bridge in what was then the Danish Halland. The peace meant that the kingdoms restored the conquests made during the war. Under the terms of the treaty, Sweden would give back Jemtland and Herjedalen to Norway.
Denmark-Norway would give back Borgholm, Kalmar and Öland.

As a result, Sweden also had to pay the Älvsborg Ransom of one million Rixdollars for the return of the fortress of Älvsborg. The ransom was paid by 1619.

A memorial stone over the site was erected between Knäred and Markaryd in 1925 by the Halland Art Museum (&quot;Hallands konstmuseum&quot;).

<doc id="603770" wikidata="Q2073253" url="?curid=603770" title="Cooper's ligaments">
<text>Cooper&#x27;s ligaments (also known as the suspensory ligaments of Cooper and the fibrocollagenous septa) are connective tissue in the breast that help maintain structural integrity. They are named for Astley Cooper, who first described them in 1840. Their anatomy can be revealed using transmission diffraction tomography.

Cooper&#x27;s suspensory ligament should not be confused with the pectineal ligament (sometimes called the inguinal ligament of Cooper) which shares the same eponym. Also, the intermediate fibers and/or the transverse part of the ulnar collateral ligament are sometimes called Cooper&#x27;s ligament(s).

==Structure==
The ligaments run from the clavicle and the clavipectoral fascia, branching out through and around breast tissue to the dermis of the skin overlying the breast. The intact ligament suspends the breast from the clavicle and the underlying deep fascia of the upper chest. This has the effect of supporting the breast in its normal position, and maintaining its normal shape. Without the internal support of this ligament, the breast tissue (which is heavier than the surrounding fat) sags under its own weight, losing its normal shape and contour.

==Clinical significance==

The suspensory ligaments of Cooper play an important role in the change in appearance of the breast that often accompanies the development of inflammatory carcinoma of the breast in which blockage of the local lymphatic ducts causes swelling of the breast. Because the skin remains tethered by the suspensory ligaments of Cooper, it takes on a dimpled appearance reminiscent of the peel of an orange (peau d&#x27;orange). Carcinomas can also decrease the length of Cooper&#x27;s ligaments leading to a dimpling.

==Relationship to sagging==

Many women believe that sagging (ptosis) is caused by the failure of the Cooper&#x27;s ligaments to support the breast tissue. In fact, ptosis is partly determined by genetic factors, but a review found that the biggest factors are higher body mass index, larger breast size, significant weight loss, smoking, her number of pregnancies, and her age.

Many women incorrectly believe that wearing a brassiere prevents their breasts from sagging later in life and that breasts cannot anatomically support themselves. But bra manufacturers have stated that because breasts are formed of fatty tissue and not muscle, bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn.

Pathologically heavy breasts may cause pain in the woman&#x27;s upper thoracic area, but this may be due to a poorly-fitting bra. Numerous reports state that 80–85% of women are wearing the wrong bra size.

In middle-aged women, breast ptosis is caused by a combination of factors. If the woman has had children, postpartum hormonal changes will cause the depleted milk glands to atrophy. Women who experience multiple pregnancies repeatedly stretch the skin envelope during engorgement while lactating. As a woman&#x27;s breasts grow in size during repeated pregnancies, the Cooper&#x27;s ligaments that maintain the position of the mammary glands against the chest are stretched and gradually lose strength. Breast tissue and suspensory ligaments may also be stretched if the woman is overweight or loses and gains weight.
