<text>Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (8 September 18925 December 1963) was a Pakistani Bengali barrister and politician. In Bangladesh, Suhrawardy is remembered as a pioneer of Bengali civil rights movements, later turned into Bangladesh independence movement, and the mentor of Bangladesh&#x27;s founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He is also remembered for his performance as the Minister for Civil Supply during the Bengal famine of 1943. In India, he is seen as a controversial figure; directly responsible for the 1946 Calcutta Killings, for which he is often referred as the &quot;Butcher of Bengal&quot; in West Bengal.

He served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1956 to 1957 and before that as the Prime Minister of Bengal from 1946 to 1947 in British India. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh, Suhrawardy is regarded as a patron of separate homeland for the Muslims, especially for Bengali Muslims, for which he is revered as one of the founding statesmen of Pakistan.

Suhrawardy was a scion of one of British Bengal&#x27;s most prominent Muslim families, the Suhrawardy family. His father Sir Zahid Suhrawardy was a judge of the high court in Bengal. Suhrawardy studied law in Oxford. After returning to India, he joined the Indian independence movement during the 1920s as a trade union leader in Calcutta. He was initially associated with the Swaraj Party. He joined the All-India Muslim League and became one of the leaders of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League (BPML). Suhrawardy was elected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1937. In 1946, Suhrawardy led the BPML to decisively win the provincial general election. He served as Bengal&#x27;s last premier until the Partition of India. His premiership was notable for his proposal to create a Free State of Bengal and failing to prevent the Great Calcutta Killings. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League, supported an independent Bengal; this was strongly opposed by the Congress Party. In 1947, the Bengal Assembly voted to partition the territory. Suhrawardy briefly remained in India after partition to attend to his ailing father and manage his family&#x27;s property. He eventually moved to Pakistan and divided his time between Karachi (Pakistan&#x27;s federal capital) and Dhaka (capital of East Pakistan).

In Dhaka, Suhrawardy emerged as the leader of the Bengali-dominated Awami League which became the principal opposition party to the Pakistan Muslim League. In 1956, the centre-left Awami League formed a coalition government with the military-backed Republican Party to unseat the Muslim League. Suhrawardy became Prime Minister in the coalition government. He forged stronger ties with the United States by leading Pakistan&#x27;s diplomacy in SEATO and CENTO. He also became the first Pakistani premier to travel to Communist China. His pro-US foreign policy caused a split in the Awami League in East Pakistan, with Maulana Bhashani forming the break-away pro-Maoist National Awami Party. Suhrawardy&#x27;s premiership lasted for a year. His central cabinet included figures like Sir Feroz Khan Noon as Foreign Minister and Abul Mansur Ahmad as Trade Minister. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was considered Suhrawardy&#x27;s chief political protégé.

Suhrawardy was premier under Pakistan&#x27;s first republican constitution which ended dominion status and the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth. During the 1958 military coup, Suhrawardy was arrested by the martial law government. He missed the wedding of his niece, Salma Sobhan (Pakistan&#x27;s first woman barrister), because of his detention. In 1963, Suhrawardy died in Beirut due to a heart attack. After his death, the Awami League veered towards Bengali nationalism, the 6-point movement, East Pakistani secession and ultimately Bangladeshi independence in 1971. According to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, &quot;Bengalis had initially failed to appreciate a leader of Mr. Suhrawardy&#x27;s stature. By the time they learned to value him, they had run out of time&quot;. Suhrawardy&#x27;s only daughter Begum Akhtar Sulaiman was a social worker and activist in Pakistan; his son, Rashid Suhrawardy, from his second marriage to Vera Alexandrovna Tiscenko Calder; was a British Bangladeshi actor known for his role in the film &quot;Jinnah&quot;. His brother Hasan Shaheed Suhrawardy was a diplomat, writer and art-critic. Many places in South Asia bear his name, including an avenue in Islamabad; a large park near his mausoleum in Dhaka; and streets, dormitories and memorials across Bangladesh. The Suhrawardy family home in modern-day Kolkata has been leased as a Library and Information Centre of the Bangladesh High Commission in India by the city&#x27;s Waqf board.

==Family and early life==

The Suhrawardy family are regarded as one of the illustrious families of the Indian subcontinent. Claiming themselves as descendants of the first caliph of Islam, the Suhrawardy lineage is traced to Shihab al-Din &#x27;Umar al-Suhrawardi, a Sufi who lived in Baghdad during the 12th century. The Suhrawardiyya order is one of the major Sunni orders of Sufism. His grandfather, Ubaidullah Al Ubaidi Suhrawardy, was a Dhaka-based Sufi leader of the Bengali Renaissance and buried beside the Lalbagh Fort. His father Justice Sir Zahid Suhrawardy was a Judge of the Calcutta High Court. His brother Hasan Shaheed Suhrawardy was a linguist, poet, art-critic and diplomat. His uncles included Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Suhrawardy and Sir Abdullah Al-Mamun Suhrawardy. His cousin Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah was one of South Asia&#x27;s pioneering women in public service. His first wife was Begum Niaz Fatima, the daughter of Justice Sir Abdur Rahim, a member of the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council and Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly. Begum Niaz Fatima died in 1922. His second wife was Begum Veera Suhrawardy, a Russian actress of Polish descent.

A young Huseyn studied in Calcutta Madrasa and attended St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Kolkata where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Both Huseyn and his elder brother Hasan studied in St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford. They entertained themselves with D. H. Lawrence, Robert Trevelyn, Bertrand Russell, Hugh Kingsmill, Basanta Kumar Mullick, Kiran Shankar Roy, Apurba Chanda, Sri Prakash, S K Gupta, Surendra Kumar Sen, and Syud Hossain. The elder Suhrawardy (Hasan) was in Oxford when Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore became the first Asian to win a Nobel Prize in 1913. His brother Hasan later recounted that &quot;it is difficult now for me to recapture the elation and the ecstasy of those days, but I remember distinctly that look of awe which was in my landlady&#x27;s eyes when she brought in the breakfast with the morning newspaper containing the scoop&quot;. Suhrawardy obtained further degrees, including a Bachelor of Civil Law from Oxford and a Master of Arts in Arabic from Calcutta. Suhrawardy became a barrister. He was called to the Bar of England and Wales through Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1922–23.

His first son Shahab died of pneumonia. His second son Rashid Suhrawardy was a British theatre actor. Rashid starred in the film &quot;Jinnah&quot; along with Christopher Lee. His granddaughter Shahida Jamil served as Pakistan&#x27;s law minister. His nieces include Princess Sarvath al-Hassan of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; the late Bangladeshi barrister Salma Sobhan; and the film-maker Naz Ikramullah.

==Political career==
===Political organizer===
Suhrawardy was credited as a pioneering modern political organizer in Bengal. He created 36 trade unions among sailors, railway employees, jute and cotton mills workers, rickshaw pullers, cart drivers and other working class groups dominated by Bengali Muslims.

===Deputy Mayor of Calcutta (1924-1926)===
Suhrawardy joined the Swaraj Party led by Bengali Hindu secularist C. R. Das in 1923. He became the Deputy Mayor of Calcutta in 1924. After the death of Das, Suhrawardy turned to Indian Muslim nationalism. He emerged as a leader of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League (BPML), the provincial wing of the Muslim League which his father Zahid had earlier helped create in 1912.

===Bengali Muslim groups===
Suhrawardy formed several Bengali Muslim political groups, including the Calcutta Khilafat Committee during the 1920s amid the dissolution of the Ottoman caliphate and the Turkish War of Independence; the Bengal Muslim Election Board; the United Muslim Party; and the Independent Muslim Party.

===Bengal Legislative Assembly and WWII===
In 1937, Suhrawardy was elected to the newly formed Bengal Legislative Assembly. He was appointed as Minister of Commerce and Labor in the cabinet of the 1st Prime Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq. In 1940, the Lahore Resolution was adopted by Indian Muslim leaders calling for the creation of independent states in eastern and northwestern India; it was unclear if the resolution implied a single state covering the two Muslim-majority regions of India or multiple states. Suhrawardy served as Minister of Civil Supplies in the cabinet of the 2nd Prime Minister of Bengal Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin. According to author Thomas Keneally, Suhrawardy blamed black marketers and the central government in New Delhi for the Bengal famine of 1943 during World War II, and claimed he worked tirelessly on relief. Viceroy Lord Wavell, however, believed that Suhrawardy was corrupt, that he &quot;siphoned money from every project that was undertaken to ease the famine, and awarded to his associates contracts for warehousing, the sale of grain to governments, and transportation.&quot; On the other hand, Indian author, Madhushree Mukherjee, laid major responsibility of this famine to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who wanted the ration for war efforts only and had refrained the U.S. aid to Bengal. Suhrawardy was further accused of practising a Scorched-Earth Policy to counter the Japanese Army&#x27;s advances in the East and supervised to burn thousand fishing boats to block any potential movement of invading Japanese Army troops. These measures aggravated starvation and famine and the relief was only ordered when Lord Wavell became the Viceroy, using the Indian Army to organise relief. However, by that time, the winter crop had arrived and famine conditions had already eased, after millions had earlier perished. Calcutta&#x27;s Hindu-owned newspapers had become very critical of his role and the Bengali Hindus held him directly responsible for the famine.

===Prime Minister of Bengal (1946-1947)===
During the 1946 general election, Suhrawardy led the Bengal Provincial Muslim League (BPML) to a decisive victory. The Muslim League&#x27;s biggest success was in Bengal where out of 119 seats for Muslims, the BPML won 113. Suhrawardy was supported by the League&#x27;s chief Muhammad Ali Jinnah to assume the premiership of Bengal. Suhrawardy&#x27;s cabinet included himself as home minister; Mohammad Ali of Bogra as finance, health and local government minister; Syed Muazzemuddin Hossain as education minister; Ahmed Hossain as agriculture, forest and fisheries minister; Nagendra Nath Roy as judicial and legislative minister; Abul Fazal Muhammad Abdur Rahman as cooperatives and irrigation Minister; Abul Gofran as civil supplies minister; Tarak Nath Mukherjee as waterways minister; Fazlur Rahman as land minister; and Dwarka Nath Barury as works minister.
====Direct Action riots====

Suhrawardy&#x27;s tenure as premier saw the Great Calcutta Killings in 1946. The Muslim League called a strike to press its demand for the creation of Pakistan. The strike degenerated into brutal and widespread Hindu-Muslim riots in which thousands were killed on both sides. The riots were seen by some as the last nail in the coffin for Hindu-Muslim unity in British India.
Troubles started on the morning of 16 August. Even before 10 o&#x27;clock Police Headquarters at Lalbazar had reported that there was excitement throughout the city, that shops were being forced to close, and that there were many reports of brawls, stabbing and throwing of stones and brickbats. These were mainly concentrated in the North-central parts of the city like Rajabazar, Kelabagan, College Street, Harrison Road, Colootolla and Burrabazar. In these areas the Hindus were in a majority and were also in a superior and powerful economic position. The trouble had assumed the communal character which it was to retain throughout.

The meeting began around 2 pm though processions of Muslims from all parts of Calcutta had started assembling since the midday prayers. A large number of the participants were reported to have been armed with iron bars and &quot;lathis&quot; (bamboo sticks). The numbers attending were estimated by a Central Intelligence Officer&#x27;s reporter at 30,000 and by a Special Branch Inspector of Calcutta Police at 500,000. The latter figure is impossibly high and the &quot;Star of India&quot; reporter put it at about 100,000. The main speakers were Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin and Chief Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Khwaja Nazimuddin in his speech preached peacefulness and restraint but spoilt the effect and flared up the tensions by stating that till 11 o&#x27;clock that morning all the injured persons were Muslims, and the Muslim community had only retaliated in self-defence.

The Special Branch of Calcutta Police had sent only one shorthand reporter to the meeting, with the result that no transcript of the Chief Minister&#x27;s speech is available. But the Central Intelligence Officer and a reporter, who Frederick Burrows believed was reliable, deputed by the military authorities agree on one statement (not reported at all by the Calcutta Police). The version in the former&#x27;s report was—&quot;He [the Chief Minister] had seen to police and military arrangements who would not interfere&quot;. The version of the latter&#x27;s was—&quot;He had been able to restrain the military and the police&quot;. However, the police did not receive any specific order to &quot;hold back&quot;. So, whatever Suhrawardy may have meant to convey by this, the impression of such a statement on a largely uneducated audience is construed by some to be an open invitation to disorder indeed, many of the listeners are reported to have started attacking Hindus and looting Hindu shops as soon as they left the meeting. Subsequently, there were reports of lorries (trucks) that came down Harrison Road in Calcutta, carrying hardline Muslim gangsters armed with brickbats and bottles as weapons and attacking Hindu-owned shops.

A 6 pm curfew was imposed in the parts of the city where there had been rioting. At 8 pm forces were deployed to secure main routes and conduct patrols from those arteries, thereby freeing up police for work in the slums and the other underdeveloped sections.

====United Bengal====

In New Delhi on 27 April 1947, Suhrawardy called a press conference to demand an undivided, independent Bengal. Suhrawardy made an impassioned plea for setting aside religious differences in order to create an &quot;independent, undivided, and sovereign Bengal&quot;. He opposed the British government&#x27;s plan to partition India&#x27;s most populous province; he was supported by the Governor of Bengal Frederick Burrows, Sarat Chandra Bose of the Indian National Congress, Kiran Shankar Roy of the Congress Parliamentary Party, Satya Ranjan Bakshi, Secretary of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League Abul Hashim, Bengal Finance Minister Mohammad Ali Chaudhury, Bengal Revenue Minister Fazlur Rahman and Tippera politician Ashrafuddin Chowdhury. Suhrawardy stated the following:-

On 20 May 1947, a five-point plan was outlined for a &quot;Free State of Bengal&quot;, echoing the legacy of the name of the Irish Free State. The plan was based on a confessionalist structure with power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. It mirrored some of the confessionalist practices adopted in French Lebanon in 1926, where the positions of President and Prime Minister rotated among Muslims and Christians. The five-point plan stated that &quot;On the announcement by His Majesty&#x27;s Government that the proposal of the Free State of Bengal had been accepted and that Bengal would not be partitioned, the present Bengal Ministry would be dissolved. A new interim Ministry would be brought into being, consisting of an equal number of Muslims and Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) but excluding the Prime Minister. In this Ministry, the Prime Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu. Pending the final emergence of a Legislature and a Ministry under the new constitutions, Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) and Muslims would have an equal share in the Services, including military and police. The Services would be manned by Bengalis. A Constituent Assembly composed of 30 persons, 16 Muslims and 14 non-Muslims, would be elected by Muslim and non-Muslim members of the Legislature respectively, excluding Europeans&quot;. The British government seriously considered of the option of an independent Bengal. British commercial interests in Bengal required safeguards. The United States was also briefed on the possibility of three countries emerging out of partition, including Pakistan, India, and Bengal. On 2 June 1947, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee informed the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Lewis Williams Douglas that there was a &quot;distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan&quot;. Douglas cabled the State Department about the matter.

===Partition of India===

On 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 126 votes to 90 that if it remained united it should join the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition. Communal violence broke out across India, especially in the Punjab and Bengal&#x27;s Noakhali district. Suhrawardy traveled to Noakhali with Mahatma Gandhi to restore order; Gandhi and Suhrawardy also had deliberations in Calcutta. After the transfer of power on 14–15 August 1947, Suhrawardy continued to remain in India for a few years where he attended to ailing members of his family. He eventually settled down in the Dominion of Pakistan, with residences in the federal capital Karachi and the provincial capital Dhaka. His cousin Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah called for Pakistan&#x27;s constituent assembly to convene in Dacca as East Bengal was home to the majority of Pakistan&#x27;s population.

===Awami League===
Suhrawardy joined the Awami League, a party formed in 1949 to counter the erstwhile ruling Muslim League. Suhrawardy emerged as the centrist leader of the Awami League; while Maulana Bhashani represented more radical leftist factions. The Awami League was often allied with the centre-left Krishak Praja Party of A. K. Fazlul Huq. Suhrawardy&#x27;s chief protégé in East Bengal was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to whom Suhrawardy delegated political responsibilities.
===Law Minister of Pakistan===
Suhrawardy was appointed law minister in 1953 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra. He was in charge of drafting Pakistan&#x27;s constitution.

===United Front===

One of the highlights of Suhrawardy&#x27;s political career was leading the United Front campaign during the 1954 East Bengali election which booted the Muslim League out of power.

===Leader of the Opposition===
At the federal level, Suhrawardy served as Leader of the Opposition in the parliament of Pakistan in 1955. His position was bolstered by the landslide victory in East Bengal in 1954.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan (1956-1957)==
In 1956, the Awami League formed a coalition with Pakistan&#x27;s Republican Party to unseat the previous government. Suhrawardy became the fifth Prime Minister of Pakistan and the second premier under the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan. Suhrawardy was known as a pro-American politician. He also cultivated pragmatic ties with Communist China. Suhrawardy supported the American-led Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). He was not keen on nonalignment which was strongly pursued by neighboring India. Suhrawardy toured the United States, was hosted by President Eisenhower at the White House, and met with American movie stars in Hollywood. In domestic policy, Suhrawardy addressed issues of nuclear energy, foreign aid utilization, food policy, the One Unit framework, and building up the military. His staunchly pro-Western foreign policy was opposed by Bengali radicals led by Maulana Bhashani who caused a split in the Awami League. However, Suhrawardy was elected as President of the Awami League. His cabinet included Feroz Khan Noon and Abul Mansur Ahmed among others.

=== One Unit ===
Initially promising to review the One Unit framework in the 1956 constitution, Prime Minister Suhrwardy later backtracked. At the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrawardy faced pressure from provincialists over the One Unit. West Pakistani provincialists wanted to restore the previous four provinces of Sind, Balochistan, Punjab and the North West Frontier Province. Large rallies were held in West Pakistan against the One Unit. Prime Minister Suhrawardy, however, did not pay attention to the issue. While East Pakistanis also objected to the One Unit for renaming East Bengal as East Pakistan, opposition among ethnic groups to the One Unit was stronger in West Pakistan.

=== Joint electorate ===
Suhrawardy&#x27;s one-year tenure was unable to introduce the joint electorate. Since 1932, elections in Pakistan&#x27;s provinces were held under the &quot;separate electorate&quot; system of dividing seats in parliament among religious groups in accordance with the colonial-era Communal Award. Abolishing the joint electorate was a key demand of the Awami League.
At the National Assembly, the Awami League initiated constitutional reforms to restore the joint electorate system but faced opposition from the Muslim League.
=== Nuclear energy ===

Suhrawardy established the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). He appointed Dr. Nazir Ahmad as its chairman. Suhrawardy supported the Atoms for Peace initiative. Suhrawardy also released funds to import a nuclear swimming pool reactor from America in 1956.

=== Economic policy and foreign aid ===

In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy halted the National Finance Commission (NFC) programme to allocate taxed revenue equally between East and West Pakistan. A poor harvest led to heavy imports that year, mostly in the form of foreign aid, to meet food shortages. The United States agreed to sell $46.4 million in rice, wheat, and other farm products, about 80% of which was covered by aid grants or loans.

The central government led by Suhrawardy focused on the implementation of the planned economy. His relations with the stock exchange and the business community deteriorated when he announced distribution of the US$10 million ICA aid between West and East, and establishing the shipping corporation at the expense of West Pakistan&#x27;s revenues. Massive labour strikes broke out in West Pakistan against his economic policy in major cities of Pakistan. Eventually leaders of the stock exchange met with President Mirza to address their concerns and issues.

=== Foreign policy ===
Suhrawardy in 1957 described Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy as &quot;friendship towards all and malice towards none&quot;, a phrase which was later adopted as Bangladesh&#x27;s foreign policy. Suhrawardy is also considered to be one of the pioneers of Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy aimed, directed, and set towards excessively supporting the United States and their cause, a policy that was pursued by the successive administrations. On 10 July 1957, Prime Minister Suhrawardy paid an official visit to the United States where he met with President Dwight Eisenhower. Suhrawardy accepted Eisenhower&#x27;s request to lease a base in Pakistan from which the United States Air Force could gather intelligence about the Soviet Union. In return, the United States distributed $2.142 billion in aid to Pakistan, including supersonic F-104 Starfighters and M48 Patton tanks. Suhrawardy&#x27;s party, the Awami League, split over his signing of the US-Pakistan military pact, with Maulana Bhasani leaving to form the National Awami Party (NAP). The 1960 U-2 incident severely compromised the national security of Pakistan when Soviet Union eventually discovered the base through interrogating its pilot.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy was invited by the Soviet Union for an informal visit but he declined. In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy became the Pakistan&#x27;s first Prime Minister to visit China. Suhrawardy&#x27;s India policy was at times critical. He demanded a fair share of water sharing on transboundary rivers. Suhrawardy visited Afghanistan and pledged to work for regional peace, decolonization and stability. Suhrawardy also visited Japan and felt the East Asian country was model to emulate in development. He addressed a joint sitting of the Philippines Congress during which he expressed support for SEATO and continued to call for decolonization.

=== Resignation ===
Suhrawardy&#x27;s short-lived premiership came to an end when he resigned under pressure from President Iskander Mirza in 1957.

===Post-coup life===
Suhrawardy was arrested by the martial law government after the 1958 military coup in Pakistan. While in jail, he wrote to his niece Salma Sobhan on the occasion of her wedding to Rehman Sobhan, calling Salma &quot;preternaturally transcendentally intelligent&quot;.

==Criticism==

Suhrawardy is often subjected to criticism by in India for failing to prevent the Direct Action Day riots. According to them, Suhrawardy and other Muslim League leaders reportedly delivered provocative speeches reminding the Bengali Muslims of the historical Islamic victory and urged them to follow the same way on 16 August. The historian Devendra Panigrahi, in his book &quot;India&#x27;s Partition: The Story of Imperialism in Retreat&quot;, quotes from 13 August 1946 issue of Muslim League mouthpiece &quot;The Star of India&quot;, &quot;Muslims must remember that ... it was in &quot;Ramazan&quot; that the permission for &quot;jehad&quot; was granted by Allah. It was in &quot;Ramazan&quot; that the Battle of Badr, the first open conflict between Islam and Heathenism, was fought and won by 313 Muslims and again it was in &quot;Ramazan&quot; that 10,000 Muslims under the Holy Prophet conquered Mecca and established the kingdom of Heaven and the commonwealth of Islam in Arabia. The Muslim League is fortunate that it is starting its action in this holy month&quot;. On 16 August 1946, the massive bloody riots erupted in Calcutta, killings scores of Hindus at the hands of rioters. However, there is no other claim or evidence have been found. Suhrawardy attempted to control the situation by unsuccessfully calling for peace and deployment of the Indian Army in Calcutta with no success. The riots ended with thousand deaths and the Indian press blaming Suhrawardy of obstructing the police work, which is well documented by several authors and eyewitnesses. According to authorities, the riots were instigated by members of the Muslim League and its affiliate Volunteer Corps after listening to the speeches made by Khwaja Nazimuddin and Suhrawardy, in the city in order to enforce the declaration by the Muslim League that Muslims were to &#x27;suspend all business&#x27; to support their demand for an independent Pakistan. However, supporters of the Muslim League believed that the Congress Party was behind the violence in an effort to weaken the fragile Muslim League government in Bengal, further generating the controversy about the real culprits. Historian Joya Chatterji allocates much of the responsibility to Suhrawardy, for setting up the confrontation and failing to stop the rioting, but points out that Hindu leaders were also culpable. A senior intelligence operative wrote to a senior British officer based at Fort William after the &#x27;Great Calcutta Killings&#x27; after the Calcutta riots: &quot;&quot;There is hardly a person in Calcutta who has a good word for Suhrawardy, respectable Muslims included. For years he has been known as &quot;The king of the goondas&quot; and my own private opinion is that he fully anticipated what was going to happen, and allowed it to work itself up, and probably organised the disturbance with his goonda gangs as this type of individual has to receive compensation every now and again.&quot;&quot; According to Tathagata Roy, Suhrawardy had pre-planned the riot long back, evident from the fact that demographic changes were being made in the Calcutta Police constabulary. Recently, Polish scholar Tomasz Flasiński expressed another opinion about Suhrawardy. His research proved, inter alia, that Suhrawardy&#x27;s famous speech during the first day of Calcutta Riot urged Muslims to come back to their homes instead of (as it was often suggested) encouraging them to riot, and in fact the Prime Minister asked the British Army to intervene against hooligans even before that speech. Making use of recently disclosed or hitherto unused sources, he also revealed that Suhrawardy was at odds with Muslim League&#x27;s radical fraction also after Noakhali riots; however, in some other cases of the Hindu-Muslim armed fights (primarily in Calcutta during Spring 1947) he did less to stop the acts of violence than he could, what made him - according to Flasiński - guilty by negligence.

==Death==
Suhrawardy died in Beirut, Lebanon in 1963 due to a heart attack. Many Bengalis were - and some still are - convinced that he was killed on Ayub Khan&#x27;s order, as his popularity may have made him a powerful rival to Ayub in the upcoming presidential elections. He was buried in Dhaka beside Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin and A. K. Fazlul Huq, signifying his towering stature in Bengali politics as one of the three leading Bengali statesmen of the early 20th century.

<doc id="598007" wikidata="Q1391067" url="?curid=598007" title="Tony Leon">
<text>Anthony James Leon (born 15 December 1956) is a South African politician who served as leader of the opposition from 1999-2007 as leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA). He led the DA from its inception in 2000, until his retirement from leadership in 2007. Before that, he led the Democratic Party from 1994. He is the longest-serving leader of the official opposition in parliament since the advent of democracy in 1994. Although still a member of the DA, he served as the South African Ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay under the African National Congress government from 2009 to 2012.

Since 2012, Leon has been serving as Executive Chairman of Resolve Communications (Pty) Ltd - a South African-based advocacy for reputation management and strategic communications consultancy, and a consultant to various international companies. Leon is also a contracted columnist to Arena Holdings Ltd, with his columns appearing weekly or monthly in &quot;Business Day&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and BusinessLive. He is also the author of five books.

==Early life==
Leon was born and raised in Durban during the apartheid era. He was educated at Clifton School (Durban) and Kearsney College near Durban. His father Ramon Leon was a High Court Judge. Both his parents were active in the liberal, anti-apartheid Progressive Party (which later became the Democratic Party). He is Jewish and had his Bar Mitzvah at the Great Synagogue in Durban, where he also attended High Holiday services with his family.

==Political career==
In 1974 at the age of 18, he became an organiser for the Progressive Party, one of the two opposition parties represented in parliament at the time. After this, he qualified as an attorney at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was President of the Law Students&#x27; Council and Vice-President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council, and became a lecturer in the Law Department in 1986. He has accredited Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman as his biggest inspirations. In the same year he was elected to the Johannesburg City Council for Yeoville. When the results for the election were released, it was announced that the National Party candidate Sam Bloomberg had won. However, Harry Schwarz, his political mentor, uncovered that this was untrue, and Leon was declared the winner. He became the leader of the opposition in the city council.

In 1989 he was elected to Parliament for the Houghton constituency, representing the Progressive Party&#x27;s successor, the Democratic Party.

From 1990 to 1994 he chaired the DP&#x27;s Bill of Rights Commission, and as such was an advisor to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and a delegate to the multi-party negotiations that led to the end of apartheid and the establishment of a non-racial democracy in 1994.

At the 1994 general elections, Leon was again elected to Parliament in the first democratic National Assembly, as well as leader of the Democratic Party. At the time, the Democratic Party was perceived as merely a minor party of white liberals, an oddity in the first non-racial democratic government of South Africa. Yet between 1994 and 1999 its seven members managed to become the most vocal, active and involved legislators.

In 1998, Leon published his first book on the eve of the second democratic election, entitled &quot;Hope &amp; Fear: Reflections of a Democrat&quot; (Jonathan Ball, 1998). With the second democratic elections in 1999 and the New National Party only retaining 28 seats (down from 82 in 1994), he became Leader of the Opposition as the DP took 38 seats, showing a growth of over five-fold.

After the 2004 general elections, the DA under Leon had a vote increased by 2.8%, as did the ANC with an increase of 3.3%. These gains came at a cost to three of the five minor opposition parties, with only the Independent Democrats – a newcomer in the elections – also attracting support.

Leon built a high media profile as an opposition leader by criticising the ANC government under Nelson Mandela but more so under his successor, President Thabo Mbeki.

==Post Politics==
On 26 November 2006, Leon announced that he would step down from the leadership of the DA in 2007, and would not accept nomination for the leadership of the party at the party&#x27;s congress in May 2007. He officially stepped down at that conference, and Helen Zille was elected to be the new party leader on 6 May 2007. Leon, nevertheless, kept his seat in Parliament until 2009, when its term expired.

One of South Africa&#x27;s leading political commentator, Justice Malala wrote about him: &quot;Every South African should wake up today and say a little thank you to Tony Leon ... he was fearless when many were fearful, vocal when many had lost their voices, openly critical when many would only speak in whispers ... the man has done a remarkable job.&quot;

Leon was voted 16th in the TV channel SABC3&#x27;s Top 100 Great South Africans.

From September to December 2007, Leon was a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

On 29 November 2007, Mr. Leon was a guest at the prestigious Yale Political Union, keynoting a student debate on the topic &quot;Resolved: The Nation Should Not Be Tied To Ethnicity.&quot; After a vigorous debate, the motion passed.

In 2008, Leon released his autobiography &quot;On the Contrary&quot;. The book was favourably received, &quot;The Economist&quot; describing it as &quot;eloquent, funny and rich... an important record of South Africa’s young democracy, witnessed from the other side of the fence&quot;. The book was also serialized by the Johannesburg &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. The book won the Recht Malan Prize in the Via Afrika Book Awards for the best work of non-fiction in 2009.

In the last quarter of 2008, Leon was a visiting fellow at the Cato Institute Center for Liberty and Global Prosperity in Washington DC. His research paper: &quot;The State of Liberal Democracy in Africa - Resurgence or Recession&quot; was published in May 2010.

Leon published a series of articles in &quot;Business Day&quot; from the campaign trail of the 2009 South African general election.

After Leon completed his over 20 years as an MP, he was invited to write two weekly columns in leading South African Sunday paper &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and in leading daily paper &quot;Business Day&quot;, winning excellent reviews for his writing and analysis even from previous political opponents.

Since 2012, Leon has been a contracted columnist to Arena Holdings Ltd with his columns appearing weekly or monthly in &quot;Business Day&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and the &quot;Business Live&quot;, respectively.

==South African ambassadorship and return to South Africa==
In August 2009, President Zuma appointed Leon as Ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. After receiving diplomatic training, Leon took up his post in September. Leon followed many DA and Democratic Party members who became ambassadors, such as Harry Schwarz, Zach de Beer, Douglas Gibson and Sandra Botha.

On his return in January 2013, he was awarded a fellowship at the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS). He wrote a paper entitled &quot;Where in the World is South Africa?&quot;, which was subsequently published in the &quot;South African Journal of International Affairs&quot;, 2013, Vol.20, No.3,447-457. Leon also published a memoir of his ambassadorial life titled &quot;The Accidental Ambassador: From Parliament to Patagonia&quot; (Pan MacMillan, 2013). The book received critical acclaim with &quot;Business Day&quot;, where it was said to be &quot;fascinating... Leon is an excellent writer and recounter... eloquent and heartwarming.&quot; (Sue Grant-Marshall). The &quot;Cape Times&quot; described the book as &quot;intelligent, engaging and incredibly funny&quot; (Shaun Swingler).

==Nelson Mandela==

Shortly after former President Nelson Mandela&#x27;s death in December 2013, Tony Leon published another book, this time concerning Mandela&#x27;s presidency and leadership from the perspective of the parliamentary opposition. &quot;Opposite Mandela: Encounters with South Africa&#x27;s Icon&quot; was published in May 2014 by Jonathan Ball Publishers. Sue Grant-Marshall in Business Day wrote: &quot;It is no surprise that in the year after Mandela&#x27;s death a cascade of books by those who know the international icon are flooding the shops and bookshelves. Leave space for this one - it&#x27;s written from Leon&#x27;s particular perspective as Mandela&#x27;s political opponent. It does not disappoint in this, his fourth book, for he tells fascinating tales with characteristic frankness and vigour.&quot;

== New Book: &quot;Future Tense, Reflections of My Troubled Land, 2021.&quot; ==
In March 2021, Jonathan Ball Publishers released Tony Leon&#x27;s latest book: &quot;Future Tense - Reflections on My Troubled Land&quot;. Drawing from his vantage points of years in active politics and his subsequent career as an opinion former and columnist, this book captures and analyses recent South African history, with a focus on the squandered and corrupted years of the past decade. It also provides an insider view, for the first time, of the power struggles within the Democratic Alliance and plots the country&#x27;s likely future trajectory. The book was favourably reviewed by Niall Ferguson.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Leon married Michal (formerly Even-Zahav) from Israel, the mother of his two stepchildren, Noa and Etai Even-Zahav.

<doc id="598010" wikidata="Q59281" url="?curid=598010" title="Provisional government">
<text>A provisional government, also called an interim government, an emergency government, a transitional government or provisional leadership, is a temporary government formed to manage a period of transition, often following state collapse, revolution, civil war, or some combination thereof.

Provisional governments generally come to power in connection with a grave crisis that has caused the previous government to suddenly and irreversibly collapse, such as economic collapse, civil war, defeat in a foreign war, revolution, or the death of a long-serving authoritarian ruler. Questions of democratic transition and state-building are often fundamental to the formation and policies of such governments.

Provisional governments maintain power until a new government can be appointed by a regular political process, which is generally an election. They may be involved with defining the legal structure of subsequent regimes, guidelines related to human rights and political freedoms, the structure of the economy, government institutions, and international alignment.

Provisional governments differ from caretaker governments, which are responsible for governing within an established parliamentary system and serve temporarily after an election, vote of no confidence or cabinet crisis, until a new government can be appointed. Caretaker governments operate entirely within the existing constitutional framework and most countries tightly circumscribe their authority, in contrast to provisional governments, which often operate in the absence of any elected legislature and usually enjoy expansive, if temporary, powers.

In opinion of Yossi Shain and Juan J. Linz, provisional governments can be classified to four groups:

# Revolutionary provisional governments (when the former regime is overthrown and the power belongs to the people who have overthrown it).
# Power sharing provisional governments (when the power is shared between former regime and the ones who are trying to change it).
# Incumbent provisional governments (when the power during transitional period belongs to the former regime).
# International provisional governments (when the power during the transitional period belongs to the international community).

The establishment of provisional governments is frequently tied to the implementation of transitional justice. Provisional governments may be responsible for implementing transitional justice measures as part of the path to establishing a permanent government structure.

The early provisional governments were created to prepare for the return of royal rule. Irregularly convened assemblies during the English Revolution, such as Confederate Ireland (1641–49), were described as &quot;provisional&quot;. The Continental Congress, a convention of delegates from 13 British colonies on the east coast of North America became the provisional government of the United States in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The government shed its provisional status in 1781, following ratification of the Articles of Confederation, and continued in existence as the Congress of the Confederation until it was supplanted by the United States Congress in 1789.

The practice of using &quot;provisional government&quot; as part of a formal name can be traced to Talleyrand&#x27;s government in France in 1814. In 1843, American pioneers in the Oregon Country, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America established the Provisional Government of Oregon—as the U.S. federal government had not yet extended its jurisdiction over the region—which existed until March 1849. The numerous provisional governments during the Revolutions of 1848 gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal government established to prepare for elections.

Numerous provisional governments have been established since the 1850s.

== Africa ==
As of 2024, eleven African countries currently have provisional governments: Algeria, Cameroon, Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia&#x27;s Tigray Region, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Gabon. The provisional governments in Algeria and Cameroon exist in opposition to the current government, while the rest formally administer their respective nations. Additionally, the Cameroonian provisional government currently exists in a splintered state, with several organizations claiming sole legitimacy.
* Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (1958–1962) (guerrilla movement)
* The Derg (1974–1987), formed during the Ethiopian Civil War following the overthrow of emperor Haile Selassie. Ultimately absorbed into the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
* Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979–1980), a short-lived yet internationally unrecognized sovereign state formed in the waning years of the Rhodesian Bush War, in contrast with the reestablished Southern Rhodesia. Ultimately dissolved in favor of granting independence to Southern Rhodesia as Zimbabwe.
* Transitional Military Council (1985–1986), interim government of Sudan following the 1985 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état. Dissolved following the 1986 Sudanese parliamentary election.
* Transitional Government of National Unity (Namibia) (1985–1989), interim government during the end of the South African Border War
* Political Bureau of the Central Committee of FRELIMO (1986), interim ruling body of the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique following the death of president Samora Machel in the 1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash. Dissolved following the election of Joaquim Chissano as Machel&#x27;s successor later that year.
* Transitional Government of Ethiopia (1991–1995), established upon the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front&#x27;s overthrow of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia at the end of the Ethiopian Civil War. Succeeded by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
* Interim Government of Somalia (1991–1997), established after the collapse of the Somali Democratic Republic and the onset of the Somali Civil War.
* Provisional Government of Eritrea (1993), established after independence from Ethiopia
* Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (1994–1996), interim ruling body of the Gambia following the 1994 Gambian coup d&#x27;état. Dissolved after Yahya Jammeh, the head of the ruling council, was elected and inaugurated as president.

<doc id="598011" wikidata="Q2305146" url="?curid=598011" title="Lyonesse Trilogy">
<text>The Lyonesse Trilogy is a group of three fantasy novels by Jack Vance, set in the European Dark Ages, in the mythical Elder Isles west of France and southwest of Britain, a generation or two before the birth of King Arthur. The stories contain references to Atlantis and Arthurian mythology, particularly to the mythical country of Lyonesse. They are told in several related storylines which are not always strictly chronological.

== Plot summary ==

=== &quot;Lyonesse&quot; (also known as &quot;Suldrun&#x27;s Garden&quot;) ===
King Casmir of Lyonesse arranges the marriage of his daughter Suldrun to Faude Carfilhiot, Duke of Vale Evander. Princes Aillas and Trewan of Troicinet are sent on a sea voyage to visit the various kingdoms of the Elder Isles to gain experience at statecraft; Aillas is eventually pushed overboard and washes up at Lyonesse. Faude Carfilhiot, wanting to be a powerful magician but lacking the patience to learn the necessary skills, schemes with his lover Tamurello. Suldrun cares for Aillas secretly and bears a son Dhrun to him. Aillas is imprisoned and Dhrun taken by the fairies and replaced with the changeling Madouc. Suldrun suicides.

=== &quot;The Green Pearl&quot; ===
King Casmir plots to destabilize South Ulfland by sending two agents, Sir Shalles and Torqual. Torqual plans to conquer all of the Elder Isles for himself. Aillas pursues and captures Lady Tatzel, declaring she is now his slave. She resists, but ends up falling in love with him. Glyneth is kidnapped by Visbhume and taken to the alternate world Tanjecterly as part of a plot by Casmir and Tamurello.

=== &quot;Madouc&quot; ===
During an unauthorized outing into a forest, Princess Madouc is separated from her bodyguard and discovers her mother, the fairy Twisk, and learns the truth. She meets Prince Dhrun at a reception and shares her knowledge with him.

King Casmir continues to plot against Aillas by funding the exploits of the Ska renegade Torqual, which however have little effect against Aillas&#x27;s precautions.

Shimrod the wizard, at Murgen&#x27;s request, investigates mysterious demonic apparitions in Ys, which appear to involve Melancthe. Shimrod disguises himself as a Scythian bravo to infiltrate Torqual&#x27;s band. While there, he disrupts a plot to assassinate King Aillas and kidnap Dhrun.

Madouc&#x27;s guardian, King Casmir, attempts to arrange a marriage for her. When she refuses, the king punishes her by making Madouc the prize in a quest for the Holy Grail. Madouc&#x27;s response is to seek the Grail herself. She and Pimfydd (&quot;Sir Pom Pom&quot;) travel to the castle where the Grail is, kill the Ogre Throop, and retrieve the Grail. The Grail itself is an anticlimax which does nothing to improve her relationship with her parents.

Torqual and Melancthe arrive at Murgen&#x27;s home. Desmei orders Torqual to free the Green Pearl so she can be whole, but the Ska instead release Tamurello. Desmei&#x27;s physical form is destroyed, and Tamurello tries to free Joald with the help of Torqual simply to spite Murgen. Joald manages to partially wrench free, and his presence in the Atlantic causes a massive tsunami that wipes out Ys instantly and the majority of Vale Evander soon thereafter. Before they can cause the downfall of the entire island however, Tamurello is defeated and Torqual is beheaded. Desmei and Tamurello are sent to an alternate dimension where one of Murgen&#x27;s associates annihilates them utterly in supernatural fire. The Green Pearl is revealed to be a corrupting magical force and an element of a much larger inter-dimensional war, which Murgen has been trying to keep from reaching Earth.

Casmir, emboldened by the news of the destruction of Vale Evander, wars against Dahaut. Dahaut is conquered, but this causes an attack on Casmir by Aillas. The Troice army routs Casmir&#x27;s army, and Casmir enters the battle but soon flees back towards Lyonesse Town. Casmir discovers to his dismay that Lyonesse Town has been captured in his absence. Queen Sollace was exiled to Europe after the castle is captured and the Grail is lost again, to be sought later by King Arthur.

Casmir is taken prisoner and spends the rest of his life in a cell ruminating over his defeat. Aillas declares himself king of the Elder Isles, and Dhrun his heir. He brings peace to the realm. Glyneth, now his queen, gives birth to her and Aillas&#x27; daughter, Serle. Madouc and Dhrun are in love, and when Twisk is summoned to partake in the celebrations she recognizes Shimrod as Madouc&#x27;s father.

==Reception==
&quot;Lyonesse: Madouc&quot; received the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1990.

<text>In signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents. This is done by assuming that at most one subcomponent is Gaussian and that the subcomponents are statistically independent from each other. ICA was invented by Jeanny Hérault and Christian Jutten in 1985. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common example application of ICA is the &quot;cocktail party problem&quot; of listening in on one person&#x27;s speech in a noisy room.

== Introduction ==

Independent component analysis attempts to decompose a multivariate signal into independent non-Gaussian signals. As an example, sound is usually a signal that is composed of the numerical addition, at each time t, of signals from several sources. The question then is whether it is possible to separate these contributing sources from the observed total signal. When the statistical independence assumption is correct, blind ICA separation of a mixed signal gives very good results. It is also used for signals that are not supposed to be generated by mixing for analysis purposes.

A simple application of ICA is the &quot;cocktail party problem&quot;, where the underlying speech signals are separated from a sample data consisting of people talking simultaneously in a room. Usually the problem is simplified by assuming no time delays or echoes. Note that a filtered and delayed signal is a copy of a dependent component, and thus the statistical independence assumption is not violated.

Mixing weights for constructing the &quot;formula_1&quot; observed signals from the formula_2 components can be placed in an formula_3 matrix. An important thing to consider is that if formula_2 sources are present, at least formula_2 observations (e.g. microphones if the observed signal is audio) are needed to recover the original signals. When there are an equal number of observations and source signals, the mixing matrix is square (&quot;formula_6&quot;). Other cases of underdetermined (&quot;formula_7&quot;) and overdetermined (&quot;formula_8&quot;) have been investigated.

The success of ICA separation of mixed signals relies on two assumptions and three effects of mixing source signals. Two assumptions:
#The source signals are independent of each other.
#The values in each source signal have non-Gaussian distributions.
Three effects of mixing source signals:
#Independence: As per assumption 1, the source signals are independent; however, their signal mixtures are not. This is because the signal mixtures share the same source signals.
#Normality: According to the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of a sum of independent random variables with finite variance tends towards a Gaussian distribution.Loosely speaking, a sum of two independent random variables usually has a distribution that is closer to Gaussian than any of the two original variables. Here we consider the value of each signal as the random variable.
#Complexity: The temporal complexity of any signal mixture is greater than that of its simplest constituent source signal.
Those principles contribute to the basic establishment of ICA. If the signals extracted from a set of mixtures are independent and have non-Gaussian distributions or have low complexity, then they must be source signals.

== Defining component independence ==
ICA finds the independent components (also called factors, latent variables or sources) by maximizing the statistical independence of the estimated components. We may choose one of many ways to define a proxy for independence, and this choice governs the form of the ICA algorithm. The two broadest definitions of independence for ICA are

# Minimization of mutual information
# Maximization of non-Gaussianity

The Minimization-of-Mutual information (MMI) family of ICA algorithms uses measures like Kullback-Leibler Divergence and maximum entropy. The non-Gaussianity family of ICA algorithms, motivated by the central limit theorem, uses kurtosis and negentropy.

Typical algorithms for ICA use centering (subtract the mean to create a zero mean signal), whitening (usually with the eigenvalue decomposition), and dimensionality reduction as preprocessing steps in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the problem for the actual iterative algorithm. Whitening and dimension reduction can be achieved with principal component analysis or singular value decomposition. Whitening ensures that all dimensions are treated equally &quot;a priori&quot; before the algorithm is run. Well-known algorithms for ICA include infomax, FastICA, JADE, and kernel-independent component analysis, among others. In general, ICA cannot identify the actual number of source signals, a uniquely correct ordering of the source signals, nor the proper scaling (including sign) of the source signals.

ICA is important to blind signal separation and has many practical applications. It is closely related to (or even a special case of) the search for a factorial code of the data, i.e., a new vector-valued representation of each data vector such that it gets uniquely encoded by the resulting code vector (loss-free coding), but the code components are statistically independent.

== Mathematical definitions ==

Linear independent component analysis can be divided into noiseless and noisy cases, where noiseless ICA is a special case of noisy ICA. Nonlinear ICA should be considered as a separate case.

=== General ===

The data are represented by the observed random vector formula_9 and the hidden components as the random vector formula_10 The task is to transform the observed data formula_11 using a linear static transformation formula_12 as formula_13 into a vector of maximally independent components formula_14 measured by some function formula_15 of independence.

=== Generative model ===

==== Linear noiseless ICA ====

The components formula_16 of the observed random vector formula_9 are generated as a sum of the independent components formula_18, formula_19:

formula_20

weighted by the mixing weights formula_21.

The same generative model can be written in vector form as formula_22, where the observed random vector formula_23 is represented by the basis vectors formula_24. The basis vectors formula_25 form the columns of the mixing matrix formula_26 and the generative formula can be written as formula_27, where formula_28.

Given the model and realizations (samples) formula_29 of the random vector formula_23, the task is to estimate both the mixing matrix formula_31 and the sources formula_14. This is done by adaptively calculating the formula_33 vectors and setting up a cost function which either maximizes the non-gaussianity of the calculated formula_34 or minimizes the mutual information. In some cases, a priori knowledge of the probability distributions of the sources can be used in the cost function.

The original sources formula_14 can be recovered by multiplying the observed signals formula_23 with the inverse of the mixing matrix formula_37, also known as the unmixing matrix. Here it is assumed that the mixing matrix is square (formula_38). If the number of basis vectors is greater than the dimensionality of the observed vectors, formula_39, the task is overcomplete but is still solvable with the pseudo inverse.

==== Linear noisy ICA ====

With the added assumption of zero-mean and uncorrelated Gaussian noise formula_40, the ICA model takes the form formula_41.

==== Nonlinear ICA ====

The mixing of the sources does not need to be linear. Using a nonlinear mixing function formula_42 with parameters formula_43 the nonlinear ICA model is formula_44.

=== Identifiability ===

The independent components are identifiable up to a permutation and scaling of the sources. This identifiability requires that:

* At most one of the sources formula_18 is Gaussian,
* The number of observed mixtures, formula_46, must be at least as large as the number of estimated components formula_47: formula_48. It is equivalent to say that the mixing matrix formula_31 must be of full rank for its inverse to exist.

== Binary ICA ==

A special variant of ICA is binary ICA in which both signal sources and monitors are in binary form and observations from monitors are disjunctive mixtures of binary independent sources. The problem was shown to have applications in many domains including medical diagnosis, multi-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management.

Let formula_50 be the set of binary variables from formula_46 monitors and formula_52 be the set of binary variables from formula_47 sources. Source-monitor connections are represented by the (unknown) mixing matrix formula_54, where formula_55 indicates that signal from the &quot;i&quot;-th source can be observed by the &quot;j&quot;-th monitor. The system works as follows: at any time, if a source formula_56 is active (formula_57) and it is connected to the monitor formula_58 (formula_59) then the monitor formula_58 will observe some activity (formula_61). Formally we have:

:formula_62

where formula_63 is Boolean AND and formula_64 is Boolean OR. Noise is not explicitly modelled, rather, can be treated as independent sources.

The above problem can be heuristically solved by assuming variables are continuous and running FastICA on binary observation data to get the mixing matrix formula_54 (real values), then apply round number techniques on formula_54 to obtain the binary values. This approach has been shown to produce a highly inaccurate result.

Another method is to use dynamic programming: recursively breaking the observation matrix formula_67 into its sub-matrices and run the inference algorithm on these sub-matrices. The key observation which leads to this algorithm is the sub-matrix formula_68 of formula_67 where formula_70 corresponds to the unbiased observation matrix of hidden components that do not have connection to the formula_56-th monitor. Experimental results from show that this approach is accurate under moderate noise levels.

The Generalized Binary ICA framework introduces a broader problem formulation which does not necessitate any knowledge on the generative model. In other words, this method attempts to decompose a source into its independent components (as much as possible, and without losing any information) with no prior assumption on the way it was generated. Although this problem appears quite complex, it can be accurately solved with a branch and bound search tree algorithm or tightly upper bounded with a single multiplication of a matrix with a vector.

== Methods for blind source separation ==

=== Projection pursuit ===

Signal mixtures tend to have Gaussian probability density functions, and source signals tend to have non-Gaussian probability density functions. Each source signal can be extracted from a set of signal mixtures by taking the inner product of a weight vector and those signal mixtures where this inner product provides an orthogonal projection of the signal mixtures. The remaining challenge is finding such a weight vector. One type of method for doing so is projection pursuit.

Projection pursuit seeks one projection at a time such that the extracted signal is as non-Gaussian as possible. This contrasts with ICA, which typically extracts &quot;M&quot; signals simultaneously from &quot;M&quot; signal mixtures, which requires estimating a &quot;M&quot; × &quot;M&quot; unmixing matrix. One practical advantage of projection pursuit over ICA is that fewer than &quot;M&quot; signals can be extracted if required, where each source signal is extracted from &quot;M&quot; signal mixtures using an &quot;M&quot;-element weight vector.

We can use kurtosis to recover the multiple source signal by finding the correct weight vectors with the use of projection pursuit.

The kurtosis of the probability density function of a signal, for a finite sample, is computed as

:formula_72

where formula_73 is the sample mean of formula_74, the extracted signals. The constant 3 ensures that Gaussian signals have zero kurtosis, Super-Gaussian signals have positive kurtosis, and Sub-Gaussian signals have negative kurtosis. The denominator is the variance of formula_74, and ensures that the measured kurtosis takes account of signal variance. The goal of projection pursuit is to maximize the kurtosis, and make the extracted signal as non-normal as possible.

Using kurtosis as a measure of non-normality, we can now examine how the kurtosis of a signal formula_76 extracted from a set of &quot;M&quot; mixtures formula_77 varies as the weight vector formula_78 is rotated around the origin. Given our assumption that each source signal formula_79 is super-gaussian we would expect:
#the kurtosis of the extracted signal formula_74 to be maximal precisely when formula_81.
#the kurtosis of the extracted signal formula_74 to be maximal when formula_78 is orthogonal to the projected axes formula_84 or formula_85, because we know the optimal weight vector should be orthogonal to a transformed axis formula_84 or formula_85.

For multiple source mixture signals, we can use kurtosis and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) to recover the signals. Given &quot;M&quot; signal mixtures in an &quot;M&quot;-dimensional space, GSO project these data points onto an (&quot;M-1&quot;)-dimensional space by using the weight vector. We can guarantee the independence of the extracted signals with the use of GSO.

In order to find the correct value of formula_78, we can use gradient descent method. We first of all whiten the data, and transform formula_89 into a new mixture formula_90, which has unit variance, and formula_91. This process can be achieved by applying Singular value decomposition to formula_89,

: formula_93

Rescaling each vector formula_94, and let formula_95. The signal extracted by a weighted vector formula_78 is formula_97. If the weight vector w has unit length, then the variance of y is also 1, that is formula_98. The kurtosis can thus be written as:

:formula_99

The updating process for formula_78 is:
:formula_101
where formula_102 is a small constant to guarantee that formula_78 converges to the optimal solution. After each update, we normalize formula_104, and set formula_105, and repeat the updating process until convergence. We can also use another algorithm to update the weight vector formula_78.

Another approach is using negentropy instead of kurtosis. Using negentropy is a more robust method than kurtosis, as kurtosis is very sensitive to outliers. The negentropy methods are based on an important property of Gaussian distribution: a Gaussian variable has the largest entropy among all continuous random variables of equal variance. This is also the reason why we want to find the most nongaussian variables. A simple proof can be found in Differential entropy.
:formula_107

y is a Gaussian random variable of the same covariance matrix as x

:formula_108

An approximation for negentropy is
:formula_109 
A proof can be found in the original papers of Comon; it has been reproduced in the book &quot;Independent Component Analysis&quot; by Aapo Hyvärinen, Juha Karhunen, and Erkki Oja This approximation also suffers from the same problem as kurtosis (sensitivity to outliers). Other approaches have been developed. 
:formula_110
A choice of formula_111 and formula_112 are 
:formula_113 and formula_114

=== Based on infomax ===

Infomax ICA is essentially a multivariate, parallel version of projection pursuit. Whereas projection pursuit extracts a series of signals one at a time from a set of &quot;M&quot; signal mixtures, ICA extracts &quot;M&quot; signals in parallel. This tends to make ICA more robust than projection pursuit.

The projection pursuit method uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure the independence of the extracted signal, while ICA use infomax and maximum likelihood estimate to ensure the independence of the extracted signal. The Non-Normality of the extracted signal is achieved by assigning an appropriate model, or prior, for the signal.

The process of ICA based on infomax in short is: given a set of signal mixtures formula_89 and a set of identical independent model cumulative distribution functions(cdfs) formula_116, we seek the unmixing matrix formula_117 which maximizes the joint entropy of the signals formula_118, where formula_119 are the signals extracted by formula_117. Given the optimal formula_117, the signals formula_122 have maximum entropy and are therefore independent, which ensures that the extracted signals formula_123 are also independent. formula_116 is an invertible function, and is the signal model. Note that if the source signal model probability density function formula_125 matches the probability density function of the extracted signal formula_126, then maximizing the joint entropy of formula_127 also maximizes the amount of mutual information between formula_89 and formula_122. For this reason, using entropy to extract independent signals is known as infomax.

Consider the entropy of the vector variable formula_118, where formula_119 is the set of signals extracted by the unmixing matrix formula_117. For a finite set of values sampled from a distribution with pdf formula_126, the entropy of formula_122 can be estimated as:
:formula_135
The joint pdf formula_136 can be shown to be related to the joint pdf formula_126 of the extracted signals by the multivariate form:
:formula_138

where formula_139 is the Jacobian matrix. We have formula_140, and formula_141 is the pdf assumed for source signals formula_142, therefore,
:formula_143
therefore,
:formula_144

We know that when formula_145, formula_136 is of uniform distribution, and formula_147 is maximized. Since
:formula_148
where formula_149 is the absolute value of the determinant of the unmixing matrix formula_117. Therefore,
:formula_151
so,
:formula_152
since formula_153, and maximizing formula_117 does not affect formula_155, so we can maximize the function
:formula_156
to achieve the independence of the extracted signal.

If there are &quot;M&quot; marginal pdfs of the model joint pdf formula_157 are independent and use the commonly super-gaussian model pdf for the source signals formula_158, then we have
:formula_159

In the sum, given an observed signal mixture formula_89, the corresponding set of extracted signals formula_74 and source signal model formula_162, we can find the optimal unmixing matrix formula_117, and make the extracted signals independent and non-gaussian. Like the projection pursuit situation, we can use gradient descent method to find the optimal solution of the unmixing matrix.

=== Based on maximum likelihood estimation ===

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a standard statistical tool for finding parameter values (e.g. the unmixing matrix formula_117) that provide the best fit of some data (e.g., the extracted signals formula_165) to a given a model (e.g., the assumed joint probability density function (pdf) formula_125 of source signals).

The ML &quot;model&quot; includes a specification of a pdf, which in this case is the pdf formula_125 of the unknown source signals formula_168. Using ML ICA, the objective is to find an unmixing matrix that yields extracted signals formula_169 with a joint pdf as similar as possible to the joint pdf formula_125 of the unknown source signals formula_168.

MLE is thus based on the assumption that if the model pdf formula_125 and the model parameters formula_173 are correct then a high probability should be obtained for the data formula_174 that were actually observed. Conversely, if formula_173 is far from the correct parameter values then a low probability of the observed data would be expected.

Using MLE, we call the probability of the observed data for a given set of model parameter values (e.g., a pdf formula_125 and a matrix formula_173) the &quot;likelihood&quot; of the model parameter values given the observed data.

We define a &quot;likelihood&quot; function formula_178 of formula_117:

formula_180

This equals to the probability density at formula_174, since formula_182.

Thus, if we wish to find a formula_117 that is most likely to have generated the observed mixtures formula_174 from the unknown source signals formula_168 with pdf formula_125 then we need only find that formula_117 which maximizes the &quot;likelihood&quot; formula_178. The unmixing matrix that maximizes equation is known as the MLE of the optimal unmixing matrix.

It is common practice to use the log &quot;likelihood&quot;, because this is easier to evaluate. As the logarithm is a monotonic function, the formula_117 that maximizes the function formula_178 also maximizes its logarithm formula_191. This allows us to take the logarithm of equation above, which yields the log &quot;likelihood&quot; function

formula_192

If we substitute a commonly used high-Kurtosis model pdf for the source signals formula_193 then we have

formula_194

This matrix formula_117 that maximizes this function is the maximum likelihood estimation.

== History and background ==

The early general framework for independent component analysis was introduced by Jeanny Hérault and Bernard Ans from 1984, further developed by Christian Jutten in 1985 and 1986, and refined by Pierre Comon in 1991, and popularized in his paper of 1994. In 1995, Tony Bell and Terry Sejnowski introduced a fast and efficient ICA algorithm based on infomax, a principle introduced by Ralph Linsker in 1987. A link exists between maximum-likelihood estimation and Infomax approaches. A quite comprehensive tutorial on the maximum-likelihood approach to ICA has been published by J-F. Cardoso in 1998.

There are many algorithms available in the literature which do ICA. A largely used one, including in industrial applications, is the FastICA algorithm, developed by Hyvärinen and Oja, which uses the negentropy as cost function, already proposed 7 years before by Pierre Comon in this context. Other examples are rather related to blind source separation where a more general approach is used. For example, one can drop the independence assumption and separate mutually correlated signals, thus, statistically &quot;dependent&quot; signals. Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber showed how to obtain non-linear ICA or source separation as a by-product of regularization (1999). Their method does not require a priori knowledge about the number of independent sources.

== Applications ==

ICA can be extended to analyze non-physical signals. For instance, ICA has been applied to discover discussion topics on a bag of news list archives.

Some ICA applications are listed below:

* optical Imaging of neurons 
* neuronal spike sorting 
* face recognition 
* modelling receptive fields of primary visual neurons 
* predicting stock market prices 
* mobile phone communications 
* colour based detection of the ripeness of tomatoes
* removing artifacts, such as eye blinks, from EEG data.
* predicting decision-making using EEG
* analysis of changes in gene expression over time in single cell RNA-sequencing experiments.
* studies of the resting state network of the brain.
* astronomy and cosmology
* finance

Shaheen founded an investment and technology development company focused on emerging economies in Asia in 1987.

<doc id="598055" wikidata="Q2532274" url="?curid=598055" title="Volkstümliche Musik">
<text>Volkstümliche Musik (German for &quot;folksy/traditional/popular music&quot;) is a modern popular derivation of the traditional &quot;Volksmusik&quot; genre of German-speaking regions. Though it is often marketed as &quot;Volksmusik&quot;, it differs from traditional folk music in that it is commercially performed by celebrity singers and concentrates on newly created sentimental and cheerful feel-good compositions. Volkstümliche Musik is sometimes instrumental, but usually presented by one or especially two singers and is most popular amongst an adult audience in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and also in South Tyrol (Italy), Alsace-Moselle (France), Netherlands, Flanders (Belgium), Slovenia, Silesia (Poland) and northern Croatia.

==Characteristics==
Closely related to the German schlager genre, many titles stress a Heimat affect, being presented in regional dialects (e.g. Bavarian, Upper Saxon, Low German) or colloquial language (e.g. Rhinelandic) and invoke local and regional lifestyles and traditions, particularly dances. Brass and Alpine musical instruments, such as Alphorns, Zithers, acoustic guitars, violas, and harmonicas are frequently featured, although most commercial productions nowadays employ drum machines and synthesizers. Yodeling is also common.

==History==
From the early 1960s onwards, Volkstümliche Musik was conceived for commercial reasons as a counterweight to youth-oriented rock and pop music. The adjective &quot;volkstümlich&quot; refers to the borrowing of German folklore elements, connecting them to virtually all kinds of light dance and popular music of the 19th and early 20th centuries, from waltz to swing music. The large popularity of this music genre led to the development of &quot;volkstümliche&quot; record charts and various radio and television broadcasts with popular presenters like Carolin Reiber or Maria Hellwig.

&quot;Volkstümliche Musik&quot; was influenced by Flower Power songs as well as by popular classical pieces during the 1970s and has been increasingly mingled with schlager music, promoted by successful singers like Heino serving as a model for performers like Die Flippers, Andy Borg or Kristina Bach. Its diffusion was further boosted by comprehensive TV broadcasting with some of the most popular programmes including &quot;Musikantenstadl&quot; (since 1981), &quot;Grand Prix der Volksmusik&quot; (1986–2010) and &quot;Lustige Musikanten&quot; with Marianne &amp; Michael. Beside Volkstümliche Musik, these telecasts also feature big bands, country and even samba music.

In East Germany, too, there was a Volkstümliche Musik scene, with Eberhard Hertel being a very popular performer. He also introduced his daughter Stefanie to the scene, performing with her. She is now a famous performer in her own right. Both continued their careers after German Reunification.

==Reception==
Modelled on immensely popular &quot;Musikantenstadl&quot;, since the early 1990s Volkstümliche Musik features strongly in numerous peak-time television broadcasts on German, Austrian and Swiss public TV networks including ARD, ZDF, ORF and Schweizer Fernsehen as well as several regional TV networks and local radio stations. Commercial broadcasters nowadays tend to stay clear of it because it is not very popular with the commercially desirable younger target groups up to 49 years of age, however, there are several cable and satellite television stations focusing on the genre.

Not unlike schlager, Volkstümliche Musik is often belittled by younger or more sophisticated audiences as a massively commercialized product created for the lower strata of society, conveying idyllic, reactionary, irrational ideas. Those holding these views sometimes sarcastically deride the expression &quot;volkstümliche Musik&quot; (folksy/folk-like music) by replacing the &quot;-tümlich&quot;(-like)-suffix by &quot;-dümmlich&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;featherbrained&quot;, turning it into &quot;folk-featherbrained Music&quot;, e.g. dim-witted, daft or dopey. Sociological surveys confirm a predominant conservative attitude among the target population, who often feel that Volkstümliche Musik performances provide a means of stress alleviation and escapism. In this perception, Volkstümliche Musik differs somewhat from its ancestor, the traditional folk (&quot;Volksmusik&quot;), which continues to be performed by many local groups and orchestras in different areas.

The Volkstümliche Musik market is the largest section of the music business in German-speaking areas. Due to the advanced age of the main target group, copyright infringement has not been prevalent so far.

===United Kingdom===

Though the term is mainly unknown in the United Kingdom, volkstümliche Musik has attracted a fanbase there including BBC Radio Manchester commentator, Ian Cheeseman. A number of British singers have also been attracted to this style of music, even featuring on &quot;Musikantenstadl&quot;, such as Ross Antony, Tony Christie and Roger Whittaker.

<text>Marcel Chevalier (28 February 1921 in Montrouge, Hauts-de-Seine – 8 October 2008 in Vendôme) worked as the last chief executioner (Monsieur de Paris) in France. 

==Life==
He succeeded his wife&#x27;s uncle, André Obrecht, in 1976 and held his position until 1981, when capital punishment was abolished under president François Mitterrand and justice minister Robert Badinter. The method of application of the death penalty for civilian capital offences in France from 1791 to 1981 was beheading with the guillotine. Military executions were by firing squad.

Chevalier, who started his executioner&#x27;s career in 1958, performed about 40 executions. After his appointment as chief executioner on 1 October 1976, he executed only two people. They were the last two executions in France:
*Jérôme Carrein, condemned twice for the murder and rape of an eight-year-old girl, was guillotined on 23 June 1977 in Douai.
*Hamida Djandoubi, for having tortured and strangled his former nurse, was guillotined on 10 September 1977 in Marseille.

Chevalier worked as a printer after his retirement. He was married to Marcelle Obrecht with whom he had two children. His son Éric was present at Carrein&#x27;s and Djandoubi&#x27;s executions in order to prepare him for succession to chief executioner upon his father&#x27;s eventual retirement.

Chevalier was interviewed by the press on a number of occasions, but later, disillusioned by the sensationalist nature of press coverage, chose to say nothing of his experiences with the guillotine.

<text>The Holy Crown of Hungary ( , ), also known as the Crown of Saint Stephen, named in honour of Saint Stephen I of Hungary, was the coronation crown used by the Kingdom of Hungary for most of its existence; kings were crowned with it since the twelfth century. The Crown symbolized the King&#x27;s authority over the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (the Carpathian Basin), and it was a key mark of legitimacy. Through the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it, with the last being Charles IV in 1916. The only kings not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John Sigismund Zápolya, and Joseph II.

The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in Constantinople in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to the King Géza I of Hungary; both are depicted and named in the Greek language on enamel plaques in the lower crown. However, in popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older and of Papal provenance, dating to the time of the first King Stephen I of Hungary crowned 1000/1001. It is one of two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier Monomachus Crown in the Hungarian National Museum, which may have had another function. The Holy Crown has probably been remodelled using elements of different origins. The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown is most commonly put around the late 12th century. The Hungarian coronation regalia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat of arms of Charles I (1310–1342). 

The name &quot;Holy Crown&quot; was first used in 1256. By the 14th century it became the unique symbol of royal power. As written by Crown Guard Péter Révay, when Hungary needed a new monarch it did not seek a crown to inaugurate a king, but a king worthy of the Crown. He also said &quot;the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the Lost Ark is for the Jewish people&quot;.

Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the Hungarian Parliament Building.

== Specifications of the Crown ==
* The shape is elliptic (width 203.9 mm, length 215.9 mm) and is larger than a normal human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather &#x27;kapa&#x27; liner inside the crown.
* The weight is 2056 g. (4 lb 8.52 oz)
* The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts differ in alloy ratio.
* The lower part is asymmetric.

== Holiness doctrine ==
As with all European Christian crowns, the Holy Crown symbolizes a halo signifying the wearer&#x27;s divine right to rule. According to popular tradition, St Stephen I held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to consecrate it and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary. After this, Mary was depicted not only as &quot;patrona&quot; (patron saint) of the Kingdom of Hungary, but also as &quot;regina&quot; (queen). This consecration was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary under the &quot;Doctrine of the Holy Crown&quot; ().

Péter Révay, a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works &quot;Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona&quot; (&quot;Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;, Augsburg 1613) and &quot;De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae&quot; (&quot;On the Monarchy and Holy Crown of Hungary&quot;, Frankfurt 1659).
Under this doctrine, the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules &quot;in the name of the crown&quot;.

==Origin==

According to the most accepted theory, in the publications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference, the Holy Crown consists of three parts: the lower &quot;abroncs&quot; (rim, hoop), the &quot;corona graeca&quot;; the upper &quot;keresztpántok&quot; (cross straps), the &quot;corona latina&quot;; and the uppermost cross, tilted at an angle. It is though that was created under Byzantine influence during the reign of the Hungarian King Béla III (1172–1196), who was brought up in the Byzantine court and was briefly heir to the Byzantine throne, or some other events around 1200. This was many decades after the crowning of Stephen I marked the beginning of Hungarian statehood, variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001.

Another version of the origin of the crown was written by bishop Hartvik around 1100–1110 at the request of King Könyves Kálmán, in which the &quot;Pope&quot; sent King Stephen I &quot;his blessings and a crown&quot;. According to &quot;Hartvik’s legend&quot;, St. Stephen sent Archbishop Astrik of Esztergom to Rome to acquire a crown from the &quot;Pope&quot;, who is not named. Despite Astrik&#x27;s haste, the envoy of Mieszko I of Poland arrived at Rome first. In a dream, the Pope saw an angel who told him: &quot;There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for a crown also. Give them the crown, as they deserve it.&quot; The next day Astrik arrived, and the Pope gave the crown to him. 

Hartvik’s legend appeared in liturgical books and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, naming the then-existing Pope Sylvester II. Subsequently, the story of the crown sent by Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, and was published in 1613 by the crown guard Péter Révay.

However, the legend is not supported by historical evidence. Mieszko I did not live at the same time as St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, the &quot;Greater Legend&quot; of St Stephen, written around 1083, makes no mention of the Crown&#x27;s Roman provenance: &quot;in the fifth year after the death of his father...they brought a Papal letter of blessing...and the Lord’s favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and auspiciously crowned with the diadem of royal honour&quot;. Moreover, Vatican archives have found no record of the granting of the crown. Another document giving doubtful evidence is by Thietmar von Merseburg (died 1018): he wrote that Holy Roman Emperor Otto III consented to Stephen&#x27;s coronation, and that the Pope sent his blessings, but there is no mention of a crown.

The question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination was carried out. 

The differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, there are no known representations in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one.

==Type==
The Crown is a coronation crown, which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (koronaőr) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the &quot;nádorispán&quot; (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during the coronation, and the Archbishop of Esztergom (primate of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king.

==Structure of the crown and its icons==

The Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel &quot;pantokrator&quot; pictures (Greek meaning &quot;master of all&quot;) as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and almandine. It has three parts: &quot;abroncs&quot; (rim, hoop) (&quot;corona graeca&quot;), &quot;keresztpántok&quot; (cross straps) (&quot;corona latina&quot;), and the cross on the top tilted at an angle.

There are four hanging pendants (pendilia) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back. There is no monde.

===Corona graeca===
The (rim, hoop) (&quot;Greek Crown&quot;) is 5.2 cm wide with a diameter of 20.5 cm.

The two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by King Matthias II (1608–1619). The enamel picture on the front depicts Christ Pantokrator. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, followed by half-length images of the Saints George and Demetrius, and Cosmas and Damian.


In the arched frame on the back of the diadem Emperor Michael VII Doukas (1071–1078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half-length picture of &quot;Kon. Porphyrogennetos&quot;, this probably being either Emperor Michael&#x27;s brother and co-emperor Konstantios Doukas or of his son and heir Constantine Doukas, both having been born in the purple. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King Géza I (1074–1077), with the Greek inscription: (, meaning &quot;Géza I, faithful kralj of the land of the Turks&quot;). 

The contemporary Byzantine name for the Hungarians was &quot;Turks&quot;, while the Hungarian branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, under Constantinople&#x27;s jurisdiction, was named the &quot;Metropolitanate of Tourkia&quot; (Hungary), and the head of this church was the &quot;Metropolitan of Tourkia&quot; (Hungary). As was customary in the hierarchy of the Byzantine state, clear differentiation is made between style of the emperors and that of the Hungarian king by using a hellenized form of the common South Slavic word for &quot;king&quot; (Kralj) for Géza. The saints and the Greek rulers have halos while Géza does not. The inscriptions of the emperors’ names are in red, while the Hungarian king&#x27;s is in dark blue or black.

The enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.

The with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses – in other words it was a woman&#x27;s crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King Géza&#x27;s wife, known only as Synadene, around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor&#x27;s treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to Hungary.

There is another view that the Géza depicted on the is not King Géza I but St Stephen&#x27;s father. This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince Géza is depicted on the without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre.

===Corona latina===
The (cross straps) (&quot;Latin Crown&quot;) is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2 × 7.2 cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the and provides a dome-shaped top.

The inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letters, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the 11th century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to István I by the pope, or possibly the treasure binding of a book. It is also possible, although it cannot be verified, that István I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating hishistorically documentedgifts. The picture of the apostles (Peter, Paul, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas), however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000. It is considered to be of Romanesque style, and created by Roman workshop in the middle of the 11th century.

The intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that close off the lower end of the bands and finish off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the , symbolising the number of Christ&#x27;s disciples (Acts 10.1).

The central panel is decorated with a square cloisonné enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13.

Éva Kovács and Zsuzsa Lovag suggested that the was originally a large Byzantine liturgical asterisk from a Greek monastery in Hungary. In order to get it to fit into its new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the autocrat, the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit (see ).

Recently, Croatian archaeologists M. Ilkić and D. Filipčić proposed thesis that the crown of Zvonimir, the last native Croatian king and which was once believed to have disappeared, is actually the , as &quot;the only plausible place where Zvonimir&#x27;s crown could end up, while maintaining the legitimacy of the coronation of new Hungarian-Croatian kings and respecting the tradition and legality of the coronation of Béla IV&#x27;s predecessors, is within the Hungarian crown&quot;. However, was soon disputed by the Croatian historian Mladen Ančić.

===Cross===
The cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have been made during the 16th century. The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly. The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.

Éva Kovács suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the True Cross and that it was the presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy. She states that “Szabolcs Vajay called to my attention a strange incident in the crown’s history which had completely escaped everybody’s attention. Before Queen Isabella handed over the regalia to Ferdinand in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown’s peak for her son, John Sigismund. According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, &quot;... because he who possesses this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it&quot;.

Later, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II. This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.” She also notes that “Several small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty. As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen. About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II’s campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king’s property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force. We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns. To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles I’s crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.”

Later, it was the Crown itself, rather than the St. Stephen&#x27;s cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen. Éva Kovács further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms. Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic. This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary.

===The crown as a whole===
The form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the kamelaukion-type crowns with closed tops, as introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The presence of multiple pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the &quot;corona graeca&quot; during the rule of Béla III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the &quot;corona graeca&quot; was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine pattern.

===Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen===
Beside the using of the intersecting bands of the &quot;corona latina&quot;, which probably came from the treasury of St. István, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, István.

The inscription embroidered onto the coronation mantle indicates with all certainty that István I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031.

The coronation sceptre with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St István. On the seals of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Rudolph III of Burgundy, the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later.

==The regalia in modern times==
After the fall of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, the crown was reincorporated into the national coat of arms in 1990. The National Assembly chose the pre-war coat of arms over the crown-less Kossuth arms of 1849.


The Holy Crown has had a varied history; having been stolen, hidden, lost, recovered, and taken abroad several times. During the Árpád dynasty (1000–1301), the coronation insignia was kept in the coronation city of Székesfehérvár. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: Visegrád (in Pest county); Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or Buda. In 1805–1806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the Palanok Castle at Munkács (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). Lajos Kossuth took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near Orsova in Transylvania (today Orşova, Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853.

At the end of the Second World War the crown jewels were recovered in Mattsee, Austria, on 4 May 1945 by the U.S. 86th Infantry Division. The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the United States Army by the Hungarian Crown Guard for safekeeping from the Soviet Union. For much of the Cold War the crown was held at the United States Bullion Depository (Fort Knox, Kentucky) alongside the bulk of the United States&#x27; gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to the people of Hungary by order of U.S. President Jimmy Carter on 6 January 1978.

Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels. The majority of the Hungarian-American population opposed the decision to return the crown. On January 6, 1978, US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance returned the Crown to Hungary in Budapest.

==Other coronation regalia==

Uniquely in Europe, most of the medieval ensemble of coronation regalia has survived. On 1 January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the Hungarian Parliament Building from the Hungarian National Museum. The sceptre, orb and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament.

The very large coronation mantle remains in a glass inert gas vault at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her sisters and the mantle&#x27;s middle back bears the king&#x27;s only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop&#x27;s chasuble.

The sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid rock crystal ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century Fatimid caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments.

The orb is unusual in having a patriarchal cross instead of a simple cross, as on the crown.

The ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product. However, what is said to be an original coronation sword of Stephen I has been in Prague&#x27;s St. Vitus Cathedral since 1368.

A lance claimed to have belonged to King Stephen I, and seen in the Mantle portrait, was reportedly obtained by the Holy Roman Emperor circa 1100.

<doc id="598072" wikidata="Q3235083" url="?curid=598072" title="Siege of Charleston">
<text>The siege of Charleston was a major engagement and major British victory in the American Revolutionary War, fought in the environs of Charles Town (today Charleston), the capital of South Carolina, between March 29 and May 12, 1780. The British, following the collapse of their northern strategy in late 1777 and their withdrawal from Philadelphia in 1778, shifted their focus to the North American Southern Colonies. After approximately six weeks of siege, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, commanding the Charleston garrison, surrendered his forces to the British. It was one of the worst American defeats of the war.

==Background==

By late 1779, two major British strategic efforts had failed. An army invading from Quebec under John Burgoyne had surrendered to the Americans under Horatio Gates at the Battles of Saratoga, which inspired both the Kingdom of France and Spain to declare war on Great Britain in support of the Americans. Meanwhile, a strategic effort led by Sir William Howe to capture the Revolutionaries&#x27; capital of Philadelphia had met with limited success. Having replaced his superior as Commander-in-Chief of the American Station, Sir Henry Clinton withdrew all his forces back to New York City to reinforce the city against a possible Franco-U.S. attack.
Stymied by the Fabian strategy adopted by Continental general George Washington and, under increasing political pressure to deliver victory, the British turned to launching their &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; to force a capitulation of the Americans. The British were persuaded that there was a strong Loyalist sentiment in the South, where major planters and merchants had a variety of economic and familial ties with Great Britain. It was expected that these Loyalists would rise against the American Patriots in large numbers. The opening British action was the Capture of Savannah, Georgia in December 1778. After repulsing an assault on Savannah by a combined Franco-American force in October 1779, the British planned to capture Charleston, South Carolina, intending to use the city as a base for further operations in the southern colonies.

Clinton evacuated Newport, Rhode Island in October 1779, and left the substantial garrison of New York City under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen. In December, the day after Christmas 1779, Clinton and his second-in-command, Charles Cornwallis, sailed southward with 8,500 troops and 5,000 sailors on 90 troopships and 14 warships. After a very stormy voyage, the fleet anchored in the Savannah River on 1 February 1780. By 12 February, Clinton had landed his army 30 miles south of Charleston on Simmons Island. By 24 February, the British had crossed the Stono River onto James Island, and by 10 March, Lord Cornwallis had made it to the mainland. By 22 March, they had advanced to Middleton Place and Drayton Hall, and on 29 March 1780, crossed the Ashley River.

Clinton had issued the Philipsburg Proclamation in 1779, promising freedom for slaves owned by Patriots who escaped to British lines and aided their cause. Slaves left both the city and countryside around Charleston to join the British around the city. Among those former slaves, known as Black Loyalists, evacuated by the British after the war was John Kizell, who had been captured as a child from the area of Sierra Leone and transported to South Carolina. He eventually returned to Sierra Leone and aided the American Colonization Society.

==Siege==

Cutting the city off from relief, Clinton began a siege on 1 April, 800 yards from the American fortifications located at today&#x27;s Marion Square. Whipple, deciding the bar was indefensible, scuttled his fleet at the mouth of the Cooper River. Then Arbuthnot, on 8 April, brought his 14 vessels safely into the harbor, past the roaring guns of Fort Moultrie, the same day Woodford arrived with 750 Virginia Continentals.

In order to consolidate British control of the immediate area, Clinton dispatched Banastre Tarleton and Patrick Ferguson to capture Monck&#x27;s Corner on 14 April. On 18 April, Lt. Col. Lord Rawdon arrived with 2,500 men, including the 42nd Highlanders, the Hessian von Ditfurth Regiment, the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, Prince of Wales American Volunteers, and the Volunteers of Ireland. Charleston was completely surrounded by the British.

Governor John Rutledge escaped on 13 April. On 21 April, Continental leader Benjamin Lincoln requested a surrender with &quot;honours of war&quot;, which was rejected by Clinton. On 23 April, Lord Cornwallis crossed the Cooper River with the Volunteers of Ireland and Carolina Tory militia, joining Lt. Col. James Webster&#x27;s 33rd Foot and 64th Foot, blocking further escape from the left bank. On 25 April, civilians led by Christopher Gadsden prevented any action on Lincoln&#x27;s part in withdrawing the Continental regiments. On 6 May, Tarleton won another engagement in the Battle of Lenud&#x27;s Ferry, while the British siege works had advanced far enough towards the Charleston fortifications to drain the canal in front.

On 7 May, Fort Moultrie surrendered without a fight. On May 8, Clinton called for Lincoln&#x27;s unconditional surrender, but Lincoln attempted to negotiate for the honours of war. On May 11, Gadsden and other citizens asked Lincoln to surrender. On the same day, the British fired heated shot into the city, burning several homes, and Lincoln felt forced to call for a parlay to negotiate terms for surrender. On May 12, Lincoln formally surrendered 3,371 men to the British.

When word reached the backcountry, the American troops holding Ninety-Six, South Carolina and Camden, South Carolina also surrendered to the British.

==Aftermath==
The British captured some 5,266 prisoners, 311 artillery pieces, 9,178 artillery rounds, 5,916 muskets, 33,000 rounds of ammunition, 15 Regimental colours, 49 ships and 120 boats, plus 376 barrels of flour, and large magazines of rum, rice and indigo. Following the surrender, the captured ordnance was brought to a powder magazine. A Hessian officer warned that some of the guns might still be loaded, but he was ignored. One prematurely fired, detonating 180 barrels of powder, further discharging 5,000 muskets in the magazine. The accident killed approximately 200 people and destroyed six houses. The prisoners of the siege were diverted to multiple locations, including prison ships, the old barracks where the College of Charleston is today (two barracks buildings are shown on early maps of the campus), and the Old Exchange and Provost &quot;Dungeon&quot;. Prison hulks awaited the majority of the 2,571 Continental prisoners, while parole was granted to the militia and civilians who promised not to take up arms. This ended the power of an American army in the South.

The defeat was a serious blow to the American cause. It was the largest surrender of an American force under arms until the 1862 surrender of Union troops at Harper&#x27;s Ferry during the Antietam Campaign. The surrender left no substantial army in the South, and the colonies were wide open for a British advance. The British troops consolidated their hold, and had driven the remaining Continental Army troops from South Carolina consequent to the May 29 Battle of Waxhaws.

During their surrender the American forces were denied honours of war, leading General George Washington to deny the same to the British during their surrender at the Siege of Yorktown. Washington said, &quot;The same Honors will be granted to the Surrendering Army as were granted to the Garrison of Charles Town.&quot;

On June 5, Clinton sailed back to New York City, believing his presence necessary to defend against a potential Franco-American attack, leaving command of the southern theater to Lord Cornwallis, with orders to reduce opposition in North Carolina. Though the effects of the surrender at Charleston were substantial, the British error in strategy soon became apparent. As no popular uprising of Loyalists took place, control of the countryside was difficult. Instead, resistance in South Carolina degenerated into a period of chaotic guerrilla warfare in the outlying areas.

==Order of battle==

===British forces===
The joint British naval-army forces were led overall by Sir Henry Clinton, with his subordinate, Lord Cornwallis as his second-in-command. The British regular troops were led by Brigadier General Alexander Leslie.

The ground and naval forces were composed thus:
===Franco-American forces===
The Franco-American garrison of Charleston was overall led by Benjamin Lincoln. The Continental Army troops were nominally led by Brigadier General William Moultrie.

The ground and naval forces were composed thus:
==Preservation==
The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of battlefield land in Charleston related to the siege as of mid-2023.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Spending and Doctorate Production&quot;.

For more than 50 years, the university has maintained the Saint Louis University Madrid Campus in Spain. The Madrid campus was the first freestanding campus operated by an American university in Europe and the first American institution to be recognized by Spain&#x27;s higher education authority as an official foreign university.

SLU&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference.

==History==
===Early years===
Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on November 16, 1818, by Louis William Valentine DuBourg, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed under the charge of François Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the Saint Louis Cathedral. Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by Gateway Arch National Park within the Archdiocese of St. Louis. 

Already having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg&#x27;s personal library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as St. Louis University High School). In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus. Not long after that, it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature.

According to William Faherty, the first Jesuit president of St. Louis College, Peter Verhaegen, was a key leader in building Catholicism in the West from his arrival 1823 to his death in 1853. He kept frontier needs in mind while designing the curriculum, intensified the school&#x27;s Catholic life, established a medical department, and moved the school to a bigger campus. It included Protestants among its faculty, student body, and supporters. It introduced evening adult programs, and taught poor boys with city funding.

===University beginnings and American Civil War===

In 1829, the new university moved its campus to Washington Avenue and Ninth, today the site of America&#x27;s Center. At this time, the founders forced enslaved Black Americans from their St. Stanislaus Seminary in Hazelwood to labor at the university. Many had previously been separated from their families enslaved at White Marsh Plantation.

In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of an anti-Catholic novel, &quot;The Mysteries of St. Louis&quot;, which was written by newspaper editor Henry Boernstein. Boernstein&#x27;s popular newspaper, &quot;Anzeiger des Westens&quot;, routinely criticized the university.

In 1867, after the American Civil War, the university purchased &quot;Lindell&#x27;s Grove&quot;, in what is now Midtown. The university subsequently moved to this new location, which is the current site of today&#x27;s north campus. Lindell&#x27;s Grove was the site of the Camp Jackson Affair, which had occurred only a few years prior to the university&#x27;s purchase.

The first building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college officially moved to its new location in 1889. Construction of the new St. Francis Xavier College Church began on 8 June 1884. The basement of the church was completed later that year and was the location for liturgical functions until the upper church was subsequently completed in 1898.

===20th century and shift to majority lay board of trustees===

During the early 1940s, many local priests, especially the Jesuits, began to challenge the segregationist policies at the city&#x27;s Catholic colleges and parochial schools. After the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, an African-American newspaper, ran a 1944 exposé on St. Louis Archbishop John J. Glennon&#x27;s interference with the admittance of a black student at the local Webster College, Fr. Claude Heithaus, professor of Classical Archaeology at Saint Louis University, delivered an angry homily accusing his own institution of immoral behavior in its segregation policies. By summer of 1944, Saint Louis University had opened its doors to African-Americans, after its president, Father Patrick Holloran, secured Glennon&#x27;s reluctant approval .

In 1967, Saint Louis University became one of the first Catholic universities to give laypeople more power over the affairs of the school. Board chairman Paul Reinert stepped aside to be replaced by layman Daniel Schlafly, and the board shifted to an 18 to 10 majority of laypeople. This was largely because of &quot;Horace Mann vs. the Board of Public Works of Maryland,&quot; a landmark case heard by the Maryland Court of Appeals, which declared unconstitutional grants to &quot;largely sectarian&quot; colleges. The Second Vatican Council has also been mentioned as a major influence on this decision for its increased focus on the laity, as well as the decreased recruitment of nuns and priests since the council.

From 1985 to 1992 the chairman of the Board of Trustees was William H. T. Bush (younger brother of former president George H. W. Bush). The younger Bush also taught classes at the school.

Since the move to lay oversight, there has been some debate over how much influence the Roman Catholic Church should have on the affairs of the university. The decision by the university to sell its hospital to Tenet Healthcare in 1997 met much resistance by both local and national Church leaders but went ahead as planned. In 2015, the Catholic SSM Health system assumed operation of Saint Louis University Hospital. Renovations were completed in 2020. In 2022, Saint Louis University sold its medical practice, SLUCare, to the SSM Health System as well.

As of 2023, 40 Jesuits taught, studied, and ministered at SLU.

=== Slavery, history, memory and reconciliation ===
In 2016, the institution revealed names and stories of Black Americans who had been enslaved by the university and its founders and who contributed to the cultivation and building of the institution. Direct descendants include Louis Chauvin and St. Louis Black Stockings player Sylvester Chauvin, whose burial site was marked by a headstone in 2022 through the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project. Contemporary descendants formed the organization Descendants of the Saint Louis University Enslaved and are petitioning for a physical monument on campus to acknowledge the history of their ancestors. The group has estimated the contemporary value of labor performed by enslaved workers to be between 361 million to 74 billion dollars.

==Campus==
SLU&#x27;s campus in Midtown, St. Louis consists of over of land, with 129 buildings on campus. This area is split between two locations along Grand Boulevard. The north campus (or Frost Campus), located just north of I-64, is the site of most undergraduate learning and is also home to the university&#x27;s residence halls. The south campus, located just south of Chouteau Avenue, is the site of the Saint Louis University Hospital, the Doisy Research Center, and some athletic facilities. Most health science instruction takes place on the south campus. The Saint Louis University School of Law is located in downtown St. Louis in Scott Hall.

Fr. Raymond L. Sullivant launched the campus in Madrid, Spain in 1967. Saint Louis University Madrid has nearly 1,000 students from more than 70 countries. The campus has a faculty of 125, an average class size of 17 and a student-faculty ratio of 12:1.

===Major campus construction and renovation===

====Jesuit Center====
In 2022, Saint Louis University opened a new residence for Jesuits living and working on campus. The 25-bedroom apostolic center also has a chapel where student Masses are held and community meeting rooms. The building replaces Jesuit Hall, which had been home to Saint Louis University Jesuits since 1973. Retired Jesuits moved to a Delmar Gardens facility in north St. Louis County.

====Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building====
In the fall of 2020, the university opened a new, 90,000-square-foot, three-story building featuring &quot;innovative teaching environments and flexible lab spaces.&quot; The building is home to bioinformatics, biology, biomedical engineering, chemistry, neuroscience and computer science courses that support all science, engineering, nursing and health science majors at SLU.

====Saint Louis University School of Law====

Saint Louis University School of Law, founded in 1843, is the oldest law school west of the Mississippi River. Law students attend classes in Scott Hall, which is in downtown St. Louis. Scott Hall was bought and renovated by the university between 2012 and 2013, as the law school had outgrown its former site on SLU&#x27;s midtown campus. The newly renovated building opened in 2013.

====Edward A. Doisy Research Center====
In 2007, SLU completed a 10-story research center on its Medical Campus Building, a green building named for Edward Adelbert Doisy, Nobel laureate of 1943 and a long-time faculty member at SLU. The building contains 80 labs that are used in the development of vaccines and in research initiatives studying cancer, liver disease, and other health conditions. The building is home to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

====Chaifetz Arena====
The multi-purpose Chaifetz Arena, built in 2008, is a 10,600-seat stadium located on-campus. The arena also contains training facilities, locker rooms, and a practice facility that can house 1,000 spectators. It is on the eastern end of the north campus. The arena replaced Enterprise Center as the university&#x27;s primary location for large events, notably commencement celebrations and varsity sports. The arena is named for alumnus Richard Chaifetz.

===Housing===
Saint Louis has residence halls and student apartment space on campus. As part of the university&#x27;s First Year Experience (FYE) program, students are required to live on campus for their first four semesters at SLU, unless they are a commuter from the St. Louis metropolitan area.

===St. Francis Xavier College Church===

Located at the corner of Grand Boulevard and Lindell Boulevard is the university&#x27;s official parish, St. Francis Xavier College Church. Built between 1888 and 1894 by architect Thomas Walsh, who also designed DuBourg Hall, the church was the first English-speaking parish in the city of St. Louis. The church has held a weekly Sunday Evening Mass for SLU students since 1990.

===Clock tower===

Built in 1993, Saint Louis University&#x27;s clock tower closed off the campus from West Pine Avenue from Spring Street to Vandeventer Avenue. The surrounding plaza is host to social gatherings, demonstrations, and philanthropic events.

In 2011, the clock tower and the area around it were renamed the Joseph G. Lipic Clock Tower Plaza. The amphitheater adjacent to the plaza was renamed in 2021 honor of Jonathan Smith.

In October 2014, the clocktower plaza became the focal point for a student-led demonstration known as OccupySLU. Hundreds of students descended on the plaza to engage in teach-ins, peaceful protest, and conversation in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown and the shooting of Vonderrit Myers Jr. Students and community leaders peacefully occupied the plaza for six days. During this time, university president Fred Pestello negotiated with demonstrators to end the occupation.

===Libraries and museums===

Saint Louis University has three libraries in St. Louis, and one on its campus in Madrid, Spain: the Pius XII Memorial Library on the north campus, the Medical Center Library on south campus, the Vincent C. Immel Library at the law school in downtown St. Louis, and the library in San Ignacio Hall in Madrid.

Pius XII Memorial Library is the general academic library. It houses over 2.2 million books and e-books. Housed within Pius XII Memorial Library is the Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library, which holds a unique collection of microfilm focusing on the manuscripts housed in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana.

In 1964, SLU president Paul Reinert established the Saint Louis University Library Associates. The Associates are a group of &quot;civic-minded St. Louisans...dedicated to the growth of the university libraries.&quot; Since 1967, the organization has presented the St. Louis Literary Award to a distinguished figure in literature. Notable recipients of the award include Salman Rushdie, E.L. Doctorow, Joan Didion, and R. Buckminster Fuller.

The university also has three museums: the Museum of Contemporary Religious Art (MOCRA), the Saint Louis University Museum of Art (SLUMA), and the Samuel Cupples House.
===Administrative Offices===
The Saint Louis University Office of Admissions Building was built in 1890 and had a number of different owners until it was acquired by the University in 1988.

<text>A trans man (short for transgender man) is a man who was assigned female at birth. Trans men have a male gender identity, and many trans men undergo medical and social transition to alter their appearance in a way that aligns with their gender identity or alleviates gender dysphoria.

== Terminology ==


The umbrella term is a shortening of both &quot;transgender&quot; and &quot;transsexual&quot;, and describes anyone whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex. Trans men who transition are commonly referred to as female-to-male (FTM or F2M).

The term &quot;transsexual&quot; originated in the medical and psychological communities, and is generally considered a subset of &quot;transgender&quot;, although the two are not always interchangeable. It predominantly describes people with medically diagnosed gender dysphoria, and who desire to permanently transition to the opposite sex via sex reassignment therapy. Many trans people prefer the labels &quot;transgender&quot; or &quot;trans&quot;, considering them more inclusive and less stigmatizing. However, others, such as Buck Angel, reject the label of &quot;transgender&quot;. The GLAAD media reference guide advises against describing people as &quot;transsexual&quot;, except for individuals who explicitly identify as such.

&quot;Transmasculine&quot; (sometimes clipped to ) is a broader term for all trans individuals with predominantly masculine identities or gender expression, and includes trans men as well as non-binary people who were assigned female at birth and may have an identity that is partially masculine but not entirely male.

The alternate spelling is sometimes used interchangeably. However, like , it is often associated with trans-exclusionary views which hold that trans men are distinct from men, and thus require a separate word to describe them. For this reason many transgender people find the spelling offensive.

== Transitioning ==

Originally, the term &quot;trans men&quot; referred specifically to female-to-male transsexual people who underwent hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or sex reassignment surgery (SRS), or both. The definition of &quot;transition&quot; has broadened to include theories of psychological development or complementary methods of self-acceptance. Many of those who identify as transgender face gender dysphoria.

Transsexual and transgender men may seek medical interventions such as hormones and surgery to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their gender presentation. However, many transgender and transsexual men cannot afford or choose not to undergo surgery or hormone replacement therapy.

Many who have not undergone top surgery choose to bind their breasts. There are a few different methods of binding, including using sports bras and specially made binders (which can be vest-type, or wrap-around style). Tape or bandages are often depicted in popular culture.

Some trans men might also decide to pack, to create a phallic bulge in the crotch of clothing. However, this is not universal. Trans men who decide to pack may use anything from rolled up socks to specially made packers, which resemble a penis. Some packers are also created for trans men to be able to urinate through them (stand-to-pee, or STP, devices), or for sexual penetration or other sexual activity (known as &quot;pack-and-play&quot;).

Transitioning might involve some or all of the following steps:
* Social transition: using a preferred name and pronouns, wearing clothing seen as gender appropriate, disclosure to family, friends and usually at the workplace/school.
* Sex reassignment therapy: hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and/or surgery (SRS)
* Legal affirmation: name and (sometimes) sex marker correction in legal identification documents.

Being socially accepted as male (sometimes known as passing) may be challenging for trans men who have not undergone HRT and/or surgery. Some trans men may choose to present as female in certain social situations (e.g. at work). After physical transition, trans men usually live full-time as male. However, some transmasculine individuals might choose to use and engage their bodies to be pregnant, birth a baby, and breastfeed.

== Prevalence, identity and relationships==

In the United States, the ratio of trans men within the general population is unclear, but estimates range between 1:2,000 and 1:100,000. A U.S. Census Bureau study in 2015 suggests that there were around 58,000 name changes in census records consistent with female to male transitions although only 7,500 of these changed their sex coding as well.

In a study by Kara Devaney, entitled &quot;Transgender Research Literature Review&quot;, it is addressed that the term &quot;transgender&quot; encompasses a myriad of different and unique identities that do not follow the &quot;normal&quot; rules of gender. Miriam J. Abelson writes, &quot;There is no question that trans men&#x27;s experiences are men&#x27;s
experiences and give insight about men, masculinity, and gender inequality.&quot;

Like cisgender men, trans men can have any sexual orientation or sexual identity, including heterosexual, gay, bisexual, and queer, and some trans men consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The literature commonly indicates that sexual attraction to those of their same gender (e.g., trans men liking men and trans women liking women) is considerably less common among trans men than among trans women; the majority of trans men are reported as heterosexual. Surveys from the National Center for Transgender Equality show more variation in sexual orientation or sexual identity among trans men. In NCTE&#x27;s 2015 Transgender Survey of respondents who identified as trans men, 23% identified as heterosexual or straight. The majority (65%) identified their sexual orientation or sexual identity as queer (24%), pansexual (17%), bisexual (12%), or gay/same-gender loving (12%).

Some trans men date heterosexual women, while other trans men date queer women; the latter might be because queer women are less invested in the gender and sexual anatomy of a person when it comes to selecting an intimate partner. It is also common for trans men to have histories with the lesbian community or to feel that they identify better with that community because of its wide acceptance of gender variance, with a number of trans men having previously identified as lesbian (often as a &quot;butch lesbian&quot;) before realizing that they are instead transgender.

Trans men have less success integrating socially within cisgender gay men&#x27;s communities, which tend to be more body-focused, especially in terms of being phallocentric. Yitzchak et al. state that, as a result, they more commonly see gay trans men partnering with each other than with cisgender gay men. There are, however, cases of women being likelier than men to thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies.

Some scholars argue against assumptions that trans men are predominantly heterosexual and usually have lesbian histories. In scholars Dan Irving and Rupert Raj&#x27;s book &quot;Trans Activism in Canada&quot;, researchers state, &quot;There is still a common misperception that trans men are largely heterosexual amongst those who conflate gender identity and sexual orientation. It is frequently assumed that trans men are exclusively attracted to women and have lesbian histories prior to transition.&quot; They add, &quot;Recent data from the Trans PULSE project (Bauer, Redman, Bradley, &amp; Scheim, 2013) challenge this assumption, with 63 percent of female-to-male spectrum trans people in Ontario reporting non-heterosexual identities and/or past-year sex with trans or non-trans men.&quot; They also argue that, based on some research, &quot;many non-trans gay men have welcomed trans men into gay communities and have increasingly recognized trans men as potential sexual and romantic partners.&quot;
== Health ==
Trans men and transmasculine people often face difficulty and discrimination receiving medical treatment, due to both bias against assigned-female patients and against transgender people. In the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 42% of 8,037 trans men reported negative experiences with healthcare providers. There is a lack of credible research about how to provide adequate healthcare to transmasculine people undergoing medical transition, notably with doctors having difficulty diagnosing breast cancer in people who have undergone top surgery. HIV infection between trans men and others is still increasing.

===Reproductive health===

Trans men with an intact female reproductive system may become pregnant. According to surveys compiled by Medicare for Australia, 75 male-identifying parents gave birth in Australia in 2016, and 40 in 2017. Although testosterone therapy eventually induces amenorrhea in most trans men, trans men with uteri are still at risk of pregnancy even if they no longer have periods. Additionally, trans men are likely to live in poverty and have inadequate access to healthcare, so many do not have access to the contraceptives they may want or need. Trans men can use barrier methods, oral contraceptives, IUDs, and other methods of contraception while taking testosterone.

Trans men must discontinue testosterone while attempting to conceive, while pregnant, and while breastfeeding, because high levels of testosterone during pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities, specifically with the urogenital system of a female fetus.

Trans men experience issues during pregnancy not experienced by pregnant women. For example, trans men may experience discrimination on the base of their gender while receiving obstetric care. Many providers are unfamiliar with the needs of transgender patients. Additionally, some men report that being pregnant made their gender dysphoria worse.

==Trans men in sports==

Despite the 2020s restrictions on transgender children and adults participation in athletics, trans boys and men have competed in many individual and team sports at high school, college, and professional levels. Early known examples of trans men who competed at international levels were often competitors in women&#x27;s championships, and came out as trans men later in life. They include Zdeněk Koubek, a Czech national champion and medal winner at the 1934 World Women&#x27;s Athletic games in track; Willy De Bruyn, a Belgian cyclist who became unofficial women&#x27;s world champion in 1934, born intersex and raised as a girl but later identified as a man; and French sprinter Pierre Brésolles, who ran the 100 metre and 200 metre races and won third place in the 100 meter dash in the Oslo European Championship in 1946. Later Olympic athletes include Andreas Krieger (b. 1965), a German former shot putter who competed on the women&#x27;s East German athletics team at SC Dynamo Berlin, and Ricardo del Real, a Mexican taekwando competitor in the 2000 Summer Olympics.

More recently, Chris Mosier, a duathlon and triathlon competitor on the US National team in duathlon, successfully challenged the International Olympic Committee former policy that required surgery before transgender athletes could compete. Mosier&#x27;s challenge led to the creation and adoption of new IOC guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes and in World Championships. Mosier was considered the catalyst for change in the policy in January 2016, after he successfully advocated for change in the policy Another Olympic team athlete, former member of Japan&#x27;s Olympic fencing team Fumino Sugiyama, is now a transgender rights activist and works to promote acceptance and participation of trans athletes in Japanese sports.

Track and field athletes include retired German pole vaulter Balian Buschbaum and American NCAA college athlete Keelin Godsey (hammer throw). Competitive athletes in individual sports include American professional boxer Patricio Manuel, and Japanese former professional boxer Shindo Go, who held the World Boxing Council women&#x27;s flyweight title from 2013 to 2014; NCAA swimmer Schuyler Bailar, and high school state wrestling champion Mack Beggs, who won the Texas state girls&#x27; wrestling title in 2017 despite efforts to bar him from participating. (State rules required him to compete according to sex assigned at birth.)

In basketball, noted trans men include Jay Mulucha, an LGBTQI activist and Ugandan basketball player with the Magic Stormers in the Federation of Uganda Basketball League (FUBA), and American basketball player Kye Allums, the first openly transgender NCAA Division I college athlete. Harrison Browne was the first openly transgender athlete in professional American hockey, coming out in 2016 and transitioning medically after his retirement from professional sports in 2018. Kumi Yokoyama is a Japanese footballer who plays as a forward for Okayama Yunogo Belle and the Japan women&#x27;s national team. Quince Mountain was the first transgender dog musher to compete in the Iditarod dogsledding race in 2020.

== Discrimination ==

Transgender men can face discrimination as a result of their status as trans men. Such discrimination may include sexual violence.

<doc id="598087" wikidata="Q558634" url="?curid=598087" title="Henry Carr">
<text>Henry Carr (November 27, 1941 – May 29, 2015) was an American track and field athlete who won two gold medals at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

==Early life==
Born in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1941, Carr moved with his family to Detroit, Michigan when he was young.

Prior to bringing his athletic talents to Arizona State University (ASU), Carr was a state champion sprinter for Northwestern High School in Detroit having posted a 100-yard time of 9.3 seconds. While competing for the ASU Sun Devils, he won three national titles; along the way setting world records at 220 yards and as a member of the Sun Devil 4 x 440 yard relay team.

Henry Carr won the 1963 NCAA title at 200 meters in 20.5; the same year he ran 20.69 to tie Paul Drayton for the USA title. Twice that season Carr ran world records; a non-ratified 20.4 for 220 yards and, three days later in a college triangular meet, a 20.3 for 220 yards. Henry Carr ran even faster in 1964; setting a world record of 20.2 for 220 yards. He also defeated Drayton into second place to win the national title.

==Olympics==
It was at the 1964 Olympics where Carr would achieve his greatest fame; Carr won the 200 meters (in an Olympic Record time) and anchored the winning 4 x 400 meter relay team to a world record 3:00.7 (with Ollan Cassell, Mike Larrabee and Ulis Williams).

Carr had a fright in his qualification for the Olympics. He had won the semi-final trials held in New York in July and only had to prove his fitness at the final trials in September in Los Angeles. However, he was well beaten into fourth place in the final there and with only 3 to qualify he could have been eliminated. His earlier win was enough though to convince the selectors that he should go to the Olympics.

==Professional football career==
Following the Olympics, Carr played American football in the National Football League. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1965 NFL draft by the New York Giants and played three seasons as a safety and cornerback with the Giants. In his last year with them he was hampered by a knee injury.

In 1969, he had a try-out with the Detroit Lions but quit their training camp.

==Personal life==
After he left the NFL he found difficulty in adjusting and finding work. He found new purpose in 1973 when he became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. In the mid-1970s he was described as living a simple life with his family outside Atlanta, Georgia. In later life, Carr became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness elder, and was reported to have done contracting work and owned a restaurant. He died of cancer on May 29, 2015, in Griffin, Georgia.

==Accolades and awards==
Carr was a 1975 Charter inductee in the Arizona State Sun Devils Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1997, he was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame.

== World records ==
Carr set the following world records during his track career:

* 220 y of 20.3 s at Tempe, Arizona on March 23, 1963, in a tri Meet ASU-Utah-USC;
* 4×440 y of 3:04.5 at Walnut, California on April 27, 1963, at the Mt. SAC Relays for the ASU;
* 220 y of 20.2 s at Tempe, Arizona on April 4, 1964, in a dual meet ASU-SC Striders;
* 4 × 400 m of 3:00.7 at Tokyo, Japan on October 21, 1964, in the Olympic final.

Note: he also ran a 20.4 s for 220 y on March 19, 1963, that was never ratified as a world record.

==World rankings==
Carr was ranked among the best in the US and the world in the 100, 200 and 400 m sprint events in the period 1962–64, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.

<doc id="598088" wikidata="Q608103" url="?curid=598088" title="Antony Lambton">
<text>Antony Claud Frederick Lambton (10 July 1922 – 30 December 2006), also known as Lord Lambton, was a British aristocrat who served as a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1951 to 1973. Styled as Viscount Lambton from 1941 to 1970, he became the 6th Earl of Durham in February 1970 but disclaimed the title soon after. As a result of a sex scandal in 1973, he resigned from Parliament and ministerial office. He was a cousin of Alec Douglas-Home, who was Prime Minister for a year from 1963 to 1964.

==Early life==
Lambton was born in Compton, Sussex, the second son of Diana Mary (née Farquhar) and John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. He grew up on the family estates centred around Lambton Castle near Washington in County Durham, actually living at the nearby Biddick Hall. He was educated at Harrow School and served in the Royal Hampshire Regiment during the Second World War, before being invalided out. He then did war work in a Wallsend factory.

==Marriage and children==
On 10 August 1942, Lambton married Belinda Bridget &quot;Bindy&quot; Blew-Jones (23 December 1921 – 13 February 2003). She was the daughter of Major Douglas Holden Blew-Jones and his wife Violet Hilda Margaret Birkin, sister of Freda Dudley Ward.

They had five daughters and one son:
* Lady Lucinda Lambton (born 10 May 1943)
* Lady Beatrix Mary Lambton (born 23 July 1949)
* Lady Rose Diana Lambton (26 November 1952 - 5 April 2022)
* Lady Anne Mary Gabrielle Lambton (born 4 July 1954)
* Lady Isabella Lambton (born 17 May 1958), married to Sir Philip Naylor-Leyland, 4th Baronet
* Edward Richard Lambton, 7th Earl of Durham (born 19 October 1961)

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===
Lambton first stood for Parliament at the 1945 general election in the safe Labour seat of Chester-le-Street, then Bishop Auckland in 1950. He was elected to Durham City Council and to Durham County Council in 1947, serving for two years. He was elected Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1951, where he served until 1973.

===Under-Secretary of State===
In 1970, Lambton was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (RAF). He succeeded to the Earldom of Durham upon his father&#x27;s death on 4 February 1970 but disclaimed it on 23 February to continue as an MP and Government Minister. He nonetheless insisted on being addressed as &#x27;Lord Lambton&#x27;, the form of address appropriate to his former courtesy title. However, a ruling of the Committee for Privileges said that he should not do so in the House of Commons, since he had renounced his peerage titles. Contradictory rulings from two Speakers, Horace King and Selwyn Lloyd, then left the point unresolved.

===Resignation===
In 1973, Lambton&#x27;s liaisons with prostitutes were revealed in the Sunday tabloid &quot;The News of the World&quot;. The husband of one of the prostitutes, Norma Levy, had secretly taken photographs of Lambton in bed with Levy and had attempted to sell the photographs to Fleet Street tabloids. As well, a police search of Lambton&#x27;s home found a small amount of cannabis. On 22 May, Lambton resigned from both his office and Parliament; this caused a by-election for his seat which was won by Alan Beith for the Liberal Party. Shortly after, the name Jellicoe emerged in connection to a rendezvous for one of Norma&#x27;s girls at a Somers Town mansion block which had been named Jellicoe House, after the earl&#x27;s kinsman Basil Jellicoe (1899–1935), the housing reformer and priest from Magdalen College (Oxford). There was a confusion and Lord Jellicoe, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, admitted &#x27;casual affairs&#x27; with prostitutes from a Mayfair escort agency but denied knowing Norma Levy.

A security inquiry on the prostitution scandal concluded that there had been &quot;nothing in (Lambton&#x27;s) conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible&quot;. Lambton stated that he had never taken his red state boxes of government documents with him when he visited Norma Levy. The security inquiry was held due to fears that the prostitution scandal may have involved an actual or potential breach of national security (as had occurred in the Profumo scandal in the 1960s).

When Lambton was interviewed by MI5 officer Charles Elwell, Lambton first claimed that the pressure of his job as a minister was what drove him to procure the prostitutes. Later, Lambton stated that his sense of &quot;the futility of the job&quot; and lack of demanding tasks as a junior minister were reasons he went to prostitutes. Finally, Lambton claimed that his judgment was faulty when he went to the prostitutes due to his obsession with the battle over the use of an aristocratic title that had been used by his father; Lambton claimed that he sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in activities such as gardening and debauchery.

==Later years==
Following the scandal, Lambton retired, separated from his wife and bought Villa Cetinale, a 17th-century villa in Tuscany, where he lived with Claire Ward (born Claire Leonora Baring), mother of actress Rachel Ward and daughter of the cricketer Giles Baring. He never divorced his wife Bindy, who died in 2003.

In 1991, Lambton made an extended appearance on the TV discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, chaired by Helena Kennedy, alongside Duncan Campbell, Jane Moore, Clare Short, Anthony Howard and others.

Despite renouncing his peerage titles in 1970, he continued to use his former courtesy title of Viscount Lambton. However, since it was now a title that had passed by courtesy to his only son, it was argued by Sir Anthony Wagner and others that it was incorrect of Lambton to use the title.

On 30 December 2006, Lambton died in hospital in Siena, Italy.

<text>The Afrikaner Broederbond (AB) or simply the Broederbond was an exclusively Afrikaner Calvinist and male secret society in South Africa dedicated to the advancement of the Afrikaner people. It was founded by H. J. Klopper, H. W. van der Merwe, D. H. C. du Plessis and the Rev. Jozua Naudé in 1918 as Jong Zuid Afrika () until 1920, when it was renamed the Broederbond. Its influence within South African political and social life came to a climax with the 1948-1994 rule of the white supremacist National Party and its policy of apartheid, which was largely developed and implemented by Broederbond members. Between 1948 and 1994, many prominent figures of Afrikaner political, cultural, and religious life, including every leader of the South African government, were members of the Afrikaner Broederbond.

==Origins==
Described later as an &quot;inner sanctum&quot;, &quot;an immense informal network of influence&quot;, and by Jan Smuts as a &quot;dangerous, cunning, political fascist organization&quot;, in 1920 &quot;Jong Zuid Afrika&quot;, now restyled as the Afrikaner Broederbond, was a group of 37 white men of Afrikaner ethnicity, Afrikaans language, and Calvinist faith, who shared cultural, semi-religious, and deeply political objectives based on traditions and experiences dating back to the arrival of Dutch white settlers, French Huguenots, and German settlers at the Cape in the 17th and 18th centuries, and including the dramatic events of the Great Trek in the 1830s and 1840s. Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom recount how, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, a leading &quot;broeder&quot; (brother or member) said: 
The precise intentions of the founders are not clear. Some considered that the group was intended to counter the dominance of the British Empire and the English language, whilst others considered that the purpose was to redeem the Afrikaners after their defeat in the Second Anglo-Boer War. Another view is that it sought to protect culture, build an economy and seize control of the government. The remarks of the organisation&#x27;s chairman in 1944 offer a slightly different, and possibly more accurate interpretation in the context of the post-Boer War and post-World War I era, when Afrikaners were suffering through a maelstrom of social and political changes:
The Afrikaner Broederbond was born out of the deep conviction that the Afrikaners had been planted in the country by the Hand of God, destined to survive as a separate people with its own calling.

The traditional, deeply pious Calvinism of the Afrikaners, a pastoral people with a difficult history in South Africa since the mid-17th century, supplied an element of Christian predestination that led to a determination to wrest the country from the English-speaking population of British descent and place its future in the hands of the Afrikaans-speaking Afrikaners. To the old thirst for sovereignty that had prompted the Great Trek into the interior from 1838 on, would be added a new thirst for total independence and nationalism. These two threads merged to form a &quot;Christian National&quot; civil religion that would dominate South African life from 1948 to 1994.

The emergence of the Broederbond took place amidst the backdrop of a rise in Afrikaner nationalism as a result of the Second Boer War (1899–1902), which saw the British annex the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. During the conflict, the British deployed scorched earth tactics against the Boers, destroying Boer farms and interning captured Boer non-combatants in concentration camps, where roughly 27,000 Boers died. The war was brought to end by the Treaty of Vereeniging, which though generous in its terms was seen by the Boers as deeply humiliating. The anglicisation policies of British administrator Lord Milner was also a major source of resentment amongst the Afrikaners. These developments led to an increase in nationalistic sentiments amongst Afrikaners, leading to the formation of the Broederbond and the National Party.

The National Party had been established in 1914 by Afrikaner nationalists. They first came to power in 1924. Ten years later, its leader J. B. M. Hertzog and Jan Smuts of the South African Party merged their parties to form the United Party. This angered a contingent of hardline nationalists under D. F. Malan, who broke away to form the Purified National Party. By the time World War II broke out, resentment towards the British had not subsided. Malan&#x27;s party opposed South Africa&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of the British; some of its members wanted to support Nazi Germany. Jan Smuts had commanded British Army forces in the East African theater of the First World War and was amenable to backing the Allies a second time. This was the spark Afrikaner nationalism needed. Hertzog, who was in favour of neutrality, resigned from the United Party when a narrow majority in his cabinet backed Smuts. He started the Afrikaner Party which would amalgamate later with D.F. Malan&#x27;s &quot;Purified National Party&quot; to become the force that would take over South African politics for the next 46 years, until majority rule and Nelson Mandela&#x27;s election in 1994.

In 1945, Smuts denounced the Broederbond as a fascist organization and ordered South African civil servants and state schoolteachers to either forfeit their Broederbond membership immediately or resign from their jobs.

==The Broederbond and apartheid==
Every prime minister and state president in South Africa from 1948 to the end of apartheid in 1994 was a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond.

Once the Herenigde Nasionale Party was in power...English-speaking bureaucrats, soldiers, and state employees were sidelined by reliable Afrikaners, with key posts going to Broederbond members (with their ideological commitment to separatism). The electoral system itself was manipulated to reduce the impact of immigrant English speakers and eliminate that of Coloureds.

The Herenigde Nationale Party was the product of the reunion of the Purified National Party and the United Party in 1940.

The Afrikaner Broederbond continued to act in secret, infiltrating and gaining control of the few organisations, such as the South African Agricultural Union (SAAU), which had political power and were opposed to a further escalation of apartheid policies.

Members of political parties right of the National Party were not welcome and 200 members were expelled by 1972.

In 1983 when the Conservative Party was founded with Andries Treurnicht as a leader, all Broederbond members who belonged to the newly formed party were no longer welcome in the Broederbond. Treurnicht, C.W.H. Boshoff and H.J. Klopper, previous chairmen, left the organization. Other members like H. J. van den Bergh left too.

In 1985 the Afrikaner Broederbond realised that change needed to take place in South African politics. Although the government did not talk openly with the banned African National Congress (ANC), it was decided by the organization they should start negotiating. On 8 June 1986 J.P. de Lange, the then-chairman met Thabo Mbeki in New York for a five-hour meeting held at a conference organised by the Ford Foundation. The meeting was just between de Lange and Mbeki, but at the conference other ANC members Mac Maharaj, Seretse Choabi, Charles Villa-Vicencio, and Peggy Dulany were present.

P.W. Botha also left the Broederbond after his retirement.

== Leaders ==
The chairmen of the Broederbond were:

==Exposed==
Although the press had maintained a steady trickle of unsourced exposés of the inner workings and membership of the Broederbond since the 1960s, the first comprehensive exposé of the organisation was a book written by Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom, &quot;The Super-Afrikaners. Inside the Afrikaner Broederbond&quot;, first published in 1978. The most notable and discussed section of the book was the last section which consisted of a near-comprehensive list of 7,500 Broederbond members. The Broederbond was portrayed as &quot;Die Stigting Adriaan Delport&quot; (The Adriaan Delport Foundation) in the 1968 South African feature film &quot;Die Kandidaat&quot; (The Candidate), directed by Jans Rautenbach and produced by Emil Nofal.

<text>Dura is an extinct language of Nepal. It has been classified in the West Bodish branch of Tibetan languages, though more recent work separates it out as an independent branch of Sino-Tibetan. Many of the Dura have switched to speaking Nepali, and the Dura language has sometimes been thought to be extinct. Some of the people who have switched to Nepali for their daily speech still use Dura for prayer.

The Himalayan Languages Project is working on recording additional knowledge of Dura. Around 1,500 words and 250 sentences in Dura have been recorded. The last known speaker of the language was the 82-year-old Soma Devi Dura.

==Classification==
Schorer (2016:293) classifies Dura as part of his newly proposed Greater Magaric branch.

==Distribution==
The ethnic Dura people mostly live in Lamjung District, with some in neighboring Tanahu District of Gandaki Province in central Nepal. They mostly live on farms in the hilly countryside. Different recent census counts have reported the number of Dura people anywhere from 3,397 to 5,676.

Dura villages include:

*बाँग्रे Bāṅgre
*बेसी बाँग्रे Besī Bāṅgre
*बेसी फाँट Besī Phā̃ṫ
*सिन्दुरे Sindure
*धुसेनी Dhusenī
*नस्के Naske (Dura majority)
*नेटा Neṭā
*चन्दि गाउँ Candigāũ
*भाँगु Bhāṅgu
*मालिङ Māliṅ
*आरीकोसे Ārīkose
*ठूलो स्वाँरा Ṭhūlo Svā̃rā (Dura majority)
*खजे गाउँ Khaje Gāũ
*तुर्लुङ Turluṅ (Dura majority)
*तान्द्राङ्कोट Tāndrāṅkoṫ
*Kunchha
*Bhorletar
Other ethnic groups in the Dura region include the Gurung, Brahmins, Chetrīs, Kāmī, and Damāi.

==Tandrange==
A closely related language variety called &quot;Tandrange&quot; (Nepali: Tāndrāṅe; IPA: tandraŋe) is spoken in a few Gurung villages. Tandrange is spoken in the villages of Tāndrāṅ तान्द्राङ, Pokharī Thok पोखरी थोक, and Jītā जीता. However, Tandrange speakers adamantly consider themselves as not related to the stigmatized Dura people.

==Vocabulary==
Schorer (2016:126-127) provides the following 125-word Swadesh list of Dura.

===Numerals===
Dura numerals are (Schorer 2016:146-147):
*0. liŋa
*1. nām, kyau, di-
*2. jʰim
*3. sām
*4. pim
*5. kum
*6. cyām (Indo-Aryan loanword)
*7. syām (Indo-Aryan loanword)
*8. him
*9. tum
*10. tʰim
*20. jʰim-tʰī
*30. sām-tʰī
*100. tʰiŋganā, kātʰerāgo
*1,000. jena

===Reconstruction of Proto-Dura===

<doc id="598101" wikidata="Q6480132" url="?curid=598101" title="Lala Mara">
<text>Ro Lala, Lady Mara, maiden name Litia Cakobau Lalabalavu Katoafutoga Tuisawau (4 January 1931 – 20 July 2004) was a Fijian chief, who was better known as the widow of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, modern Fiji&#x27;s founding father who served for many years as Prime Minister and President of his country. As Fiji&#x27;s First Lady, Adi Lala took on a diplomatic role, frequently representing her country abroad. She was regarded as a formidable and astute woman, whose influence on her husband was said to be considerable.

== Family background ==
From her father George Tuisawau, she inherited the title of Roko Tui Dreketi, the traditional title of the rulers of the Burebasaga Confederacy, which covers the provinces of Rewa, Nadroga-Navosa, Namosi, Serua, Kadavu (off the southern coast of Viti Levu), and parts of Ba and Ra. Her mother, Adi Asenaca Vosailagi, was from the chiefly Ka Levu clan of Nadroga, where she was a chief in her own right. The village of Lomanikoro in Rewa Province is the capital of the confederacy. Adi Lala&#x27;s marriage, on 9 September 1950, to Ratu Mara, who was to become the Tui Lau and Tui Nayau (the traditional ruler of the Lau Islands) was considered a dynastic marriage, as it united two powerful feudal families. Relations between the families had been strained in the past, so the marriage was opposed in certain quarters, especially on Ratu Mara&#x27;s side. Nevertheless, the marriage was by all accounts a happy one and lasted 54 years, until Ratu Mara&#x27;s death on 18 April 2004. The duration of this marriage was in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce in much of the Mara clan. Three sons and five daughters issued from their marriage, two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, served as a member of the House of Representatives and of the Cabinet throughout the 1990s, and led the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998. Their second daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1999 and was Minister of Tourism in 1999 and 2000. She was a Senator from 2001 to 2006, and has been First Lady since 2009, being married to the President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau.

== Political career ==

In 1991, Adi Lala founded the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (&quot;Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei,&quot; or SVT) as the successor to the disbanded Alliance Party that her husband had founded and led, but for the leadership she was outmanoeuvred by Sitiveni Rabuka, who had led the Fiji coups of 1987. To the end of her life, Adi Lala remained active in the Great Council of Chiefs, where she was regarded as a voice of moderation.

On 12 November 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that Adi Lala had bitterly accused some chiefs, whom she did not name, of having been involved in the coup d&#x27;état which deposed her husband from the presidency in May 2000 and also toppled the elected government. Opening a meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs, she said that the perpetrators of the coup were &quot;false prophets&quot; motivated by greed, who were inciting racial strife and uncertainty with their threats, and that the coups had brought Fiji to its knees. She called on her fellow-chiefs to re-examine their roles, especially in regard to promoting racial harmony in a multicultural nation. She said some chiefs had also been involved in the earlier coups of 1987.

== Controversies following her death ==

Ro Lala&#x27;s death, only three months after that of her husband, was announced in Suva on 20 July 2004. No immediate cause of death was given. Allegations were subsequently made in Parliament, however, that she had suffered a fatal heart attack after hearing the distressing news that her son-in-law, &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli Ganilau, was to be dismissed as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, which was &quot;the last straw&quot; after her husband&#x27;s death three months earlier. Senator James Ah Koy claimed on the floor of the Senate to have received the information from sources close to Adi Lala&#x27;s family, and charged the Qarase government with responsibility for her death because of its involvement in Ganilau&#x27;s sacking. His comments drew a strong rebuke from the Chairman of the Kadavu Provincial Council, which Ah Koy represented in the Senate. &quot;Ratu&quot; Joe Nawalowalo called his speech &quot;gutter material&quot; which &quot;belittled&quot; the close relationship Adi Lala had enjoyed with the province.

== Statue proposed ==
Adi Lala was succeeded as Roko Tui Dreketi by her younger sister, Ro Teimumu Vuikaba Kepa, who also served as Minister for Education in the Qarase government from 2000 to 2006.

The women&#x27;s organisation &quot;Soqosoqo Vakamarama i Taukei&quot; announced on 21 July 2005, the day after the first anniversary of Adi Lala&#x27;s death, that it was setting up a foundation that would help build a statue of the late Adi Lala, who was the founder of the &quot;Soqosoqo Vakamarama&quot; and its president until her death.

The period of mourning for Adi Lala ended on 20–21 September 2005, with a ceremony at the chiefly village of Cuvu in Nadroga, where her mother was from. Attended by large delegations of chiefs and commoners from the Kubuna and Tovata as well as her own Burebasaga Confederacy, the ceremonies included the presentation of more than two container-loads of gifts including &quot;tabua&quot; (whales&#x27; teeth), &quot;masi&quot; (tapa cloth), canoes, mats, and lavish quantities of food, and culminated in a feast. Earlier, Ro Epeli Mataitini, the &quot;Younger brother of the official Vunivalu&quot; (a Chiefs Right Hand) for the Roko Tui Dreketi, had spoken of the love and respect that Fijians had for Adi Lala. While humans planned their future, he said, God always had the final say in people&#x27;s lives, which was why it was so important to appreciate and maintain the links that bound Fiji&#x27;s chiefly clans together. He called on younger Fijians to learn from the older chiefs who, despite political differences, cherished their links to the different tribes that make up the nation.

<doc id="598103" wikidata="Q6684773" url="?curid=598103" title="Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)">
<text>The Lothians was one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) from 1999 to 2011. Nine of the parliament&#x27;s 73 first past the post constituencies were sub-divisions of the region and it elected seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Thus it elected a total of 16 MSPs.

The Lothians region shared boundaries with the South of Scotland and Central Scotland regions, and was connected with the Mid Scotland and Fife region by bridges over the Firth of Forth.

As a result of the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries it is largely replaced by the Lothian region.

==Constituencies and council areas==

The council areas City of Edinburgh and West Lothian are entirely within the region. Most of the East Lothian council area is outside, covered by the East Lothian constituency, which is in the South of Scotland region. A western portion of the Midlothian council area is covered by the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency, within the South of Scotland region.

Council areas are as defined in 1996, and may be subject to change after the next Scottish Parliament election.

The constituencies were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing in at that time. Scottish Westminster constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies in 2005.

In terms of first past the post constituencies the region includes:
==Members of the Scottish Parliament==
The table below displays the Members of the Scottish Parliament that were elected from the Lothians region between 1999 and 2011. From the 2011 election the Lothian region was used.

<text>Dubingiai () is a town in Molėtai district in Lithuania. It is situated near Lake Asveja, the longest lake in the country. The town has 208 inhabitants as of 2017.

==History==

The settlement was first mentioned in 1334, when Teutonic knights razed &quot;terra Dubingam&quot; during one of their raids. Other raids took place in 1373 and 1375. During the reign of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas the Great the town became an important place in that part of Lithuania. In 1415 Vytautas ordered the building of a new masonry castle.

Later it was governed by the Radziwiłłs who built Dubingiai Castle from rock and town became one of the centres of the Reformation in Lithuania. Many famous members of Radziwiłł family were burned and are buried in the churchyard of Dubingiai castle. In the 17th century weave and paper manufactures were established in the town. In the 17th century - 18th century the town was slowly re-converted to Catholicism.

Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Dubingiai belonged to Vilnius Voivodeship. It was annexed by the Russian Empire after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 and became a part of Vilna Governorate.

A massacre of over 20 Lithuanian inhabitants by a local Home Army unit occurred on 23 June 1944, during World War II. The crime was a retaliation by the Polish commander for an earlier massacre of Polish villagers in Glitiškės by collaborationist Lithuanian police.

<text>Prem Singh is an Indo-Fijian politician and a former member of the Fijian Parliament. He is a member of the National Federation Party (NFP).

Singh was educated in Fiji and at Wellington Polytechnic in New Zealand. He served three terms on the Nadi town council, and was deputy mayor from 1999 to 2001. He is a founding member of the Fiji Cane Growers Association.

Singh contested the 2001 election for the NFP, winning the Nadi Open constituency and becoming the only member of his party to win a seat in the House of Representatives of Fiji. He was subsequently appointed Leader of the Opposition, after Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry declined the office. In February 2002 he lost his seat after an election petition. Singh appealed this decision to the Supreme Court which ruled that even though the ruling was incorrect, the Constitution did not allow for the appeal of a Court of Disputed Returns ruling. He was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Mick Beddoes.

Singh was re-elected to Parliament in the 2014 election, winning 1125 votes.

In September 2016 the High Court found that Singh had violated the Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures) Decree 2013 by under declaring value of estate held in Nadi. The finding was later upheld by the Court of Appeal, and referred to the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption.

Singh gained only 926 votes in the 2018 election and was not re-elected. He contested the 2022 election, winning 642 votes, but again missed out on re-election.

<doc id="598113" wikidata="Q58316" url="?curid=598113" title="Inoke Kubuabola">
<text>Ratu Inoke Kubuabola (born 1948) is a Fijian politician and Cabinet Minister. He is the former leader of the opposition and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Since 11 August 2022, he has been a High Commissioner to New Zealand.

Kubuabola worked as an assistant manager for the New Zealand Insurance Company in Auckland and Suva. From 1975 to 1987 he was secretary of the South Pacific Bible Society. A Fijian nationalist, he was involved in the planning of the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état. Following the coup he was appointed Minister for Information in the Military Government, and subsequently served as Minister for Information, Broadcasting, Television and Telecommunication.

Kubuabola was elected to Parliament in the 1992 election as a candidate for the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) and reappointed to Cabinet as Minister for Youth, Employment Opportunities and Sports. He was re-elected at the 1994 election and was appointed Minister for Regional Development and Multi Ethnic Affairs. In 1996 he was appointed Minister of Works, Infrastructure and Transport.

Following the defeat of the SVT government at the 1999 election and the subsequent resignation of its leader, the defeated Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, Kubuabola became leader of the SVT and Leader of the Opposition. Under the 1997 Constitution of Fiji the Leader of the Opposition chose 8 of the 32 members of the Senate, and Kubuabola sparked controversy in the role by limiting his selection to members of opposition parties.

Following the Fiji coup of 2000 Kubuabola was appointed Minister for Information and Communications in the interim Cabinet formed by Laisenia Qarase. He held this office till September 2001, when he lost his seat in the 2001 election. That year he also resigned the Chairmanship of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council, which he had led for several years, to Sitiveni Rabuka.

== Diplomat ==
Kubuabola served as Fiji&#x27;s High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea from 2002 to 2005. In late 2005, he attempted to handle the problem of Fijian security guards, whom some accused of being mercenaries, operating illegally on the island of Bougainville.

On 4 May 2006 Kubuabola was posted to Tokyo as Fiji&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan and Korea, replacing Ratu Tevita Momoedonu. He remained in this position until July 2009 when he was named Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Interim Government.

Kubuabola ran as a candidate for FijiFirst in the 2014 election, and was elected with 5,414 votes. He did not seek re-election at the 2018 election.

On 11 August 2022, he presented his letter of credence to Governor-General Cindy Kiro as High Commissioner to New Zealand.

<doc id="598118" wikidata="Q172773" url="?curid=598118" title="François Cevert">
<text>Albert François Cevert (; 25 February 1944 – 6 October 1973) was a French racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Cevert won the 1971 United States Grand Prix with Tyrrell.

Cevert competed in Formula One for Tecno and Tyrrell, finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in .

During qualifying for the 1973 United States Grand Prix, Cevert was killed when he crashed his Tyrrell 006 in an attempt at his maiden pole position.

==Family background==
Cevert was the son of Charles Goldenberg (1901–1985), a Parisian jeweller, and Huguette Cevert. Charles was a Russian-Jewish émigré brought to France as a young boy by his parents, to escape the persecution of the Jews under the Tsarist autocracy. During World War II, under the Nazi occupation of France, Goldenberg joined the French Resistance to avoid forced deportation to Poland, as he was a registered Jew. In order not to draw further attention, Charles and Huguette&#x27;s four children were all registered with her surname (Cevert) rather than his. Some years after the liberation of France, Cevert&#x27;s father wanted to rename his children back to Goldenberg, but they decided not to as by now they had become used to be known as Cevert.

Cevert&#x27;s sister would marry fellow Grand Prix driver Jean-Pierre Beltoise.

==Career==

===Early career===
When he was 16, François Cevert began his motorsport career on two wheels, rather than four, initially racing his mother&#x27;s Vespa scooter against friends, before graduating to his own Norton at the age of 19. After completing his National Service, Cevert switched his attention to cars. In 1966 he completed a training course at the Le Mans school, before enrolling Winfield Racing School at the Magny-Cours racing school. At Winfield, he won the Volant Shell scholarship as the top finisher among the students. The prize was an Alpine Formula Three.

His first season in F3, at the wheel of his prize Alpine, did not go well. He lacked the funds and experience to properly set up and maintain his car. After finding sponsorship for the 1968 season, Cevert traded in his Alpine for a more competitive Tecno car. With his new mount Cevert finally started to win races, and by the end of the season he was French Formula 3 Champion, just ahead of Jean-Pierre Jabouille.

After winning the French Formula 3 Championship, Cevert joined the works Tecno Formula Two team in 1969, and finished third overall, as well as driving in the F2 class of the 1969 German Grand Prix. At the time, Formula Two was an ideal training ground for ambitious drivers, as many top Grand Prix drivers also competed in the F2 class, when their Formula One schedules permitted. When Jackie Stewart had a hard time getting around Cevert in an F2 race at Crystal Palace the same year, Stewart told his team manager Ken Tyrrell to keep an eye on the young Frenchman. This personal recommendation was to pay off in 1970, as when Tyrrell needed a new driver at short notice Stewart&#x27;s recommendation was still in his mind. Tyrrell later commented on the reason for Cevert&#x27;s appointment to the Formula One team that &quot;everybody said it was (French oil company and Tyrrell sponsor) Elf, but it was really what Jackie said about him.&quot;

===Formula One===

When Johnny Servoz-Gavin suddenly retired from the Tyrrell Formula One team three races into the 1970 season, Tyrrell called upon Cevert to be his number two driver, alongside defending World Champion Stewart. Over the next four seasons, Cevert became the veteran Stewart&#x27;s devoted protégé. After making his debut at the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort in Tyrrell&#x27;s second customer March-Ford, he increased his pace and closed the gap to Stewart with virtually every race. He earned his first World Championship point by finishing sixth in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

In 1971, with the Tyrrell team now building their own cars, Cevert finished second in France and Germany, both times behind team leader Stewart. Then, in the season-ending United States Grand Prix at the newly extended Watkins Glen race course, the Frenchman earned his first and only Grand Prix win.

&quot;Having started from fifth spot, Cevert took the lead from Stewart on lap 14 as the Scot&#x27;s tires began to go off in the 100° heat. At about half-distance, Cevert finally began to struggle with the same understeer that had plagued Stewart much earlier. Jacky Ickx was closing, and his Firestones were getting better as the race went on. On lap 43, Ickx set the fastest lap of the race, and the gap was down to 2.2 seconds. Then, on lap 49, the alternator on Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari fell off, punching a hole in the gearbox and spilling oil all over the track! Denny Hulme&#x27;s McLaren hit the oil and spun into the barrier, bending his front suspension. Hulme was standing beside the track when Cevert came by and also slid off and hit the barrier, but he kept going, now 29 seconds in the lead! Cevert coasted home, taking both hands off the wheel to wave as he crossed the line.&quot;
Cevert became only the second Frenchman to win a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix (Maurice Trintignant won at Monaco in 1955 and 1958), and received 50,000 U.S. dollars as award. It was the high point of his career, helping him take third place in the 1971 Drivers&#x27; Championship behind Stewart and Ronnie Peterson.
Great expectations for Cevert, Stewart and Tyrrell were not fulfilled in 1972, Cevert finished in the points only three times, with second places in Belgium and in the USA, and a fourth at his home race in France at the Clermont-Ferrand circuit. One bright spot in a disappointing year for Cevert was his second-place finish at the 24 hours of Le Mans, driving a Matra-Simca 670 with New Zealand&#x27;s Howden Ganley.

==Death==
In 1973, the Tyrrell team was back on top in Formula One and Cevert showed he was capable of running with Stewart at almost every race. He finished second six times, three times behind Stewart, who acknowledged that at times the Frenchman had been a very &quot;obedient&quot; teammate. As Cevert began to draw even with Stewart&#x27;s driving abilities, the Scot was secretly planning to retire after the last race of the season in the United States. For the 1974 season, Cevert would be Tyrrell&#x27;s team leader.

At Watkins Glen, with Stewart having already clinched his third World Championship, Cevert was killed during Saturday morning qualifying, while battling for pole position with Ronnie Peterson. In the fast right-left uphill combination called &quot;The Esses&quot;, Cevert&#x27;s car was a little too far over towards the left side of the track, getting a bump from the kerbs. This made it swerve towards the right-hand side of the track, where it touched the track&#x27;s signature powder blue safety barriers causing it to spin and crash into the barriers on the other side of the track at a near 90° angle, uprooting and lifting the barrier. Cevert died instantly of massive injuries inflicted by the barrier, which cut his body in half between his neck and hip.

Stewart said that &quot;Cevert had crashed violently in the uphill Esses heading onto the back of the circuit. Fighting the car as he went up the hill, he brushed the curb on the left, whipped across the track and hit the guardrail on the right. The car began to spin, and he swerved back across the track at 150 mph and hit the outside guardrail almost head-on.&quot; Stewart was one of the last on the scene of Cevert&#x27;s accident and later said: &quot;They [the marshals] had left him [in the car], because he was so clearly dead.&quot; Stewart immediately left the scene of the accident and returned to the pits.

Word of the severity of the crash gradually reached the pit area. Footage shows track personnel and members of other teams, including Lotus owner Colin Chapman heading for the Tyrrell pit where Stewart parked his car. Chapman was told by Lotus team manager Peter Warr that Cevert was the driver involved and that it was &quot;very bad&quot;. When Stewart exited his car, Chapman apparently deduced simply from his expression that it was a fatal accident. The Lotus team boss shook his head and stated mournfully, &quot;Cevert... bloody hell.&quot; He then sighed and started walking slowly back to the Lotus pits.

Peterson returned to the pits and Team Lotus boss Peter Warr asked him about Cevert&#x27;s crash. Peterson&#x27;s response was &quot;I have never seen anything like it&quot;. He was later interviewed about the crash in 1975 in SVT, the Swedish television broadcaster in a documentary about Ronnie. He explained about the terrible sight of Cevert&#x27;s body when he found him lying scattered in pieces of the wreckage. Peterson was still visibly shaken when talking about the accident and he also said that Cevert was his closest friend in F1.

Wilson Fittipaldi said he talked to Cevert earlier, wishing him good luck. After Cevert crashed, Wilson was still oblivious as to why all cars were returning to the pits, and why the crowd was silent. He then noticed that only Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Tyrell returned and not Cevert&#x27;s. He talked with his race engineer, asking what happened. After the engineer confirmed Cevert&#x27;s death, and being told the qualifying session would resumed, Wilson got out of his car and furiously called the decision &quot;bullshit&quot;, as he sat on top of the pit wall and refused to go back. Emerson Fittipaldi claims he parked his car shortly thereafter and immediately got out without speaking. He later called Cevert&#x27;s death &quot;[o]ne of the saddest [days] of my career. I asked [myself] &#x27;is this what I really want?&#x27; as I was in the paddock&quot;. After the qualifying session resumed, he returned to his car, however. Because of Cevert&#x27;s death, Tyrrell withdrew its entry for this GP, and Stewart did not run what had been planned to be his final, and 100th, race. Cevert was 29 years and 224 days old. He is buried in the Cimetière de Vaudelnay in the village of Vaudelnay, Maine-et-Loire.

===Cause of the accident analysed by Stewart===
When practice resumed, Stewart went out on the track in his car on a personal fact-finding mission. His conclusion was that his own preference was to take The Esses complex in fourth gear in the Tyrrell, hence he would be at the low end of the engine&#x27;s rev range, making the car more tractable and less nervous (in exchange for a bit less throttle response). Cevert, however, preferred to use third gear and be at the top end of his engine&#x27;s power range: it was always something of a compromise because of the need to accelerate through the combination of corners. Stewart noted that the Tyrrell always felt jumpy through this section of the Watkins Glen track owing to its short wheelbase; he felt that this was somewhat counteracted by driving in the higher gear even though this meant a time penalty if he got his line wrong through the corner.

A film documentary of the time, shot minutes before the start of the fatal practice session, captures Stewart and Cevert in a spirited debate on exactly this point. Another accident occurred at the same circuit a year later in the 1974 USA Grand Prix when another young Formula One driver, Helmut Koinigg, died when his car went straight into the barrier at turn 7 decapitating the driver. As a response to Cevert&#x27;s and Koinigg&#x27;s accidents, a chicane was added in 1975 in order to slow the cars through turns 2 to 4. That chicane was removed in 1985 after the track lost its Formula One race in 1981. It is not to be confused with the current chicane built in 1992 before the entrance to turn 5, which was installed after another two accidents during the 1991 racing season that resulted in severe injuries to Tommy Kendall and the death of J.D. McDuffie in separate racing incidents.

==Films==
Cevert was extensively profiled and interviewed in the 1975 Formula One documentary &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;. The 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot; portrays a composite of Cevert&#x27;s qualifying fatal accident, combining what appears to be the remains of a blue liveried 1973 Tyrrell 006 with the configuration of Helmut Koinigg&#x27;s accident while driving the Surtees TS16 in the 1974 race. Also in 2013, &quot;1: Life on the Limit&quot; documents Cevert&#x27;s fatal accident in 1973.

<doc id="598128" wikidata="Q7351154" url="?curid=598128" title="Robert Wilson (dramatist)">
<text>Robert Wilson (flourished 15721600), was an Elizabethan dramatist who worked primarily in the 1580s and 1590s. He is also believed to have been an actor who specialized in clown roles.

He was connected with sixteen plays intended for Philip Henslowe&#x27;s Rose Theatre, in partnership with other playwrights who also produced copy for Henslowe. While mentioned as a dramatist by Francis Meres in 1598, most existing information on his dramatic career is derived from Henslowe&#x27;s papers.

Since the name is common, it is not certain that the Robert Wilson who worked for Henslowe in 1598-1600 is the same man who was a prominent actor and occasional playwright in the 1580s; yet many scholars consider it more likely than not that the records refer to one Robert Wilson and not two. If this is correct, Wilson was acting with Leicester&#x27;s Men in the 1570s, and was praised along with Richard Tarlton for his &quot;wit.&quot; He is generally accepted as the author of &quot;The Three Ladies of London&quot; (published 1584), &quot;The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London&quot; (published 1590), and &quot;The Cobbler&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; (published 1594). It has been speculated that he may also have written &quot;Fair Em&quot; (c. 1590). In &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), Francis Meres mentions Wilson along with Tarlton, and specifically connects Wilson with the Swan Theatre, which was built c. 1595.

In just over two years, from spring 1598 to summer 1600, Wilson worked with other members of Henslowe&#x27;s stable of house playwrights on sixteen different plays, including three two-part projects. Several of these were never completed.

# &quot;Earl Goodwin and his Three Sons, Parts 1 and 2&quot;, with Michael Drayton, Henry Chettle, and Thomas Dekker; March 1598.
# &quot;Piers of Exton&quot;, with Drayton, Chettle, and Dekker; March 1598.
# &quot;Black Bateman of the North, Parts 1 and 2&quot;, with Chettle; Part I with Dekker and Drayton also; May–June 1598.
# &quot;The Funeral of Richard Cordelion&quot;, with Chettle, Drayton, and Anthony Munday; June 1598.
# &quot;The Madman&#x27;s Morris&quot;, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598.
# &quot;Hannibal and Hermes&quot;, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598.
# &quot;Pierce of Winchester&quot;, with Dekker and Drayton, July–August 1598.
# &quot;Catiline&#x27;s Conspiracy&quot;, with Chettle; August 1598. Apparently never completed.
# &quot;Chance Medley&quot;, with Munday, Drayton, and Dekker or Chettle; August 1598.
# &quot;Sir John Oldcastle, Parts 1 and 2&quot;, with Drayton, Munday, and Richard Hathwaye; Oct.-Dec. 1599.
# &quot;Henry Richmond, Part 2&quot;, with others; never completed.
# &quot;Owen Tudor&quot;, with Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; Jan. 1600. Apparently never completed.
# &quot;Fair Constance of Rome, Part 1&quot;, with Dekker, Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; June 1600.

Of Wilson&#x27;s collaborations for Henslowe, only the first part of &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; was published, in 1600 and 1619. None of the other plays has survived. &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; was commissioned as a counterblast to the negative depiction of title character in the original versions of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. Objections from descendants of the historical John Oldcastle, a Protestant martyr, appears to have been responsible both for the writing of the corrective &quot;Oldcastle&quot; play and the alteration of Oldcastle to Sir John Falstaff in later versions of the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays.

Also, Wilson has been proposed as a possible author of several anonymous Elizabethan plays, including &quot;Fair Em&quot;, &quot;The Pedlar&#x27;s Prophecy&quot;, &quot;A Larum for London&quot;, &quot;Look About You&quot;, &quot;Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes&quot;, and &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot;. On the basis of traditional literary-critical analysis and digital textual methods, Darren Freebury-Jones has proposed that the case for Wilson&#x27;s authorship of &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot; is compelling.

As to why a writer would work the way the Henslowe collaborators did: the careers of dramatists who worked mostly on solo projects, like Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, show that a dramatist working alone could produce one or two plays a year on a dependable basis. If one of those plays failed to sell, or flopped with the audience, the writer was severely affected. Collaborative writing spread the risk, and could provide a more certain income for a journeyman author.

A &quot;Robert Wilson, yeoman (player)&quot; was buried at St. Giles in Cripplegate on 20 November 1600. This is consistent with the view that the two Robert Wilsons, the player with Leicester&#x27;s Men and Henslowe&#x27;s dramatist, were one and the same person; it explains why Henslowe&#x27;s Wilson stopped writing in 1600.

<doc id="598134" wikidata="Q377551" url="?curid=598134" title="Join (Unix)">
<text>codice_1 is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that merges the lines of two sorted text files based on the presence of a common field. It is similar to the join operator used in relational databases but operating on text files.

==Overview==
The codice_1 command takes as input two text files and several options. If no command-line argument is given, this command looks for a pair of lines from the two files having the same first field (a sequence of characters that are different from space), and outputs a line composed of the first field followed by the rest of the two lines.

The program arguments specify which character to be used in place of space to separate the fields of the line, which field to use when looking for matching lines, and whether to output lines that do not match. The output can be stored to another file rather than printed using redirection.

As an example, the two following files list the known fathers and the mothers of some people. Both files have been sorted on the join field — this is a requirement of the program.

 george jim
 kumar gunaware

 albert martha
 george sophie

The join of these two files (with no argument) would produce:

 george jim sophie

Indeed, only &quot;george&quot; is common as a first word of both files.

==History==
 is intended to be a relation database operator. It is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Mike Haertel. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

<doc id="598139" wikidata="Q3519346" url="?curid=598139" title="Bekal Fort">
<text>Bekal Fort is a medieval fort built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over .



==Structure==
The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.

The fort&#x27;s zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy closest to the fort.

Its solid construction resembles the Thalassery Fort and the St. Angelo Fort at Kannur built by the Dutch .

== History ==
During the &quot;Perumal Age&quot; Bekal was a part of Mahodayapuram. Following the decline of Mahodayapuram Perumals, Bekal came under the sovereignty of the Mushika or Kolathiri or Chirakkal Royal Family in the 12th century. The maritime importance of Bekal increased under the Kolathiris and Malabar became an important port town.

After the Battle of Talikota in 1565 feudatory chieftains including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayaks) became powerful in the region. Bekal served as a hub to first dominate, then later defend Malabar. The economic importance of this port town prompted the Nayakas to fortify Bekal subsequently. Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka initiated the construction of the fort and it was completed in 1650 AD by Shivappa Nayaka. Chandragiri fort near Kasargod was also built during this period.

The struggles between the Kolathiries and nayaks to hold this area ended when Hyder Ali conquered the Nayakas and Bekal fell into the hands of Mysore kings.

It was an important military station for Tipu Sultan when he led a military expedition to capture Malabar. The coins and artefacts found in archaeological excavations at Bekal fort indicate the strong presence of Mysore Sultans. Tipu Sultan&#x27;s death during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War ended Mysorean control in 1799. The fort came under the British East India Company&#x27;s control and became the headquarters of the Bekal Taluk of South Canara District in Bombay presidency. The political and economic importance of Bekal and its port declined.

Nearby the Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and ancient Muslim mosque bear testimony to the religious harmony that prevailed in the area.

== Tourism ==
India declared Bekal Fort a special tourism area in 1992 and formed Bekal Tourism Development Corporation three years later to promote it. The fort has been featured in the song &#x27;Uyire&#x27; (Tamil) from the movie Bombay and the song ‘Dwadashiyil’ from the Malayalam movie Madhuranombarakattu.

==Transportation==
Local roads connect to Mangalore in the north and Calicut in the south. The nearest railway station is Bekal Fort Railway Station, Kanhangad Railway Station and Kotikulam Railway Station on Mangalore-Palakkad line. 

Nearest Airports are Mangalore International Airport, 71 km, Kannur International Airport, 101 km, and Calicut International Airport, 195 km.


==In popular culture==
The song &#x27;Uyire Uyire&#x27; from the film Bombay was shot in Bekal Fort.

<text>DIBOL or Digital&#x27;s Business Oriented Language is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative programming language that was designed for use in Management Information Systems (MIS) software development. It was developed from 1970 to 1993.

DIBOL has a syntax similar to FORTRAN and BASIC, along with BCD arithmetic. It shares the COBOL program structure of separate data and procedure divisions. Unlike Fortran&#x27;s numeric labels (for GOTO), DIBOL&#x27;s were alphanumeric; the language supported a counterpart to computed goto.

==History==
DIBOL was originally marketed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1970.

The original version, DIBOL-8, was produced for PDP-8 systems running COS-300. The PDP-8-like DECmate II, supports the COS-310 Commercial Operating System, featuring DIBOL.

DIBOL-11 was developed for the PDP-11 running COS-350 operating system. It also ran on RSX-11, RT-11, and from 1978 on RSTS/E. DIBOL-32 runs on VMS systems, although it can also be used on other systems through emulators.

ANSI Standards were released in 1983, 1988 and 1992 (ANSI X3.165-1992). The 1992 standard was revised in 2002.

DIBOL compilers were developed by several other companies, including DBL from DISC (later Synergex), Softbol from Omtool, and Unibol from Software Ireland, Ltd. Development of DIBOL effectively ceased after 1993, when an agreement between DEC and DISC replaced DIBOL with DBL on OpenVMS, Digital UNIX, and SCO Unix.

<text>The Millennium Technology Prize () is one of the world&#x27;s largest technology prizes. It is awarded once every two years by Technology Academy Finland, an independent foundation established by Finnish industries, academic institutions, and the state of Finland. The patron of the prize is the President of Finland. The Millennium Technology Prize is Finland&#x27;s tribute to innovations for a better life. The aims of the prize are to promote technological research and Finland as a high-tech Nordic welfare state. The prize was inaugurated in 2004.

==The Prize==
The idea of the prize came originally from the Finnish academician Pekka Jauho, with American real estate investor and philanthropist Arthur J Collingsworth encouraging its establishment. The Prize celebrates innovations that have a favorable and sustainable impact on quality of life and well-being of people. The innovations also must have been applied in practice and stimulate further research and development. Compared to the Nobel Prize the Millennium Technology Prize is a technology award, whereas the Nobel Prize is a science award. Furthermore, the Nobel Prize is awarded for basic research, but the Millennium Technology Prize may be given to a recently conceived innovation which is still being developed. The Millennium Technology Prize is not intended as a reward for lifetime achievement.

The Millennium Technology Prize is awarded by Technology Academy Finland (formerly Millennium Prize Foundation and Finnish Technology Award Foundation), established in 2002 by eight Finnish organisations supporting technological development and innovation. The prize sum is 1 million euros (~US$1.3 million). The Millennium Technology Prize is awarded every second year and its patron is the president of Finland. 

Universities, research institutes, national scientific and engineering academies, high-tech companies, and other organizations around the world are eligible to nominate individuals or groups for the award. Nominations are accepted from any field except military technology. In accordance with the rules of the Technology Academy Finland, a proposal concerning the winner of the Millennium Technology Prize is made to the board of the foundation by the eight-member international selection committee, and the final decision on the prize winner is made by the board of the foundation.

<doc id="598144" wikidata="Q1422815" url="?curid=598144" title="Acura MDX">
<text>The Acura MDX is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV with three-row seating produced by the Japanese automaker Honda under its luxury Acura division since 2000. The alphanumeric moniker stands for &quot;Multi-Dimensional&quot; luxury. It has ranked as the second-best selling mid-size luxury SUV after the Lexus RX in the U.S.

The MDX is the first luxury crossover SUV to have standard third-row seating, and shares its platform with the Honda Pilot. The Pilot was made available with an eight person seating configuration, while the MDX exclusively seats seven, with two seating positions in the third row. The MDX was introduced on October 5, 2000 as a 2001 model, replacing the slow-selling U.S.-only body-on-frame SLX, based on the Isuzu Trooper. In Japan, it was made to replace the Honda Horizon (also based on the Trooper) which was discontinued in 1999. In 2003, the vehicle went on sale in Japan and Australia as the Honda MDX; sales with Honda badges ended with the introduction of the second generation three years later.


== First generation (YD1; 2000) ==

Derived from Honda&#x27;s Global mid-size platform which underpins cars like the Honda Accord, Acura TL, TSX and Odyssey, it is powered by a &quot;J35A3&quot; 3.5 L SOHC 24 valve V6 engine with VTEC. Curb weight is , with a wheelbase and of ground clearance. The cargo floor can flip up to provide two additional seats. The vehicle is designed to hold 7 passengers, but the third row seats are small and only seat two, in contrast to the Odyssey and Pilot whose third row holds three passengers.

The vehicle features an automatic four wheel drive system (named VTM-4) that engages during off the line acceleration as well as when wheel slippage is detected. Additionally, the system offers a lock mode which can be activated and operated at low speeds and provides permanent 4WD and the equivalent of a locked rear differential; designed for climbing steep hills and getting out of stuck situations. To reduce drivetrain noise and increase fuel efficiency, the system runs as front wheel drive during normal cruising. The VTM-4 AWD system in the MDX has the same design as the VTM-4 systems found in the Honda Pilot and Honda Ridgeline. It is different than Honda&#x27;s &quot;RealTime AWD&quot; system in the Honda CR-V and other models in that it can lock and it attempts to predict when traction will be lost and apply power to all four wheels before slippage occurs (by monitoring throttle inputs).

The navigation system and DVD entertainment system (also popular on other Honda/Acura models, such as the CR-V and Odyssey) options were mutually exclusive in the 2002 model. Both could be ordered at the same time since the 2003 model. The navigation option comes with a backup camera since the 2003 model. Since 2005, the navigation system featured information from Zagat about restaurants and other points of interest. The 2003 model was rated as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates highway and city.
The first two model years&#x27; 3.5-liter V6 engine produces and of torque from 3000 to 5000 rpm. For the 2003 model year, the engine was improved to produce 20 hp (15 kW) more power than the earlier models, and the wheel designs were updated. The 2004 through 2006 engine received a modest increase in power and produces and . The 2004 model is credited with a top speed of 137 mph, and a 0-60 time of 7.1 seconds. The 2004 model year features dual tail pipes instead of the single pipe in earlier models, side curtain airbags, new head lights and tail lights, and new wheels. Some chrome trimmings on the 2004 model use matte finish to distinguish from the polished shiny finish on earlier models. Little changed for the MDX during 2005 for the 2006 model year with a few minor revisions to the vehicle&#x27;s chrome and faux wood interior trim which could now be had with a dark grey wood (as opposed to reddish wood on earlier models), and also a black dash and steering wheel in tan interiors.

== Second generation (YD2; 2006) ==

On April 11, 2006, Acura unveiled the 2007 Acura MD-X Concept during the New York International Auto Show, showing to the public an indication about the exterior styling of the upcoming completely redesigned MDX. The second-generation MDX was released on October 17, 2006 in the U.S.

The second generation model&#x27;s body has a wider track and longer wheelbase than the previous MDX. There is less visibility to the rear compared to the prior generation, however an available backup camera compensates for this. The redesigned Acura MDX&#x27;s unit-body was engineered with Honda&#x27;s Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure designed to absorb energy from a collision. The suspension was tuned at Germany&#x27;s Nürburgring race track. 

The engine was upgraded to a 3.7-liter (3664 cc) V6 tuned for at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. It accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds and is estimated by the EPA to consume in the city and on the highway. It is one of the most powerful engines Honda has produced to date. The MDX is able to tow .

The &quot;VTM-4&quot; all-wheel drive system on the previous generation was replaced by the new SH-AWD &quot;Super Handling All-Wheel Drive&quot; previously debuted on the 2005 Acura RL. This AWD system is one of the most advanced in its class, featuring an active rear differential often found on high performance cars, which somewhat mitigates the nose-heaviness of the MDX&#x27;s traverse engine platform so it can dynamically compete with the longitudinal engine layout crossover SUVs. The latter types of vehicles, such as the BMW X5 or Audi Q5, have a more balanced 50/50 front/rear distribution for better handling, but have less efficient packaging for passenger/cargo room.

Like many Acura models, the MDX comes with a power sunroof, leather interior, and high-intensity discharge (Xenon) low-beam headlights. For the 2007 through 2009 model years, three option packages were available: Sport, Technology and Entertainment.
* The Technology Package includes the Acura/Alpine DVD-based satellite GPS navigation system with AcuraLink satellite communications with real-time traffic reporting (XM NavTraffic), a 410-watt Acura/ELS DTS Surround audio system with XM Satellite Radio, backup camera, and a remote powered liftgate, operated either from the key&#x27;s remote, inside the car or directly from the lift gate.
* The Sport Package featured active suspension dampers (co-developed by Honda and Beijing West Industries) that dynamically improves handling according to road conditions with a button in the center stack to switch to Sport/Comfort modes. This Comfort/Sport mode uses magneto rheological dampers, which change their characteristics when a magnetic field is introduced (usually in milliseconds). The Sport package also includes unique 5-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels, perforated leather seats and the items in the Technology package.
* The Entertainment Package offers a flip-down LCD screen with 2 wireless Dolby Digital headphones, second-row heated outboard seats, and a unique center-stack silver trim. The Entertainment Package is only available on Sport or Technology Package models as compared to the 1st Generation MDX where the Entertainment Package was available as a standalone package on Touring Models.

All Canadian Acura MDX models, aside from the heated front seats, also get the second-row heated outboard seats as standard equipment as well. A feature unique to Canadian MDX models are headlight washers. In terms of packages, Canadian MDX models get only two: Technology and Elite. The Technology package corresponds essentially to the US model&#x27;s Technology package while the Elite package is an amalgamation of the US model&#x27;s Sport and Entertainment packages. However, AcuraLink real-time traffic reporting through XM NavTraffic is unavailable for Canadian MDX models.

Like the first generation model, the new generation is manufactured exclusively by Honda of Canada Manufacturing Ltd. in Alliston, Ontario, Canada. Along with the 2007 RDX, the new MDX was the first Acura model to pass the Acura Quality Line, a special quality control and verification process separate from the other Honda vehicles.

In 2008, for the 2009 model year, the MDX had added more upgrades to the navigation system and there are two new colors added. The power tailgate, previously available only with the Entertainment package, is now included with Technology and Sport packages.

In 2010, the MDX received a facelift adopting to Acura&#x27;s new &quot;Power Plenum&quot; grille that debuted on its 2009 model year sedans. The most important upgrades to the 2010 model where a new paddle shift six-speed SportShift automatic transmission with downshift Rev-matching, and an increase in compression ratio to 11.2:1 with forged aluminum pistons to replace the previous 2007–2009 3.7L&#x27;s 11.0:1 pistons. Structural rigidity was improved for the 2010 model year. An Advance Package became available that included Adaptive Cruise Control, blind spot monitor, Active Damper suspension, collision mitigation braking system, wider 7-spoked 19 inch wheels and tires, Premium Milano leather ventilated seats and auto leveling headlights. Non-navigation equipped MDX models now have a backup camera monitor located in the rear-view mirror.

The redesigned MDX overtook the TL as Acura&#x27;s top seller in the United States.

== Third generation (YD3/4/7; 2013) ==

The 2014 MDX Prototype was unveiled at the 2013 North American International Auto Show, the production version was revealed at the New York Auto Show. Production began on May 2, 2013; vehicle assembly shifted from Ontario, Canada to Lincoln, Alabama. US sales began on June 20.

The MDX is powered by a 3.5-liter direct injected Earth Dreams V6 with Variable Cylinder Management. A front-wheel drive (FWD) model is available for the first time, in Canada all-wheel drive remains the only configuration offered. EPA-estimated fuel economy is improved with all-wheel drive (SH-AWD) models rated at // (city/highway/combined) and FWD models rated at // (city/highway/combined).

The headlights are Acura&#x27;s Jewel Eye LED Headlights (first introduced on the RLX). Each headlamp uses five separate LED sources with three used for low-beam lighting and two for high-beam lighting. LED bumper mounted fog lamps are offered as a dealer installed option.

The interior reduced button clutter by adding a 7-inch touchscreen with haptic feedback, an additional 8-inch screen is also standard. To reduce interior noise an acoustic (PVB layered) windshield, acoustic front door glass and thicker rear glass are used as well as triple sealed door openings. Advance package models include further noise reduction using a thicker carpet base layer and front fender liners. The seating H-point has been reduced.

According to Acura the exterior is more aerodynamic reducing drag by 16% with the new model lapping Nürburgring 8 seconds faster than its predecessor. The steering gear ratio is 9% quicker for a more sporty feel. The MDX rides lower, which reduces its center of gravity. To reduce unsprung mass, the front suspension lower control arms are made from forged aluminum. Structure rigidity is improved and weight reduced through increased use of high-strength steel. Overall, 64% of the total vehicle body mass is high strength steel (HSS), aluminum and magnesium. HSS makes up 59% of vehicle body mass; 1,500 MPa yield strength steel makes up 7%. A single ring-like hot stamped HSS outer door ring component reinforces the A-pillar, roof rail, B-pillar, and lower floor rail encircling the front doors for improved crash protection. Acura states that after conducting a simulated IIHS 25% small offset frontal crash test the front doors will open with normal force.

The updated Adaptive Cruise Control adds low-speed stop-and-go functionality. In terms of safety the MDX adds a standard driver&#x27;s knee airbag, optional Lane Keeping Assist System and Collision Mitigation Braking System.

Acura swapped the Honda 6-speed automatic transmission for a ZF 9-speed automatic and changed the SH-AWD system in 2015 for the 2016 model year. The revised SH-AWD system uses a hydraulically-controlled clutch and is similar to system found in the TLX.

===Facelift===
A refreshed for the 2017 model year MDX went on sale in June 2016, and features a diamond pentagon front grille which debuted on the Acura Precision Concept, redesigned LED headlamps with automatic high beams, LED DRL light pipes and LED amber light pipe turn signals. Restyled LED fog lamps are optional from the factory. MDX models will come standard with AcuraWatch which includes forward collision warning (with automatic emergency braking), lane departure warning (with lane keep assist) and Adaptive Cruise Control. A 360-degree surround view camera is optional. To reduce body mass the front fenders switched from steel to an aluminum panel.

==== MDX Sport Hybrid (YD7)====
The MDX Sport Hybrid (YD7) powered by a 3.0-liter SOHC V6, 7-speed dual-clutch, 1.3 kWh lithium-ion battery gasoline hybrid producing and was added to the lineup. The front wheels are powered by the engine and a single electric motor, and the rear wheels are powered by two electric motors. The Sport Hybrid comes as standard with the SH-AWD system, Acura&#x27;s Active Damper System and the Integrated Dynamics System with a SPORT+ mode. Sales commenced in April 2017 for the 2017 model year and was available in Technology and Advanced packages.

===2018 update===
In 2018, for the 2019 model year, the Active Damper System is available for non-hybrids, the front seats feature 4-way power lumbar. During the 2018 New York International Auto Show, alongside the debut of the third generation RDX, Acura announced the introduction of the A-Spec appearance package. The exterior features black and dark chrome accents, replacing all the chrome and rides on 20&quot; grey aluminum wheels. The bumpers are redesigned to give the A-Spec a more sharp and aggressive design. Red leather seats with black alcantara inserts is now an option for the A-Spec package. Other changes for the A-Spec trim are new gauges, carbon fiber trim, sport pedals, and thicker steering wheel with paddle shifters.

===Marketing===
As part of 2014 Acura MDX launch in the United States, a campaign called &#x27;The Extremely New MDX - Made for Mankind&#x27; was produced. The campaign highlights the complete technical transformation of the MDX and centers around the idea of &quot;Made for Mankind,&quot; a concept designed to highlight the unique engineering and design philosophy at the heart of all Acura vehicles - the synergy between man and machine. The campaign was developed by Mullen (Boston and LA) and with MediaVest. Also, a series of 8 comedic commercials were created with comedian Jerry Seinfeld and director Barry Sonnenfeld. In addition, Acura became an exclusive sponsor of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

== Fourth generation (YD8/9/YE1; 2021)==
Skipping the 2021 model year, the fourth-generation MDX was revealed as a prototype on October 14, 2020, virtually revealed on December 8, went into bulk production on January 12, 2021 for the 2022 model year, and went on sale on February 2, with the Type-S trim released on December 23. The MDX became the flagship model of the Acura marque following the discontinuation of the RLX mid-size luxury sedan in June 2020.

The exterior includes the standard panoramic sunroof, either 19 or 20-inch alloy rims, a tailgate similar to the 2019 RDX, headlights and taillights similar to the current TLX, a differently styled grille emblem, nine exterior and seven interior colors. For the Type-S trim, a yellow color, called Tiger Eye will also be available. The improved interior includes a 12.3-inch infotainment system and the Acura&#x27;s first 12-inch digital full TFT instrument cluster, touch pad, 16-way power front seats with 3-memory positions, removable center second row seat, a removable double sided trunk floor with carpet and plastic, and more legroom and headroom compared to the third generation MDX. The MDX also features an optional audio system with 16-speakers including four roof-mounted speakers and a foot sensor for Hands Free Access power tailgate release and closure when the key fob is nearby. A redesigned key fob that is shaped like a convex irregular polygon is included.

Powertrains are improved, with the existing 3.5-liter V6 paired with a 10-speed transmission available for four trims; base, technology package, A-Spec, and advance package. While the all-wheel-drive (AWD) is optional on the base and technology trims, it is standard on A-Spec and advance trims. The Type-S trim model will get a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 and front brakes with four-piston Brembo calipers as standard. All-wheel-drive will also be standard for the Type-S. However there is no hybrid powertrain available unlike the previous generation.

In the front, a double wishbone suspension with forged aluminum lower control arms, damper forks, and steering knuckles makes its way into the MDX along with more rigid cast-aluminum shock towers, larger front brake rotors and wider alloy wheels. Plastic wheel well liners are replaced with fabric material and a repositioned air intake for easier access to both battery terminals. High-strength steel (HSS), press-hardened steel and aluminum make up 69.7% of vehicle body mass. The rear body is more rigid with suspension load paths passing into the C and D-pillars, allowing for towing capabilities. Standard towing capacity is while it can be increased to when the transmission cooler is added. The cooler kit is available as an accessory for the AWD models.

===Facelift===
The MDX facelift was revealed on April 9, 2024 for the 2025 model year. Changes include updated exterior styling, new exterior colors, new alloy wheel designs, the touchpad controller has been replaced in favour of additional storage space and a wireless charging pad, a new 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Google built-in and the addition of new safety features such as AcuraWatch 360 system. Powertrain options remain unchanged for the facelifted model.

<doc id="598153" wikidata="Q995960" url="?curid=598153" title="Agaonidae">
<text>The family Agaonidae is a group of pollinating fig wasps. They spend their larval stage inside the fruits of figs. The pollinating wasps (Agaoninae, Kradibiinae, and Tetrapusiinae) are the mutualistic partners of the fig trees. Extinct forms from the Eocene and Miocene are nearly identical to modern forms, suggesting that the niche has been stable over geologic time.

Females emerge from ripe figs and fly to another fig tree with developing syconia (which contain the flowers). They enter the syconium via the ostiole, pollinate the flowers, and lay their eggs in some of the ovules. The ovules containing eggs develop into galls that support the growth of the wasp larvae. Prior to the final ripening of the fig, wingless males emerge from the galls they developed in. The males enter the galls of their winged sibling females, mate with them and die within the fruit. The newly hatched females then make their way out of the fruit continuing this cycle. 

==Taxonomy==
The family has changed several times since its taxonomic appearance after the work of Francis Walker in 1846 described from the wasp genus &quot;Agaon&quot;. 
Previously the subfamilies Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, Sycoryctinae, Sycophaginae, and Agaoninae were the subdivisions of the family. Recent works building strong molecular phylogenies with an extended sampling size have changed the composition of Agaonidae. The paraphyletic groups have been excluded; Epichrysomallinae was raised to family status (Epichrysomallidae), whereas Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, Sycophaginae, and Sycoryctinae were transferred to Pteromalidae. New subfamilies have been instated (Kradibiinae and Tetrapusiinae).

==Ecology==
The relationship between fig trees and agaonid fig wasps is an obligate mutualism that has evolved over a period of about sixty million years.

==Morphological adaptations==
The pollinating female fig wasps are winged and in general dark, while the males are mostly wingless and whitish. This difference of color is probably due to a clear split in the gender role. Once they have mated, male and female fig wasps have different fates. In some fig species, such as &quot;Ficus subpisocarpa&quot; or &quot;Ficus tinctoria&quot;, the males have to chew a hole for the females to leave their natal fig. The winged female wasps can fly over long distances before finding another fig to oviposit in it, while the male dies after chewing a hole.
As the fig is closed by a tight ostiole, the female wasps have developed adaptations to enter. First, the mandibles of the female wasps have developed specialized mandibular appendages to help them crawl into the figs. These appendages are adapted to the host fig species, with for instance spiraled ostioles matched by spiral mandibular appendages.

<text>Port Kavkaz () is a small harbour on the Chushka Spit in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, on the eastern side of Kerch Strait. It is adjacent to the village of Chushka, which is now largely deserted due to toxic effects of the port.

The port is able to handle vessels up to in length, in breadth and with draft up to . It was the eastern terminal of the railroad and car Kerch Strait ferry line connecting Krasnodar Krai with Crimea (the western terminal of the ferry line is Port Krym). It is served by a railway line and the Port Kavkaz railway station. The southern zone of the port has been under renovation to increase the port&#x27;s throughput to .

==History==
In August 2014 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a government order to enlarge the area of the port with the aim to increase cargo transportation volumes with the use of large ships. The borders of the port were changed to add a deep-water area south of the port of Taman for large ships to anchor. Plans included an additional 15–18 anchor places for loading large ships. The additional area is with depths of .

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at the end of May 2024 Ukrainian missiles struck an oil depot at the port, which stored oil products bound for Crimea. Two railway train ferries were damaged in May.

In a July attack the railway train ferry was damaged.

On 22 August 2024, a rail ferry carrying wagons of fuel was struck by a Ukrainian missile in Port Kavkaz. One source suggested a Neptune missile hit the ferry. Simultaneously the Kerch Bridge was closed due to a &quot;missile threat&quot;.

<doc id="598165" wikidata="Q2916460" url="?curid=598165" title="Irish cream">
<text>Irish cream () is a cream liqueur based on Irish whiskey, cream and other flavourings. It typically has an alcohol by volume (ABV) level of 15 to 20% and is served on its own or in mixed drinks, most commonly mixed with coffee or in shots such as the B-52. Its largest markets are the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.
==Etymology==
Despite its name, it is not a traditional Irish product, as the first version of it, Baileys, was invented in 1973 by British businessman Tom Jago in London, in response to a marketing brief from Gilbeys of Ireland (a division of International Distillers &amp; Vintners). Nevertheless, within the European Union, Irish cream is a protected geographical indicator product that must be produced in Ireland.

== Brands ==
Top brands of Irish cream include Baileys, Kerrygold, Merrys, Carolans and Saint Brendan&#x27;s. The largest manufacturer is Diageo.

==Use==
Irish cream is served straight, on the rocks or in mixed drinks, often layered in a shot glass with Kahlúa and Grand Marnier to make a B-52 shot or mixed with coffee or hot chocolate. It is also a common addition to White Russians. Some use Irish cream to flavour desserts and other sweet treats.&lt;ref name=&quot;itv/john-and-lisa/fondant-and-irish-cream&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="598168" wikidata="Q1573974" url="?curid=598168" title="Hampster Dance">
<text>The Hampster Dance is one of the earliest Internet memes. Created in 1998 by Canadian art student Deidre LaCarte as a GeoCities page, the dance features rows of animated GIFs of hamsters and other rodents dancing in various ways to a sped-up sample from the song &quot;Whistle-Stop&quot;, written and performed by Roger Miller for the 1973 Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. In 2005, CNET named the Hampster Dance the number-one Web fad.

==Background==

Canadian martial arts instructor and Malaspina University-College student Deidre LaCarte (of Nanaimo, British Columbia) was in a competition with her best friend and sister to generate the most Web traffic when she created the Hampster Dance page with the free Geocities web service in August 1998. She named the site &quot;Hampton Hampster&#x27;s Hamster House&quot; in homage to her pet hamster, &quot;Hampton Hampster&quot;, who on the page declared his intent to become a &quot;Web star.&quot; LaCarte noted that the misspelling of &quot;hamster&quot; as &quot;hampster&quot; in both her pet&#x27;s name and the Hampster Dance page was intentional.

The Hampster Dance site originally consisted of a single page with just four unique animated GIFs of cartoon hamsters. These images were repeated in rows by the dozens and were paired with an infectious, continuously looping background tune. At the time the page was created, embedding background music in HTML pages was a fairly novel browser feature. The clip, a nine-second looped WAV file, was a sped-up sample of Roger Miller&#x27;s &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;, a song written for the opening credits of the 1973 Disney animated feature film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.

From its creation in August 1998 to March 1999, the Hampster Dance site only recorded about 800 total visits (roughly four per day). In February 1999, word of the website spread by e-mail and early blogs. By March, the site gathered approximately 60,000 views in four days. By December, LaCarte had created an online store selling themed items. Fans of the site created variations on the original theme, using images of other animals and of politicians such as Dan Quayle. In January 2000, the site was featured in a television commercial for Internet service provider EarthLink.

The original website was hosted on GeoCities, and LaCarte failed to register the &quot;hampsterdance.com&quot; domain. With the continued popularity of the original site, an unauthorized duplicate website was hosted on &quot;hampsterdance.com&quot;. LaCarte thus used the domains &quot;hamsterdance.com&quot;, &quot;hamsterdance2.com&quot;, and &quot;hampsterdance2.com&quot;. In early 2000, the domain was transferred to humor business Nutty Sites for undisclosed reasons. In late 2001, LaCarte sold the &quot;Hampster Dance&quot; rights to Abatis International, who managed to acquire the original domain. The site later expanded, revealing the names of all four characters (Hampton, Dixie, Hado, and Fuzzy) and offering themed versions for birthdays, graduation, holidays, etc. The original website is no longer functional, but other sites inspired by the original still exist.
==Music releases and Hampton and the Hampsters==
In April 1999, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the website, English electronic group the Cuban Boys promotionally released &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot;. In its original release, the track featured the sped-up sample of &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;. When the song was commercially released later that December, it was replaced with a soundalike sample. The song was marketed as &quot;the Hamster Dance song&quot;, and LaCarte accused the group of stealing her idea. The single peaked at number 4 on the Christmas 1999 UK singles chart.

In June 2000, LaCarte partnered with producers The Boomtang Boys for the release of a site-sponsored song, &quot;The Hampsterdance Song&quot;. Like the previous single by the Cuban Boys, the single contains a different sound-alike sample of &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;. Disney did not allow the use of the actual &quot;Whistle Stop&quot; clip, and liner notes for the single state: &quot;Includes elements of &#x27;Whistle Stop&#x27; by Roger Miller.&quot; A cartoon video was produced for the single that introduced a cartoon &quot;band&quot; of four hamsters which included Hampton alongside Fuzzy, Hado, and Dixie. Though the song was solely credited to &quot;Hampton the Hampster&quot;, the band was later dubbed &quot;Hampton and the Hampsters.&quot; The song reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart while peaking at number 32 on the &quot;RPM&quot; charts. In Australia, &quot;The Hampsterdance Song&quot; was released in 2001 and reached number five on the ARIA Singles Chart. The song proved to be very successful on Radio Disney, where it became the station&#x27;s all-time most played song and was later included on the compilation album &quot;Radio Disney Ultimate Jams&quot;. LaCarte&#x27;s online store was expanded and began offering T-shirts and CDs of the fictional group&#x27;s music. A Flash-animated series was planned by Nelvana, but never made it past the planning process.

Following the relative success of &quot;The Hampsterdance Song&quot; single, an entire album titled &quot;&quot; was released in October 2000. Some follow-up singles from this album were moderately successful in Australia, such as &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; (a cover of the John Denver song, reaching number 12) and &quot;Hampster Party&quot; (reaching number 44). In August 2001, the group released the single &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot; which was a number one hit on Radio Disney. The song was included on their follow-up album &quot;Happy Times Ten&quot; (2002). &quot;Hampsterdance: The Album&quot; was reissued twice with shorter track listings: first as &quot;The Hampster Dance Party&quot; (2002) followed by &quot;Hampsterdance Hits&quot; (2004). In 2008, the group released their final album, &quot;A Very Hampsterdance Christmas&quot;.

===Direct-to-video film===
In December 2004, Abatis International relaunched the Hampsterdance website and announced that a DVD would be released in Spring 2005. The date passed with no release, and the release date was later removed. On April 2, 2009, the website began selling a DVD of the direct-to-video animated film &quot;How the Hampsters Saved Winter&quot;. The film was produced by Abatis International LLC and animated by Unreal Productions, located in New Jersey. The DVD was purchasable until 2012 and sold 2000 copies. In 2022, the film was archived on the Lost Media Wiki and uploaded onto YouTube.

<doc id="598171" wikidata="Q344752" url="?curid=598171" title="Acura EL">
<text>The Acura EL is a subcompact executive car that was built at Honda&#x27;s Alliston, Ontario, plant, and also the first Acura built in Canada. It was also exclusively sold in Canada. The EL is a badge-engineered Honda Civic with a higher level of features. There is no Type-S trim offered on any Acura EL.

The Acura EL was a sales success. Representing 51% of Acura Canada&#x27;s annual new-vehicle sales in its first full year, the EL remained Acura&#x27;s top seller in Canada from 1997 to 2003. The Acura EL was replaced for the 2006 model year by the Acura CSX which, like the EL, was available only in Canada.


==First generation (1997–2000)==

Seeing that sales within Canada for the four-door Acura Integra were extremely low, Honda decided to replace it with the four-door-only Acura EL. The first generation of the EL was a somewhat altered version of the 1997–2000 Honda Civic with the differing front end, trunk, lights and various interior pieces. Produced by Honda Canada, the EL would also be rebadged and exported to Japan as the second-generation Honda Domani.

The EL has a moonroof, CD player, and a 1.6-litre SOHC VTEC engine produces at 6,600 rpm and at 5,500 rpm, making it similar to the American Civic EX sedan (which was not sold in Canada) and the Canadian Civic Si Coupe (which was equivalent to the American Civic EX Coupe). The EL has additional features not available on Civics such as amber-lit LED interior dash display, tachometer, power trunk (no keyhole on the trunklid), alarm, 15-inch (195/55/15) wheels, antenna in the rear window glass, chrome interior door handles, extra pocket underneath the centre console, paint-matched mirrors, side mouldings, and door handles, slightly stiffer suspension, 12-mm rear sway bar and 26-mm front sway bar, heated mirrors, and an amplifier. From 1999, all 5-speed models had a leather-wrapped shift knob, similar to the one in the Acura Integra GS-R.

===Model configurations===
In addition to the above: 
* Base: CD player, air conditioning 
* Sport: 15-inch alloy wheels, CD player, air conditioning. From 1999: folding heated mirrors, a sunroof, and an upgraded grill on the front end. 
* Premium: in addition to the Sport, leather seats, and decorative spoiler.
==Second generation (2001–2005)==

The EL was completely redesigned for the 2001 model year and was then based on the seventh-generation Civic. Besides the slightly more powerful and torquier VTEC-equipped 1.7 L 4-cylinder SOHC engine with 127 hp (95 kW), headlight and taillight designs and available leather interior trimmings set it apart from the Civic. Other differences include 15-inch multi-spoke alloys, heated power mirrors, cruise control, and rear disc brakes. The badging was changed to Acura 1.7EL and was dropped altogether for 2004.

The second generation was available in touring and premium trim levels, the latter adding leather seats, heated front seats and a power sunroof. Automatic climate control was added for the premium trim in 2003 and the touring trim in 2004. All second generation EL models came with ABS anti-lock braking, but in 2003 an electronic brakeforce distribution system was made standard. For 2003 and 2004, a special dealer-installed &#x27;aero package&#x27; was made available for both trims levels adding unique front and rear lips, side stills and a rear spoiler. In 2004, the EL underwent a slight exterior makeover with restyled headlamps, front bumper and grille, taillights, trunk lid, and rear bumper. The new look came with standard fog lights, a restyled steering wheel, new woodgrain trim patterns, and two additional tweeters powered by two amplifiers to complete the 6-speaker audio system.
==Discontinuation==
Despite being Acura Canada’s best-selling vehicle, Honda announced that it would discontinue the EL. In 2006, the CSX was confirmed to be a replacement for the EL. Like the EL, the CSX was sold only in Canada. The CSX was discontinued in 2011.

<doc id="598173" wikidata="Q3546966" url="?curid=598173" title="Hyacinth Bucket">
<text>Hyacinth Bucket (née Walton; sometimes known as &quot;The Bucket Woman&quot;) is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, portrayed by Patricia Routledge. Routledge won a British Comedy Award in 1991, and was nominated for two BAFTA awards in 1992 and 1993 for her portrayal.

==Character synopsis==
Hyacinth is a social-climbing snob who constantly aims to impress people, particularly of the upper and upper-middle classes, and to give the impression that she is of high social standing, despite her modest status. This is epitomised in her insistence on pronouncing her surname as &quot;Bouquet&quot;. She has an &quot;acquired cultured accent which buckles under stress&quot;.

The character&#x27;s creator, Roy Clarke, has called her the &quot;least invented of all the characters I&#x27;ve found in my head&quot;: 

So I knew my Hyacinths and I knew I had to write my own. They fascinated me. They were hilarious in their pretensions, so marvellously unaware of the real impressions they were making, and yet somehow so up front in their crusade to be superior that it was brave.
Hyacinth is married to Richard Bucket, and they live at 22 Blossom Avenue, in a bungalow which Hyacinth refers to as &quot;The Residence&quot; when sending letters. In an attempt to make callers think she is wealthy enough to employ domestic staff, she repeatedly answers the telephone with, &quot;The Bouquet residence; the lady of the house speaking.&quot; This false accent had previously been used for Edie Pegden in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, another series written by Clarke.

As revealed in the 2016 prequel, &quot;Young Hyacinth&quot;, Hyacinth is the eldest of the four floral-named Walton sisters: in birth order, Hyacinth, Daisy, Violet, and Rose.

Hyacinth&#x27;s social class has been the subject of much discussion. Renée Dickason suggests that &quot;Hyacinth Bucket is lower-middle class and thus close in status to the viewing audience&quot;, while Paul Roscoe argues that:

With each episode, Hyacinth struggles to transcend the trappings of her lower-class status and relations, only to be brought low and her pretensions to middle-class status ridiculed. For the show&#x27;s middle- and upper-middle-class audience, the comedic pivot is the many ways and multiple occasions that Hyacinth is slapped down for failing to recognize her position in the status hierarchy.
Dickason concludes that Hyacinth is a &quot;relatively rare example of a wholly unsympathetic weak Britcom character that the audience can only delight in laughing at and not with&quot;.

<doc id="598183" wikidata="Q7679819" url="?curid=598183" title="Talking Heads (British TV series)">
<text>Talking Heads is a 1988 TV series of dramatic monologues written for BBC television by British playwright Alan Bennett. The first series was broadcast on BBC1 in 1988, and adapted for radio on BBC Radio 4 in 1991. A second series was broadcast on BBC Two in 1998. They have since been included on the A-level and GCSE English Literature syllabus. Some episodes aired on PBS in the United States as part of its &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; programme.

In 2020, the BBC remade 10 of the existing episodes, with two brand new stories.

==Summary==
There are two series of &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, six monologues in each, along with an earlier (1982) play, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;, which, while not released alongside &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, generally fits into the canon. Although the plays deal with a variety of subjects, there are certain recurring themes, such as death, illness, guilt and isolation. All of the characters are childless with the notable exception of Muriel in &quot;Soldiering On&quot;; Violet in &quot;Waiting for the Telegram&quot; is told she has a son, but she does not remember him.

Most of the plays give some hint as to where they are set, mostly in Leeds, although not (as Bennett stresses) the &quot;real&quot; Leeds, but rather one that exists in his head. For example, Matthias Robinson, in which Miss Fozzard works, closed in the 1970s.

==Cast and crew==
Each episode consists of an individual monologue and therefore in most episodes only one character appears. The only exception is when Steven Beard features as a policeman in &quot;A Cream Cracker under the Settee&quot;. Julie Walters, Patricia Routledge and Thora Hird appear as different characters in both series.

The show was produced by Innes Lloyd and Ralph Wilton (series 1) and Mark Shivas (series 2), while Alan Bennett, Stuart Burge, Giles Foster, Tristram Powell, Gavin Millar, Patrick Garland, Stuart Garland and Udayan Prasad directed individual episodes. The music was written by George Fenton.

==Episodes==
Actors are named for the earlier of the BBC television versions.

===Stand-alone play===
&quot;&quot; – (19 November 1982)
* Patricia Routledge plays Miss Schofield

:Peggy Schofield, clerical worker and self-described linchpin of her office, finds that when her strict regime is disrupted, her world crumbles around her. Her health deteriorates and she is rapidly spirited away to hospital, where she reconstructs her office routine, appropriating doctors, other hospital staff and patients as replacements for her co-workers. It is soon revealed, through hints, that she has lost her job and her co-workers haven&#x27;t bothered to visit, that she is not as popular and significant as she assumed. She grows constantly sicker and weaker, and it&#x27;s hinted that though everyone around her is aware she&#x27;s slowly dying, no one has ever told her.

===Series 1===
&quot;Talking Heads 1 – (19 April to 24 May 1988)&quot;

* Alan Bennett plays Graham Whittaker in &quot;
:Mild, middle-aged Graham Whittaker (who we learn is a repressed homosexual with a history of mild mental health problems) finds life becoming complicated as his mother, with whom he still lives, reunites with an old flame named Frank Turnbull. Graham becomes increasingly jealous when Mr Turnbull takes an ever-growing hold on Mam, especially when Frank proposes marriage while simultaneously suggesting Graham move out of the house to a hostel. But Mr Turnbull is hiding a secret, and when Graham finds out he triumphantly confronts his mother with the information, restoring the status quo and his comfortable life, but destroying her hopes of happiness in the process.

* Patricia Routledge plays Irene Ruddock in &quot;
:Irene Ruddock is a working class single woman living near Bradford who is not afraid to speak, or rather write, her mind: she writes letters to her MP, the police, the chemist – everyone she can, to remedy the social ills she sees around her. After one too many accusations of misconduct from Irene&#x27;s pen, she is sent to prison – where, for the first time in her life, she feels free and happy.

* Maggie Smith plays Susan in &quot;
:Susan, an alcoholic, nervous vicar&#x27;s wife who has to travel into Leeds to go to the off-licence because of her debts with the local shop keeper, distracts herself from her ambitious, and, as she sees him, vainly insensitive husband and his doting parishioners by conducting an affair with a nearby grocer, Ramesh Ramesh the third, discovering something about herself and God in the process. She does not feel cheated when Ramesh Ramesh moves on to marry. (Anna Massey took the role in the BBC Audio Tape version.)

* Stephanie Cole plays Muriel Carpenter in &quot;
:Muriel is a strong woman, and always has been – a pillar of the community, a regular charity worker, and a volunteer for Meals on Wheels; and looking after her mentally ill daughter, Margaret, has fortified her resolve. So, after the death of her husband Ralph, Muriel is well-prepared to cope with the crisis. However, given her son Giles&#x27; ineptitude (or dishonesty) with money, and the vile secret behind Margaret&#x27;s illness, Muriel finds that she needs to adapt in order to &#x27;soldier on&#x27;.

* Julie Walters plays Lesley in &quot;
:Lesley is an aspiring actress, who, after a series of unpromising extra roles on television programmes such as &quot;Crossroads&quot;, finds what she believes to be her big break as the adventurous Travis in a new film for the West German market. It is not clear to what extent Lesley understands that she is appearing in a soft pornographic film.

* Thora Hird plays Doris in &quot;&quot;
:Doris, aged seventy-five, is a tidy woman — and when she suffers a fall after trying to clear up after her considerably less thorough home help, Zulema, it becomes apparent that her constant nagging may have been responsible for her husband&#x27;s early death. Alone and injured, she wonders whether the only place left for her in society is a care home which she distrusts. Resisting this with all her being, she decides she&#x27;d rather die on her own in considerable pain than live in a care home &#x27;smelling of pee&#x27;.

===Series 2===
&quot;Talking Heads 2 – (6 October to 11 November 1998)&quot;

* Patricia Routledge plays Miss Fozzard in &quot;
:Miss Fozzard is a lonely, middle-aged department-store clerk in Soft Furnishings whose free time is mostly spent caring for her brother after he suffers a stroke. Her one joy is visiting her chiropodist, but, when he retires, she finds her life consumed with a burgeoning relationship with his replacement, Mr Dunderdale, who is a decidedly kinky fellow with an all-consuming foot fetish. While Miss Fozzard would be the last to admit it, she ventures into benign prostitution as she allows her new chiropodist to pay her to model a variety of footwear whilst also indulging in other activities. It is this that gives her the satisfaction her life was missing, as she begins to stop caring what other people think.

* Eileen Atkins plays Celia in &quot;
:Celia is a covetous antiques dealer who brazenly aids elderly neighbours for the sole purpose of being in a good position to buy their treasures on the cheap when they die. She&#x27;s particularly put out when one elderly woman whom she&#x27;s visited, living in a house chock full of antiques, dies and leaves everything to a distant Canadian relative. Celia is somewhat soothed when the Canadian gives her a small box of the woman&#x27;s things, which includes a curious drawing of a finger. Celia is particularly pleased she makes a hundred pounds selling the frame around the picture, but then later learns to her horror that the drawing is a lost Michelangelo masterpiece worth millions, which the buyer says on national television he bought in a &quot;junk shop&quot;. The figure is a study of the central image of the hand of God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

* David Haig plays Wilfred Paterson in &quot;
:Wilfred is, we discover over time, a reformed paedophile living under a false identity and working as a much-praised maintenance man in a public park. However, as a superior begins to pressure him for bureaucratic historical information to include in his personnel file, the pressure causes Wilfred to resume his old ways, with horrifying results. Incarcerated, he contemplates his condition, remarking &#x27;It&#x27;s the one part of my life that feels right... and that&#x27;s the bit that&#x27;s wrong.&#x27;

* Julie Walters plays Marjory in &quot;
:Clean freak Marjory gradually comes to realise that her husband, Stuart, who works in a slaughterhouse, is using his employment to cover the fact he&#x27;s a particularly dangerous criminal. He regularly goes out with his Alsatian, Tina (whom Marjory has barred from entering the house), and returns late at night. This usually culminates in brutal sexual advances which Marjory finds distasteful but feels powerless to reject. She is so alienated from the outside world that she subsumes all emotion in her domestic routine – her control of which becomes gradually more threatened as her husband becomes the subject of both police and media attention. When he is arrested and tried for a series of murders, Marjory struggles to maintain a low profile, and to continue with her routine as normal, but in the process discovers a damning piece of evidence which links her husband to the killings. However, she receives a telephone call announcing he has been acquitted (due to lack of evidence), before she is able to decide upon a course of action. When he returns home, Marjory now has to deal with the horrific realisation she&#x27;ll be sharing her home with a serial murderer. As an ultimate sign of her lapsed control, Tina finally gains entry into the house. Marjory contemplates making the evidence known.

* Penelope Wilton plays Rosemary Horrocks in &quot;
:Rosemary Horrocks is a lonely woman whose husband is intent on moving them both to Marbella. Unknown to him, Rosemary does not wish to go. She takes it upon herself to tend to a female neighbour&#x27;s garden after the latter is arrested for murdering her abusive husband. The two women become close friends in a tender relationship which has the potential to bring both of them real happiness. As the case of her newfound friend is investigated, a darker and more perverted side of Rosemary&#x27;s own husband is revealed. Sadly, Rosemary&#x27;s neighbour dies of cancer before the potential of their friendship can be fully realised, and Rosemary must passively continue with the non-marriage she has with her highly repressed, golf-playing husband.

* Thora Hird plays Violet in &quot;
:Violet is a confused, elderly woman in a nursing home who has been told by the excited staff she will soon be receiving a congratulatory telegram from the Queen in honour of her one hundredth birthday. This, however, perplexes Violet as she wanders far back in her memory to an age where telegrams brought news of death on a battlefield. Violet ruminates about a long-lost love to her only real friend, a gay male nurse at the home named Francis, who ultimately dies of AIDS.

===2020 Series===
&quot;Talking Heads 3 – (23 June to 9 July 2020)&quot;

Filmed during the lockdown for COVID-19, in 2020, the BBC released a new series of &quot;Talking Heads&quot; including remakes of 10 of the original monologues and two new episodes written by Bennett in 2019.

* Sarah Lancashire plays Gwen Fedder in &quot;
:Michael is only 15, but you wouldn&#x27;t know. Gwen thought there would be something that gave you immunity, that you couldn&#x27;t fall for your own child.

* Monica Dolan plays Lorna in &quot;
:Lorna visits the spot where Clifford&#x27;s motorbike crashed, hoping for some closure. But one day she finds someone else has left some flowers on the shrine.

Ten of the original monologues were performed with new actors.

* Imelda Staunton plays Irene Ruddock in &quot;A Lady of Letters&quot;
* Harriet Walter plays Muriel Carpenter in &quot;Soldiering On&quot;
* Jodie Comer plays Lesley in &quot;Her Big Chance&quot;
* Lucian Msamati plays Wilfred Paterson in &quot;Playing Sandwiches&quot;
* Martin Freeman plays Graham Whittaker in &quot;A Chip in the Sugar&quot;
* Rochenda Sandall plays Marjory in &quot;The Outside Dog&quot;
* Lesley Manville plays Susan in &quot;Bed Among the Lentils&quot;
* Tamsin Greig plays Rosemary Horrocks in &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot;
* Kristin Scott Thomas plays Celia in &quot;The Hand of God&quot;
* Maxine Peake plays Miss Fozzard in &quot;Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet&quot;

The two Thora Hird monologues (&quot;A Cream Cracker under the Settee&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Telegram&quot;) were not included, primarily due to the fact the directors were unable to use actors over the age of 70.

==Nominations and awards==

===Series 1 (1988)===
BAFTA TV Awards

RTS Awards

===Series 2 (1998)===
BAFTA TV Awards
Peabody Awards

RTS Awards
==Radio broadcasts==
The nature of the monologues is that, despite being conceived for television, they can be broadcast unaltered in sound only. As such, they were re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between February and March 1991, the only difference being the inclusion of an introductory instalment with Bennett discussing their development. The second series did not appear on radio but received a CD release. &quot;Bed Among the Lentils&quot; was subsequently remade for BBC Radio 7 in 2008 with Anna Massey as Susan.

==Releases==
The radio shows were released as two CDs in 1999. In 2007, the monologues were published as a book titled &quot;Talking Heads&quot;. There have also been a number of DVD and video releases, the most recent in 2005 entitled &quot;The Complete Talking Heads&quot;. This release also features Bennett&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Telling Tales&quot; monologues from 2000.

==Stage adaptations==
A West End theatre production, also entitled &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, opened at the Comedy Theatre in January 1992 for a 10-week season, starring Patricia Routledge and Alan Bennett, who also directed, plus piano interludes by Jeremy Sams.

In 2002, seven of the pieces were performed at the Tiffany Theater in Los Angeles for a highly praised engagement. In 2003, the Los Angeles production was staged Off-Broadway, at the Minetta Lane Theatre with a few changes in casting and creative personnel, and replacement of one of its seven monologues. This version was recognised with Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle award nominations, and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress (Lynn Redgrave), The Obie Award for Outstanding Performance, (Kathleen Chalfant, Daniel Davis, Christine Ebersole, Valerie Mahaffey, Redgrave, Brenda Wehle), and The Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Foreign Play (Alan Bennett).

London&#x27;s Bridge Theatre staged eight monologues from the 2020 television series in the months following their broadcast. Actors Lucian Msamati, Imelda Staunton, Tamsin Greig, Maxine Peake, Rochenda Sandall, Kristin Scott Thomas, Monica Dolan and Lesley Manville reprised their roles in four double bills. Martin Freeman, Jodie Comer, Harriet Walter and Sarah Lancashire appeared in the TV series, but not in the stage productions.

<doc id="598190" wikidata="Q5418992" url="?curid=598190" title="Ewen McQueen">
<text>Ewen McQueen is a New Zealand writer and social commentator who blogs at RenewNZ. From 2008 to 2018 he was involved in the National Party in the Epsom electorate. Prior to that was the leader of Christian Heritage NZ. McQueen has had opinion pieces published in newspapers around New Zealand and on the Stuff website. These include articles on family values issues, the Treaty of Waitangi, and New Zealand&#x27;s Christian history.

==Early years==
McQueen was born in Palmerston North in 1965, although spent most of his youth in the North Shore (part of the greater Auckland area). He attended Takapuna Grammar School where he played for the first XV and was head prefect in 1983. McQueen graduated from the University of Auckland in 1990. His primary field of study at university was economics, in which he gained a Master&#x27;s degree with honours in 1990. As part of his post graduate degree he completed a thesis entitled &quot;A Christian Perspective on Neo-Classical Economics.&quot;

After graduating McQueen worked in the health sector in analyst, planning and management roles. His last role was as Business Manager for the Facilities &amp; Development Group within the Auckland DHB.

==Politics==
Ewen McQueen was a member of the New Zealand National Party from 2007 until his resignation in June 2018 because according to McQueen &quot;family values... leadership is not going to come via the National Party.&quot; McQueen was a member of the National party&#x27;s 2010/11 candidate college and sought selection as the National candidate in the North Shore electorate for the 2011 general election, losing to Maggie Barry. He also unsuccessfully sought selection for the Epsom seat.

Prior to joining the National Party McQueen joined the Christian Heritage Party in 1992, and stood as a Christian Heritage candidate on five occasions. Four of his campaigns were in the Auckland electorates of Eden, Epsom and Mt Roskill, but his most successful election campaign was in the Taranaki-King Country by-election in 1998. In this by-election he polled ahead of both the NZ First and Green candidates. He also served as his party&#x27;s Deputy Leader and Finance Spokesperson until 1999.

McQueen narrowly missed election to Parliament in the 1996 general election. He was ranked 4th on the Christian Coalition party list. The Coalition fell just under the MMP threshold.

In August 2003, McQueen was elected as the new leader of Christian Heritage NZ, and replaced the retiring Graham Capill. In October 2006, McQueen announced the closure of Christian Heritage NZ, blaming its demise on Graham Capill&#x27;s criminal convictions, although he hoped to be involved with a new conservative Christian political party . That party did not eventuate and McQueen subsequently joined the National Party.

==Social commentary==
McQueen has had a number of articles published on economics and social values issues in newspapers across New Zealand including &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, &quot;The Christchurch Press&quot; and &quot;The Taranaki Daily News&quot; and &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;. He has a blog site, &#x27;renewnz&#x27;. McQueen authored a book entitled &quot;One Sun in the Sky&quot;, which argues 19th century Maori did not expect co-governance to result from the Treaty of Waitangi, and Te Tiriti validly ceded sovereignty to the Crown.

<text>&quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; (meaning &quot;the experts versus the intellectual elite&quot;), also known as &quot;C vs. I&quot;, is a song by English electronic music group the Cuban Boys. The song consists almost in its entirety of an unofficial soundalike sampled loop from &quot;Whistle Stop&quot; by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, played at high speed in a manner similar to the classic &quot;Chipmunks&quot; records. The original sample, also sped up, was first featured on the Internet as part of &quot;The Hampster Dance&quot; song on the website of the same name.

==Background==
The song was first aired on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show on 7 April 1999, and quickly became one of the most requested songs on his show. After being included on a free sampler CD on the industry magazine &quot;The Tip Sheet&quot;, the song caught the attention of numerous large record labels including EMI, Parlophone and RCA, thanks mostly to the efforts of Jonathan King. The band eventually signed for EMI. They were given £25,000 to record a video for the song which ended up featuring a giant fibreglass melon covered in trifle and a live-action hamster singing along.

The song&#x27;s closing lines are of an announcer of a children&#x27;s radio show:
And this is your Uncle Dan saying good night.
Good night, little kids, good night.
We&#x27;re off? Good, well that oughta hold the little bastards.&quot;
This last line, usually omitted on radio play, is itself a sample from Kermit Schafer&#x27;s 1950s &quot;recreation&quot; of a supposed on-air blooper by 1920s children&#x27;s radio presenter, &quot;Uncle Don&quot;. In fact, this faux pas is an urban legend. The sample caused many complaints to the band&#x27;s label EMI, enough for a Parental Advisory sticker to be included on the single by the end of the single&#x27;s first week of release, presumably by those assuming the song to be aimed at children. Additionally, the sample was left unedited when the song was played by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 in November, the broadcast of the song which eventually greenlit the single&#x27;s release by EMI, the sample was again unedited, causing much controversy.

The song itself is, like many recordings by the band, dotted with other humorous quotes from old movies, TV and radio programmes, including the 1965 Michael Winner movie &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot;, and at least one from the 1950s dramatization of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t be too happy. After some of months of this you&#x27;ll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef&quot;. The &quot;B-side&quot; tracks on the single exhibit similar traits, with e.g. Fluorescent Dream Beams featuring several samples from 1974&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, alongside an original vocal. Somewhat ironically, whilst the movie quotes are original, the core sample had to be re-recorded as a close but imperfect soundalike owing to copyright clearance issues - a problem that also plagued several other Cuban Boys singles and many tracks on the &quot;Eastwood&quot; album (e.g. &quot;Kenny&quot;, &quot;I Like Everybody&quot;), though it is unclear whether the holders refused permission (heavily suggested in the case of &quot;Inertia Kicks&quot;) or EMI simply declined to pay the licensing fees. It is known that in the case of later single &quot;The Hampsterdance Song&quot;, which was recorded by the group The Boomtang Boys under the name Hampton the Hampster, Disney did not want the sample to be used. That single also ultimately used a soundalike.

==Release==
Unlike the later single &quot;The Hampsterdance Song&quot;, &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; was released without the involvement of the owner of the original website, Deidre LaCarte. LaCarte accused the Cuban Boys of stealing in an article in the Mail on Sunday Originally scheduled for release as a single in November 1999, the release date was threatened to be pushed back to some time in January 2000 until the song was played on Jo Whiley&#x27;s afternoon radio show. It received the same amount of attention as when it had been played on Peel&#x27;s show. The decision was made to move the release to 13 December to put it in line for the Christmas number-one slot. It managed to get to number four on the Christmas chart week, being beaten by Westlife&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;. The song did, however, top John Peel&#x27;s Festive Fifty for that year. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 19 on the week of Christmas. In March 2000, it made a brief appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart, peaking at number 27.

==Reception==
The song garnered extreme reactions. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray said the song was &quot;eloquent in its sheer vacuity&quot; during a highbrow debate on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, and Cliff Richard, whose song &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;, which had been number 1 in the three weeks before the chart debut of &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; and was released to very negative reviews, said the song was &quot;awful&quot; during an appearance on &quot;Newsround&quot;.

The band&#x27;s performance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; of the song, reportedly unaired, saw the band dressed in lab coats and covered in cobwebs. Because of the relative obscurity of the Cuban Boys both before and after the single, they are generally considered to be a one-hit wonder. The people behind the Cuban Boys went on to score further one-hit wonder successes with a remake of &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; with Glen Campbell, a novelty kids band called the Barndance Boys, and the US club hit &quot;I Am Gothic&quot; under the name Spray.

<doc id="598223" wikidata="Q181331" url="?curid=598223" title="Post-it note">
<text>A Post-it note (or sticky note) is a small piece of paper with a re-adherable strip of glue on its back, made for temporarily attaching notes to documents and other surfaces. A low-tack pressure-sensitive adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached, removed and even re-posted elsewhere without leaving residue. The Post-it&#x27;s signature adhesive was discovered accidentally by a scientist at 3M. Originally small yellow squares, Post-it Notes and related products are available in various colors, shapes, sizes and adhesive strengths. As of 2024, there are at least 28 documented colors of Post-it notes. 3M&#x27;s Post-it has won several awards for its design and innovation.

Post-its are versatile and can be used in various settings for various purposes. They are commonly used in classrooms and workplaces but can also be found in art, media, and social media. Post-its have also been used as tools for public engagement and persuasion.

Although 3M&#x27;s patent expired in 1997, &quot;Post-it&quot; and the original notes&#x27; distinctive yellow color remain registered company trademarks, with terms such as &quot;repositionable notes&quot; used for similar offerings manufactured by competitors. While use of the trademark &#x27;Post-it&#x27; in a representative sense refers to any sticky note, no legal authority has ever considered it a generic trademark.

==History==
In 1968, Spencer Silver, a scientist at 3M in the United States, attempted to develop a super-strong adhesive. Instead, he accidentally created a &quot;low-tack&quot;, reusable, pressure-sensitive adhesive for the aerospace industry. For five years, Silver promoted his &quot;solution without a problem&quot; within 3M both informally and through seminars, but failed to gain adherents. In 1974, a colleague who had attended one of his seminars, Art Fry, came up with the idea of using the adhesive to anchor his bookmark in his hymn book. Fry then utilized 3M&#x27;s sanctioned &quot;permitted bootlegging&quot; policy, which allows employees to spend some of their work time on projects of their own choosing, to develop the idea. The original notes&#x27; canary yellow color was chosen by chance, from the color of the scrap paper available at the lab next door to the Post-it team. Fry provided 3M employees with a prototype of the product, and individuals started exchanging messages, demonstrating the product&#x27;s communicative effectiveness.

3M test marketed the product as a &quot;Press &#x27;n Peel&quot; in stores in four cities in 1977, but results were disappointing. A year later, 3M launched a massive marketing campaign known as the Boise Blitz. This campaign involved renaming the product to &quot;Post-it Note&quot; and giving out free samples to offices in Boise, Idaho. This time, results were promising as more than 90 percent of those who received free samples indicated they would buy the product. Post-its were launched across the United States in 1980. The following year, they were launched in Canada and Europe.

Post-it Flags were introduced as a new way to organize with color coding, filing and indexing.

In 1995, Post-it Easel Pads were introduced. The following year, Post-it Easel Pads for kids were introduced.

In 2003, the company introduced Post-it Brand Super Sticky Notes, with a stronger glue that adheres better to vertical and non-smooth surfaces.

In 2014, 3M released Post-it Super Sticky Dry Erase Surface, an instant dry erase surface that is stain-free and customizable to quickly fit on walls, cabinets, desks and more.

In 2018, 3M launched Post-it Extreme Notes, which are more durable and water-resistant and which stick to wood and other materials in industrial environments.

In 2019, the Post-it App was relaunched.

In 2020, 3M released the Post-it Flex Write Surface – a whiteboard surface that can be written on with dry erase and permanent markers without leaving stains behind when cleaned with water and soap. The company also released Post-it Foil Tabs, which were a revamp of the Post-it Tab with the purpose of satisfying the rise of personalization and bullet journaling trends of customers.

In 2021, 3M revealed a new logo and launched Noted by Post-it Brand – a collection of paper goods and desktop applications.

=== Awards and honors ===
The Post-it Note team received the internal 3M Golden Step Award in both 1981 and 1982 in recognition of their creation of a lucrative product that resulted in substantial new sales. Additionally, in 1981, they were honored with 3M&#x27;s Outstanding New Product Award.

In 2010, the creators of the Post-it note joined the National Inventors Hall of Fame as a result of the widespread success of the Post-it note.

In 2019, the Post-it app was awarded &#x27;Best of&#x27; App of 2019 by Google Play.

In 2021, the Post-it app won the Google Material Design Award within the motion category which awards apps that utilize unique design systems.

Silver and Fry both concluded their careers at 3M after achieving the highest accolades for their research and receiving numerous international engineering awards.

===Competing claims===
Alan Amron claimed to have been the actual inventor in 1973 who disclosed the Post-it note technology to 3M in 1974. His 1997 suit against 3M resulted in a confidential settlement. As part of the settlement, Amron agreed not to make future claims against the company unless the settlement agreement should be breached. However, in 2016, he launched a further suit against 3M, asserting that 3M was wrongly claiming to be the inventor, and seeking $400 million in damages. At a preliminary hearing, a federal judge ordered the parties to undergo mediation. The suit was subsequently dismissed, upholding the previous 1998 settlement.

In 1997, 3M sued Microsoft for trademark infringement for creating an electronic Post-it in Microsoft&#x27;s Office 97 and using the term “Post-it” in a help file.

== Types ==
Post-it Notes come in a variety of colors, collections, sizes, and rulings. The original Post-it note color is Canary Yellow, the color of the notes when they were initially invented, and it remains one of the most popular colorways to this day. All the notes are recyclable, but 3M has also introduced Greener Post-It Notes, which feature a 67% plant-based adhesive and recycled paper that uses no new trees.

== Uses ==

=== Workspaces and the classroom ===

Post-it notes can be used in design teams to offer up personal ideas, assist in group activities like brainstorming, and support design thinking and design outcomes.

They offer a wide variety of advantages in a classroom—for instance, they are cost efficient, don&#x27;t take time to set up, and are simple enough to be used by almost any age group. They have uses in concept mapping, labeling models, and more. They can also be used when explaining and teaching about broader terms like genetics.

They are used in the workplace both to convey information and to offer praise or words of encouragement. They can help boost communication between coworkers and can help communications between departments. They can also serve to praise people or tell them to keep up the good work.

They can be used to annotate textbooks in place of standard highlighting and sideline note-taking methods, allowing the pages to remain free of markings. Additionally, Post-it notes can be used to visually guide students to important points in the textbook, helping them find information faster.

They are convenient for team exercises involving graphic organizers, such as a fishbone diagram. Students can easily collaborate on an organizer by each contributing one idea or clause on a Post-it.

=== Media ===
Post-its have appeared in a variety of movies and TV shows and are a widely used prop across different media channels. In &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, the Post-it became an iconic symbol of commitment after Meredith and Derek used a blue Post-it to declare their wedding vows, a significant pop-culture moment. In season six of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, the Post-it was used to facilitate a breakup.

Post-it notes have appeared in episodes of various TV shows, including &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Post-its have also appeared in films, including &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, and &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;.

=== Social media ===
On Instagram, the hashtag “#postitnotes” contains over 242,000 posts. The posts under this hashtag feature post-its as art mediums, bookmarks, flipbooks, and more.

Due to its collaborative use in the workplace, Post-its are commonly seen in LinkedIn posts. One LinkedIn member posted about mapping the customer journey through Post-its with tips on involving different team members and organizational strategy.

=== Persuasion ===
As one of the top-selling consumer items on the market, Post-it notes may have a positive effect on how users take in the information presented on them. This is backed up by research that aimed to see just how helpful these small strips of paper can be to those who utilize them.

=== Art ===
&quot;The Yellow Stickee Diary of a Mad Secretary&quot;, by Rosa Maria Arenas, is the mini graphic journal of an office worker/artist, exhibited July 7 through August 25, 2013, at the Michigan Institute of Contemporary Art (MICA) Gallery in Lansing, Michigan. The 41 drawings displayed are a tiny percentage of the more than 2000 original drawings that constitute the Yellow Stickee Diary Project which Arenas created while working temp jobs from 1994 to 2005. Printed with archival inks on archival paper, the reproductions include &quot;stickee sized&quot; (3″ × 5″) framed prints and enlargements of the original drawings (which were all done on Post-it notes).

In 2012, Turkish artist Ardan Özmenoğlu was selected to have a solo exhibition at Bertrand Delacroix Gallery in the art district of Chelsea, Manhattan. The exhibition, titled &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Out of many, one&quot;), opened November 15, 2012 and featured large scale works on Post-it notes.

In 2004, Paola Antonelli, a curator of architecture and design, included Post-it notes in a show entitled &quot;Humble Masterpieces&quot;.

Rebecca Murtaugh, a California artist, who uses Post-it notes in her artwork, in 2001 created an installation by covering her whole bedroom with $1000 worth of the notes, using the ordinary yellow for objects she saw as having less value and neon colors for more important objects, such as the bed.

In 2000, the 20th anniversary of Post-it notes was celebrated by having artists create artworks on the notes. One such work, by the artist R. B. Kitaj, sold for £640 in an auction, making it the most valuable Post-it note on record.

The Lennon Wall, a message board created during the 2014 Hong Kong protests from a stretch of curved staircase in the Central Government Complex, is covered in multi-colored Post-it notes with handwritten messages from supporters.

In 2011, at the Munich, Germany Apple store, a group of Apple fans paid tribute to Steve Jobs by constructing a portrait of him out of 4001 Post-it notes. The use of Post-its resembled pixel art as each Post-it acted as a single pixel.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, artist Cauleen Smith created a video work featuring sticky notes called “Covid Manifesto.” Smith used Instagram as a platform to engage with the social injustice posed by the pandemic. Covid Manifesto is part of an online exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art, which premiered on September 3, 2021.

=== Public engagement ===
In 2016, the day after the US presidential election, artist Matthew &quot;Levee&quot; Chavez started a collaborative art project called “Subway Therapy.” Levee set up tables and chairs in Union Square Station and invited commuters to express their thoughts and feelings on Post-it notes. Most Post-it notes conveyed people&#x27;s hopes and fears in response to the election. The public contributed over 50,000 Post-it notes to the subway walls until the project was taken down on December 16, 2016. The New York Historical Society preserved several thousand of the Post-it notes.

Sidewalks Labs, a Google-owned company that focuses on urban innovation, opened a public workspace in Quayside, Toronto that supports public engagement in the city-planning process. Plans are presented here and the public can freely share their ideas, opinions, and feedback on potential projects, often in the form of Post-it note annotations.

Post-it notes have also been used in museums to allow for more public interactivity and participation. In 2016, at the Minnesota History Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, the public wrote their reflections on the life of Prince on Post-it notes and posted them near the exhibit. Some Post-it notes were archived by the museum to preserve the public sentiment expressed at the time.

==Software implementations==
Virtual Post-it notes have been created for computers in the form of desktop notes. These include 3M&#x27;s own Post-it Brand Software Notes, Stickies in macOS, or Sticky Notes in Windows.

<doc id="598231" wikidata="Q753746" url="?curid=598231" title="Alexandrine parakeet">
<text>The Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria), also known as the Alexandrine parrot, is a medium-sized parrot in the genus Psittacula of the family Psittaculidae, native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. It is named after Alexander the Great, who transported numerous birds from Punjab to various European and Mediterranean countries and regions, where they were prized by the royalty, nobility and warlords.

The Alexandrine parakeet has established feral populations in Turkey,
Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Pakistan, where it lives alongside feral populations of its close relative, the rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;Psittacula krameri&quot;).

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Alexandrine parakeet was first described by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson as &quot;Psittaca Ginginiana&quot; or &quot;La Perruche de Gingi&quot; (The Gingi&#x27;s Parakeet) in 1760; after the town of Gingee in southeastern India, which was a French outpost then. The birds may, however, merely have been held in captivity there.
Carl Linnaeus redescribed the Alexandrine parakeet in 1766 as &quot;Psittacus eupatria&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Psittacula&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;parrot&quot;, and the specific name &quot;eupatria&quot; () is derived from the ancient Greek meaning &quot;well&quot; and meaning &quot;descent&quot;.

In 2019, a genetic study revived the genus &quot;Palaeornis&quot;, formerly viewed as a synonym of the current genus &quot;Psittacula&quot;. Some organisations – including the IUCN – have accepted the new taxonomy.
If this were to be taken into account, this could mean that the Alexandrine parakeet is the only living member of the now-revived genus.

==Phylogeny==
Genetic analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of &quot;Psittacula&quot; parakeets has shown that the Alexandrine parakeet diverged from the lineage that gave rise to the rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;Psittacula krameri&quot;) and the Mauritius parakeet (&quot;Psittacula eques&quot;) about 5 million years ago.

==Description==
The Alexandrine parakeet is one of the largest parakeets, measuring from the top of the head to the tip of the tail and weighing . The tail measures .
It is predominantly green with a light blue-grey sheen on the cheeks and nape (back of the neck), yellow-green abdomen, red patch on the shoulders and massive red beak with yellow tips. The upper-side of the tail passes from green at the top to blue further down, and is yellow at the tip. The underside of the tail is yellow.

Adults are sexually dimorphic. Adult males have a black stripe across their lower cheeks and a pink band on their nape. Adult females lack both a black cheek stripe and a pink nape band. The young are similar in appearance to adult females but have shorter tails.
==Subspecies==
Five subspecies of the Alexandrine parakeet are currently recognized

==Ecology and behaviour==

The Alexandrine parakeet lives in forests, woodlands, agricultural lands and mangrove forests at elevations of up to . It eats a variety of wild and cultivated seeds, buds, fruits and nuts. Flocks can cause extensive damage to ripening fruits and grain crops like maize and jowar. It usually lives in small flocks, but forms larger groups in areas where food is abundant or at communal roosts.

The Alexandrine parakeet has a variety of calls, including a ringing &quot;trrrieuw&quot;, loud &quot;kree-aar&quot; or &quot;keeak&quot;, deep &quot;klak-klak-klak-klak&quot; and resonant &quot;gr-aak&quot;. Its calls are usually deeper, harsher and more resonant than those of the rose-ringed parakeet. Its voice becomes harsher when alarmed, and it shrieks loudly when mobbing predators. Flocks occasionally excitedly vocalize together. It is known to imitate human speech in captivity.

===Breeding===
Alexandrine parakeets breed from November to April in their native range. They usually nest in tree hollows, but sometimes use tree holes excavated by themselves or cracks in buildings. Females lay 2 to 4 white, blunt oval-shaped eggs, measuring . The average incubation period is 24 days. The chicks fledge at about 7 weeks of age, and are dependent on their parents until 3 to 4 months of age.
==Aviculture==
Alexandrine parakeets are relatively popular pet birds due to their long lifespan in captivity (up to 40 years),
playful behaviour and ability to mimic human speech. Alexander the Great is thought to have kept one as a pet. They are one of the most sought-after cage birds in the Indian market. According to CITES trade data, at least parakeets were imported into countries outside their native range between 1981 and 2014.

Color variants including lutino, albino, and blue are well-established in captivity. 

The World Parrot Trust recommends that captive Alexandrine parrots be kept in a metal or welded mesh enclosure of minimum length .

==Conservation==
The Alexandrine parakeet is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of its steep population decline in its native range due to habitat loss, persecution and excessive capture to cater to the demands of the illegal wildlife trade. It is sporadic in South India, uncommon in Bangladesh, and declining in North Bengal and certain parts of Sri Lanka. It has suffered the greatest population declines in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, Laos, northwestern and southwestern Cambodia, and Thailand.

The sale of Alexandrine parakeets is not banned in Pakistan, and they can be found being openly sold in the markets of Lahore and Rawalpindi. Their sale is banned in India, and yet they are sold in broad daylight in urban bird markets, suggesting that the Indian government is allocating insufficient resources for their protection.

== Culture ==
Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia and Iran have issued postage stamps depicting the Alexandrine parakeet.

<text>Rudolf Trümpy (16 August 1921 – 30 January 2009) was a Swiss geologist, who was born in the small Swiss town of Glarus. He graduated from the ETH Zürich in the late 1940s with a thesis titled: “Der Lias der Glarner Alpen”. From 1947 to 1953 he spent his post-doctoral years in Lausanne before being appointed professor at ETH Zürich in 1953. He would remain there until 1986.

His research mainly concentrated on alpine geology. However, he also published papers on extra-alpine regions like Greenland, the Montagne Noire and the Sahara. He was the author of the reference book &quot;Geology of Switzerland&quot;.

Trümpy is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes including the Wollaston Medal and the Penrose Medal. In 1978 he was elected a Foreign Associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He is also a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

Many stratigraphic formations in the western Alps were first described by Trümpy. For example, the Couches de l’Aroley, the Couches des Marmontains and the Couches de St Cristoph.

<doc id="598264" wikidata="Q430035" url="?curid=598264" title="Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award">
<text>The Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award () is an international children&#x27;s literary award established by the Swedish government in 2002 to honour the Swedish children&#x27;s author Astrid Lindgren (1907–2002). The prize is five million SEK, making it the richest award in children&#x27;s literature and one of the richest literary prizes in the world. The annual cost of 10 million SEK (in 2008) is financed with tax money.

The Lindgren Award annually recognises one or more living people and extant institutions (twelve in the first ten years) – people for their career contributions and institutions for their long-term sustainable work. Specifically they should be &quot;authors, illustrators, oral storytellers and promoters of reading&quot; whose &quot;work is of the highest quality, and in the spirit of Astrid Lindgren.&quot; The object of the award is to increase interest in children&#x27;s and young people&#x27;s literature, and to promote children&#x27;s rights to culture on a global level.

The award is administered by the Swedish Arts Council funded solely by the central government.
Officially it is called &quot;An award by the Swedish people to the world&quot;. The award ceremony is presided over by Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden.

&quot;The award recipients are chosen by a jury with broad expertise in international children&#x27;s and young adult literature, reading promotion and children&#x27;s rights. The 12 members include authors, literary critics and scholars, illustrators and librarians. One member represents Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s family.&quot;

The annual cycle begins no later than December about 9 months before nominees are announced, 15 months before the winner is announced and 18 months before the presentation.

== Winners ==

In the first 22 annual cycles through 2024 there were 24 recipients, twenty people and four institutions. There were two inaugural awards in 2003 and two again in 2005.

Five of the Lindgren Award winners have also, and much earlier, won the older, international Hans Christian Andersen Award for their lifetime contributions to children&#x27;s literature: Sendak and Erlbruch as illustrators; Nöstlinger, Nunes, and Paterson as authors. Lindgren herself won the Andersen Award in 1958. In 2020, Woodson also won the Andersen Award as an author, two years after winning the Lindgren Award.

<text>The Leblanc process was an early industrial process for making &quot;soda ash&quot; (sodium carbonate) used throughout the 19th century, named after its inventor, Nicolas Leblanc. It involved two stages: making sodium sulfate from sodium chloride, followed by reacting the sodium sulfate with coal and calcium carbonate to make sodium carbonate. The process gradually became obsolete after the development of the Solvay process.

== Background ==

Soda ash (sodium carbonate) and potash (potassium carbonate), collectively termed &quot;alkali&quot;, are vital chemicals in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. The traditional source of alkali in western Europe had been potash obtained from wood ashes. However, by the 13th century, deforestation had rendered this means of production uneconomical, and alkali had to be imported. Potash was imported from North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, where large forests still stood. Soda ash was imported from Spain and the Canary Islands, where it was produced from the ashes of glasswort plants (called barilla ashes in Spain), or imported from Syria. The soda ash from glasswort plant ashes was mainly a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In addition in Egypt, naturally occurring sodium carbonate, the mineral natron, was mined from dry lakebeds. In Britain, the only local source of alkali was from kelp, which washed ashore in Scotland and Ireland.

In 1783, King Louis XVI of France and the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a method to produce alkali from sea salt (sodium chloride). In 1791, Nicolas Leblanc, physician to Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans, patented a solution. That same year he built the first Leblanc plant for the Duke at Saint-Denis, and this began to produce 320 tons of soda per year. He was denied his prize money because of the French Revolution.

&quot;For more recent history, see industrial history below.&quot;

== Chemistry ==

In the first step, sodium chloride is treated with sulfuric acid in the Mannheim process. This reaction produces sodium sulfate (called the &quot;salt cake&quot;) and hydrogen chloride:
: 2 NaCl + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 HCl

This chemical reaction had been discovered in 1772 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Leblanc&#x27;s contribution was the second step, in which a mixture of the salt cake and crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) was reduced by heating with coal. This conversion entails two parts. First is the carbothermic reaction whereby the coal, a source of carbon, reduces the sulfate to sulfide:
: Na2SO4 + 2  C → Na2S + 2 CO2

In the second stage, is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide. This mixture is called &quot;black ash&quot;.

: Na2S + CaCO3 → Na2CO3 + CaS
The soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water. Evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate. This extraction process was termed lixiviation.

In response to the Alkali Act, the noxious calcium sulfide was converted into calcium carbonate:

The hydrogen sulfide can be used as a sulfur source for the lead chamber process to produce the sulfuric acid used in the first step of the Leblanc process.

Likewise, by 1874 the Deacon process was invented, oxidizing the hydrochloric acid over a copper catalyst:

The chlorine would be sold for bleach in paper and textile manufacturing. Eventually, the chlorine sales became the purpose of the Leblanc process. The inexpensive chlorine was a contributor to the development of the chloralkali process.
== Process detail ==
The sodium chloride is initially mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and the mixture exposed to low heat. The hydrogen chloride gas bubbles off and was discarded to atmosphere before gas absorption towers were introduced. This continues until all that is left is a fused mass. This mass still contains enough chloride to contaminate the later stages of the process. The mass is then exposed to direct flame, which evaporates nearly all of the remaining chloride.

The coal used in the next step must be low in nitrogen to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, in the form of limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a reverberatory furnace at about 1000 °C. Sometimes the reverberatory furnace rotated and thus was called a &quot;revolver&quot;.

The black-ash product of firing must be lixiviated right away to prevent oxidation of sulfides back to sulfate. In the lixiviation process, the black-ash is completely covered in water, again to prevent oxidation. To optimize the leaching of soluble material, the lixiviation is done in cascaded stages. That is, pure water is used on the black-ash that has already been through prior stages. The liquor from that stage is used to leach an earlier stage of the black-ash, and so on.

The final liquor is treated by blowing carbon dioxide through it. This precipitates dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H2S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding zinc hydroxide. The liquor is separated from the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the reverberatory furnace. The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids that fail to dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.

== Industrial history ==

Leblanc established the first Leblanc process plant in 1791 in St. Denis. However, French Revolutionaries seized the plant, along with the rest of Louis Philip&#x27;s estate, in 1794, and publicized Leblanc&#x27;s trade secrets. Napoleon I returned the plant to Leblanc in 1801, but lacking the funds to repair it and compete against other soda works that had been established in the meantime, Leblanc committed suicide in 1806.

By the early 19th century, French soda ash producers were making 10,000 - 15,000 tons annually. However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process became most widely practiced. The first British soda works using the Leblanc process was built by the Losh family of iron founders at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works in Walker on the River Tyne in 1816, but steep British tariffs on salt production hindered the economics of the Leblanc process and kept such operations on a small scale until 1824. Following the repeal of the salt tariff, the British soda industry grew dramatically. The Bonnington Chemical Works was possibly the earliest production, and the chemical works established by James Muspratt in Liverpool and Flint, and by Charles Tennant near Glasgow became some of the largest in the world. Muspratt&#x27;s Liverpool works enjoyed proximity and transport links to the Cheshire salt mines, the St Helens coalfields and the North Wales and Derbyshire limestone quarries. By 1852, annual soda production had reached 140,000 tons in Britain and 45,000 tons in France. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

=== Obsolescence ===
In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay developed a more direct process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone through the use of ammonia. The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc-based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). The development of electrolytic methods of chlorine production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s&#x27; agreements&quot; with Solvay producers. By 1900, 90% of the world&#x27;s soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of trona, discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986.

The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant in the West closed in the early 1920s, but when during WWII Nationalist China had to evacuate its industry to the inland rural areas, the difficulties in importing and maintaining complex equipment forced them to temporarily re-establish the Leblanc process.

However, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of potassium carbonate, because it relies on the low solubility of the corresponding bicarbonate. Thus, the Leblanc process continued in limited use for K2CO3 manufacture until much later.

== Pollution issues ==
The Leblanc process plants were quite damaging to the local environment. The process of generating salt cake from salt and sulfuric acid released hydrochloric acid gas, and because this acid was industrially useless in the early 19th century, it was simply vented into the atmosphere. Also, an insoluble smelly solid waste was produced. For every 8 tons of soda ash, the process produced 5.5 tons of hydrogen chloride and 7 tons of calcium sulfide waste. This solid waste (known as galligu) had no economic value, and was piled in heaps and spread on fields near the soda works, where it weathered to release hydrogen sulfide, the toxic gas responsible for the odor of rotten eggs.

Because of their noxious emissions, Leblanc soda works became targets of lawsuits and legislation. An 1839 suit against soda works alleged, &quot;the gas from these manufactories is of such a deleterious nature as to blight everything within its influence, and is alike baneful to health and property. The herbage of the fields in their vicinity is scorched, the gardens neither yield fruit nor vegetables; many flourishing trees have lately become rotten naked sticks. Cattle and poultry droop and pine away. It tarnishes the furniture in our houses, and when we are exposed to it, which is of frequent occurrence, we are afflicted with coughs and pains in the head ... all of which we attribute to the Alkali works.&quot;

In 1863, the British Parliament passed the Alkali Act 1863, the first of several Alkali Acts, the first modern air pollution legislation. This act allowed that no more than 5% of the hydrochloric acid produced by alkali plants could be vented to the atmosphere. To comply with the legislation, soda works passed the escaping hydrogen chloride gas up through a tower packed with charcoal, where it was absorbed by water flowing in the other direction. The chemical works usually dumped the resulting hydrochloric acid solution into nearby bodies of water, killing fish and other aquatic life.

The Leblanc process also meant very unpleasant working conditions for the operators. It originally required careful operation and frequent operator interventions (some involving heavy manual labour) into processes giving off hot noxious chemicals.
Sometimes, workmen cleaning the reaction products out of the reverberatory furnace wore cloth mouth-and-nose gags to keep dust and aerosols out of the lungs.

This improved somewhat later as processes were more heavily mechanised to improve economics and uniformity of product.

By the 1880s, methods for converting the hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas for the manufacture of bleaching powder and for reclaiming the sulfur in the calcium sulfide waste had been discovered, but the Leblanc process remained more wasteful and more polluting than the Solvay process. The same is true when it is compared with the later electrolytical processes which eventually replaced it for chlorine production.

== Biodiversity ==

There is a strong case for arguing that Leblanc process waste is the most endangered habitat in the UK, since the waste weathers down to calcium carbonate and produces a haven for plants that thrive in lime-rich soils, known as calcicoles. Only four such sites have survived the new millennium; three are protected as local nature reserves of which the largest, at Nob End near Bolton, is an SSSI and Local Nature Reserve - largely for its sparse orchid-calcicole flora, most unusual in an area with acid soils. This alkaline island contains within it an acid island, where acid boiler slag was deposited, which now shows up as a zone dominated by heather, &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, MAGENTA is a symmetric key block cipher developed by Michael Jacobson Jr. and Klaus Huber for Deutsche Telekom. The name MAGENTA is an acronym for Multifunctional Algorithm for General-purpose Encryption and Network Telecommunication Applications. (The color magenta is also part of the corporate identity of Deutsche Telekom.) The cipher was submitted to the Advanced Encryption Standard process, but did not advance beyond the first round; cryptographic weaknesses were discovered and it was found to be one of the slower ciphers submitted.

MAGENTA has a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. It is a Feistel cipher with six or eight rounds.

After the presentation of the cipher at the first AES conference, several cryptographers immediately found vulnerabilities. These were written up and presented at the second AES conference (Biham et al., 1999).

<text>The Wiesner building (Building E15) houses the MIT Media Lab and the List Visual Arts Center and is named in honor of former MIT president Jerome Wiesner and his wife Laya. The building is very box-like, a motif that is consistently repeated in both the interior and exterior design evoking a sense of boxes packed within each other.

The building is notable for the level of collaboration between the architect and artists. It stands apart from the surrounding neighborhood with its flat, gridded skin make of white, modular metal panels. The building&#x27;s exterior was designed by Kenneth Noland is meant as a metaphor of technology through the grids of graph paper and number matrices while also quoting the corridor-like morphology of the rest of the MIT campus. Scott Burton, Alan Shields, and Richard Fleischner also collaborated extensively in the final design of the internal atria and external landscaping.

The Wiesner Building in Cambridge, Massachusetts houses the MIT Media Lab, the Center for Bits and Atoms (Neil Gershenfeld&#x27;s lab), the Department of Architecture&#x27;s Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT, formerly the Visual Arts Program), the Comparative Media Studies (CMS) program and the List Visual Arts Center. It was designed by I.M. Pei &amp; Partners. It is named in honor of former MIT president Jerome Wiesner and his wife Laya and was dedicated in 1985.

The Wiesner Building is also known to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community as Building E15.

<text>Dasa Sahitya () is a genre of literature of the bhakti movement composed by devotees in honor of Vishnu or one of his avatars. &quot;Dasa&quot; is literally servant in Kannada and sahitya is &quot;literature&quot;. Haridasas (&quot;servants of God&quot;) were preachers of bhakti to Vishnu or one of his avatars. The bhakti literature of these Haridasas is collectively referred to as Dasa Sahitya. It is in the Kannada language. Dasas are Dvaita scholars and poets.

The Haridasas contributed to the rich heritage of Karnataka music. They made an indelible impression on the religious and cultural life of Karnataka. They spread the didactic teachings in a musical form to the hearts of the common man. Like other doyens of Indian classical music, these scholars offered pooja to Vishnu through music, called naadopasana. Vishnu is described as Samagana priya; bhakti through music is the most preferred path to &#x27;reach&#x27; him.

The Haridasa compositions are popularly known as Devaranamas. Compositions like &quot;Venkatachala Nilayam, Jagadoddharana, Tamboori meetidava, Krishna Nee Begane Baaro&quot; are some of the many examples of their scholarly work.

Although the association of the Dasas is with Vishnu, they composed songs on other forms of Hindu Gods, also known as Saguna Brahma Svarupa(s). Purandaradasa for example, has composed songs in praise of Ganesha (Gajavadana Beduve), Shiva (Chandra chuda Shiva Shankara), and Saraswati (Kodubega Divyamati Saraswati).

<text>Divinyls () were an Australian rock band that were formed in Sydney in 1980. The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and she often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience.
Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996.

In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th-anniversary celebrations, named &quot;Science Fiction&quot; as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008. Divinyls broke up in 2009, and Amphlett died in 2013.

Divinyls released five studio albums—four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (&quot;Divinyls&quot;) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the United States, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada.

==Career==
===1980s: Formation, &quot;Desperate&quot;, &quot;What a Life!&quot;, and &quot;Temperamental&quot;===
Amphlett was the first cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia &quot;Little Pattie&quot; Amphlett. In her autobiography &quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot; (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain.

Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney&#x27;s Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, &quot;Music from Monkey Grip&quot; EP, &quot;Boys in Town&quot;, which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and &quot;Only Lonely&quot;. The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival.

After the band&#x27;s initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring.

Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, &quot;Music from Monkey Grip&quot; EP on WEA in 1982, &quot;Desperate&quot; on Chrysalis Records in 1983, &quot;What a Life!&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Temperamental&quot; in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the United States. They had hit singles in Australia with, &quot;Science Fiction&quot; No. 13 in 1983, &quot;Good Die Young&quot; No. 32 in 1984 and &quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot; which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman and went No. 11 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls&#x27; transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of the United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Make You Happy&quot;, and Syndicate of Sound&#x27;s &quot;Hey Little Boy&quot; (&quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988. Amphlett became a controversial and highly visible celebrity for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances, and media interviews.

===Image transformation===

At the start of their popularity, Divinyls were considered to be a hard rock band. At some point, many fans referred to Amphlett as the female Angus Young (of AC/DC), as both had similar mannerisms on stage and wore school uniforms while performing in the early 1980s. Amphlett acknowledged Young&#x27;s schoolboy outfit as the inspiration for her performing in a schoolgirl&#x27;s uniform. The band&#x27;s image gradually changed after the release of the album &quot;What a Life!&quot; when the band began wearing elaborate clothing and producing more songs in the pop music genre. By the time of the release of their album &quot;Temperamental&quot;, Divinyls&#x27; image had changed to a glamour fashion style where they produced modern pop music.

===1990s: &quot;diVINYLS&quot; &amp; &quot;Underworld&quot;===
In 1991, Divinyls released &quot;diVINYLS&quot; on Virgin Records and the single &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; which became their only Australian No.1 single. The song reached No. 4 in the United States and No. 10 in the United Kingdom. The majority of Divinyls&#x27; hits were co-written by Amphlett and McEntee, but in this case they wrote with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. &quot;diVINYLS&quot; reached No. 5 on the Australian album charts and No. 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. The drummer for the &quot;diVINYLS&quot; sessions was Charley Drayton, who became romantically involved with Amphlett: they married in July 1999, and from 2000, lived together in New York. A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot; No. 19 in 1992 and &quot;I&#x27;m Jealous&quot; No. 14 in 1995. During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including Chrissie Hynde and Cyndi Lauper, and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects.

A live album, &quot;Divinyls Live&quot;, was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s, they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the Young Rascals&#x27; &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot; for &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992), the Wild Ones&#x27; &quot;Wild Thing&quot; for &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot; (1993), and Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; for &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; (1993).

The song &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers. 

It wasn&#x27;t until 1996 that their fifth studio album, &quot;Underworld&quot;, was released in Australia by BMG. Despite the success of &quot;diVINYLS&quot;, Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release &quot;Underworld&quot; in the United States. As with &quot;What a Life!&quot;, they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording &quot;I&#x27;m Jealous&quot; in Nashville, followed by Keith Forsey for &quot;Sex Will Keep Us Together&quot; and &quot;Heart of Steel&quot;. Although &quot;Heart of Steel&quot; was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett &quot;he was a bit too &#x27;pop&#x27; for us&quot; and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton. By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls.

===1998–2005: After the separation===
Following &quot;Underworld&quot;, Amphlett pursued a stage career. In 1998, she played the role of Judy Garland in the Australian stage production of the life story of entertainer Peter Allen, titled &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;. The production was a success and Amphlett&#x27;s interpretation of Garland, during her final troubled years, brought her critical acclaim: she was nominated for the Helpmann Award for &#x27;Best Female Actor in a Musical&#x27;.

Amphlett and McEntee concentrated on solo projects and collaborations with other artists. Amphlett and Drayton lived in New York City from 2000, while McEntee ran a clothing label, Wheels and Doll Baby, in Perth with his partner, Melanie Greensmith. In November 2005 Amphlett published her autobiography &quot;Pleasure and Pain: My Life&quot; co-written with Larry Writer; she detailed her achievements, drug and alcohol abuse, love affairs and triumphs while a member of Divinyls.

===2006–2012: Hall of Fame and reformation===

On 16 August 2006, Divinyls were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and made their first performance for 10 years at the award ceremony. They reformed shortly afterwards and a compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released by EMI Music Australia in August 2006. The band recorded four new songs via a satellite link: Amphlett and Drayton at Palm Studios in Las Vegas and McEntee in Perth. A single and B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Do This&quot;/&quot;Asphyxiated&quot;, was released in November 2007, with a third track, &quot;All Pretty Things&quot;, released on a compilation album for the Homebake Festival. Amphlett stated that the band would return to the studio to record a full album provided they &quot;survived&quot; their Homebake headline gig and national tour.

They performed during the &quot;Australian Idol&quot; grand final at the Sydney Opera House, on 25 November 2007, although their performance of &quot;Boys in Town&quot; (also performed by &quot;Idol&quot; winner Natalie Gauci) had to be repeated after Network Ten&#x27;s transmission feed was interrupted. A national tour of Australia followed in December 2007 with a touring band featuring Drayton on drums, Jerome Smith on bass, Charlie Owen on guitar and newest member Clayton Doley on keyboards. Amphlett revealed on 7 December 2007 that she had multiple sclerosis in an interview with Richard Wilkins on Network Nine&#x27;s &quot;A Current Affair&quot;—nevertheless, she was looking forward to touring with Divinyls. The next day, Divinyls headlined the Homebake music festival where Amphlett displayed an emotional fragility when attempting to get the crowd to sing along with her. In August 2009, Amphlett announced that Divinyls were finished and she had a new band in New York.

===2013–present: Death of Amphlett and aborted 2018 reformation===
Aged 53 years, Amphlett died on 21 April 2013 at her home in New York City after a protracted battle with breast cancer since 2010. Amphlett stated that she had been unable to receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy as treatment for the cancer due to her multiple sclerosis. Amphlett&#x27;s cousin Patricia Thompson announced the news in an official public statement: &quot;Our beloved Chrissy peacefully made her transition this morning. Christine Joy Amphlett succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity.&quot; In 2014, some of Australia&#x27;s leading female artists came together to cover &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer.

In 2017, the band performed a one-off show in Perth with The Preatures&#x27; Isabella Manfredi and Jack Moffit joining as guests on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, respectively. McEntee, Grossman and Harvey completed the line-up.

In December 2018, McEntee announced he would be reforming the group with new singer Lauren Ruth Ward, ex-Divinyls guitarist Frank Infante and a new rhythm section for an Australian tour, to begin in 2019. However, this announcement was criticised by Drayton and several fans as an &quot;ultimate disrespect&quot;, with Drayton stating that anyone other than Amphlett who fronted the Divinyls should &quot;seek some trustworthy advice&quot;. On 6 February 2019, the Australian tour was cancelled.

In early January 2021, former band drummer Warren McLean died. Original drummer Richard Harvey died on 19 July 2022, his passing announced on social media by his bandmate from The Party Boys Paul Christie.

<text>Pathophysiology (or physiopathology) is a branch of study, at the intersection of pathology and physiology, concerning disordered physiological processes that cause, result from, or are otherwise associated with a disease or injury. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically &quot;observed&quot; during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms &quot;operating&quot; within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition (symptoms of a disease), whereas pathophysiology seeks to explain the functional changes that are occurring within an individual due to a disease or pathologic state.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;pathophysiology&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek πάθος (&quot;pathos&quot;) and φυσιολογία (&quot;phisiologia&quot;).

==History==

===Early Developments===
The origins of pathophysiology as a distinct field date back to the late 18th century. The first known lectures on the subject were delivered by Professor at the University of Erfurt in 1790, and in 1791, he published the first textbook on pathophysiology, &quot;Grundriss der Physiologia pathologica&quot;, spanning 770 pages. Hecker also established the first academic journal in the field, &quot;Magazin für die pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie&quot;, in 1796. The French physician Jean François Fernel had earlier suggested in 1542 that a distinct branch of physiology should study the functions of diseased organisms, an idea further developed by in 1617, who first coined the term &quot;pathologic physiology&quot; in a medical text.

===Nineteenth century===

====Reductionism====

In Germany in the 1830s, Johannes Müller led the establishment of physiology research autonomous from medical research. In 1843, the Berlin Physical Society was founded in part to purge biology and medicine of vitalism, and in 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz, who joined the Society in 1845, published the paper &quot;On the conservation of energy&quot;, highly influential to reduce physiology&#x27;s research foundation to physical sciences. In the late 1850s, German anatomical pathologist Rudolf Virchow, a former student of Müller, directed focus to the cell, establishing cytology as the focus of physiological research. He also recognized pathophysiology as a distinct discipline, arguing that it should rely on clinical observation and experimentation rather than purely anatomical pathology. Virchow’s influence extended to his student Julius Cohnheim, who pioneered experimental pathology and the usage of intravital microscopy, further advancing the study of pathophysiology.

====Germ theory====
By 1863, motivated by Louis Pasteur&#x27;s report on fermentation to butyric acid, fellow Frenchman Casimir Davaine identified a microorganism as the crucial causal agent of the cattle disease anthrax, but its routinely vanishing from blood left other scientists inferring it a mere byproduct of putrefaction. In 1876, upon Ferdinand Cohn&#x27;s report of a tiny spore stage of a bacterial species, the fellow German Robert Koch isolated Davaine&#x27;s &quot;bacterides&quot; in pure culture —a pivotal step that would establish bacteriology as a distinct discipline— identified a spore stage, applied Jakob Henle&#x27;s postulates, and confirmed Davaine&#x27;s conclusion, a major feat for experimental pathology. Pasteur and colleagues followed up with ecological investigations confirming its role in the natural environment via spores in soil.

Also, as to sepsis, Davaine had injected rabbits with a highly diluted, tiny amount of putrid blood, duplicated disease, and used the term &quot;ferment of putrefaction&quot;, but it was unclear whether this referred as did Pasteur&#x27;s term &quot;ferment&quot; to a microorganism or, as it did for many others, to a chemical. In 1878, Koch published &quot;Aetiology of Traumatic Infective Diseases&quot;, unlike any previous work, where in 80 pages Koch, as noted by a historian, &quot;was able to show, in a manner practically conclusive, that a number of diseases, differing clinically, anatomically, and in aetiology, can be produced experimentally by the injection of putrid materials into animals.&quot; Koch used bacteriology and the new staining methods with aniline dyes to identify particular microorganisms for each. Germ theory of disease crystallized the concept of cause—presumably identifiable by scientific investigation.

====Scientific medicine====

The American physician William Welch trained in German pathology from 1876 to 1878, including under Cohnheim, and opened America&#x27;s first scientific laboratory —a pathology laboratory— at Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1878. Welch&#x27;s course drew enrollment from students at other medical schools, which responded by opening their own pathology laboratories. Once appointed by Daniel Coit Gilman, upon advice by John Shaw Billings, as founding dean of the medical school of the newly forming Johns Hopkins University that Gilman, as its first president, was planning, Welch traveled again to Germany for training in Koch&#x27;s bacteriology in 1883. Welch returned to America but moved to Baltimore, eager to overhaul American medicine, while blending Virchow&#x27;s anatomical pathology, Cohnheim&#x27;s experimental pathology, and Koch&#x27;s bacteriology. Hopkins medical school, led by the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; —Welch, William Osler, Howard Kelly, and William Halsted— opened at last in 1893 as America&#x27;s first medical school devoted to teaching German scientific medicine, so called.

===Twentieth century===

====Biomedicine====

The first biomedical institutes, Pasteur Institute and Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases, whose first directors were Pasteur and Koch, were founded in 1888 and 1891, respectively. America&#x27;s first biomedical institute, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was founded in 1901 with Welch, nicknamed &quot;dean of American medicine&quot;, as its scientific director, who appointed his former Hopkins student Simon Flexner as director of pathology and bacteriology laboratories. By way of World War I and World War II, Rockefeller Institute became the globe&#x27;s leader in biomedical research.

====Molecular paradigm====

The 1918 pandemic triggered frenzied search for its cause, although most deaths were via lobar pneumonia, already attributed to pneumococcal invasion. In London, pathologist with the Ministry of Health, Fred Griffith in 1928 reported pneumococcal transformation from virulent to avirulent and between antigenic types —nearly a switch in species— challenging pneumonia&#x27;s specific causation. The laboratory of Rockefeller Institute&#x27;s Oswald Avery, America&#x27;s leading pneumococcal expert, was so troubled by the report that they refused to attempt repetition.

When Avery was away on summer vacation, Martin Dawson, British-Canadian, convinced that anything from England must be correct, repeated Griffith&#x27;s results, then achieved transformation &quot;in vitro&quot;, too, opening it to precise investigation. Having returned, Avery kept a photo of Griffith on his desk while his researchers followed the trail. In 1944, Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty reported the transformation factor as DNA, widely doubted amid estimations that something must act with it. At the time of Griffith&#x27;s report, it was unrecognized that bacteria even had genes.

The first genetics, Mendelian genetics, began at 1900, yet inheritance of Mendelian traits was localized to chromosomes by 1903, thus chromosomal genetics. Biochemistry emerged in the same decade. In the 1940s, most scientists viewed the cell as a &quot;sack of chemicals&quot; —a membrane containing only loose molecules in chaotic motion— and the only especial cell structures as chromosomes, which bacteria lack as such. Chromosomal DNA was presumed too simple, so genes were sought in chromosomal proteins. Yet in 1953, American biologist James Watson, British physicist Francis Crick, and British chemist Rosalind Franklin inferred DNA&#x27;s molecular structure —a double helix— and conjectured it to spell a code. In the early 1960s, Crick helped crack a genetic code in DNA, thus establishing molecular genetics.

In the late 1930s, Rockefeller Foundation had spearheaded and funded the molecular biology research program —seeking fundamental explanation of organisms and life— led largely by physicist Max Delbrück at Caltech and Vanderbilt University. Yet the reality of organelles in cells was controversial amid unclear visualization with conventional light microscopy. Around 1940, largely via cancer research at Rockefeller Institute, cell biology emerged as a new discipline filling the vast gap between cytology and biochemistry by applying new technology —ultracentrifuge and electron microscope— to identify and deconstruct cell structures, functions, and mechanisms. The two new sciences interlaced, &quot;cell and molecular biology&quot;.

Mindful of Griffith and Avery, Joshua Lederberg confirmed bacterial conjugation —reported decades earlier but controversial— and was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York, Delbrück and Salvador Luria led the Phage Group —hosting Watson— discovering details of cell physiology by tracking changes to bacteria upon infection with their viruses, the process transduction. Lederberg led the opening of a genetics department at Stanford University&#x27;s medical school, and facilitated greater communication between biologists and medical departments.

====Disease mechanisms====

In the 1950s, researches on rheumatic fever, a complication of streptococcal infections, revealed it was mediated by the host&#x27;s own immune response, stirring investigation by pathologist Lewis Thomas that led to identification of enzymes released by the innate immune cells macrophages and that degrade host tissue. In the late 1970s, as president of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Thomas collaborated with Lederberg, soon to become president of Rockefeller University, to redirect the funding focus of the US National Institutes of Health toward basic research into the mechanisms operating during disease processes, which at the time medical scientists were all but wholly ignorant of, as biologists had scarcely taken interest in disease mechanisms. Thomas became for American basic researchers a patron saint.

==Examples==

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

The pathophysiology of Parkinson&#x27;s disease is death of dopaminergic neurons as a result of changes in biological activity in the brain with respect to Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD). There are several proposed mechanisms for neuronal death in PD; however, not all of them are well understood. Five proposed major mechanisms for neuronal death in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease include protein aggregation in Lewy bodies, disruption of autophagy, changes in cell metabolism or mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown resulting in vascular leakiness.

===Heart failure===

The pathophysiology of heart failure is a reduction in the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. As such, it can be caused by a wide number of conditions, including myocardial infarction (in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies), hypertension (which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood) and amyloidosis (in which misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle, causing it to stiffen). Over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself.

===Multiple sclerosis===

The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis is that of an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS in which activated immune cells invade the central nervous system and cause inflammation, neurodegeneration and tissue damage. The underlying condition that produces this behaviour is currently unknown. Current research in neuropathology, neuroimmunology, neurobiology, and neuroimaging, together with clinical neurology provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum

===Hypertension===

The pathophysiology of hypertension is that of a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90–95% of hypertension is essential hypertension.

===HIV/AIDS===

The pathophysiology of HIV/AIDS involves, upon acquisition of the virus, that the virus replicates inside and kills T helper cells, which are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a latent, asymptomatic phase. When the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer.

===Spider bites===

The pathophysiology of spider bites is due to the effect of its venom. A spider envenomation occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites inject venom – a dry bite, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans.

===Obesity===

The pathophysiology of obesity involves many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its development and maintenance. 

This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman&#x27;s laboratory. These investigators postulated that leptin was a satiety factor. In the ob/ob mouse, mutations in the leptin gene resulted in the obese phenotype opening the possibility of leptin therapy for human obesity. However, soon thereafter J. F. Caro&#x27;s laboratory could not detect any mutations in the leptin gene in humans with obesity. On the contrary Leptin expression was increased proposing the possibility of Leptin-resistance in human obesity.

<text>The Polar Music Prize is a Swedish international award founded in 1989 by Stig Anderson, best known as the manager of the Swedish band ABBA, with a donation to the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. The award is annually given to one contemporary musician and one classical musician. Exceptions were made in 2001, when it was awarded to three musicians (one composer, one contemporary musician and one inventor), and 2003, when it was awarded only to one musician. Without any restrictions of nationality, the prize is to be &quot;awarded for significant achievements in music and/or musical activity, or for achievements which are found to be of great potential importance for music or musical activity, and it shall be referable to all fields within or closely connected with music&quot;. The prize has been called the &quot;Nobel Prize of Music&quot; in Sweden.

The awards were first presented in 1992. The recipients were Sir Paul McCartney and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Each of these four Laureates were awarded 1 million kr (approximately US$120,000 at 2016 rates, US$106,000 in 2019, US$94,000 in 2024) presented by HM King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden at a ceremony at Stockholm Concert Hall in June every year. The Polar Music Prize is regarded as Sweden&#x27;s foremost musical honour. The prize is overseen by the Stig Anderson Music Award Foundation, which includes members of Anderson&#x27;s family and representatives of SKAP – the Swedish Society of Songwriters, Composers and Authors and the Swedish Performing Rights Society. A committee of musicians, other experienced members of the music industry, and members of Anderson&#x27;s family selects the prize recipients from nominations submitted by representatives of several international music industry organizations, such as the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance. The prize amount is raised from revenue from the donation, while sponsors fund the ceremony. In June 2018, it was reported by Swedish public service radio that the Polar Prize organization had sustained large financial losses for several years.
