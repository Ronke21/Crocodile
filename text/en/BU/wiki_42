<text>The 1911 Canadian federal election was held on September 21, 1911, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 12th Parliament of Canada.

The central issue was Liberal support for a proposed agreement with the United States president William Howard Taft to lower tariffs. The Conservative Party denounced it because it threatened to weaken ties with Britain, submerge the Canadian economy and Canadian identity with the US, and lead to American annexation of Canada. The idea of a Canadian Navy was also an issue.

The Conservatives won, and Robert Borden became the eighth prime minister. The election ended 15 years of government by the Liberal Party of Wilfrid Laurier.

==Navy==
The Liberal government was caught up in a debate over the naval arms race between the British Empire and Germany. Laurier attempted a compromise by starting up the Canadian Navy (now the Royal Canadian Navy) but failed to appease either the French-Canadians or English-Canadians: the former refused giving any aid, and the latter suggested sending money directly to Britain. After the election, the Conservatives drew up a bill for naval contributions to the British, but it was held up by a lengthy Liberal filibuster before it was passed in the House of Commons by invoking closure, only to be defeated by the Liberal-controlled Senate.

==Ties to Britain==
Many English Canadians in British Columbia and the Maritimes felt that Laurier was abandoning Canada&#x27;s traditional links to their mother country, Great Britain. On the other side, the Quebec nationalist Henri Bourassa, who had earlier quit the Liberal Party over what he considered the government&#x27;s pro-British policies, campaigned against Laurier in the province. Ironically, Bourassa&#x27;s attacks on Laurier in Quebec aided in the election of the Conservatives, who held policies that were more staunchly imperialist than those of the Liberals.

In mid-1910, Laurier had attempted to kill the naval issue, which was setting English-Canadians against French-Canadians by opening talks for a reciprocity treaty with the United States. He believed that an economically favourable treaty would appeal to most Canadians and have the additional benefit of dividing the Conservatives between the western wing of the party, which had long wanted free trade with the United States, and the eastern wing, which was more hostile to Continentalism.

In January 1911, Laurier and US President William Howard Taft announced that they signed a reciprocity agreement, which they decided to pass by concurrent legislation rather than a formal treaty, as would normally have been the case. As such, the reciprocity agreement had to be ratified by both houses of the US Congress rather than just the US Senate, which Laurier would later regret.

==Ties to United States==
The base of Liberal support shifted to Western Canada, which sought markets for its agricultural products. The party had long been a proponent of free trade with the United States. The protected manufacturing businesses of Central Canada were strongly against the idea. The Liberals, who by ideology and history had strongly supported free trade, decided to make the issue the central plank of their re-election strategy, and they negotiated a free trade agreement in natural products with the United States.

===Clark speech===
Allen argues that two speeches by American politicians gave the Conservatives the ammunition needed to arouse anti-American, pro-British sentiments, which provided the winning votes. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives was a Democrat, Champ Clark, and he declared, on the floor of the House, &quot;I look forward to the time when the American flag will fly over every square foot of British North America up to the North Pole. The people of Canada are of our blood and language.&quot; Clark went on to suggest in his speech that reciprocity agreement was the first step towards the end of Canada, a speech that was greeted with &quot;prolonged applause&quot; according to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;Evidently, then, the Democrats generally approved of Mr. Clark&#x27;s annexation sentiments and voted for the reciprocity bill because, among other things, it improves the prospect of annexation.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, in an editorial, condemned Clark and warned that Clark&#x27;s speech might have fatally damaged the reciprocity agreement in Canada and stated, &quot;He lets his imagination run wild like a Missouri mule on a rampage. Remarks about the absorption of one country by another grate harshly on the ears of the smaller.&quot;

A Republican Representative, William Stiles Bennet, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a resolution that asked the Taft administration to begin talks with Britain on how the United States might best annex Canada. Taft rejected the proposal and asked the committee to take a vote on the resolution, which only Bennett supported, but the Conservatives now had more ammunition. Since Bennett, a strong protectionist, had been an opponent of the reciprocity agreement, the Canadian historian Chantal Allen suggested that Bennett had introduced his resolution deliberately inflame Canadian opinion against the reciprocity agreement. Clark&#x27;s speech had already provoked massive outrage in Canada. Bennett&#x27;s resolution was taken by many Canadians as more proof that the Conservatives were right that the reciprocity agreement would result in the US annexing Canada.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted that the effect of Clark&#x27;s speech and Bennett&#x27;s resolution in Canada had &quot;roused the opponents of reciprocity in and out of Parliament to the highest pitch of excitement they have yet reached&quot;. The &quot;Montreal Daily Star&quot;, English Canada&#x27;s most widely read newspaper and had supported the Liberals and reciprocity, now did a &quot;volte-face&quot; and turned against the reciprocity agreement. In an editorial, it wrote, &quot;None of us realized the inward meaning of the shrewdly framed offer of the long headed American government when we first saw it. It was as cunning a trap as ever laid. The master bargainers of Washington have not lost their skill.&quot;

===Anti-Americanism===
Contemporary accounts mentioned in the aftermath of Clark&#x27;s speech that anti-Americanism was at an all-time high in Canada. Many American newspapers advised their readers that if they visited Canada, they should not identify themselves as American, or they could become the objects of abuse and hatred from the Canadians. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, in a July 1911 report stated that Laurier was &quot;having the fight of his career to carry reciprocity at all&quot;. One Conservative MP compared the relationship of Finance Minister William Stevens Fielding and Taft to Samson and Delilah, with Fielding having &quot;succumbed to the Presidential blandishments.&quot;

When the reciprocity agreement was submitted by Laurier to the House of Commons for ratification by Parliament, the Conservatives waged a vigorous filibuster against the reciprocity agreement on the floor of the House. Although the Liberals still had two years left in their mandate, they decided to call an election to settle the issue after it had aroused controversy, and Laurier was unable to break the filibuster.

Borden largely ran on a platform of opposing the reciprocity agreement under the grounds that it would &quot;Americanize&quot; Canada and claimed that there was a secret plan on the part of the Taft administration to annex Canada, with the reciprocity agreement being only the first step. In his first speech given in London, Borden declared, &quot;It is beyond doubt that the leading public men of the United States, its leading press, and the mass of its people believe annexation of the Dominion to be the ultimate, inevitable, and desirable result of this proposition, and for that reason support it.&quot;

To support his claims, the Conservatives produced thousands of pamphlets reproducing the speeches of Clark and Bennett, which encouraged a massive burst of anti-Americanism that was sweeping across English Canada in 1911.

One American newspaper wrote that the Conservatives were portraying the Americans as &quot;a corrupt, bragging, boodle-hunting and negro lynching crowd from which Canadian workingmen and the Canadian land of milk and honey must be saved.&quot; On 7 September 1911, the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; published a front-page appeal to all Canadians by the popular British poet Rudyard Kipling, who had been asked by his friend, Max Aitken, to write something for the Conservatives. Kipling wrote in his appeal to Canadians, &quot;It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.&quot; Kipling&#x27;s appeal attracted much media attention in English Canada and was reprinted over the next week, in every English newspaper in Canada.

==Immigration==
In British Columbia, the Conservative Party ran on the slogan &quot;A White Canada&quot; by playing to the fears of British Columbians who resented the increasing presence of cheap Asian labour and the resulting depression in wages.

==Results==
The campaign went badly for the Liberals, however. The powerful manufacturing interests of Toronto and Montreal switched their allegiance and financing to the Conservatives, who argued that free trade would undermine Canadian sovereignty and lead to a slow annexation of Canada by the US. In an editorial after Borden&#x27;s victory, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Their ballots have consigned to everlasting flames the bogy of annexation by the United States which Champ Clark called from the deeps. It was not really a wraith of anything that existed on this side of the line. It was a pumpkin scarehead with blazing eyes, a crooked slit for a nose, and a hideous grinning mouth which the fun-loving Champ placed upon a pole along with the Stars and Stripes, the while he carried terror to loyal Canuck hearts by his derisive shout of annexation.&quot;

The election is often compared to the 1988 federal election, which was also fought over free trade, but the positions of the two parties were now reversed, with the Liberals against the Conservatives&#x27; trade proposals.

The Conservatives dominated in Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba. They also made significant gains in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, although the Liberals still won pluralities in both regions. The Liberals continued to dominate in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where free trade was extremely popular. Notably, this remains the most recent federal election where the Liberals would win the most seats in Alberta (although most Albertan Liberals supported the Borden-led Unionist government during the First World War).

<text>A slow cooker, also known as a crock-pot (after a trademark owned by Sunbeam Products but sometimes used generically in the English-speaking world), is a countertop electrical cooking appliance used to simmer at a lower temperature than other cooking methods, such as baking, boiling, and frying. This facilitates unattended cooking for many hours of dishes that would otherwise be boiled: pot roast, soups, stews and other dishes (including beverages, desserts and dips).

==History==
Slow cookers achieved popularity in the US during the 1940s, when many women began to work outside the home. They could start dinner cooking in the morning before going to work and finish preparing the meal in the evening when they came home.

The Naxon Utilities Corporation of Chicago, under the leadership of electrical engineer Irving Naxon (born Irving Nachumsohn), developed the Naxon Beanery All-Purpose Cooker for the purposes of cooking a bean meal. Naxon was inspired by a story from his mother which told how back in her native Lithuanian town, his grandmother made a traditional Jewish stew called cholent which took several hours to cook in an oven. A 1950 advertisement shows a slow cooker called the &quot;Simmer Crock&quot; made by the Industrial Radiant Heat Corp. of Gladstone, NJ.

The Rival Company from Sedalia, Missouri, bought Naxon in 1970, acquiring Naxon&#x27;s 1940 patent for the bean simmer cooker. Rival asked inventor Alex MacMaster, from Boonville, Missouri, to develop Naxon&#x27;s bean cooker into a large scale production model which could cook an entire family meal, going further than just cooking a bean meal. Alex also designed and produced the mass-production machines for Rival&#x27;s manufacturing line of the Crock-Pot. The cooker was then reintroduced under the name &quot;Crock-Pot&quot; in 1971. In 1974, Rival introduced removable stoneware inserts, making the appliance easier to clean. The Crock-Pot brand now belongs to Newell Brands.

Other brands of this appliance include Cuisinart, GE, Hamilton Beach, KitchenAid, Magic Chef, West Bend Housewares, and the now defunct American Electric Corporation.

==Design==

A basic slow cooker consists of a lidded round or oval cooking pot made of glazed ceramic or porcelain, surrounded by a housing, usually metal, containing an electric heating element. The lid itself is often made of glass, and seated in a groove in the pot edge; condensed vapor collects in the groove and provides a low-pressure seal to the atmosphere. The contents of a crock pot are effectively at atmospheric pressure, despite the water vapor generated inside the pot. A slow cooker is quite different from a pressure cooker and presents no danger of an abrupt pressure release.

The &quot;crock&quot;, or ceramic pot, itself acts as both a cooking container and a heat reservoir. Slow cookers come in capacities from to . Because the heating elements are generally located at the bottom and often also partway up the sides, most slow cookers have a minimum recommended liquid level to avoid uncontrolled heating. Some newer models have coated aluminum or steel &quot;crocks&quot; which, while not as efficient as ceramic at retaining heat, do allow for quicker heating and cooling as well as the ability to use the &quot;crock&quot; on the stove top to brown meat prior to cooking.

Many slow cookers have two or more heat settings (e.g., low, medium, high, and sometimes a &quot;keep warm&quot; setting); some have continuously variable power. In the past, most slow cookers had no temperature control and deliver a constant heat to the contents. The temperature of the contents rises until it reaches boiling point, at which point the energy goes into gently boiling the liquid closest to the hot surface. At a lower setting, it may just simmer at a temperature below the boiling point. While many basic slow cookers still operate in this manner, newer models have computerized controls for precise temperature control, delayed cooking starts and control via a computer or mobile device.

==Operation==
To use a slow cooker, the cook places raw food and a liquid, such as stock, water, or wine, in the slow cooker. Some recipes call for pre-heated liquid. The cook puts the lid on the slow cooker and turns it on. Some cookers automatically switch from cooking to warming (maintaining the temperature at ) after a fixed time or after the internal temperature of the food, as determined by a probe, reaches a specified value.

The heating element heats the contents to a steady temperature in the range. The contents are enclosed by the crock and the lid, and attain an essentially constant temperature. The vapor that is produced at this temperature condenses on the bottom of the lid and returns as liquid, into which some water-soluble vitamins are leached.

The liquid transfers heat from the pot walls to its contents, and also distributes flavors. The slow cooker&#x27;s lid is essential to prevent the warm vapor from escaping, taking heat with it and cooling the contents.

Basic cookers, which have only high, medium, low, or keep warm settings, must be turned on and off manually. More advanced cookers have computerized timing devices that let a cook program the cooker to perform multiple operations (e.g., two hours high, followed by two hours low, followed by warm) and to delay the start of cooking.

Because food cooked in a slow cooker stays warm for a long time after it is switched off, people can use the slow cookers to take food elsewhere to eat without reheating. Some slow cookers have lids that seal to prevent their contents from spilling during transport.

==Recipes==
Recipes intended for other cooking methods must be modified for slow cookers. Quantities of liquids may need adjustment, as there is a little evaporation, but there should be enough liquid to cover the food. Many published recipes for slow cookers are designed primarily for convenience and use few ingredients, and often use prepared sauces or seasonings. The long, moist cooking is particularly suitable for tough and cheap cuts of meat including pork shoulder, beef chuck and brisket. For many slow-cooked dishes, these cuts give better results than more expensive ones. They are also often used to cook while unattended, meaning the cook can fill the pot with its ingredients and come back several hours later to a ready meal.

==Advantages==
Cheaper cuts of meat with connective tissue and lean muscle fibers are suitable for stewing, and produce tastier stews than those using expensive cuts, as long slow cooking softens connective tissue without toughening the muscle. Slow cooking leaves gelatinized tissue in the meat, so that it may be advantageous to start with a richer liquid.

The low temperature of slow-cooking makes it almost impossible to burn even food that has been cooked too long. However, some meats and most vegetables become nearly tasteless or &quot;raggy&quot; if over-cooked.

Food can be set to slow-cook before leaving for the day so it is ready on return. Many homeowners with rooftop solar panels switch to slow cooking because it draws under 1 kW of power and can therefore be powered entirely by 1–2 kW panels during the day. Some models include timers or thermostats that bring food to a given temperature and then lower it. With a timerless cooker it is possible to use an external timer to stop cooking after a set time, or both to start and stop.

Cooking the meal in a single pot reduces water waste resulting from cleaning multiple dishes, and the low cooking temperature and glazed pot make cleaning easier than conventional high-heat pots.

==Disadvantages==
Some vitamins and other trace nutrients are lost, particularly from vegetables, partially by enzyme action during cooking and partially due to heat degradation. When vegetables are cooked at higher temperatures these enzymes are rapidly denatured and have less time to act during cooking. Since slow cookers work at temperatures well below boiling point and do not rapidly denature enzymes, vegetables tend to lose trace nutrients. Blanched vegetables, having been exposed to very hot water, have already had these enzymes rendered largely ineffective, so a blanching or sauteing pre-cook stage leaves more vitamins intact. This is often a smaller nutrient loss than over-boiling and can be lessened to an extent by not removing the lid until the food is done.

Slow cookers do not provide sufficient heat to compensate for loss of moisture and heat due to frequent removal of the lid, e.g., to add and remove food in perpetual stews, (pot-au-feu, olla podrida). Added ingredients must be given time to cook before the food can be eaten.

==Hazards==
===Scalding===
Slow cookers are less dangerous than ovens or stove tops due to their lower operating temperatures and closed lids. However, they still contain a large amount of foods and liquids at temperatures close to boiling, and they can cause serious scalds if spilled.

===Poisoning concerns===
Slow cookers should not be used to cook dried kidney beans and other legume seeds. These foods contain the highly toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin, making as few as four raw beans toxic. This lectin is only deactivated by long soaking, then boiling in fresh water at for at least thirty minutes. Information published by the United States Food and Drug Administration states that slow cookers should not be used to cook bean containing dishes. Commercially canned beans are fully cooked and are safe to use. Pressure cooking also deactivates the lectins.

<doc id="596386" wikidata="Q2067361" url="?curid=596386" title="Roswell That Ends Well">
<text>&quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot; is the nineteenth episode in the third season of the American animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;, and the 51st episode of the series overall. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 2001. The plot centers on an accidental time travel event that results in the main characters participating in the Roswell Incident in 1947.

The episode was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Rich Moore. &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot; scored a Nielsen rating of 3.1 during its original broadcast, and it received acclaim from television critics, with many hailing it as one of the best episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;. It won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2002.

==Plot==
As the crew watch a supernova, Fry puts a metal pan of popcorn into the ship&#x27;s microwave oven. The radiation causes the pan to emit sparks, which interact with the particles thrown off by the supernova and send the ship back to 1947. Since GPS technology does not yet exist in this time period, the crew have no way to navigate the ship accurately and crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico. Refusing to wear a seat belt like the rest of the crew, Bender is flung through the windshield on impact and smashed to pieces. The crew and Bender&#x27;s disembodied head seek out a way to return to the 31st century, leaving Zoidberg behind to pick up the pieces. Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and taken to Roswell Air Base for experimentation. Assuming the pieces are the remnants of a flying saucer, the military &quot;reconstructs&quot; Bender&#x27;s body as such.

Meanwhile, the microwave oven needed to return to the future has been destroyed and a replacement is not yet commercially available. A microwave antenna from the army base would work as a viable alternative, but Professor Farnsworth warns that stealing it could change history. He likewise warns Fry against visiting his grandfather, Enos, who is stationed at the base, as he might kill Enos and erase his own existence. However, Farnsworth&#x27;s advice has the opposite effect; Fry becomes determined to seek out Enos and encourage him to pursue a sexual relationship with his fiancée Mildred. After several bumbling attempts to keep Enos safe (as well as discovering that Enos is a latent homosexual), Fry resorts to locking him in an abandoned house. The house turns out to be located in the middle of a nuclear weapon testing range, and Enos is killed in a bomb test.

When Fry visits Mildred to console her on Enos&#x27; death, she begins to seduce him. Realizing that his existence has not been erased, he concludes that she cannot be his grandmother. The two have sex that night and are found by the rest of the crew the following morning. Seeing that Mildred has begun to act like his grandmother, Fry panics after Farnsworth tells him that he has become his own grandfather.

With time running out, Farnsworth decides that secrecy is no longer important and the crew storm Roswell Air Base by force to get the microwave dish, throwing the entire complex into disarray. Fry and Leela rescue Zoidberg from an alien autopsy while Farnsworth grabs Bender&#x27;s body. As the ship leaves Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and triggers the microwave dish for the time jump, Bender&#x27;s head falls out and has to be left behind in 1947. Back in the 31st century, Fry laments the loss of Bender, until he realizes that his head must still be where it landed in New Mexico. The crew return to Roswell&#x27;s ruins with a metal detector and dig up the head, still intact and functioning. They attach it to Bender&#x27;s still-mangled, hovering, &quot;UFO&quot; body and return to New New York, content that their misadventures in 1947 have not changed history in any way.

==Production==
The writing team came up with the idea for this episode when they were planning the three plot lines for &quot;Anthology of Interest II&quot;. As the idea developed they eventually had so much material for it that they broke it out as a separate episode. The reason the concept was originally under consideration for the &quot;What if...&quot; scenario was that when Groening and Cohen originally created &quot;Futurama&quot; they decided there would not be any time travel; however they changed their mind and decided to go forward with the idea. The writers did not want to create a situation that would leave fans wondering why the Planet Express crew could not simply travel through time on a regular basis. For this purpose they chose to have it occur unintentionally during a supernova as that was deemed to be a suitably rare occurrence. &quot;Futurama&quot; has returned to the theme of time travel three times since; in &quot;&quot;, although the cause of time travel is different, in &quot;The Late Philip J. Fry&quot;, which involves a time machine that can only travel forwards in time – to specifically avoid creating a paradox, and in &quot;I Know What You Did Next Xmas&quot;, involving a time machine that can travel both forwards &quot;and&quot; backwards in time.

In this episode, director Rich Moore used screen position and character movement to mimic the time travel aspects of the plot. In the planning stages it was decided that actions that played to screen left would represent events from the past or a setback to the plot. Likewise, screen right indicated progress or moving past their problems.

==Cultural references==
TV critic Rob Owen perceived the episode to have touched upon many of the plot devices and themes commonly seen in time travel stories, most notably the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot; movies. The episode also shares much in common with the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Little Green Men&quot;. Bender&#x27;s head lying buried in the sand for centuries recalls the same thing happening to the android Data&#x27;s head in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;. The episode also features a digital clock resembling the ones used for the DeLorean time machine, as well as a clock resembling a cat from Back to the Future.

Much of Enos&#x27; character is taken from Gomer Pyle, such as his accent and use of Pyle&#x27;s trademark &quot;Go-oooly!&quot;, which was parodied as &quot;Gadzooks!&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
The episode won an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) category in 2002, marking &quot;Futurama&quot;″s first win in this category. Rich Moore also won an Annie Award for &quot;Directing in an Animated Television Production&quot; in 2002 and in 2006, IGN ranked the episode as the sixth best &quot;Futurama&quot; episode. In 2013, they reassessed the list and upgraded it to third best. In 2001, executive producer David X. Cohen noted that this was one of his favorite episodes of the series. &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; gave the episode an &quot;A&quot; grade and noted that it was &quot;a half hour of pure entertainment&quot;. Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an A. This episode is one of four featured in the &quot;Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection&quot;, marking it as one of Matt Groening&#x27;s favorite episodes from the series. Claudia Katz, producer of &quot;Futurama&quot;, has also stated that this is one of her three favorite episodes of the series. In 2013, it was ranked number 5 &quot;as voted on by fans&quot; for Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Futurama&quot; Fanarama marathon. Although the episode was well received by critics, it continued to do poorly in its time slot. The original airing was in 83rd place for the week with a 3.1 rating/5 share.

<text>A collider is a type of particle accelerator that brings two opposing particle beams together such that the particles collide. Compared to other particle accelerators in which the moving particles collide with a stationary matter target, colliders can achieve higher collision energies. Colliders may either be ring accelerators or linear accelerators. 

Colliders are used as a research tool in particle physics by accelerating particles to very high kinetic energy and letting them impact other particles. Analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. These may become apparent only at high energies and for extremely short periods of time, and therefore may be hard or impossible to study in other ways.

==Explanation==
In particle physics one gains knowledge about elementary particles by accelerating particles to very high kinetic energy and guiding them to colide with other particles. For sufficiently high energy, a reaction occurs that transforms the particles into other particles. Detecting these products gives insight into the physics involved.

To do such experiments there are two possible setups:

* Fixed target setup: A beam of particles (the &quot;projectiles&quot;) is accelerated with a particle accelerator, and as collision partner, one puts a stationary target into the path of the beam.
* Collider: &quot;Two&quot; beams of particles are accelerated and the beams are directed against each other, so that the particles collide while flying in opposite directions.

The collider setup is harder to construct but has the great advantage that according to special relativity the energy of an inelastic collision between two particles approaching each other with a given velocity is not just 4 times as high as in the case of one particle resting (as it would be in non-relativistic physics); it can be orders of magnitude higher if the collision velocity is near the speed of light.

In the case of a collider where the collision point is at rest in the laboratory frame (i.e. formula_1), the center of mass energy formula_2 (the energy available for producing new particles in the collision) is simply formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5 is the total energy of a particle from each beam.
For a fixed target experiment where particle 2 is at rest, formula_6.

== History ==
The first serious proposal for a collider originated with a group at the Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURA). This group proposed building two tangent radial-sector FFAG accelerator rings. Tihiro Ohkawa, one of the authors of the first paper, went on to develop a radial-sector FFAG accelerator design that could accelerate two counterrotating particle beams within a single ring of magnets. The third FFAG prototype built by the MURA group was a 50 MeV electron machine built in 1961 to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept.

Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill proposed using a single accelerator to inject particles into a pair of tangent storage rings. As in the original MURA proposal, collisions would occur in the tangent section. The benefit of storage rings is that the storage ring can accumulate a high beam flux from an injection accelerator that achieves a much lower flux.

The first electron-positron colliders were built in late 1950s-early 1960s in Italy, at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Frascati near Rome, by the Austrian-Italian physicist Bruno Touschek and in the US, by the Stanford-Princeton team that included William C.Barber, Bernard Gittelman, Gerry O’Neill, and Burton Richter. Around the same time, the &quot;VEP-1&quot; electron-electron collider was independently developed and built under supervision of Gersh Budker in the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, USSR. The first observations of particle reactions in the colliding beams were reported almost simultaneously by the three teams in mid-1964 - early 1965. 

In 1966, work began on the Intersecting Storage Rings at CERN, and in 1971, this collider was operational. The ISR was a pair of storage rings that accumulated and collided protons injected by the CERN Proton Synchrotron. This was the first hadron collider, as all of the earlier efforts had worked with electrons or with electrons and positrons.

In 1968 construction began on the highest energy proton accelerator complex at Fermilab. It was eventually upgraded to become the Tevatron collider and in October 1985 the first proton-antiproton collisions were recorded at a center of mass energy of 1.6 TeV, making it the highest energy collider in the world, at the time. The energy had later reached 1.96 TeV and at the end of the operation in 2011 the collider luminosity exceeded 430 times its original design goal. 

Since 2009, the most high-energetic collider in the world is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It currently operates at 13 TeV center of mass energy in proton-proton collisions. More than a dozen future particle collider projects of various types - circular and linear, colliding hadrons (proton-proton or ion-ion), leptons (electron-positron or muon-muon), or electrons and ions/protons - are currently under consideration for detail exploration of the Higgs/electroweak physics and discoveries at the post-LHC energy frontier.

<text>Omega is an extension of the TeX typesetting system that uses the Basic Multilingual Plane of Unicode. It was authored by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous after TeX development was frozen in 1991, primarily to enhance TeX&#x27;s multilingual typesetting abilities. It includes a new 16-bit font encoding for TeX, as well as fonts (omlgc and omah) covering a wide range of alphabets.

At the 2004 TeX Users Group conference, Plaice announced his decision to split off a new project (not yet public), while Haralambous continued to work on Omega proper.

LaTeX for Omega is invoked as &quot;lambda&quot;.

== Aleph and LuaTeX ==
Although the project seemed very promising from the beginning, the development has been slow and the functionality rather unstable. A separate project was started with the goal of stabilizing the code and extending it with e-TeX functionality, known as &quot;Aleph&quot;, and led by Giuseppe Bilotta.

The LaTeX for Aleph is known as &quot;Lamed&quot;.

Aleph alone is not being developed any more, but most of its functionality has been integrated into LuaTeX, a new project initially funded by Colorado State University (through the Oriental TeX Project by Idris Samawi Hamid) and NTG. LuaTeX started in 2006 and released the first beta version in Summer 2007. It will be a successor of both Aleph and pdfTeX, using Lua as an integrated lightweight programming language. It is developed primarily by Taco Hoekwater.

<doc id="596416" wikidata="Q10996" url="?curid=596416" title="Bushey">
<text>Bushey is a town in the Hertsmere borough of Hertfordshire in the East of England. It had a population of 25,328 in the 2011 census, rising to 28,416 in the 2021 census, an increase of 12.19%. This makes Bushey the second most populated town in Hertsmere. Bushey Heath is a large neighbourhood south east of Bushey on the boundary with the London Borough of Harrow reaching elevations of above sea level.

==Etymology==
Bushey is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the form &quot;Bissei&quot;. Although there has been some debate, modern, scholarly commentary has concluded that the name originated as a compound of the Old English words &quot;bysc&quot; (&#x27;bush, thicket&#x27;) and &quot;hæg&quot; (&#x27;enclosure&#x27;). Thus it once meant &#x27;enclosure made of bushes&#x27;.

==History==
The first written record of Bushey is its entry in the Domesday Book of 1086, which describes a small agricultural village named &#x27;Bissei&#x27; (which later became &#x27;Biss(h)e&#x27; and then &#x27;Bisheye&#x27; during the 12th century). However, chance archaeological findings of Stone Age tools provide evidence that the area was inhabited as far back as the Palaeolithic period. The town also has links to the Roman occupation of Britain, with the main road running through it being Roman; sites of possible Roman villas being unearthed in the area; and a Roman tessellated pavement was discovered near Chiltern Avenue.
Bushey Heath&#x27;s story begins in the Napoleonic Wars during a large food shortage. To help solve the problem, the government awarded the waste land to the east of Bushey to Bushey landowners to be used as farming; the land was more generally known as Bushey Common. Whilst the original aim was to produce food, being close to a railway and up to 500 ft above sea level with beautiful and broad views made the area attractive for housing developers.

The 19th and 20th centuries marked the time of most change in Bushey, especially between 1860 and 1960. The population rose 28-fold within 200 years, from 856 in 1801, to just under 24,000 today. The expansion was for many reasons, one of the main ones being due to the boom in industry caused by the railway in the early 20th century. A result was that many new jobs were created in and around Watford, and in the early 1920s, Bushey&#x27;s first council houses were built. More housing was later built for the service families working in defence organisations in Stanmore and Northwood. The expansion eventually died down because much of the land in and around Bushey was protected under the Metropolitan Green Belt after the Second World War.

This same Green Belt legislation was also partly responsible for the abandonment of the pre-war Edgware to Bushey Heath extension as part of the Northern Heights programme of the Northern line underground railway. The Metropolitan Green Belt put great restrictions on new development, and the plan had been to use the new railway to stimulate new housing around the new route; without the new housing the route was deemed no longer viable. However, as work was advanced at the onset of war, the depot was completed for use as bomber manufacture, and following the Second World War and Green Belt coming into force, it was converted into the Aldenham bus depot (of Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; fame), which it remained until 1985, when it became derelict. It was redeveloped in 1996 and is now the Centennial Park Industrial Estate (). Bushey Heath station would have been located at the intersection of Elstree Road and Northwestern Avenue (). Conceptual plans existed in the 1903 Act of Parliament for an Edgware to Watford railway that would have seen the railway extended at a later date though Bushey village and on to Watford market, but even less came of that than the partially completed Edgware to Bushey Heath stretch. In the 1830s, the London and Birmingham Railway cut through the area between London and Watford though it did not initially serve Bushey. The railway passes to the north west of the town and crosses Bushey Arches Viaduct, an original feature dating from 1837.

The highest point in the historic county of Middlesex was in Bushey Heath on the border between Hertfordshire and Middlesex at the junction of the A4140 and the A409. At above sea level, the grid reference was TQ 152937.

===Stories, legends and folklore===
The lack of farming in Bushey Heath meant that it was a heavily wooded area up to the 18th century; this, added to the lack of street lighting and police, meant that Bushey Heath&#x27;s history is full of tales of thieves, highwaymen and even murder. According to Grant Longman&#x27;s &quot;Robberies on Bushey Heath&quot;, the road from Bushey Heath to Stanmore is said to be where the highwaymen lurked, ready to raid the dozen or so caravans that passed through Bushey Heath daily, carrying money from trade in London. Before venturing through the pass, parties of travellers and merchants would form at the &quot;Boot Inn&quot; at Edgware and the &quot;Three Crowns&quot; at Bushey Heath so they did not have to venture through the pass alone. Although one of the highwaymen responsible for the attacks is rumoured to have been the notorious Dick Turpin, evidence suggests that he was in fact more active in the region of Essex.

==Governance==
Bushey has two tiers of local government, at district and county level: Hertsmere Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. There is no parish or town council in Bushey, which has been an unparished area since 1974.

Historically, Bushey was a parish in the hundred of Dacorum. Bushey was included in the Watford Poor Law Union from 1835. When the Watford Local Board of Health was established in 1850, its territory included a part of the parish of Bushey where the urban area of Watford crossed the parish boundary. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the Watford Local Board became Watford Urban District, and parishes that straddled urban district boundaries were divided. Bushey parish was therefore split with effect from 4 December 1894 into two parishes: &quot;Bushey Urban&quot; for the part of the parish within Watford Urban District and &quot;Bushey Rural&quot; for the remainder. Bushey Urban did not have its own parish council, being governed directly by Watford Urban District Council. Bushey Rural Parish Council held its first meeting on 2 January 1895 at Merry Hill School, with Edward Fithian being appointed the first chairman of the parish council. The parish of Bushey Rural was included in the Watford Rural District.

On 1 April 1906 the parish of Bushey Rural was renamed &quot;Bushey&quot; and was made an urban district, independent of the Watford Rural District. To avoid confusion, the separate parish of &quot;Bushey Urban&quot; within Watford Urban District was renamed &quot;Oxhey&quot; on the same day. The first meeting of Bushey Urban District Council was held on 16 April 1906 at Merry Hill School, with Richard Prowse being appointed the first chairman. The council built itself new offices and a fire station on Rudolph Road in Bushey, which were completed in 1909.

Bushey Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of Hertsmere on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for Bushey, and so it became an unparished area. The council&#x27;s former offices on Rudolph Road later became Bushey Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

==Modern day==
Local events include the Bushey Festival and quarter marathon, held each July, and the Horticultural Society&#x27;s flower and produce show. 

Being located near several film studios at Elstree and Borehamwood, Bushey and Bushey Heath frequently feature as backdrops for many film and TV shows. Most notable is a bus scene in the &quot;Cannon and Ball&quot; film, and in the 1957 film &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;. Several historic buildings in Bushey, notably the old Royal Masonic School for Boys, later the International University, in the Avenue, have been used in films over a long period of time, including &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot;, &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;, &quot;Children of Men&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. It has also been the set for several television comedy series, including &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;Little Britain&quot;. This site is currently being redeveloped for residential usage, with the 1960s additions to the site having been demolished.

Many of &quot;The Avengers&quot; episodes include location shots around the Bushey area, and the latter half of the &quot;Confessions of a Driving Instructor&quot; is entirely shot on the roads between Elstree and Bushey, finishing in the car dump at &#x27;Bushey Breakers&#x27;.

Pupils from local schools including Bushey Hall and Bushey Meads have taken part as extras in productions such as &quot;My Dad&#x27;s the Prime Minister&quot;.

Warren Lake, a duck pond on Bushey Heath, was restored in 1992 after falling into a poor state of repair.

==Religion==

In 2021, Jews formed a plurality of the population in Bushey Heath ward. A majority (192 of 342) of those who came under &#x27;Other&#x27; were Jains.

==Schools==
The area contains a mix of primary schools and linked infants and junior schools (see schools in Bushey).

The state secondary schools are Queens&#x27; School, Bushey Meads School and The Grange Academy, of which the first two generally do well in comparison with other schools in the county. Bushey is also the site of the famous Purcell School, a school for young musicians well known for turning out many successful musicians. It was formerly the Royal Caledonian School. There are also two private girls&#x27; schools, St. Hilda&#x27;s and St Margaret&#x27;s in the area.

==Herkomer&#x27;s Art School==

Hubert Herkomer was a poor immigrant from Bavaria, who grew up in Southampton and studied art in London before moving to Bushey in 1874. His painting and portraits earned him fame and fortune, and he died in 1914 as Sir Hubert von Herkomer RA CVO. Herkomer had visited a friend who lived in Bushey in 1873, and returned to rent a pair of cottages and a studio near Melbourne Road. He founded Herkomer&#x27;s Art School at Bushey in 1883, which, in its 21-year life, attracted some 500 students to the area, including the miniaturist Elsie Higgins. Some of those students stayed after establishing their own studios. Their paintings are on display in the Bushey Museum. A street, Herkomer Road, was named in his memory.

At around 1888, he built Lululaund (), a &#x27;Bavarian castle&#x27;, which was named after his second wife Lulu Griffiths. After being married for only a year she died. Lululaund dominated the Bushey skyline until 1939 when it was almost entirely demolished; a lot of the building was used as hardcore for Bovingdon Airfield, and much of the woodwork and carvings from the castle were burnt.

In 2014 the surviving remnant of Lululaund was converted into luxury apartments.

Sir Hubert is mainly remembered as an artist today, but in his time he was a polymath, becoming involved in some of the earliest film productions in Europe, and starting a series of races and time trials for cars in Germany.

In 1904 Herkomer closed his school and sold the building. The school was re-opened in 1905 on the same site by the artist Lucy Kemp-Welch as the Bushey School of Painting. In 1912 Herkomer bought back the school building and demolished it. A rose garden was laid out on the site to a design by T.H. Mawson. It is listed grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens.

There is a gallery named after Kemp-Welch close to the village church. It is more usually used as a village hall today, with occasional exhibitions such as one in September 2006 by students from the Chelsea College of Art.

==Film studios==

Bushey Film Studios in Melbourne Road were originally built by Hubert Herkomer and operated between 1913 and 1985. For much of its existence the studios focused on low-budget productions.

==Jewish cemeteries==
There are two Jewish cemeteries, Old and New Cemeteries, both active, serving the north-west London Jewish communities. In 2018 an extension was built to provide for 50 further years of interment covering of new landscaping and including prayer halls, offices and mortuary.

<doc id="596419" wikidata="Q248422" url="?curid=596419" title="Amphicyonidae">
<text>Amphicyonidae is an extinct family of terrestrial carnivorans belonging to the suborder Caniformia. They first appeared in North America in the middle Eocene (around 45 mya), spread to Europe by the late Eocene (35 mya), and further spread to Asia and Africa by the early Miocene (23 mya). They had largely disappeared worldwide by the late Miocene (5 mya), with the latest recorded species at the end of the Miocene in Africa. They were among the first carnivorans to evolve large body size. Amphicyonids are colloquially referred to as &quot;bear-dogs&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The family was erected by Haeckel in 1866 (also attributed to Trouessart 1885). Their exact position has long been disputed. Early paleontologists usually defined them as members of Canidae (the dog family) or Ursidae (the bear family), but the modern consensus is that they form their own family. Some researchers have defined it as the sister clade to ursids, based on morphological analysis of the ear region. However, cladistic analysis and reclassification of several species of early carnivore as amphicyonids has strongly suggested that they may be basal caniforms, a lineage older than the origin of both bears and dogs.

Amphicyonids should not be confused with the similar looking (and similarly nicknamed) &quot;dog-bears&quot;, a more derived group of caniforms that is sometimes classified as a family (Hemicyonidae), but is more often considered a primitive subfamily of ursids (Hemicyoninae). They should also not be confused with Amphicynodontidae (another family of extinct caniforms which were related to bears or pinnipeds) or Arctocyonidae (a family of &quot;condylarths&quot; which literally translates to &quot;bear-dogs&quot;).

==Description==
Amphicyonids ranged in size from as small as and as large as and evolved from wolf-like to bear-like body forms.

=== Skull ===

Amphicyonids tended to have relatively large skulls, with the snout shorter than the rear portion of the cranium. In some large members of the family, such as &quot;Amphicyon&quot;, the back of the skull develops a sharp sagittal crest which defines attachment points for large jaw muscles.

Amphicyonids had a relatively rudimentary form of auditory bulla, a bony sheath which encases the middle ear cavity. The bulla is small, mostly formed by the crescent-shaped ectotympanic bone below the middle ear. The entotympanics only make a minor contribution whenever they are ossified, which only becomes commonplace in Miocene amphicyonids. In these regards, amphicyonids are similar to living bears, otters, walruses, eared seals, and the red panda. The bulla also helps to distinguish the evolutionary trajectory of amphicyonids: early bears such as &quot;Cephalogale&quot; have large bullae which are reduced through the course of their evolution, while dogs start out with large bullae which persist through their entire existence. Amphicyonids differ from both dogs and bears in that they start with a small bulla which gradually becomes more strongly developed later in their evolution.

=== Teeth ===

Like most carnivorans, amphicyonid teeth were adapted for carnivory, with large canines near the front and shearing carnassials at the back of the jaw. Amphicyonids were typically mesocarnivorous (majority meat-eating, like dogs) or hypercarnivorous (entirely meat-eating, like cats), and some were adapted for tough abrasive food. Only two small Miocene amphicyonines, &quot;Pseudarctos&quot; and &quot;Ictiocyon&quot;, show any evidence for a hypocarnivorous (majority plant-eating) diet.

At the start of their evolution, amphicyonids retained the typical placental dental formula of , but each subfamily follows their own trend in modifying their teeth. Daphoenines, for example, have dog-like teeth, with substantial premolars and reduced second and third molars. Temnocyonines and haplocyonines take this approach even further, with massive crushing premolars akin to hyenas. Amphicyonines follow the opposite path, reducing most premolars and greatly enlarging and strengthening the carnassials and second molar. Bears also have large molars, but their teeth are modified into wide rectangular forms for grinding plant material. Amphicyonids did not pursue the same adaptations; their upper molars always maintain a roughly triangular profile for shearing and crushing meat. Thaumastocyonines were the most specialized for hypercarnivory, emphasizing massive blade-like carnassials at the expense of the rest of their postcanine teeth.

Fossils of juvenile &quot;Agnotherium&quot;, &quot;Ischyrocyon&quot;, and &quot;Magericyon&quot; all show an unusual type of tooth eruption in which there is a vulnerable stage at about two or three years of age where the subadult animal has no functional molar or carnassial teeth, the only functional cheek teeth being several milk premolars. This period is suggested to be short and would have left the animal somewhat vulnerable.

=== Postcrania ===

Many amphicyonids had cat-like bodies, with a long tail and relatively short, strong limbs suitable for stalking and pouncing on their prey. Later and larger species tended to be plantigrade or semiplantigrade, walking with most or all of the surface of the foot against the ground like bears. This was the norm for amphicyonines, thaumastocyonines, and most daphoenines. It is entirely possible that the largest amphicyonids were capable of both bear-style hunting (chasing down and mauling their prey with teeth and claws) and cat-style hunting (a quick ambush where the prey is killed with a bite to the neck).

Many amphicyonid lineages instead adopted a digitigrade posture and locomotion (walking on their toes) and long legs specialized for running with a primarily front-to-back arc of movement. These cursorial wolf- or hyena-like forms included temnocyonines, haplocyonines, and some species of the large daphoenine &quot;Daphoenodon&quot;.

==Evolution==
It has long been uncertain where amphicyonids originated. It was thought that they may have crossed from Europe to North America during the Miocene epoch, but recent research suggests a possible North American origin from the miacids &quot;Miacis cognitus&quot; and &quot;M. australis&quot; (now renamed as the genera &quot;Gustafsonia&quot; and &quot;Angelarctocyon&quot;, respectively). As these are of North American origin, but appear to be early amphicyonids, it may be that the Amphicyonidae actually originates in North America.

Other New World amphicyonids include the oldest known amphicyonid, &quot;Daphoenus&quot; (37–16 Mya).

Amphicyonids began to decline in the late Miocene, and disappeared by the end of the epoch. The exact reasons for this are unclear. The most recent known amphicyonid remains are teeth known from the Dhok Pathan horizon, northern Pakistan, dating to 7.4-5.3 mya. The species is classically named &quot;Arctamphicyon lydekkeri&quot;, which may actually be synonymous with a species of &quot;Amphicyon&quot;.

== Ecology ==
Amphicyonids are suggested to have ranged in ecology from omnivores to hypercarnivores, with some amphicyonids suggested to have engaged in bone-crushing like some modern hyenas. At least some amphicyonids are suggested to have been solitary hunters.

<text>[[California]] State Disability Insurance (SDI or CASDI) is a statutory (state-regulated and state-audited) state disability program of the State of California for short-term disability income replacement. The program has been in effect since 1946.

==Costs==
The costs of the program are covered by contributions to the State Fund in the form of SDI tax paid by employees, optionally by employers. Employee contributions to the state fund are deductible as state taxes.
The table below summarizes the contribution rates, taxable wage limits and maximum withholdings per employee since 1996:

==Benefits==
The plan provides up to one year of tax-free benefits equal to 55% of the recipient&#x27;s average gross (pre-tax) income in their highest earning base period quarter. The minimum benefit is $50 per week, and the maximum benefit is updated each year. The &quot;base period&quot; for determining benefits is defined as 12 months divided into four consecutive quarters, excluding the quarter immediately prior - i.e., the lookback period is ~17 months pre-disability up to ~5 months pre-disability. For example, assuming the recipient&#x27;s highest quarterly earnings were $3,900, dividing by 13 weeks gives an average pay rate of $300 per week. At 55% of this, the benefit amount would be $165 per week.

For 2018–2021, the benefit was changed to 60% of regular weekly salary if earning above $23,972 annually and 70% of regular weekly salary if earning less than that.

Maximum weekly benefit 
SDI is deductible on federal returns (Schedule A) because it is considered a state income tax.

==Family Temporary Disability Insurance==
In 2002, California enacted the Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance program, also known as the Family Temporary Disability Insurance (FTDI) program, which extends unemployment disability compensation to cover individuals who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or bond with a new child.

<text>Skejby is a neighbourhood and former village in Aarhus, Denmark. The neighbourhood is part of the city district Aarhus N.

The Skejby village was originally situated in the countryside north of Aarhus, overlooking the broad flat Egå Valley, but urban development has engulfed it, creating a new suburban neighbourhood by the same name. The old village is still distinctly visible, surrounding the old white village church. Archaeological excavations have revealed, that Skejby has been settled since the early Iron Ages (c. 500 BC), but finds from the Stone Age has also been unearthed. Søften and Lisbjerg north of Skejby, are important archaeological sites.

== The neighbourhood ==
The Skejby neighbourhood comprise a large business park, an industrial park, a regional hospital, and several major institutions for education and business. Residential areas forms a large part of Skejby east of the expressway of Randersvej, while the old village is the only residential area west of the expressway, with the exception of a few new apartment blocks near nature site Vestereng.

Business Park Skejby stretches south from the village of Skejby towards Aarhus and continues into the neighbourhood of Christiansbjerg. In Skejby, it contains the Agro Food Park, with a focus on agriculture and foodstuff, and offices and business headquarters for companies such as Vestas, Rambøll, IBM, TDC Hosting and NRGi. The headquarters of INCUBA Science Park, the educational institution of Professionshøjskolen VIA University College is also located here.

The New University Hospital (DNU) was built in Skejby in the years 2012-2018 and is absorbing all other hospital departments across Aarhus, to be fully functional in 2020. The new hospital complex includes a psychiatric department and the only emergency and trauma center in Aarhus.

East of the expressway of Randersvej, in a low-rise residential area, is the mall of Skejby Centret and the headquarters of the television company department TV 2/Østjylland. North of here is a lightweight industrial park stretching eastward into the neighbourhood of Vejlby. The industrial park comprise large store departments of ILVA, IKEA and Silvan Byggemarked, and a number of mixed industries, offices and warehouse facilities. The woodland of Mollerup Skov in the east, connects with the nature site of Egå Engsø.

== Aarhus light rail ==
The first leg of Aarhus light rail was inaugurated in December 2017 and connects the inner city to Skejby, continuing north to Lisbjerg. There is a station at the new AU Hospital.

<text>Fred and Al Key were brothers who performed barnstorming events and other activities during the early 20th century. They are best known for their flight endurance record, which they cemented at twenty-seven days. They also invented a valve for aerial refueling that became the industry standard for the United States military.

==Early history and record attempt==
Brothers Fred and Al Key became interested in aviation after World War I. They started doing some barnstorming in the 1920s and continued their interest as the managers of the Meridian Municipal Airport, in Meridian, Mississippi.

With the onset of the Great Depression, the city of Meridian began doing whatever it could to save money. The airport was considered unnecessary, given the economic conditions, and was slated to be closed.

The Key brothers had no desire to see this happen, so they came up with a plan to draw attention to Meridian and its airport by breaking the standing flight endurance record of 23 days. At that time, air-to-air refueling was a dangerous affair. If gasoline was spilled, which often happened, it could be ignited by the hot engine exhaust.

To solve this problem, the Key brothers, along with local inventor and mechanic A. D. Hunter, invented a spill-free fueling system that consisted of a valve on the end of the fuel nozzle which was opened by a probe in the neck of the fuel tank. The valve would not allow fuel to flow unless it was inserted into the fuel tank. During fueling, if the nozzle was removed from the tank, the fuel would automatically stop flowing. This nozzle was later adopted by the US Army Air Corps, and is still in use today with some modifications.

Refueling the plane wasn&#x27;t their only concern. The engine needed regular maintenance during the flight in order to stay in good running order. To facilitate this, a catwalk was built so that Fred could walk out and work on the plane while it was airborne.

On June 4, 1935, The Flying Keys, as the brothers later became known, lifted off in a borrowed Curtiss Robin monoplane named &quot;Ole Miss&quot; from Meridian, Mississippi&#x27;s airport. For the next twenty-seven days, they flew over the Meridian vicinity. Several times each day, the crew of a similar plane would lower food and supplies to the brothers on the end of a rope, as well as supply fuel via a long flexible tube. They landed on July 1 after traveling an estimated 52,320 miles and used more than 6,000 gallons of gasoline.

Their non-stop endurance flight lasted 653 hours, 34 minutes. The &quot;Ole Miss&quot; is permanently displayed in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

After this historic flight, Meridian&#x27;s public airport was renamed &quot;Key Field&quot; in the brothers&#x27; honor.

According to Owen, the brothers&#x27; flight boosted confidence in aviation nationally. People figured if the Key brothers made their flight safely in such a small plane, then the big commercial airplanes were definitely safe.

==World War II==
The Key brothers both served as bomber pilots during World War II. 
Fred was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (USA).

Al was the commanding officer of the 66th Squadron (part of the 44th Bombardment Group) flying Consolidated B-24 Liberators from England. By the time he was taken off combat missions in 1943 he had earned a Distinguished Flying Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, an Air Medal, a Distinguished Service Cross from the British and seven Bronze Stars for participating in combat.

==Postwar activities==
Al remained in the Air Force until his retirement in 1960 at the rank of full Colonel, after which he was elected mayor of Meridian in 1965 and 1969; he was unseated in 1973 by a Republican, Tom Stuart.

Fred Key ran the Key Brothers Flying Service at Key Field until his death in 1971. The cutoff valve developed for the Keys by A.D. Hunter was an important innovation for national defense, being the precursor of those used by modern tanker airplanes, such as the KC-135 Stratotanker, that keep bombers and fighter aircraft in the air. Today, with only slight modifications, U.S. Air Force and Strategic Air Command airplanes use the valve that Hunter invented.

<text>State disability insurance is a type of insurance for workers who are ill, unable or injured. It partially replaces wages in the event a worker is unable to perform their work due to a disability. 
In some states, there are many types of organisations that provide different disability insurance. These organisations have specific definitions regarding what is a disability and how a person should qualify in order to receive the benefit.

==State disability insurance in the United States==
State disability insurance is provided in many states and in one commonwealth in United States. Disability insurance (also known as state disability insurance, statutory disability programs or state disability benefits) is a kind of insurance, which is funded by mandatory contribution of employees.

Employees can lower the tax they have to pay to their state, by the fact that their contributions are tax-deductible.

There is a difference between the states in details of the state disability insurance and tax-deductive.

===Statutory disability insurance in New York State===
In New York State, there is a disability benefits insurance, that provides temporary cash benefits paid to an eligible wage earner to partially replace wages lost, whether the wage earner is disabled by an off-the-job illness or injury or for disabilities arising from pregnancy.

====Who is required to provide state disability benefits insurance according to New York State disability insurance====
Each employer, who hires one and more employees on each of 30 days in any calendar year, is required to provide state disability benefits insurance for their employees. These employees have to provide it unless they are considered exempt.

====Among those employees, who are not considered exempt belongs====
* Each employer of one or more employees on each of 30 days in any calendar year becomes a &quot;covered&quot; employer four weeks after the 30th day of such employment.
* Employees or recent employees of a &quot;covered&quot; employer, who have worked at least four consecutive weeks.
* Employees of an employer who elects to provide benefits by filing an Application for Voluntary Coverage.
* Employees who change jobs from one &quot;covered&quot; employer to another &quot;covered&quot; employer are protected from the first day on the new job. Generally, an eligible employee does not lose protection during the first 26 weeks of unemployment, provided he/she is eligible for and is claiming unemployment insurance benefits.
* Domestic or personal employees who work 40 or more hours per week for one employer.

====Among those employees, who are considered exempt belongs====
* A minor child of the employer.
* Government, railroad, maritime or farm laborers.
* Ministers, priests, rabbis, members of religious orders, sextons, Christian Science readers.
* Individuals that volunteer their services for nonprofit organizations and receive no compensation. Compensation includes stipends, room and board, and other &quot;perks&quot; that have monetary value. (Stipends used solely to offset expenses incurred while performing activities for the nonprofit are not counted as stipends.)
* An executive officer of an incorporated religious, charitable or educational institution, and persons engaged in a professional or teaching capacity in or for a religious, charitable, or educational institution (Section 501(c)(3) under the IRS tax code), and persons receiving rehabilitation services in a sheltered workshop operated by such institutions under a certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Labor.
* Persons receiving aid from a religious or charitable institution, who perform work in return for such aid.
* One or two corporate officers who either singly or jointly own all of the stock and hold all of the offices of a corporation that employs no other employees.
* Golf caddies.
* Daytime students in elementary or secondary school, who work part-time during the school year or their regular vacation period.
* Employees who change to jobs in an exempt employment or with a &quot;non-covered&quot; employer, and work in such employment for more than four weeks, lose protection until they work four consecutive weeks for a &quot;covered&quot; employer.

==Statutory disability insurance in the United Kingdom==
In the UK, people can apply for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) if they are under 16. If they are above 16, they can apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

===Disability Living Allowance (DLA)===
DLA is made up of two parts: the care component and the mobility component. The person can get DLA if they are eligible for at least one of the components.

The person is eligible for the care component if they cannot do everyday tasks (e.g. washing, dressing, eating, using the toilet etc.) and there is no one who can care for them or if they live alone. There are three levels: lowest (for occasional help), middle (for frequent help or constant supervision), and highest (for nonstop supervision).

The person is eligible for the mobility component if they have a walking disability, have no legs, are blind, are at least 80% deaf, have behavioural problems or need walking supervision. There are two levels: lower (for guidance or supervision outdoors) and higher (for more severe walking difficulties).

===Personal Independence Payment (PIP)===
Personal Independence Payment helps the person financially, if they have a chronic illness or if they are disabled. They receive between £23.20 and £148.85 per week if they are 16 or older and have not reached State Pension age.

==State disability insurance in the Czech Republic==
In the Czech Republic, prior to 2010, disabled people were divided into two categories based on the seriousness of their disability.
These two categories were partial invalidity and full invalidity.

Since 2010, there is just one category of benefits, the invalidity pension, which is divided into three degrees corresponding with the severity of the person&#x27;s disability. The severity is measured by how disruptive the disability is.

An invalid pension cannot be collected along with an old-age pension.

Degrees of disability:

* 35–49%: first degree disability
* 50–69%: second degree disability
* 70–100%: third degree disability

===Conditions for reaching the invalidity pension===
* They have any of the three disability degrees, which are mentioned above.
* They are under 65.
* They do not comply with the conditions for the purpose of obtaining a standard old-age pension.
* They have previously completed the stipulated periods of pension insurance.

The lowest amount of money they can receive in any degree of disability is CZK 770.00 (€30) per month. The base amount is CZK 2,700.00 (€105) per month. It is a fixed portion of an invalidity pension.

Eligibility for an invalidity pension is based on a required term of insurance based on: the applicant&#x27;s age required term of insurance:

* Under 20: less than one year
* 20–22: one year
* 22–24: two years
* 24–26: three years
* 26–28: four years
* Over 28: five years
* Over 38: ten years

For instance, if the person was born in 1953, their disability was recognized in 2014 and they are insured for 44 years, they get from the State Invalidity pension of CZK 13,262.00 (€516) per month.

<text>Mr. Tumnus is a faun in The Chronicles of Narnia books written by C. S. Lewis, primarily in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; but also briefly in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. He is the first creature Lucy Pevensie meets in Narnia and becomes her first friend in the kingdom. Lewis wrote that the first Narnia story, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. Tumnus thus became the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.

==Description==
Lewis describes Tumnus as having reddish skin, curly hair, brown eyes, a short pointed beard, horns on his forehead, cloven hooves, goat legs with glossy black hair, a &quot;strange but pleasant little face,&quot; a long tail, and being &quot;only a little taller than Lucy herself.&quot;

Tumnus first appears when Lucy arrives in Narnia at the lamp post. He invites her back to his cave for tea, during which, they talk about Narnia, including its glorious past which gave way to endless winter. Tumnus plays an evocative tune on his flute, but when Lucy says that she has to go, he bursts into tears. He confesses that he is in the pay of the White Witch (Jadis), who rules Narnia and has made it always winter but never Christmas. She had ordered him and the other Narnians to hand over any Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve - humans - should they ever encounter any in Narnia. Tumnus, despite fearing that the Witch will find out and is likely to punish him severely if he disobeys her orders, quickly realises that he cannot bring himself to give up Lucy to the Witch, so he guides her back to the lamp-post to see that she returns safely to her own world.

When Lucy returns to Narnia a few days later, Tumnus is still safe: evidently the White Witch has not discovered his disobedience. However, Lucy&#x27;s brother Edmund has also entered Narnia and mentions to the White Witch that his sister had visited Narnia before and met a faun - even though he does not name the faun as Tumnus.

When Lucy and her siblings subsequently come to Narnia some time afterwards, they find that Tumnus has been arrested by Maugrim, Chief of the White Witch&#x27;s secret police, and is awaiting trial on a charge of high treason which involves harbouring spies and fraternizing with humans. Tumnus had spoken to Mr Beaver of his fears not long before his arrest and asked him to guide the four children if he found them in Narnia. The children meet Mr Beaver just after leaving Tumnus&#x27;s ransacked cave.

Later in the story, when the winter has come to an end and Aslan is preparing an army to take on the White Witch, Lucy and Susan find Tumnus petrified as a statue in the Witch&#x27;s castle, and he is restored by Aslan. He follows the other Narnians to the battle as the Witch is defeated and killed.

Years later, he is the one who tells the Kings and Queens that the White Stag has been spotted near his home. Their hunt for it leads to their disappearance from Narnia and the end of the Golden Age.

In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, Tumnus appears as a royal adviser to the four Pevensie monarchs (fourteen years later, according to Lewis&#x27;s Narnian Timeline). He devises a plan for escaping from Calormen, thereby saving Queen Susan from being forcibly married to Prince Rabadash, and the other Narnians, including her brother Edmund, from certain death trying to defend her.

He and Lucy eventually meet again in Aslan&#x27;s Country in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

==Portrayals==

*In the 1979 animated film, Mr. Tumnus is voiced by Leslie Phillips (UK version) and Victor Spinetti (US version)

<text>Éric Dazé (born July 2, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger who played for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League for eleven seasons from 1995 to 2005.

==Playing career==
Eric Daze began his career playing midget with Laval in Quebec AAA Midget Hockey League. In the 1992–93, he joined the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) before being traded to the Beauport Harfangs late in the season. Despite starring for Beauport, and a strong junior career (finishing with 261 points in 191 games), Daze&#x27;s value amongst NHL scouts dropped sharply due to his unwillingness to play a rough game, despite possessing the abilities for it.

Daze was drafted in the fourth round, 90th overall, in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks (with the draft pick the Blackhawks received with Stephane Beauregard for Dominik Hasek). He had early success and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in 1996 after scoring 30 goals as a rookie. He scored at least 20 goals in each season between 1996 and 2003, even when struggling with injuries, and was named to the NHL All-Star Game in 2002. Daze who was appearing in his first All-Star Game, was named game MVP (two goals/one assist), becoming the first Blackhawk player to win the award since Bobby Hull in 1971. He often polarized Chicago fans because he showed a reluctance to involve himself in the physical (hitting) aspect of the game despite his prototypical power forward build. Instead he displayed a combination of size and good scoring ability, especially during key, or clutch, moments of the game. He possessed a quick wrist shot and an excellence with one-timers.

Daze ran into severe back problems during his career, which limited him to only 19 games in the 2003–04 NHL season. Even after three herniated disc surgeries in a five-year span, pain was still a problem in Daze&#x27;s back when he attempted to return to the Blackhawks in 2005. He quietly left professional hockey after appearing in only the season opener that year. On March 20, 2010, Daze officially announced his retirement on the Comcast Sportsnet pregame show before the Blackhawks game.

==Personal life==
Daze is married to Guylaine, whom he met during his high school years. The couple have two children and the family resides in Hinsdale, Illinois.

<text>Tangibility is the property of being able to be perceived by touch. A commonplace understanding of &quot;tangibility&quot; renders it as an attribute allowing something to be perceptible to the senses.

In criminal law, one of the elements of an offense of larceny is that the stolen property must be tangible.

In the context of intellectual property, expression in tangible form is one of the requirements for copyright protection.

In the context of international tax law, article 5(1) of the OECD Model Tax Treaty requires to date a permanent establishment to consist of a &quot;tangible&quot; place of business. This is problematic concerning the taxation of the Digital Economy.

In the context of trade, &quot;tangibles&quot; are physical goods (as opposed to &quot;intangible&quot; services and software).

<doc id="596465" wikidata="Q154059" url="?curid=596465" title="Horst-Wessel-Lied">
<text>The &quot;&#x27;&quot; (), also known by its incipit &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;The Flag Raised High&#x27;), was the anthem of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from 1930 to 1945. From 1933 to 1945, the Nazis made it the co-national anthem of Germany, along with the first stanza of the &quot;&quot;.

The &quot;&quot; has been banned in Germany and Austria since the end of World War II unless for artistic or educational purposes.

==History==
The lyrics to &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; were written in 1929 by &quot;Sturmführer&quot; Horst Wessel, the commander of the Nazi paramilitary &quot;Brownshirts&quot; (&quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; or &quot;SA&quot;) in the Friedrichshain district of Berlin. Wessel wrote songs for the SA in conscious imitation of the Communist paramilitary, the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League, to provoke them into attacking his troops, and to keep up the spirits of his men.

===Horst Wessel===
Wessel was the son of a pastor and educated at degree level, but was employed as a construction worker. He became notorious among the Communists when he led a number of SA attacks into the Fischerkiez, an extremely poor Berlin district, which he did on orders from Joseph Goebbels, who was then the Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (regional party leader) of Berlin. Several of these incursions were only minor altercations, but one took place outside the tavern which the local German Communist Party (KPD) used as its headquarters. As a result of that melee, five Communists were injured, four of them seriously. Communist newspapers accused the police of letting the Nazis get away while arresting the injured Communists, while Nazi newspapers claimed that Wessel had been trying to give a speech when Communists emerged and started the fight. Wessel&#x27;s face was printed together with his address on Communist street posters. The slogan of the KPD and the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League became &quot;strike the fascists wherever you find them.&quot;

Wessel moved with his partner Erna Jänicke into a room on Große Frankfurter Straße. The landlady was the widowed Mrs. Salm, whose husband had been a Communist. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent. Salm requested Wessel&#x27;s partner to leave but Jänicke refused. Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help. Shortly thereafter on 14 January 1930, Wessel was shot and seriously wounded by two Communist Party members, one of whom was Albrecht &quot;Ali&quot; Höhler. Wessel died in hospital on 23 February from blood poisoning, which he contracted during his hospitalisation. Höhler was tried in court and sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment for the shooting. After the Nazi accession to national power, he was taken out of prison under false pretenses by the SA in September 1933 and shot dead.

===Nazi Party anthem===
Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and owner and editor of the newspaper &quot;Der Angriff&quot; (The Attack), had made several attempts to create Nazi martyrs for propaganda purposes, the first being an SA man named Hans-Georg Kütemeyer, whose body was pulled out of a canal the morning after he attended a speech by Hitler at the Sportpalast. Goebbels attempted to spin this into an assassination by Communists, but the overwhelming evidence showed it to have been suicide, and he had to drop the matter. Thus, Goebbels put considerable effort into mythologizing Wessel&#x27;s story, even as the man lay dying. He met with Wessel&#x27;s mother, who told him her son&#x27;s life story, his hope for a &quot;better world&quot;, and his attempt to rescue a prostitute he had met on the street. Goebbels saw Wessel as an &quot;idealistic dreamer&quot;.

Wessel himself had undergone an operation at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital which stopped his internal bleeding, but the surgeons had been unable to remove the bullet in his cerebellum. Wessel was brought to his mother&#x27;s home to die. In his diary, Goebbels described Wessel&#x27;s entire face as being shot up and his features distorted, and claimed that Wessel told him &quot;One has to keep going! I&#x27;m happy!&quot; After a period where his condition stabilized, Wessel died on 23 February.

Goebbels consulted Hermann Göring and others in the party on how to respond to Wessel&#x27;s death. They declared a period of mourning until 12 March, during which party and SA members would avoid amusements and Wessel&#x27;s name would be invoked at all party meetings. Wessel&#x27;s unit was renamed the Horst Wessel Storm Unit 5.

From a mashup of fact and fiction, Goebbels&#x27; propaganda created what became one of the Nazi Party&#x27;s central martyr-figures of their movement. He officially declared Wessel&#x27;s march, renamed as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;), to be the Nazi Party anthem, which aided in promoting Wessel as the first of many in the Nazi cult of martyrdom. Wessel was buried on 1 March 1930. Contrary to Nazi claims, there were no attacks on the funeral procession. His funeral was filmed and turned into a major propaganda event by the NSDAP. The &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; was sung by the SA at the funeral, and was thereafter extensively used at party functions, as well as sung by the SA during street parades.

According to Austrian historian Oliver Rathkolb, the song was created as a counterweight to the socialist song &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

===Co-national anthem===
When Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; became a national symbol by law on 19 May 1933. The following year, a regulation required the right arm be extended and raised in the &quot;Nazi salute&quot; when the (identical) first and fourth verses were sung. Nazi leaders can be seen singing the song at the finale of Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;Triumph of the Will.&quot; Hitler also mandated the tempo at which the song had to be played. After Hitler&#x27;s public speeches, he would exit during the playing of both the national anthem and then the Horst Wessel Song.

Some Nazis were extremely sensitive about the uses to which the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; was put. For instance, a bandleader who wrote a jazz version of the song was forced to leave Germany, and when Martha Dodd, the daughter of William E. Dodd, at the time the US ambassador to Germany, played a recording of an unusual arrangement of the song at her birthday party at the Ambassador&#x27;s residence in 1933, a young Nazi who was a liaison between the German Foreign Ministry and Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery, turned off the record player, announcing &quot;This is not the sort of music to be played for mixed gatherings and in a flippant manner.&quot; The song was played in some Protestant places of worship, as some elements of the Protestant Church in Germany had accepted the Horst Wessel cult, built as it was by Goebbels on the model of Christian martyrs of the past.

===Post-World War II===
With the end of the Nazi regime in May 1945, the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; was banned. The lyrics and tune are now illegal in Germany, with some limited exceptions. In early 2011, this resulted in a Lower Saxony State Police investigation of Amazon.com and Apple Inc. for offering the song for sale on their websites. Both Apple and Amazon complied with the government&#x27;s request, and deleted the song from their offerings.

A special marine commando unit within the Chilean Navy uses the same melody as the Horst-Wessel-Lied with different lyrics called &quot;Himno de la Agrupación de Comandos IM no. 51&quot;.

== Lyrics ==
The words to the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; were published in September 1929 in the Nazi Party&#x27;s Berlin newspaper, &quot;Der Angriff&quot; (&#x27;The Attack&#x27;) which Joseph Goebbels owned and ran.

The &quot;Rotfront&quot;, or &quot;Red Front&quot;, was the &quot;Rotfrontkämpferbund&quot;, the paramilitary organization of the Communist Party of Germany. The Nazi SA, also known as the &quot;brown shirts&quot; and the Communist Red Front fought each other in violent street confrontations, which grew into almost open warfare after 1930. The &quot;reactionaries&quot; were the conservative political parties and the liberal democratic German government of the Weimar Republic period, which made several unsuccessful attempts to suppress the SA. The &quot;time of bondage&quot; refers to the period after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, in which the victorious powers imposed huge reparations on Germany, stripped her of her colonies in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Ocean, some of which became League of Nations mandates, gave parts of Germany to Belgium, Denmark, France, Poland, and Lithuania, and occupied the Rhineland.

The line is technically ambiguous. It could either mean &quot;Kameraden, die von Rotfront und Reaktion erschossen wurden&quot; (&quot;Our comrades who were shot dead by the Red Front and Reactionaries&quot;) or &quot;Kameraden, welche die Erschießung von Rotfront und Reaktion durchführten&quot; (&quot;Our comrades who have shot the Red Front and Reactionaries dead&quot;). In spite of this obvious syntactic problem, which was mentioned by Victor Klemperer in his &quot;LTI – Lingua Tertii Imperii&quot;, the line was never changed. The following line (March in spirit within our ranks) however indicates that the aforementioned comrades are deceased, advocating the first interpretation.

Some changes were made to the lyrics after Wessel&#x27;s death:

After Wessel&#x27;s death, new stanzas were added, composed in his honour. These were frequently sung by the SA but did not become part of the official lyrics used on party or state occasions.

==Melody==
After Wessel&#x27;s death, he was officially credited with having composed the music as well as having written the lyrics for the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;. Between 1930 and 1933, however, German critics disputed this, pointing out that the melody had a long history. &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; is a well-known hymn of Swedish origin with a similar tune for example. Criticism of Horst Wessel as author became taboo after 1933, when the Nazi Party took control of Germany and criticism would likely be met with severe punishment.

The most likely immediate source for the melody was a song popular in the Imperial German Navy during World War I, which Wessel would no doubt have heard being sung by World War I veterans in the Berlin of the 1920s. The song was known either by its opening line as or as the &quot;&quot;, after the German cruiser , which is mentioned in one version of the song&#x27;s lyrics. The opening stanza of the song is:

In 1936, the German music critic Alfred Weidemann published an article, in which he identified the melody of a song composed in 1865 by Peter Cornelius as the &quot;Urmelodie&quot; (source-melody). According to Weidemann, Cornelius described the tune as a &quot;Viennese folk tune&quot;. This appeared to him to be the ultimate origin of the melody of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;.

==Far-right use outside Germany==
During the 1930s and 1940s, the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; was adapted by fascist groups in other European countries.

===British Union of Fascists===

One of the marching songs of the British Union of Fascists, known as &quot;The Marching Song&quot; or &quot;Comrades, the Voices&quot; was set to the same tune, and its lyrics were to some extent modelled on the song, though appealing to British Fascism. Instead of referring to martyrs of the party, it identifies Britain&#x27;s war dead as those marching in spirit against the &quot;red front and massed ranks of reaction&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;Comrades, the voices of the dead battalions,
Of those who fell, that Britain might be great,
𝄆 Join in our song, for they still march in spirit with us,
And urge us on to gain the fascist state! 𝄇

We&#x27;re of their blood, And spirit of their spirit,
Sprung from that soil, for whose dear sake they bled,
𝄆 Against vested powers, Red Front, and massed ranks of reaction,
We lead the fight for freedom and for bread! 𝄇

The streets are still, the final struggle&#x27;s ended;
Flushed with the fight, we proudly hail the dawn!
𝄆 See, over all the streets, the fascist banners waving,
Triumphant standards of our race reborn! 𝄇&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Croatian Fascists ===
In modern Croatia, members of various far-right movements consider the adaptation written by Jan Zadravec, called &quot;Hrvatski Stijeg&quot; (The Croatian Banner), to be their unofficial anthem.

===Empire of Japan===
===Falange fascist movement===
In Spain, the Falange fascist movement sang &quot;Camisa azul&quot; to the same tune:

(Note that this was a traditional Falange march, not a march of the original Falange. It was sung by some of the volunteers of the 250th division, the División Azul, after the death of José Antonio Primo de Rivera.)

===Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism===
In Vichy France the members of the Légion des volontaires français sang:

===Golden Dawn===
In modern Greece, Golden Dawn, an extreme right-wing party, uses the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; with Greek lyrics in its gatherings or events such as the occasional public distribution of food &quot;to Greeks only&quot;, while its leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, often uses the song&#x27;s key stanzas (e.g. &quot;The flags on high!&quot;) in his speeches.

The lyrics of their version are:

===All-Russian Fascist Organisation===

The All-Russian Fascist Organisation, founded in 1933, largely consisted of émigrés of the White Movement. It was led by Anastasy Vonsiatsky and was based in Connecticut, USA. The organisation dissolved after the United States entered World War II. Vonsyatsky was arrested for violating the 1917 Espionage Act.

The lyrics of their version are:

===Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement===
The fascist Lapua Movement and its successor Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement of Finland sang a song to the tune of Horst Wessel Lied, translated by Otto Al’Antila:
==Parodies==
Before 1933, the German Communists and the Social Democrats sang parodies of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; during their street battles with the SA. Some versions simply changed the political character of the song:

&quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, or &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;, was a nationalist veterans&#x27; organisation closely aligned with the German National People&#x27;s Party.

The Communist Party of Germany substituted completely new lyrics:
Ernst Thälmann was the KPD leader.

These versions were banned once the Nazis came to power and the Communist and Social Democratic parties prohibited. However, during the years of the Third Reich the song was parodied in underground versions, poking fun at the corruption of the Nazi elite. There are similarities between different texts as underground authors developed them with variations. Below are several versions.

Wilhelm Frick was the Interior Minister, Baldur von Schirach was the Hitler Youth leader and Heinrich Himmler was head of the SS and police.

Another version was:
In the first year of Nazi rule radical elements of the SA sang their own parody of the song, reflecting their disappointment that the socialist element of National Socialism had not been realised:

Kurt Schmitt was Economics Minister between 1933 and 1935.

One of the best-known parodies was included in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Schweik in the Second World War&quot; (1943). Hanns Eisler composed a score for the &quot;Kälbermarsch&quot; (Calves&#x27; March):

The German post-punk and gothic rock band Xmal Deutschland released a version of the &quot;Kälbermarsch&quot; in 1981 on the compilation &quot;Lieber Zuviel Als Zuwenig (ZickZack Sommerhits 81)&quot; on the Hamburg label Zickzack Records. 
After Nazi Germany&#x27;s capitulation on 8 May 1945, which ended World War II, as well as Germany&#x27;s occupation of Eastern Europe, Germany was divided into four occupation zones (British, French, US-American and Soviet). In the Soviet zone, a version of &#x27;Die Preise hoch&#x27; became popular, targeting Communist functionaries:

A French parody was written by humorist Pierre Dac, &quot;Chant des Waffen SS&quot; &quot;(Song of the Waffen SS)&quot;. The lyrics are from the perspective of a French collaborator, singing about how proud he is to now serve Nazi Germany.

The most notable English-language parody was written by Oliver Wallace to a similar melody and titled &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; for the 1942 Donald Duck cartoon of the same name. It was the first hit record for Spike Jones. The opening lyrics give the flavor of the song:

&lt;poem&gt;When der Fuehrer says we is de master race
We &quot;Heil!&quot; (pffft), &quot;Heil!&quot; (pffft) right in der Fuehrer&#x27;s face
Not to love der Fuehrer is a great disgrace
So we &quot;Heil!&quot; (pffft), &quot;Heil!&quot; (pffft) right in der Fuehrer&#x27;s face&lt;/poem&gt;

Each &quot;Heil!&quot; is followed by a Bronx cheer.

==In popular culture==
*In 2015, The New York Youth Symphony abruptly canceled a Carnegie Hall performance of &quot;Marsh u Nebuttya&quot; (Ukrainian: &quot;March to Oblivion&quot;), a 9-minute piece composed by Estonian-born Jonas Tarm, a 21-year-old junior at the New England Conservatory of Music, after it discovered that a piece it had commissioned included a 45-second musical quote of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;. The composer would not explain his purpose in using the song in his piece, saying &quot;[I]t can speak for itself&quot;, but the orchestra said that the usage was not appropriate.
*German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s electronic and concrete work titled, &quot;Hymnen&quot; includes a sample recording of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;. It premiered in Cologne, Germany, on 30 November 1967. It was also performed in New York&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall) and London&#x27;s English Bach Festival among other international performances.
*The tune is used in Lukas Foss&#x27; &quot;Elegy for Anne Frank&quot; (1989) as a contorted march about three-quarters of the way through the work. This leads to an abrupt silence after which the earlier theme returns.
*The neofolk band Death in June released a recording of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; under the name &quot;Brown Book&quot; on their 1987 album of the same name.
*The title theme for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; has a rendition of the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, recomposed by Bobby Prince and released for DOS on 5 May 1992.
*In &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, the song is played from radios in several locations in the game. The radios can be destroyed to stop the song playing.
*In 2003, a high school marching band from Paris, Texas, played the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; while waving a Nazi flag at a football match at Hillcrest High School in Dallas. The performance coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. The performance, which was meant to symbolize the history of World War II and also included musical selections and flags from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, was greeted with boos from the audience which threw objects at the band. The school superintendent apologized to the Dallas school district and removed the flag from future performances of the composition.
*The song was featured in a scene of the 1993 TV miniseries &quot;&quot; during which the future president was in a bar in Nazi Germany.

<doc id="596473" wikidata="Q1417847" url="?curid=596473" title="Long Depression">
<text>The Long Depression was a worldwide price and economic recession, beginning in 1873 and running either through March 1879, or 1899, depending on the metrics used. It was most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. The episode was labeled the &quot;Great Depression&quot; at the time, and it held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though it marked a period of general deflation and a general contraction, it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the later Great Depression.

The United Kingdom was the hardest hit; during this period it lost some of its large industrial lead over the economies of continental Europe. While it was occurring, the view was prominent that the British economy had been in continuous depression from 1873 to as late as 1896 and some texts refer to the period as the Great Depression of 1873–1896, with financial and manufacturing losses reinforced by a long recession in the agricultural sector.
In the United States, historians refer to the Depression of 1873–1879, kicked off by the Panic of 1873, and followed by the Panic of 1893, book-ending an era of prosperity. The U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research dates the contraction following the panic as lasting from October 1873 to March 1879. At 65 months, it is the longest-lasting contraction identified by the NBER, eclipsing the Great Depression&#x27;s 43 months of contraction. In the United States, from 1873 to 1879, 18,000 businesses went bankrupt, including 89 railroads. Unemployment peaked in 1878 at 8.25%.

==Background==

The period preceding the depression was dominated by several major military conflicts and a period of economic expansion. In Europe, the end of the Franco-Prussian War yielded a new political order in Germany, and the £200 million indemnity imposed on France led to an inflationary investment boom in Germany and Central Europe. New technologies in industry such as the Bessemer converter were being rapidly applied; railroads were booming. 
In the United States, the end of the Civil War and a brief post-war recession (1865–1867) gave way to an investment boom, focused especially on railroads on public lands in the Western United States – an expansion funded largely by foreign investors.

==Causes of the crisis==


In 1873, during a decline in the value of silverexacerbated by the end of the German Empire&#x27;s production of &quot;thaler&quot; coinsthe US government passed the Coinage Act of 1873 in April. This essentially ended the bimetallic standard of the United States, forcing it for the first time onto a pure gold standard. This measure, referred to by its opponents as &quot;the Crime of 1873&quot; and the topic of William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold speech in 1896, forced a contraction of the money supply in the United States. It also drove down silver prices further, even as new silver mines were being established in Nevada, which stimulated mining investment but increased supply as demand was falling. Silver miners arrived at US mints, unaware of the ban on production of silver coins, only to find their product no longer welcome. By September, the US economy was in a crisis, deflation causing banking panics and destabilizing business investment, climaxing in the Panic of 1873.

The Panic of 1873 has been described as &quot;the first truly international crisis&quot;. The optimism that had been driving booming stock prices in central Europe had reached a fever pitch, and fears of a bubble culminated in a panic in Vienna beginning in April 1873. The collapse of the Vienna Stock Exchange began on May 8, 1873, and continued until May 10, when the exchange was closed; when it was reopened three days later, the panic seemed to have faded, and appeared confined to Austria-Hungary. Financial panic arrived in the Americas only months later on Black Thursday, September 18, 1873, after the failure of the banking house of Jay Cooke and Company over the Northern Pacific Railway. The Northern Pacific railway had been given of public land in the Western United States and Cooke sought $100,000,000 in capital for the company; the bank failed when the bond issue proved unsalable, and was shortly followed by several other major banks. The New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days on September 20.

The financial contagion then returned to Europe, provoking a second panic in Vienna and further failures in continental Europe before receding. France, which had been experiencing deflation in the years preceding the crash, was spared financial calamity for the moment, as was the United Kingdom.

Some have argued the depression was rooted in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War that devastated the French economy and, under the Treaty of Frankfurt, forced that country to make large war reparations payments to Germany. The primary cause of the price depression in the United States was the tight monetary policy that the United States followed to get back to the gold standard after the Civil War. The U.S. government was taking money out of circulation to achieve this goal, therefore there was less available money to facilitate trade. Because of this monetary policy the price of silver started to fall causing considerable losses of asset values; by most accounts, after 1879 production was growing, thus further putting downward pressure on prices due to increased industrial productivity, trade and competition.

In the US the speculative nature of financing due to both the greenback, which was paper currency issued to pay for the Civil War and rampant fraud in the building of the Union Pacific Railway up to 1869 culminated in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Railway overbuilding and weak markets collapsed the bubble in 1873. Both the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific lines were central to the collapse; another railway bubble was the Railway Mania in the United Kingdom.

Because of the Panic of 1873, governments depegged their currencies, to save money. The demonetization of silver by European and North American governments in the early 1870s was certainly a contributing factor. The US Coinage Act of 1873 was met with great opposition by farmers and miners, as silver was seen as more of a monetary benefit to rural areas than to banks in big cities. In addition, there were US citizens who advocated the continuance of government-issued fiat money (United States Notes) to avoid deflation and promote exports. The western US states were outragedNevada, Colorado, and Idaho were huge silver producers with productive mines, and for a few years mining abated. Resumption of silver dollar coinage was authorized by the Bland–Allison Act of 1878. The resumption of the US government buying silver was enacted in 1890 with the Sherman Silver Purchase Act.

Monetarists believe that the 1873 depression was caused by shortages of gold that undermined the gold standard, and that the 1848 California Gold Rush, 1886 Witwatersrand Gold Rush in South Africa and the 1896–99 Klondike Gold Rush helped alleviate such crises. Other analyses have pointed to developmental surges (see Kondratiev wave), theorizing that the Second Industrial Revolution was causing large shifts in the economies of many states, imposing transition costs, which may also have played a role in causing the depression.

==Course of the depression==

Like the later Great Depression, the Long Depression affected different countries at different times, at different rates, and some countries accomplished rapid growth over certain periods. Globally, however, the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s were a period of falling price levels and rates of economic growth significantly below the periods preceding and following.

Between 1870 and 1890, iron production in the five largest producing countries more than doubled, from 11 million tons to 23 million tons, steel production increased twentyfold (half a million tons to 11 million tons), and railroad development boomed. But at the same time, prices in several markets collapsedthe price of grain in 1894 was only a third what it had been in 1867, and the price of cotton fell by nearly 50 percent in just the five years from 1872 to 1877, imposing great hardship on farmers and planters. This collapse provoked protectionism in many countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States, while triggering mass emigration from other countries such as Italy, Spain, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Similarly, while the &quot;production&quot; of iron doubled between the 1870s and 1890s, the &quot;price&quot; of iron halved.

Many countries experienced significantly lower growth rates relative to what they had experienced earlier in the 19th century and to what they experienced afterwards:


===Austria-Hungary===
The global economic crisis first erupted in Austria-Hungary, where in May 1873 the Vienna Stock Exchange crashed. In Hungary, the panic of 1873 terminated a mania of railroad-building.

===Chile===
In the late 1870s the economic situation in Chile deteriorated. Chilean wheat exports were outcompeted by production in Canada, Russia and Argentina and Chilean copper was largely replaced in international markets by copper from the United States and Spain. Income from silver mining in Chile also dropped. Aníbal Pinto, president of Chile in 1878, expressed his concerns the following way:

This &quot;mining discovery&quot; came, according to historians Gabriel Salazar and Julio Pinto, into existence through the conquest of Bolivian and Peruvian lands in the War of the Pacific. It has been argued that economic situation and the view of new wealth in the nitrate was the true reason for the Chilean elite to go into war with its neighbors.

Another response to the economic crisis, according to Jorge Pinto Rodríguez, was the new pulse of conquest of indigenous lands that took place in Araucanía in the 1880s.

===France===
France&#x27;s experience was somewhat unusual. Having been defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, the country was required to pay £200 million in reparations to the Germans and was already reeling when the 1873 crash occurred. The French adopted a policy of deliberate deflation while paying off the reparations.

While the United States resumed growth for a time in the 1880s, the Paris Bourse crash of 1882 sent France careening into depression, one which &quot;lasted longer and probably cost France more than any other in the 19th century&quot;. The Union Générale, a French bank, failed in 1882, prompting the French to withdraw three million pounds from the Bank of England and triggering a collapse in French stock prices.

The financial crisis was compounded by diseases impacting the wine and silk industries French capital accumulation and foreign investment plummeted to the lowest levels experienced by France in the latter half of the 19th century. After a boom in new investment banks after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the destruction of the French banking industry wrought by the crash cast a pall over the financial sector that lasted until the dawn of the 20th century. French finances were further sunk by failing investments abroad, principally in railroads and buildings. The French net national product declined over the ten years from 1882 to 1892.

===Italy===
A ten-year tariff war broke out between France and Italy after 1887, damaging Franco-Italian relations which had prospered during Italian unification. As France was Italy&#x27;s biggest investor, the liquidation of French assets in the country was especially damaging.

===Russia===
The Russian experience was similar to the US experiencethree separate recessions, concentrated in manufacturing, occurred in the period (1874–1877, 1881–1886, and 1891–1892), separated by periods of recovery.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom, which had previously experienced crises every decade since the 1820s, was initially less affected by this financial crisis, even though the Bank of England kept interest rates as high as 9 percent in the 1870s.

The 1878 failure of the City of Glasgow Bank in Scotland arose through a combination of fraud and speculative investments in Australian and New Zealand companies (agriculture and mining) and in American railroads. 

Building on an 1870 reform, and the 1879 famine, thousands of Irish tenant farmers affected by depressed producer prices and high rents launched the Land War in 1879, which resulted in the reforming Irish Land Acts.

===United States===


In the United States, the Long Depression began with the Panic of 1873. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the contraction following the panic as lasting from October 1873 to March 1879. At 65 months, it is the longest-lasting contraction identified by the NBER, eclipsing the Great Depression&#x27;s 43 months of contraction. Figures from Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz show net national product increased 3 percent per year from 1869 to 1879 and real national product grew at 6.8 percent per year during that time frame. However, since between 1869 and 1879 the population of the United States increased by over 17.5 percent, per capita NNP growth was lower. Following the end of the episode in 1879, the U.S. economy would remain unstable, experiencing recessions for 114 of the 253 months until January 1901.

The dramatic shift in prices mauled nominal wages in the United States, nominal wages declined by one-quarter during the 1870s, and as much as one-half in some places, such as Pennsylvania. Although real wages had enjoyed robust growth in the aftermath of the American Civil War, increasing by nearly a quarter between 1865 and 1873, they stagnated until the 1880s, posting no real growth, before resuming their robust rate of expansion in the later 1880s. The collapse of cotton prices devastated the already war-ravaged economy of the southern United States. Although farm prices fell dramatically, American agriculture continued to expand production.

Thousands of American businesses failed, defaulting on more than a billion dollars of debt. One in four laborers in New York were out of work in the winter of 1873–1874 and, nationally, a million became unemployed.

The sectors which experienced the most severe declines in output were manufacturing, construction, and railroads. The railroads had been a tremendous engine of growth in the years before the crisis, yielding a 50% increase in railroad mileage from 1867 to 1873. After absorbing as much as 20% of US capital investment in the years preceding the crash, this expansion came to a dramatic end in 1873; between 1873 and 1878, the total amount of railroad mileage in the United States barely increased at all.

The Freedman&#x27;s Savings Bank was a typical casualty of the financial crisis. Chartered in 1865 in the aftermath of the American Civil War, the bank had been established to advance the economic welfare of America&#x27;s newly emancipated freedmen. In the early 1870s, the bank had joined in the speculative fever, investing in real estate and unsecured loans to railroads; its collapse in 1874 was a severe blow to African-Americans.

The recession exacted a harsh political toll on President Ulysses S. Grant. Historian Allan Nevins says of the end of Grant&#x27;s presidency:

Recovery began in 1878. The mileage of railroad track laid down increased from in 1878 to 11,568 in 1882. Construction began recovery by 1879; the value of building permits increased two and a half times between 1878 and 1883, and unemployment fell to 2.5% in spite of (or perhaps facilitated by) high immigration.

Business profits declined briefly between 1882 and 1884. The recovery in railroad construction reversed itself, falling from of track laid in 1882 to of track laid in 1885; the price of steel rails collapsed from $71/ton in 1880 to $20/ton in 1884. Manufacturing again collapseddurable goods output fell by a quarter again. The decline became a brief financial crisis in 1884, when multiple New York banks collapsed; simultaneously, in 1883–1884, tens of millions of dollars of foreign-owned American securities were sold out of fears that the United States was preparing to abandon the gold standard. This financial panic closed eleven New York banks, more than a hundred small state banks, and led to defaults on at least $32 million worth of debt. Unemployment, which had stood at 2.5% between recessions, surged to 7.5% in 1884–1885, and 13% in the northeastern United States, even as immigration plunged in response to deteriorating labor markets.

The 1880s saw an extraordinarily large expansion of industry, of railroads, of physical output, of net national product, and real per capita income. As Friedman and Schwartz admit, the decade from 1869 to 1879 saw a 3-percent-per annum increase in money national product, an outstanding real national product growth of 6.8 percent per year in this period, and a phenomenal rise of 4.5 percent per year in real product per capita. Even the alleged &quot;monetary contraction&quot; never took place, the money supply increasing by 2.7 percent per year in this period. From 1873 through 1878, before another spurt of monetary expansion, the total supply of bank money rose from $1.964 billion to $2.221 billiona rise of 13.1 percent or 2.6 percent per year. In short, a modest but definite rise, and scarcely a contraction.

==Reactions to the crisis==

===Protectionism===

The period preceding the Long Depression had been one of increasing economic internationalism, championed by efforts such as the Latin Monetary Union, many of which then were derailed or stunted by the impacts of economic uncertainty. The extraordinary collapse of farm prices provoked a protectionist response in many nations. Rejecting the free trade policies of the Second Empire, French president Adolphe Thiers led the new Third Republic to protectionism, which led ultimately to the stringent Méline tariff in 1892. Germany&#x27;s agrarian Junker aristocracy, under attack by cheap, imported grain, successfully agitated for a protective tariff in 1879 in Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Germany over the protests of his National Liberal Party allies. In 1887, Italy and France embarked on a bitter tariff war. In the United States, Benjamin Harrison won the 1888 US presidential election on a protectionist pledge.

As a result of the protectionist policies enacted by the world&#x27;s major trading nations, the global merchant marine fleet posted no significant growth from 1870 to 1890 before it nearly doubled in tonnage in the prewar economic boom that followed. Only the United Kingdom and the Netherlands remained committed to low tariffs.

===Monetary responses===

In 1874, a year after the 1873 crash, the United States Congress passed legislation called the Inflation Bill of 1874 designed to confront the issue of falling prices by injecting fresh greenbacks into the money supply. Under pressure from business interests, President Ulysses S. Grant vetoed the measure. In 1878, Congress overrode President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s veto to pass the Silver Purchase Act, a similar but more successful attempt to promote &quot;easy money&quot;.

===Strikes===

The United States endured its first nationwide strike in 1877, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. This led to widespread unrest and often violence in many major cities and industrial hubs including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading, Saint Louis, Scranton, and Shamokin.

===New Imperialism===

The Long Depression arguably contributed to the revival of colonialism leading to the New Imperialism period, symbolized by the scramble for Africa, as the western powers sought new markets for their surplus accumulated capital. According to Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951), the &quot;unlimited expansion of power&quot; followed the &quot;unlimited expansion of capital&quot;.

In the United States, beginning in 1878, the rebuilding, extending, and refinancing of the western railways, commensurate with the wholesale giveaway of water, timber, fish, minerals in what had previously been Indian territory, characterized a rising market. This led to the expansion of markets and industry, together with the robber barons of railroad owners, which culminated in the genteel 1880s and 1890s. The Gilded Age was the outcome for the few rich. The cycle repeated itself with the Panic of 1893, another huge market crash.

==Recovery==
In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Analysis dates the recession through March 1879. In January 1879, the United States returned to the gold standard which it had abandoned during the Civil War; according to economist Rendigs Fels, the gold standard put a floor to the deflation, and this was further boosted by especially good agricultural production in 1879. The view that a single recession lasted from 1873 to 1896 or 1897 is not supported by most modern reviews of the period. It has even been suggested that the trough of this business cycle may have occurred as early as 1875.
In fact, from 1869 to 1879, the US economy grew at a rate of 6.8% for real net national product (NNP) and 4.5% for real NNP per capita. Real wages were flat from 1869 to 1879, while from 1879 to 1896, nominal wages rose 23% and prices fell 4.2%.

==Explanations==
Irving Fisher believed that the Panic of 1873 and the severity of the contractions which followed it could be explained by debt and deflation and that a financial panic would trigger catastrophic deleveraging in an attempt to sell assets and increase capital reserves; that selloff would trigger a collapse in asset prices and deflation, which would in turn prompt financial institutions to sell off more assets, only to further deflation and strain capital ratios. Fisher believed that had governments or private enterprise embarked on efforts to reflate financial markets, the crisis would have been less severe.

David Ames Wells (1890) wrote of the technological advancements during the period 1870–1890, which included the Long Depression. Wells gives an account of the changes in the world economy transitioning into the Second Industrial Revolution in which he documents changes in trade, such as triple expansion steam shipping, railroads, the effect of the international telegraph network and the opening of the Suez Canal. Wells gives numerous examples of productivity increases in various industries and discusses the problems of excess capacity and market saturation.

Wells&#x27; opening sentence:

The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a centuryor during the present generation of living menhave unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world&#x27;s history.

Other changes Wells mentions are reductions in warehousing and inventories, elimination of middlemen, economies of scale, the decline of craftsmen, and the displacement of agricultural workers. About the whole 1870–90 period Wells said:

Some of these changes have been destructive, and all of them have inevitably occasioned, and for a long time yet will continue to occasion, great disturbances in old methods, and entail losses of capital and changes in occupation on the part of individuals. And yet the world wonders, and commissions of great states inquire, without coming to definite conclusions, why trade and industry in recent years has been universally and abnormally disturbed and depressed.

Wells notes that many of the government inquiries on the &quot;depression of prices&quot; (deflation) found various reasons such as the scarcity of gold and silver. Wells showed that the US money supply actually grew over the period of the deflation. Wells noted that deflation lowered the cost of only goods that benefited from improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by craftsmen and many services did not decrease in value, and the cost of labor actually increased. Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did not have modern manufacturing, transportation, and communications.

Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, author of &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;, on the other hand, blamed this prolonged economic crisis on the imposition of a new gold standard, part of which he referred to by its traditional name, The Crime of 1873. Additionally, Friedman pointed to the expansion of the gold supply through Gold cyanidation as a contributor to the recovery. This forced shift into a currency whose supply was limited by nature, unable to expand with demand, caused a series of economic and monetary contractions that plagued the entire period of the Long Depression. Murray Rothbard, in his book &quot;History of Money and Banking of the United States&quot;, argues that the long depression was only a misunderstood recession since real wages and production were actually increasing throughout the period. Like Friedman, he attributes falling prices to the resumption of a deflationary gold standard in the U.S. after the Civil War.

==Interpretations==

Most economic historians see this period as negative for the most industrial nations. Many argue that most of the stagnation was caused by a monetary contraction caused by abandonment of the bimetallic standard, in favor of a new fiat gold standard, starting with the Coinage Act of 1873.

Other economic historians have complained about the characterization of this period as a &quot;depression&quot; because of conflicting economic statistics that cast doubt on this interpretation. They note it saw a relatively large expansion of industry, of railroads, of physical output, of net national product, and of real per capita income.

As economists Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz have noted, the decade from 1869 to 1879 saw a growth of 3 percent per year in money national product, an outstanding real national product growth of 6.8 percent per year, and a rise of 4.5 percent per year in real product per capita. Even the alleged &quot;monetary contraction&quot; never took place, the money supply increasing by 2.7 percent per year. From 1873 through 1878, before another spurt of monetary expansion, the total supply of bank money rose from $1.964 billion to $2.221 billion, a rise of 13.1 percent, or 2.6 percent per year. In short, it was a modest but definite rise, not a contraction. Although per-capita nominal income declined very gradually from 1873 to 1879, that decline was more than offset by a gradual increase over the course of the next 17 years.

Furthermore, real per capita income either stayed approximately constant (1873–1880; 1883–1885) or rose (1881–1882; 1886–1896), so the average consumer appears to have been considerably better off at the end of the &quot;depression&quot; than before. Studies of other countries where prices also tumbled, including the United States, Germany, France, and Italy, reported more markedly positive trends in both nominal and real per capita income figures. Profits generally were also not adversely affected by deflation, although they declined (particularly in the UK) in industries struggling against superior, foreign competition. Furthermore, some economists argue a falling general price level is not inherently harmful to an economy and cite the economic growth of the period as evidence. As economist Murray Rothbard has stated:

Unfortunately, most historians and economists are conditioned to believe that steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked the fact that in the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.

Accompanying the overall growth in real prosperity was a marked shift in consumption from necessities to luxuries: by 1885, &quot;more houses were being built, twice as much tea was being consumed, and even the working classes were eating imported meat, oranges, and dairy produce in quantities unprecedented&quot;. The change in working class incomes and tastes was symbolized by &quot;the spectacular development of the department store and the chain store&quot;.

Prices certainly fell, but almost every other index of economic activity – output of coal and pig iron, tonnage of ships built, consumption of raw wool and cotton, import and export figures, shipping entries and clearances, railway freight clearances, joint-stock company formations, trading profits, consumption per head of wheat, meat, tea, beer, and tobacco – all of these showed an upward trend.

A large part at least of the deflation commencing in the 1870s was a reflection of unprecedented advances in factory productivity. Real unit production costs for most final goods dropped steadily throughout the 19th century and especially from 1873 to 1896. At no previous time had there been an equivalent &quot;harvest of technological advances... so general in their application and so radical in their implications&quot;. That is why, notwithstanding the dire predictions of many eminent economists, the UK did not end up paralyzed by strikes and lockouts. Falling prices did not mean falling money wages. Instead of inspiring large numbers of workers to go on strike, falling prices were inspiring them to go shopping.

<text>Achtmaal is a village the south of the Netherlands. It is located in Zundert, North Brabant, near the border with Belgium.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1294 as &quot;Gilberti de Achtmale&quot;, and is a combination of &quot;reserved forest&quot; and &quot;court of justice&quot;.

Achtmaal was home to 100 people in 1840. The St Cornelius Church was built in 1863.

During World War II, the United States Army 104th Infantry Division, 415th Infantry Regiment, liberated Achtmaal from German troops. Operation Pheasant (code-name &quot;Suitcase&quot;), aimed at clearing German troops from the province of North Brabant, started on the morning of Friday 20 October 1944 just after 7:00am. On 27 October 1944 the 3rd Battalion of the 415th Infantry entered the village and Lieutenant Colonel Kelleher was handed papers by the Dutch resistance. They proved to be very helpful for the liberators. The Regiment sustained thirty-seven killed and 135 wounded during the operation.

<text>James Craig Adamson (born March 3, 1946) is a former NASA astronaut and retired Colonel of the United States Army. He is married with 3 children. James Adamson flew on two missions, STS-28 and STS-43, and completed 263 orbits and 334 hours in space. After retiring from NASA, he was recruited by Allied Signal (later merged with Honeywell) where he retired in 2001. Adamson has logged over 3,000 hours in over 30 different types of helicopters and airplanes.

==Personal data==
Adamson was born March 3, 1946, in Warsaw, New York. He currently resides in Fishersville, Virginia with his wife Ellen and two of his three children.

==Education==
Adamson completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army at United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1969. In 1977, he completed a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. In 2010, he completed his Chartered Director certification, graduating from The Directors College (a joint venture between McMaster University and the Conference Board of Canada). Additionally, he has completed undergraduate and graduate pilot training, paratrooper training, Arctic water and mountain survival training, nuclear weapons training, basic and advanced officer training, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.

==Military experience==
As a military test pilot, Adamson has flown research aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, Princeton University, West Point, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, and NASA Houston. During the Vietnam War, he flew in the IV Corps area and in Cambodia with the Air Cavalry as scout pilot, team lead, and air mission commander. He has also flown with several peacetime flight units at Fort Bliss, Texas, West Point and Houston, Texas. Following completion of his master&#x27;s in aerospace engineering at Princeton University, he became assistant professor of aerodynamics at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. While at West Point, he developed and taught courses in fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aircraft performance, and stability and control. He also developed flight laboratories in aircraft flight testing and completed a text on aircraft performance. In addition to being an experimental test pilot and Master Army Aviator, Adamson is also a certified professional engineer and licensed commercial pilot. In ground assignments with the Army, Adamson has commanded nuclear-capable missile units in Europe and in the United States.

==NASA experience==
Adamson was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center from 1981 to 1992. During the Operational Flight Test phase of the Shuttle Program, he served as a research test pilot and aerodynamics officer in Mission Control. Following completion of the operational test flights he became guidance navigation and control officer for Shuttle Missions 5 through 11. As research test pilot he also conducted airborne remote sensing studies in biospheric research.

Selected by NASA as an astronaut in 1984, Adamson became qualified for mission assignment on Space Shuttle flights. In November 1985, he was selected to the crew of a Department of Defense mission, which was subsequently delayed due to the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. During the Shuttle Program reconstruction period, Adamson was one of eleven astronauts selected to hold management positions within NASA. He served as Shuttle Program Office Assistant Manager for Engineering Integration. In this position he was responsible for the initial development of a reliability based maintenance program for the Space Shuttle program. He also initiated an enhancements program for Shuttle ground processing.

In February 1988 Adamson was assigned to the flight crew of STS-28, the first flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; following the reconstruction period. Columbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carried a classified Department of Defense payload and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 earth orbits in 121 hours, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989.

Following STS-28 Adamson once again returned to management. This time he was assigned to the Kennedy Space Center as Director of Shuttle Processing Analysis. He served in this post from September 1989 until October 1990 when he was assigned to the flight crew of STS-43. During this period Adamson developed risk based processing and scheduling programs which resulted in reduction of processing times from 80 days to 50 days.

The nine-day STS-43 mission aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center on August 2, 1991, setting a new world record for payload weight lifted to orbit. The five member crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E) and conducted 32 physical and life sciences experiments. During this flight, Adamson performed the first flight test of the Orbital Digital Autopilot following Shuttle retrofit with new General Purpose Computers and new software. After 142 earth orbits in 213 hours, the STS-43 mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991.

Following Adamson&#x27;s retirement from government service in June 1992, he continued as a management consultant to NASA and the aerospace industry. Until September 1994 he served as management consultant and strategic planner for Lockheed Corporation in the area of Human Space Flight Operations. He was also selected by the NASA Administrator to serve on the NASA Advisory Council.

In September 1994, Adamson joined Lockheed Corporation as Executive Vice President of Lockheed Engineering and Science Company (LESC) where he was shortly promoted to president and CEO. In late 1995 he was selected by Lockheed Martin to start up and become the first COO of the United Space Alliance (USA), a joint venture with Rockwell International. USA subsequently won the Space Flight Operations Contract with NASA to operate the Space Shuttle Program and grew to $1.5 billion annual revenue in the first year.

In 1999, Adamson was recruited by AlliedSignal Corporation to be the President of Allied Signal Technical Services Corporation. He remained in that post through Allied Signal&#x27;s merger with Honeywell until his retirement in March 2001.

Adamson is still active as a consultant and board member for the aerospace industry and still serves on the NASA Advisory Council for the NASA Administrator.

==Honors and awards==
Adamson was recently awarded the &quot;Gil Bennett Gold Standard Award&quot; for corporate governance. In 2007 he was inducted into the Army Aviation Hall of Fame. Adamson was a two time All-American in pistol competition. He was also a winner of the Army&#x27;s Excellency In Competition Award, and a recipient of the George S. Patton Award. Named an Outstanding College Athlete of America, Adamson captained West Point&#x27;s pistol team to the national championship in 1969. He was a distinguished graduate of his pilot training class, as well as his graduate fixed-wing and multi-engine pilot training classes. During aerial combat in Southeast Asia, he earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses, 18 Air Medals, and three Vietnam Crosses of Gallantry for valor. He has also earned the Defense Superior Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, the Bronze Star, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, two NASA Space Flight Medals, and is a world record holder for space flight lifting the most weight to orbit. He is a Charter Honoree of the Geneseo Central School Alumni Hall of Fame, Class of 1964. Adamson is an Eagle Scout.

<text>Hair wax is a thick hairstyling product containing wax, used to assist with holding the hair. In contrast with hair gel, most of which contain alcohol, hair wax remains pliable and has less chance of drying out. It is often sold under names such as pomade, putty, glue, whip, molding gum, or styling paste. The texture, consistency, and purpose of these products varies widely and each has a different purported purpose depending on the manufacturer. Traditionally, pomade is a type of hair wax that also adds shine to one&#x27;s hair.

Hair wax has been used for many years and a waxy soap-like substance was invented by the ancient Gauls as a hair styling agent and was not used as a cleaning agent until many years later.

==Ingredients==
The following are some of the ingredients typically found in commercial hair wax products: 

* Beeswax
* Candelilla wax
* Carnauba wax
* Castor wax
* Emulsifying wax
* Japan wax
* Lanolin
* Ozokerite

Some stylists prefer making their own blends of hair wax customized for their clientele. Various recipes exist, including some with &quot;secret&quot; ingredients.

<doc id="596485" wikidata="Q606754" url="?curid=596485" title="Urine therapy">
<text>Urine therapy or urotherapy, (also urinotherapy, Shivambu, uropathy, or auto-urine therapy) in alternative medicine is the application of human urine for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, including drinking of one&#x27;s own urine and massaging one&#x27;s skin, or gums, with one&#x27;s own urine. No scientific evidence exists to support any beneficial health claims of urine therapy.

==History==
Though urine has been believed useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several traditional systems, and mentioned in some medical texts, auto-urine therapy as a system of alternative medicine was popularized by British naturopath John W. Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family&#x27;s practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical misreading of the Hebrew Biblical Proverb 5:15 &quot;Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well&quot;, and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast &quot;on nothing but urine and tap water&quot;. Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine therapy regimens that he devised for thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published &quot;The Water of Life: A Treatise on Urine Therapy&quot;, which became a founding document of the field.

Armstrong&#x27;s book sold widely, and in India inspired the writing of (Gujarati: Urine therapy; 1959) by Gandhian social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference &quot;Shivambu Kalpa&quot;, a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East. They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in Yogic-texts such as &quot;Vayavaharasutra&quot; by Bhadrabahu and &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradapika&quot; by Svatmarama; and Ayurvedic texts such as &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, &quot;Bhava Prakasha&quot; and &quot;Harit&quot;. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of (drinking one&#x27;s own urine) and recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in &quot;Shivambu Kalpa&quot;.

Urine therapy has also been combined with other forms of alternative medicine. 

It was used by ancient Roman dentists to whiten teeth.

==Modern claims and findings==
An exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971. Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water. The remaining constituents are, in order of decreasing concentration: urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.

In China there is a &quot;Urine Therapy Association&quot; which claims thousand of members.

According to a BBC report, a Thai doctor promoting urine therapy said that Thai people had been practicing urophagia for a long time, but according to the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, there was no record of the practice. In 2022, Thawee Nanra, a self-proclaimed holy man from Thailand, was arrested by police; his followers were observed consuming his urine and feces which they believed to have healing properties.

Urinating on jellyfish stings is a common &quot;folk remedy&quot;. This does not help with jellyfish stings, and can be counterproductive, activating nematocysts remaining at the site of the sting, making the pain worse. This is because nematocysts are triggered by the change in the concentration of solutes (e.g. salt), such as when freshwater or similarly-composed urine is applied to the site. The myth originated from the false idea that ammonia, urea, and other compounds in urine could break down the nematocysts: however, urine is much too low in concentration to have those effects.

Urine and urea have been claimed by some practitioners to have an anti-cancer effect, and urotherapy has been offered along with other forms of alternative therapy in some cancer clinics in Mexico. No well-controlled studies support this, and available scientific evidence does not support this theory.

In the Arabian Peninsula, bottled camel urine is sold by vendors as prophetic medicine. In 2015, Saudi police arrested a man for selling supposed &quot;camel urine&quot; that was actually his own.

In January 2022, Christopher Key, a spreader of COVID-19 misinformation, claimed that urine therapy is the antidote to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key also falsely claims that a 9-month research trial on urine therapy has been conducted. There is no scientific evidence supporting urine therapy as a cure for COVID-19.

Urea-containing creams are sold commercially for topical use, and contain synthetically produced urea rather than being derived from urine. Urea in very high concentrations is effective as a humectant and a keratolytic. Actual urine is too dilute to work well for this purpose.

==Health concerns==
There is no scientific evidence of therapeutic use for untreated urine.

According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that urine or urea given in any form is helpful for cancer patients&quot;.

In 2016, the Chinese Urine Therapy Association was included on a list of illegal organizations by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. However, the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs in Wuhan said they had no jurisdiction over the association.

<doc id="596486" wikidata="Q1606158" url="?curid=596486" title="USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)">
<text>USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (DDG-68) is the eighteenth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer. She is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the five Sullivan brothers–George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert Sullivan, aged 20 to 27–who died when their ship, , was sunk by a Japanese submarine in November 1942 in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. This was the greatest military loss by any one American family during World War II.

The first ship named for the brothers was the , now a museum ship in Buffalo, New York.

==Construction==
The contract to build &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was awarded to Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine on 8 April 1992 and her keel was laid down on 27 July 1994. She was launched on 12 August 1995 and sponsored by Kelly Ann Sullivan Loughren, granddaughter of Albert Sullivan. The ship was
commissioned on 19 April 1997, with Commander Gerard D. Roncolato in command. Upon her commissioning, the ship was given the motto that is thought to have been spoken by the brothers when asked to separate during World War II, &quot;&quot;We Stick Together&quot;.&quot;

==Service history==
===1990s===

On 26 April 1997, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; departed New York City for Norfolk, Virginia, where, after arriving on 27 April, the crew completed underway replenishment qualifications with . The warship then sailed for NS Mayport, Florida, on 29 April and arrived in her new homeport on 2 May.

After completing two days of gunnery trials in mid-May, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; embarked upon her shakedown deployment to the West Indies on 27 May. That cruise took her to the waters off Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the destroyer conducted numerous sonar, gunnery, and torpedo exercises. The warship also twice entered Roosevelt Roads and stopped once at St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands for port visits. On 29 June, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; conducted test firings of Standard SM-2 ER missiles from her vertical launch system (VLS). After a brief stop at Mayport for the 4 July weekend, the warship joined other &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, cruisers, destroyers, and frigates off the Virginia Capes for a multiple-ship missile firing exercise. She returned to Mayport on 12 July for upkeep.

Following three days of damage control exercises in mid-August, the crew began preparations for a post shakedown availability. She sailed for Maine on 3 September, arriving at Bath Iron Works on 5 September. The shipyard repainted the hull, altered the superstructure, and installed equipment upgrades in the engineering plant and combat systems suite. When the yard work was completed &quot;The Sullivans&quot; got underway for Mayport, arriving there on 23 November.

On 8 December, the destroyer joined the aircraft carrier off Georgia for a week of underway training. While providing plane guard services on 11 December, a T-45 Goshawk trainer aircraft crashed following take-off. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; made a high-speed dash to the site. While the carrier&#x27;s rescue helicopter safely rescued the pilot, boats launched by &quot;The Sullivans&quot; picked up considerable pieces of wreckage which were helpful in determining the cause of the crash. The crew also completed helicopter deck landing qualifications before returning to port for the holidays on 12 December.

In January 1998, the crew of &quot;The Sullivans&quot; began a series of exercises designed &quot;to build the capability for long-term self-sustained training onboard.&quot; They included engineering, combat, seamanship, and battle scenario training exercises. These local operations lasted until 18 May when the warship got underway for New York City and the annual &quot;Fleet Week&quot; celebrations.

Following a week-long port visit, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; got underway on 26 May for Halifax, Nova Scotia, to conduct training workups for the upcoming Exercise &quot;Unified Spirit &#x27;98.&quot; During the exercise she joined an amphibious task force formed around , two Amphibious transport docks (LPDs), and two dock landing ships (LSDs). The warship screened the &quot;gator&quot; ships during an exercise focusing on multi-national peace enforcement operations. Ships from Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and Portugal also participated in the exercise. After this exercise, the ship visited Boston, Massachusetts, and then sailed with relatives and family for Mayport, arriving on 1 July.

After a summer of conducting midshipmen training off the Florida coast, Commander Roncolato was relieved by Commander E. Scott Hebner, USN, in a change of command ceremony on 4 September 1998. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was then assigned to Destroyer Squadron 24, a component of the Battle Group. In 1999 the ship participated in various training exercises to prepare for her maiden deployment in October to the Mediterranean Sea.

===2000s===
Later in 2000 she continued into the Arabian Sea, participating in exercises and boarding operations until late March. On 9 February 2000, Commander Daniel Paul Keller USN relieved Commander Heber in a change of command ceremony held at sea on station in the Persian Gulf.

After port visits in the Persian Gulf, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; returned through the Mediterranean Sea to her homeport in April 2000, successfully completing her first six-month deployment. After participating in BEACHFEST at Port Canaveral, Florida, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; underwent a major maintenance overhaul to prepare for future operations.

====Attempted Al-Qaeda bombing====
Members of al-Qaeda attempted an attack on &quot;The Sullivans&quot; while in port at Aden, Yemen on 3 January 2000 as a part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The plan was to load a boat full of explosives and detonate it near &quot;The Sullivans&quot;; however the boat was so overladen that it sank. Later, al-Qaeda tried the same type of attack a second time, successfully bombing on 12 October 2000.

====September 11 Attacks====
While underway and sailing for Composite Unit Training Exercise 01-2 &quot;The Sullivans&quot; received word of the September 11 attacks. &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, as part of the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Battle Group, took part in Operation Noble Eagle. The destroyer provided air-space security along the mid-Atlantic seaboard.

In February 2002 &quot;The Sullivans&quot; deployed with the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Carrier battle group to the Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

===2010s===
On 20 March 2010 as the ship entered the harbor at Manama, Bahrain she struck a harbor buoy and sustained between $200,000 and $1 million in damage. The ship&#x27;s captain, Commander Neil Funtanilla, was subsequently relieved of his command at an admiral&#x27;s mast by Rear Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of Combined Task Force 50. On 17 August 2011, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; mistakenly fired on a fishing boat rather than a towed gunnery target during a gunnery exercise off North Carolina. As a result, Commander Mark Olson was relieved of his command. None of the inert shells hit the boat and there were no injuries as a result of the incident. On 7 May 2012, Commander Derick Armstrong was relieved of command after several female crew members alleged that he sexually harassed women aboard ship. On 18 August 2013, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; provided medical assistance to an ill mariner on board the merchant vessel MV &quot;Abir Alqaray No. 4&quot;, a Saudi Arabian-flagged dhow, off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

On 18 July 2015, a RIM-66 Standard missile test fired from &quot;The Sullivans&quot; exploded just after launch. No injuries were reported but a small fire occurred on deck. Malfunctions of solid-fuel missiles in the U.S. Navy are extremely rare. In early November 2017, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; pulled into port in New York City, and its crew was given shore leave to celebrate Veterans&#x27; Day in the city.

===2020s===

On 14 September 2020, it was announced that &quot;The Sullivans&quot; would be part of &#x27;s Task Group for the GROUPEX and Joint Warrior exercises. On 19 January 2021, a declaration confirmed that &quot;The Sullivans&quot; would form part of the escort for HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; during her first active deployment as part of the United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group 21 in 2021.

USS The Sullivans deployed on 2 November, 2024 for her 5th Deployment in the last 3 years.

==Awards==

* Meritorious Unit Commendation – (October 2022 - January 2023)
* Battenberg Cup - (2022)
* Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy - (2022)

==Coat of Arms==
The dark blue and gold, on the shield of the coat of arms, represent the sea and excellence. They are also the US Navy&#x27;s traditional colors. Red is emblematic of courage and sacrifice. The five interlaced swords honor the five Sullivan brothers killed in action during World War II and commemorate their spirit of teamwork and patriotism. The upright points of the swords allude to the present ship&#x27;s combat readiness and her missile system. The border reflects unity and the eleven stars represent the battle stars earned by the first ; nine for World War II and two for the Korean War. The trident on the crest, a symbol of sea prowess, symbolizes DDG-68&#x27;s modern warfare capabilities; the AEGIS and vertical launch system. The fireball underscores the Guadalcanal campaign where the five brothers were killed in action while serving on , and highlights the firepower of both past and present USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. The inverted wreath, a traditional symbol of the ultimate sacrifice, is also in memory of the Sullivan brothers. The shamrock recalls the Irish heritage. The arms, on the seal, are blazoned in full color upon a white oval enclosed by a dark blue collar edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the name &quot;USS THE SULLIVANS&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 68&quot; in the base in gold.

<text>Charles Dillon Perrine (July 28, 1867June 21, 1951) was an American astronomer at the Lick Observatory in California (1893-1909) who moved to Cordoba, Argentina to accept the position of Director of the Argentine National Observatory (1909-1936). The Cordoba Observatory under Perrine&#x27;s direction made the first attempts to prove Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity by astronomical observation of the deflection of starlight near the Sun during the solar eclipse of October 10, 1912 in Cristina (Brazil), and the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914 at Feodosia, Crimea, Russian Empire. Rain in 1912 and clouds in 1914 prevented results.

In 1897 he was awarded the Lalande Prize and gold medal by the Paris Academy of Sciences given each year ″to the person who makes the most outstanding observation ... to further the progress of Astronomy, in France or elsewhere.″. He served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1902, was elected an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1904, and was awarded the gold medal of the Mexican Astronomical Society in 1905. In the same year he received the degree of Doctor of Sciences (honorary) from Santa Clara College (today Santa Clara University.

A crater on the far side of the moon was named in his honor in 1970.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Charles was born in Steubenville, Ohio, the son of Peter, a Methodist minister, and Elizabeth (McCauley) Perrine. He was a descendant of Daniel Perrin, &quot;The Huguenot&quot;, and Maria Thorel whose marriage was the first (European) recorded in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, (Feb 18, 1666). Following high school graduation in 1884, he moved to Alameda, California in about 1886 and worked as a bookkeeper at Armour &amp; Co., a meat-packing business in San Francisco.

Interested in photography and astronomy from an early age, and unable to afford a college education, &quot;he nevertheless looked forward to engaging in astronomical work&quot;. Perrine responded to a general invitation to amateurs in astronomy and photography from E. S. Holden, the Director of the newly established Lick Observatory (1888), to observe the total solar eclipse of January 1, 1889 in Northern California. Perrine&#x27;s report and photographs caught the attention of the Director who hired him as Secretary in 1893. Holden agreed to Perrine&#x27;s &quot;fixed purpose of devoting his spare time to the study of astronomical and related subjects, by way of preparation for later observatory duties&quot;.

=== Career ===
As his experience, skills, and discoveries grew he was promoted to Secretary and Assistant Astronomer (1895), Assistant Astronomer (1902), and Astronomer (1905).

From 1895 to 1902 Perrine discovered eight unexpected and four periodic comets including the co-discovery of the lost periodic comet 18D/Perrine-Mrkos in 1896 (see list below). Antonín Mrkos later named the asteroid 6779 Perrine after him. The lunar crater Perrine is also named after him.

In 1904-05 he discovered the sixth and seventh moons of Jupiter, today known as Himalia (December 3, 1904) and Elara (February 21, 1905) using telescopic photography (glass plate negatives) with the 36-inch Crossley Reflector which he had recently rebuilt. At the time they were simply designated &quot;Jupiter VI&quot; and &quot;Jupiter VII&quot; and were given their present names in 1975. The first certain observations of Jupiter&#x27;s moons (I - IV) were those published by Galileo Galilei in 1610. No additional moons were discovered until E. E. Barnard observed Amalthea (Jupiter V) in 1892.

Perrine participated in four solar eclipse expeditions of the Lick Observatory: 1900 (Georgia, USA), 1901 (Sumatra), 1905 (Spain), and 1908 (Flint Island), and was in charge of the one sent to Sumatra. Also in 1901, he and George Ritchey observed the apparent superluminal motion in the nebulosity surrounding Nova Persei 1901.

In 1909 he resigned from the Lick Observatory to accept the position of Director of the Argentine National Observatory (today, Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba) at Cordoba, Argentina, a position which he held until his retirement in 1936 at age 69.

Perrine played an early role in the history of general relativity and tests of general relativity. The Argentine National Observatory led by Perrine made the first attempt to test Albert Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity by observing the deflection of star light near the Sun at a total solar eclipse. Perrine wrote, &quot;The Cordoba Observatory made the first definite attempt to secure observations at an eclipse (that of 1912) for the relativity problem and that was done at the instigation of Dr. Freundlich.&quot; Einstein, in 1905, had proposed his Theory of Special Relativity which predicted that gravity bent light. In 1911 Einstein wrote, &quot;It would be urgently wished that astronomers take up the question here raised (gravitational light deflection near the Sun)...&quot;. Dr. Erwin Finlay-Freundlich, a German astronomer and mathematician, took up Einstein&#x27;s challenge and contacted Perrine in 1911 and 1912 to ask if he would undertake a test of light deflection near the Sun. Perrine agreed to add the test to his planned expedition to Cristina, Brazil to observe the total solar eclipse of October 10, 1912. William Wallace Campbell, the Director of the Lick Observatory, recognizing that Perrine would likely be the most experienced eclipse observer, also encouraged him to pursue the test and loaned him Lick&#x27;s eclipse camera lenses with which Perrine had previous eclipse experience while at Lick. The Argentine National Observatory built the telescopes and readied the equipment at the observation site at Cristina, Brazil. Unfortunately, steady rain made visibility and therefore the test impossible. As Perrine put it, &quot;We suffered a total eclipse instead of observing one&quot;. While observational results were elusive in 1912, the expedition produced valuable instruments (telescopes, cameras, timers, etc.) and experience for the next eclipse in 1914 in Russia. Three observatories would organize expeditions and include light deflection in their programs for 1914; the Argentine National Observatory (Perrine), the Lick Observatory (Campbell), and the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory (Freundlich).

Perrine&#x27;s photograph of the total solar eclipse of August 21, 1914 was the first taken in an attempt to measure star light deflection near the Sun which effect was predicted by Einstein&#x27;s Special Theory of Relativity in 1911. Thin clouds obscured the eclipse just enough to prevent accurate star observation. If these first attempts in Brazil in 1912 or Russia in 1914 had achieved results, they would have proven Einstein wrong because at that time (1911-1914) Einstein had predicted a light deflection of 0.87 arcseconds rather than the 1.75 arcseconds which he later calculated in 1915 with the General Theory of Relativity.

Perrine pioneered the study of astrophysics in Argentina and promoted the construction of the 60-inch/1.54 m reflecting telescope at Bosque Alegre which was completed in 1942 after his retirement in 1936. It would remain the largest telescope in South America until 1981 when Brazil built a 63-inch reflector. After retirement he lived first in Cordoba city and next in Villa General Mitre (originally and again Villa del Totoral) where he died. He is buried in the Cementerio del Salvador (Cemetery of the Savior) formerly called the &quot;Cementerio de Disidentes&quot; (cemetery of dissidents/non-Catholics), in the city of Córdoba. His grave marker reads:

Dr. Charles Dillon Perrine
28/07/1867 — 21/06/1951

<text>Easington was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district in eastern County Durham, England. It contained the settlements of Easington, Seaham, Peterlee, Murton, Horden, Blackhall, Wingate and Castle Eden. It did not however include Easington Lane which is administered as part of the City of Sunderland.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Seaham urban district with most of Easington Rural District.

It had the lowest percentage of foreign-born residents in England at 1.2% (2001 census).

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. An electoral ward in the name of Easington still exists. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 7,693.

<text>Marcus George Singer (January 4, 1926 – February 21, 2016) was an American philosopher. His works include &quot;Generalization in Ethics – An Essay in the Logic of Ethics, with the Rudiments of a System of Moral Philosophy&quot; (1961).

==Personal life==
Marcus George Singer was born in 1926 in New York City. His father, David Singer, a lawyer, died when MGS was 9 years old from a rare autoimmune disease. His mother, Esther Kobre Singer, was a concert level pianist and received awards from the City of New York for her service typing books in braille. Her father and uncle, through their small bank, provided loans to many Jews to pay passage to the USA (Kobre Bank, NYC). MGS enlisted in the US Army Air Corps Reserves in 1943. From 1944 to 1945 he served in the U.S. Army Air Force as an aerial engineer and was training as a pilot. After mustering out of the army, he attended the University of Illinois, met his future wife, Blanche Ladenson, and graduated with High Honors in Philosophy, Phi Beta Kappa in 1948. In 1952, Singer earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy at Cornell University. Immediately on receiving his doctorate, Singer accepted a position teaching in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he continued to teach until 1994. Marcus lived with his wife, Blanche Ladenson Singer, for almost 70 years. He died February 21, 2016, after battling chronic illness, likely autoimmune. His curiosity, humor, enthusiasm for life and the larger issues of living continued almost until the end of life. Marcus has two daughters, Karen and Debra, and one grand child, Isaac. Karen Singer is Principal and Artistic Director of Karen Singer Tileworks. Debra Singer is a photographer/designer focused on environmental advocacy, also working at UCSF Medical Center in research program administration (Managing Director, Center for Cellular Construction, UCSF ). One of his closest friends was Claudia Card, Emma Goldman Professor of Philosophy, UW–Madison, whom he mentored since her undergraduate years at UW. She pre-deceased him by six months.

His brilliance manifested at a young age, with insatiable curiosity, quick wittedness, an interest in right and wrong. He served in the US Army Airforce to fight fascism in WW II - the war ended before he was sent to a front, but living through that time of evil profoundly influenced his thinking and actions. His family lost family in Germany and throughout Europe. His brother-in-law Lawrence Cane served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, fighting against Franco in Spain and was blacklisted as a Communist thinker (See &#x27;Fighting Fascism in Spain: The World War II Letters of An American Veteran of the Spanish Civil War.&#x27; MG Singer persisted in focusing on moral philosophy and ethics despite it being out of fashion in philosophical circles. In later years, he explained what he did as &#x27;teaching people how to think for themselves&#x27;, one of the most important endeavors one can do.

MG Singer served as Chairman of the UW Philosophy Department 1963–1968, during the Vietnam War Years. He served as the president of the American Philosophical Association, Central Division, from 1985 until 1986. He gave generously to support civil liberties, free thought, environmental and social justice, wildlife protection, indigenous peoples&#x27; rights, the right to clean air, water, soil, food for all, among other issues. He taught that to keep silent in the face of evil, especially that perpetrated by the culture around one, is to be complicit in that evil. His latest works focused on Evil, and a History of the UW Philosophy Department (to be published in the next year.)

==Works==
Singer&#x27;s early work describes a moral philosophy which has become known as the generalization argument. He further refines this philosophy in later works. Similar to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s universalizability principle, Singer argues that if it is acceptable for one person in a particular situation to take – or not take – an action, then it is acceptable for any person in that particular situation to do the same. He further posits that an action is ethical if the results would be positive if everyone took that action and the results would not be negative if no one took that action. According to Richard Flathman, Singer&#x27;s 1961 book, &quot;Generalization in Ethics – An Essay in the Logic of Ethics, with the Rudiments of a System of Moral Philosophy&quot;, was, at its publication, the &quot;most detailed study of the topic&quot; of generalization of the universalizability principle.

According to his profile in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ethics&quot;, Singer&#x27;s &quot;writings also include important work on the moral philosophies of&quot; John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick. Singer&#x27;s views of utilitarianism have also been noted as some of the most influential of modern ethicists.

His latest work as Emeritus Professor focused on Evil in the world. More to come from Debra Singer, who is Literary Executor of his works.

<doc id="596493" wikidata="Q7874697" url="?curid=596493" title="USS The Sullivans (DD-537)">
<text>USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (DD-537) is a retired United States Navy . The ship was named in honor of the five Sullivan brothers (George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert) aged 20 to 27 who died when the light cruiser, , was sunk by a Japanese submarine during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. This was the greatest military loss by any one American family during World War II. She was also the first ship commissioned in the Navy that honored more than one person.

After service in both World War II and the Korean War, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was assigned to the 6th Fleet and was a training ship until she was decommissioned on 7 January 1965.

In 1977, she and cruiser were processed for donation to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park in Buffalo, New York. The ship now serves as a memorial museum ship and is open for public tours. On 13 April 2022, the USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; partially sank from a severe hull breach.

==Construction and career==
&quot;The Sullivans&quot; was originally laid down as &quot;Putnam&quot; on 10 October 1942, at San Francisco by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. She was initially renamed &quot;Sullivan&quot; until President Franklin Roosevelt changed the name to &quot;The Sullivans&quot; to clarify that the name honored all five Sullivan brothers. The name was made official on 6 February 1943, and launched 4 April 1943. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan, the mother of the five Sullivan brothers. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was commissioned on 30 September 1943.

===1944===

Following a shakedown cruise, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; got underway with sister ships and on 23 December 1943. The group arrived at Pearl Harbor five days later. During training operations in Hawaiian waters, the ship was assigned to Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 52. On 16 January 1944, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor with Task Group 58.2 (TG 58.2) bound for the Marshall Islands. En route to Kwajalein Atoll the group was joined by Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9). Two days later, as the American warships neared their target, picket destroyers were sent ahead to protect the main force from the enemy. On 24 January, TG 58.2 arrived at the dawn launching point for air strikes against Roi. For two days, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; screened , , and as they launched nearly continuous aerial raids. Thereafter, the destroyer continued her operations to the north and northwest of Roi and Namur Islands throughout the Battle of Kwajalein until 4 February, when TG 58.2 retired to Majuro to refuel and replenish.

Underway at noon on the 12th, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; screened (protected) the sortie of Task Group 58.2, as part of Task Force 58&#x27;s raid on Truk. The same carriers—&quot;Essex&quot;, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and &quot;Cabot&quot;—whose planes had attacked Roi and Namur steamed in the van now headed for the Japanese fortress-base in the Central Pacific. From the time the group arrived at its launching point on 16 February, the carriers launched what seemed to be nearly continuous air strikes against Truk. &quot;No enemy opposition of any kind was encountered,&quot; wrote &quot;The Sullivans&quot;″ commander, &quot;indicating that the initial attacks came as a complete surprise.&quot;

While the enemy may have been slow to react at the outset, they soon struck back—torpedoing &quot;Intrepid&quot; at 00:10 on the 17th. The carrier slowed to and lost steering control. &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, , and stood by the stricken carrier and escorted her to Majuro for repairs. Reaching Majuro on 21 February, the destroyer soon sailed on to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 March for drydocking and upkeep.

Underway again on the 22nd, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; covered the sortie of Task Groups 58.2, 58.9, and 50.15 from Majuro, bound for the Palaus, Yap, and Woleai Islands. On the evening of the 29th, while the American warships were approaching the target area, enemy aircraft attacked but were driven off by the anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The next day, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; screened the carriers during air strikes and that evening helped to beat off a Japanese air attack.

After returning to Majuro for replenishment, the warship screened TG 58.2 during air strikes on Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), Tanahmerah, Wakde, and Aitape to support amphibious operations on New Guinea. Late in April, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; participated in support of air strikes on the Japanese base at Truk. On the 29th during one of these raids, the Japanese retaliated with a low-level air attack. American radar picked up four Japanese planes away, coming in fast at altitudes varying from 10 to . When the planes came within range, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; opened up with one 40-millimeter twin mount and all five guns. Two aircraft splashed into the sea due to the firing of the American ships, and one crossing ahead of &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was taken under fire and crashed in flames off her port beam.
&quot;The Sullivans&quot; arrived off the northwest coast of Ponape on the afternoon of 1 May and provided cover for the battleships led by which bombarded the island. From the disengaged side of the screen, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; fired 18 rounds from extreme range at Tumu Point. She then noted three beached Japanese landing barges and shifted her fire to them. However, she received the general cease-fire order shortly thereafter.

During the task unit&#x27;s retirement, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; refueled from and arrived at Majuro on 4 May. Ten days later, TG 58.2 sortied again, bound for Marcus and Wake Islands. Launching the first raid at 08:00 on the 19th, the American carriers kept up nearly continuous air strikes with no enemy interruptions for three days. En route back to Majuro, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and her sister destroyers conducted a thorough but unsuccessful search for a suspected submarine.

On 6 June, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; got underway again, bound for Saipan, Tinian, and Guam to screen carriers in conducting air strikes. On occasion while in the screen, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;″ radar picked up enemy &quot;snoopers&quot; around the periphery of the formation—and before dawn at 03:15 on the 12th, TG 58.2 shot down one in flames.

The second day&#x27;s strikes against Saipan took place on the 13th to support the American landings there. Assigned to the duty of communication-linking station between task forces, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; remained within visual sighting distance of both TG&#x27;s 58.1 and 58.2 during the day. That day, she picked up 31 Japanese merchant seamen after their ship had been sunk offshore and transferred these prisoners to flagship .

On 19 June 1944, during the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Japanese aircraft attacked the task group. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; picked up a plane visually at a range of less than . &quot;Judies&quot;, diving from , pressed home their attacks. One, taken under fire by &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, took tracer fire from the ship&#x27;s 20- and 40-millimeter batteries and, moments later, crashed just short of the horizon. American air attacks against Pagan Island, made without enemy retaliation, topped off the Saipan-Tinian-Guam strikes; and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; proceeded with TG 58.2 to Eniwetok for upkeep.

Underway on 30 June, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; resumed work in the screen of carriers launching air strikes to support operations against Saipan and Tinian. During this action, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; served as fighter direction ship for TU 58.2.4.

On Independence Day, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; joined Bombardment Unit One (TU 58.2.4) to conduct a shore bombardment of airfields, shore batteries, and other installations on the west coast of Iwo Jima. The heavy ships in the group opened fire at 15:00, and smoke and dust soon obscured targets along the western shore of the island, making spotting difficult. &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, second ship in a column of destroyers, opened fire at 15:48 on planes parked on the southern airstrip. After three ranging salvos, the ship commenced hitting twin-engined &quot;Bettys&quot; parked in revetments along the strip. &#x27;The Sullivans&quot; destroyed five planes, and shrapnel and burning gasoline likely damaged eight other planes. Minutes later, an enemy ship resembling an LST came under &quot;The Sullivans&quot;″ gunfire and caught fire astern. While closed to complete the destruction of the enemy vessel, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and the remainder of the bombardment unit retired and rejoined TG 58.2.

From 7 to 22 July, TG 58.2 operated south and west of the Marianas, conducting daily air strikes on Guam and Rota Islands before returning to Garapan Anchorage, Saipan, to allow the carriers to replenish bombs. Underway at dawn on the 23d, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; accompanied the task group as it sped towards the Palaus for air strikes on the 26th and 27th. She joined TG 58.4 for temporary duty on 30 July and continued air strikes until 6 August, when she joined TG 58.7, the heavy bombardment group, and operated with TP 34 until 11 August, when the group returned to Eniwetok for replenishment.

Early in September, as the Navy prepared to take the Palaus, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; supported neutralizing air strikes against Japanese air bases in the Philippines. At dawn on the 7th, she began radar picket duty for TG 38.2 and continued the task through the strikes of the 9th and 10th. From 18:00 on 12 September, the ships noted an increase in air activity—observing many bogies that merely orbited the formations as snoopers. The carriers conducted further raids on the central Philippines on the 13th and 14th and then shifted course to the north to subject Manila to air attacks commencing on the 21st. Three days later, American planes again hit the central Philippines.

Returning to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, at dawn on the 28th, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; went alongside for ammunition, provisions, and routine upkeep. However, the cross-swells in the anchorage swept &quot;The Sullivans&quot; hard against the battleship&#x27;s steel hide, damaging the destroyer&#x27;s hull and superstructure. Following brief antisubmarine patrol duty, she proceeded to Ulithi on 1 October.

While undergoing tender repairs alongside , &quot;The Sullivans&quot; formed part of a nest of destroyers blown away from the tender during a heavy storm that lashed the anchorage. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; drifted free downwind and got up steam &#x27;in a hurry&#x27;. However, she collided with . Many small boats were being tossed about, and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; rescued four men from &#x27;s gig before it disappeared beneath the waves. As the storm abated on the 4th, the warship returned to Ulithi to complete the abbreviated tender overhaul alongside &quot;Dixie&quot;.

At 16:15 on 6 October, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; sortied with the carriers and protected them during raids against targets on Formosa and the Ryukyus. On the evening of the 12th, as the planes returned to the carriers, radar spotted the first of many Japanese aircraft coming down from the north. For the next six hours, approximately 50 to 60 Japanese aircraft subjected the American task force to continuous air attacks. Nearly 45 minutes after sunset, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; sighted a &quot;Betty&quot;, coming in low on the starboard side, and took it under fire. During the next 15 minutes, the formation to which &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was attached shot down three planes; between 18:56 and 19:54, the destroyer herself took five planes under fire. Varying speed between 18 and , the formation undertook eight emergency maneuvers. Again and again, timely turns and the great volume of gunfire thrown up by the ships repulsed the enemy air attacks.

The second phase of the attack began at 21:05 on the 12th and continued through 02:35 on the 13th. The Japanese increased the use of &quot;window&quot; to jam American radar transmissions while their flares lit up the evening with ghostly light. The formation made smoke whenever enemy flare-dropping planes approached, creating an eerie haze effect which helped baffle the enemy pilots. Meanwhile, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and the other ships in formation executed 38 simultaneous turn movements at speeds between 22 and as their guns kept up a steady fire to repel the attackers.

The next day, the carriers again launched successful strikes on Formosa. During the ensuing night retirement, the formation again came under attack by Japanese torpedo-carrying &quot;Betties&quot; which struck home this time and damaged . &quot;The Sullivans&quot; then helped to protect the damaged cruiser. On the 14th, &quot;Betty&quot; torpedo bombers scored against .&quot;The Sullivans&quot; soon joined the screen which guarded the two battle-battered cruisers—nicknamed &quot;CripDiv 1&quot;—as they retired toward Ulithi.

Things progressed well until the 16th, when the Japanese mounted a heavy air attack to attempt to finish off cruisers. &quot;Houston&quot; reeled under the impact of a second hit astern, and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; opened fire on the &quot;Frances&quot; which had made the attack and splashed the Japanese plane. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and then took a second &quot;Frances&quot; under fire and knocked it down off the bow of .

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; rescued 118 &quot;Houston&quot; men and kept them on board until the 18th, when she transferred them to . While the damaged cruisers were making their way to Ulithi, a Japanese surface force attempted to close the formation before TF 38 intervened to drive them back. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; transferred salvage gear to &quot;Houston&quot; and helped with the ship&#x27;s many wounded. For his part in directing the destroyer&#x27;s rescue and salvage attempts, Comdr. Ralph J. Baum received his first Silver Star.

On 20 October, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; joined TG 38.2 for scheduled air strikes on the central Philippines in support of the Leyte landings. At dawn of the 24th, reconnaissance located a Japanese surface force south of Mindoro, and the American carriers launched air strikes all day against the enemy warships. That morning, a Japanese air attack developed, and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; downed an &quot;Oscar&quot; fighter plane.

By 25 October, enemy forces were sighted coming down from the north; TF 34, including &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, was formed and headed north, following the carrier groups in TF 38. At dawn on the 25th, the carriers launched air strikes to harass the Japanese surface units, now some north. At 11:00, TF 34 reversed course, topped-off the destroyers with fuel, and formed fast striking group TG 34.5, with &quot;Iowa&quot;, , three light cruisers, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, and seven other destroyers. The American force missed the Japanese by three hours, but ran across a straggler and reported sinking an . Japanese records fail to confirm the claim.

After sweeping south along the coast of Samar hunting for enemy &quot;cripples&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and other units of TG 34.5 reported back to TG 38.2. The destroyer then remained in the Philippine area, screening the fast carriers and standing by on plane guard duties, through mid-November. At dusk on the 19th, during one of the many air attacks fought off by &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, the destroyer damaged a &quot;Betty&quot; by gunfire and watched it disappear over the horizon, smoking but stubbornly remaining airborne. Six days later, she had better luck when her guns set a Japanese plane afire and splashed it into the sea. Two days later, her task group returned to Ulithi.

The destroyer undertook training exercises from 8 to 11 December before rejoining TG 38.2 to screen its warships during air strikes on Manila and southern Luzon beginning on 14 December. On the 17th, running low on fuel, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; commenced refueling but, with the weather worsening minute by minute, she broke off the operation. Typhoon Cobra swept through the Fleet, with the wind clocked at an estimated on the morning of 18 December. Three destroyers were sunk and several ships damaged by the winds and waves. &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, her &quot;lucky shamrock&quot; painted on her funnel, emerged from the typhoon undamaged and, on the 20th began searching for men lost overboard from other ships. The lingering bad weather resulted in cancellation of air strikes, and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; retired to Ulithi on Christmas Eve.

===1945===
After a brief run to Manus and back, escorting &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; sortied from Ulithi on 30 December to screen TG 38.2&#x27;s air strikes on Formosa in support of the American landings on Luzon. Heavy seas forced a three-day postponement of a high-speed thrust toward the target originally planned for the night of 6 January 1945. During the evening of the 9th, the task force passed through the Bashi Channel and entered the South China Sea. Three days later, carrier planes from TG 38.2 swept over Saigon and Camranh Bay, Indochina, hammering at whatever enemy merchantmen they found.

Soon after the conclusion of the air strikes, a bombardment group, TG 34.5, was formed to go after possible &quot;cripples&quot; and dispatch them by surface gunfire. Accordingly, two battleships, two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and 15 destroyers raced into Camranh Bay but found it devoid of Japanese shipping. Throughout the day, however, carrier pilots had better luck and enjoyed a veritable &quot;field day&quot; with coastal &quot;marus&quot;. During subsequent air strikes on Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and Formosa, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; served on radar picket duty ahead of the task group.

A brief respite for upkeep at Ulithi in late January preceded the ship&#x27;s deployment with TG 58.2, covering the carriers as they launched devastating air strikes against the Japanese homeland itself, hitting Tokyo and other targets on Honshū on 16 and 17 February. From the 18th through the 21st, American carrier-based air power struck at Japanese positions contesting the landings on Iwo Jima. More strikes were scheduled for Tokyo four days later, but bad weather forced their cancellation. Retiring from the area, TF 58 fueled and commenced a high-speed run at Okinawa at noon on 28 February. Later that day, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; sighted and destroyed a drifting mine. At dawn on 1 March, Hellcats, Avengers, Dauntlesses, and Helldivers attacked Japanese positions on Okinawa. The ships of the task force encountered no enemy opposition from sea or sky and soon retired towards Ulithi.

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; sortied 12 days later, bound for Kyushu and southern Honshū to support the invasion of Okinawa. Once again screening for TG 58.2, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; stood by as the carriers launched air strikes on 14 March. On 20 March, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; fueled from at 11:52, clearing the carrier&#x27;s side five minutes later when a kamikaze alert sent the ships scurrying.

At 14:39, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; commenced maneuvering to go alongside &quot;Enterprise&quot; again—this time to pick up a part for her FD radar antenna. Soon, however, another enemy air attack scattered the ships. As a line had not yet been thrown across to the carrier, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; bent on speed and cleared her as other ships in the task group opened fire on the attackers. A Japanese plane came through the antiaircraft fire and crashed into astern as that destroyer was fueling alongside . The stricken destroyer lost steering control and started to veer across the big carrier&#x27;s bow, and only rapid and radical maneuvering on &quot;Hancock&quot;″s part averted a collision.

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; soon closed &quot;Halsey Powell&quot; to render emergency assistance. She slowed to a stop 11 minutes later and lowered her motor whaleboat to transfer her medical officer and a pharmacist&#x27;s mate to &quot;Halsey Powell&quot;, when another kamikaze came out of the skies, apparently bent on crashing into &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. At 16:10, the destroyer&#x27;s radar picked up the &quot;Zeke&quot; on its approach; and, as soon as the motor whaler was clear of the water, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; leapt ahead with all engines thrusting at flank speed.

Bringing right full rudder, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; maneuvered radically while her 20- and 40-millimeter guns sent streams of shells at the &quot;Zeke&quot;, which passed over the masthead and escaped. Meanwhile, &quot;Halsey Powell&quot; managed to achieve a steady course at five knots; and, with &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, she retired toward Ulithi. However, their troubles were not yet over. At 10:46 on the following day, 21 March, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; picked up a plane, closing from . Visually identified as a twin-engined &quot;Frances&quot;, the aircraft was taken under fire at by &quot;The Sullivans&quot;″ 5-inch battery. &quot;Halsey Powell&quot; joined in too; and, within a few moments, the &quot;Frances&quot; crashed into the sea about abeam of &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. At 12:50, a combat air patrol (CAP) Hellcat from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, under direction by &quot;Halsey Powell&quot;, splashed another &quot;Frances&quot;. At 13:20, a CAP Hellcat from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, directed by &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, downed a &quot;Nick&quot; or &quot;Dinah&quot;.

On 25 March, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and &quot;Halsey Powell&quot; arrived at Ulithi, the former for upkeep prior to training exercises and the latter for battle repairs.

The warship next rendezvoused with TF 58 off Okinawa and guarded the carriers supporting the landings on the island. While operating on radar picket duty on the 15th, the ship came under enemy air attack, but downed one plane and emerged unscathed. She continued conducting radar picket patrols for the task group, ranging some 12 to out from the main body of the force. On the afternoon of 29 April, she commenced fueling from , but a kamikaze alert interrupted the replenishment, forcing &quot;The Sullivans&quot; to break away from the carrier&#x27;s side. During the ensuing action, and were both crashed by kamikazes but survived.
Kamikazes continued to plague the ships of TG 58.3 as they supported the troops fighting ashore on Okinawa. Everything from landing craft to battleships were targeted. On the morning of 11 May, a kamikaze crashed into &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; promptly closed the carrier to render assistance and picked up 166 men forced over the side by the fires that at one point ravaged the ship. After transferring them to ships in TG 50.8 and replenishing her fuel bunkers, she helped to screen TG 58.3 during air strikes on Kyushu.

In a morning air attack three days later, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was hit by a kamikaze. Four enemy planes were shot down in the melee—one by &quot;The Sullivans&quot; in what proved to be her last combat action during World War II.

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; anchored at San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, on 1 June for recreation and upkeep. She departed Leyte on the 20th, bound, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for the west coast. The destroyer arrived at Mare Island, Calif., on 9 July and, two days later, commenced her overhaul. She thus missed the final fleet activity that closed the war.

Meanwhile, since the return of peace greatly reduced the Navy&#x27;s need for warships, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 10 January 1946—soon after her overhaul was completed—and she was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

==Korean War service==

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; remained decommissioned at San Diego until May 1951, when she began to undergo reactivation. This was due to naval fleet expansion because of the Korean War. She was recommissioned on 6 July 1951. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; soon headed to her home port in Newport, R.I. by way of the Panama Canal. During the winter of 1951–52, the ship conducted training exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; departed Newport on 6 September 1952 bound for Japan. Proceeding via the Panama Canal, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Midway she arrived at Sasebo, Japan on 10 October 1952. The next day she got underway to join Task Force 77 off the eastern shores of Korea. Her duties included screening the fast carriers which were launching repeated air strikes to interdict enemy supply lines. She also supported United Nations ground forces who were battling communist forces. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; remained on this duty until 20 October 1952 when she steamed to Yokosuka, Japan for a brief refit.
Following the refit, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; stopped at Buckner Bay, Okinawa and then proceeded to rejoin Task Force 77. Upon her arrival on 16 November 1952 she resumed screening activities and plane guard duty. She supported the carriers as they made the northernmost stab at North Korean supply lines, approaching within of the Soviet base at Vladivostok, Russia. MiG-15 fighters approached the task force, but combat air patrol Grumman F9F Panthers downed two of the attackers and damaged a third in history&#x27;s first engagement between jet fighters over water. The destroyer arrived back at Sasebo, Japan on 5 December 1952. From Sasebo she joined United Nations forces on 14 December 1952 in blockading the Korean coasts. Her mission was to interdict seaborne traffic and bombard shore targets to support United Nations ground troops and interdict enemy supply operations. Arriving in Area &quot;G&quot; the following day, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; made contact with the enemy on the 16th off Songjin, North Korea which was an important rail terminus and supply center. For the next few days, she bombarded railroad trains and tunnels. She frequently opened fire to destroy railroad rolling stock, depots, and prevented repairs to railroad tracks and buildings.

On Christmas Day 1952, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; scored direct hits on a railroad bridge while under fire from enemy artillery positions on shore. Fifty rounds from enemy guns failed to touch the ship, although near-misses showered the warship&#x27;s decks with shell fragments. Counter-battery fire from the ship destroyed at least one of the enemy artillery positions.

&quot;The Sullivans&quot; was ordered home and departed Yokosuka, Japan on 26 January 1953. On the voyage home the ship called at Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Hong Kong; Subic Bay; Singapore, Colombo, Ceylon; Bombay, India; Bahrain and Aden. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; then steamed through the Red Sea, transited the Suez Canal, and proceeded to Cannes, France, via Naples. After a brief fueling stop at Gibraltar the warship reached Newport, R.I. on 11 April 1953.

==6th Fleet deployment==

The destroyer operated out of her home port well into the summer of 1953, before deploying to the Mediterranean for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. She remained on this duty through the end of the year and returned to Newport on 3 February 1954 for operations off the east coast and into the Caribbean through May 1955. She again deployed to European and Mediterranean waters from May to August of that year before returning to Newport late in the summer.

In the years that followed, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; continued alternating east coast operations with Mediterranean deployments. The summer of 1958 saw a communist threat to the security of Lebanon, and president Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered American ships to land troops there to protect Americans and to help stabilize the tense situation. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; supported the landings of Marines at Beirut. After their presence had dispelled the crisis, she returned to the United States for a three-month navy yard overhaul and subsequent refresher training at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Back at Newport in March 1959, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; joined a hunter/killer group formed around the aircraft carrier . Then, after making a midshipman training cruise for USNA and NROTC midshipmen in which she also conducted antisubmarine warfare operations, the destroyer sailed for another Mediterranean deployment which lasted until she returned home in the autumn.

Operations out of Newport occupied &quot;The Sullivans&quot; until early spring of 1960 when she headed south for ASROC evaluations off Key West, Florida. During this deployment to southern climes, on 31 March and 1 April, the warship helped to rescue five of eleven survivors from a U.S. Air Force KC-97 Stratofreighter(Model F Stratotanker) that had ditched 40 miles off the Florida coast near Cape Canaveral.

Following NATO exercises in September, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; visited Lisbon, Portugal, prior to a quick trip through the Mediterranean, Suez Canal, and Red Sea, to Karachi, West Pakistan. In late October and into November, she participated in Operation &quot;Midlink III&quot;, joint operations with Pakistani, Iranian, and British warships. After returning to the Mediterranean, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; conducted exercises with the French Navy and with the 6th Fleet and reached home in time for Christmas.

In January 1961, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; assisted in the sea trials of the nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarine off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, before steaming south and taking part in Operation Springboard. While in the Caribbean, she visited Martinique. Briefly back at Newport early in March, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; soon returned to the West Indies to support marine landing exercises at Vieques, Puerto Rico.

In April, the ship began intensive training in the waters off Florida to prepare to cover a Project Mercury spaceshot. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; joined &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and took station. On 5 May 1961, Commander Alan Shepard&#x27;s Mercury space capsule, Freedom 7, passed overhead and splashed down near &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; and was speedily rescued by helicopters from the carrier. &quot;The Sullivans&quot; then made a midshipman cruise in June, visiting New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

From September 1961 to February 1962, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; underwent a major overhaul in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She proceeded to Guantanamo Bay soon thereafter to train for duty as a school ship. She subsequently served as a model destroyer in which officer students could see and learn the fundamentals of destroyer operation. In May and again in August, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; made training cruises to the Caribbean for the Destroyer School.

In October 1962, after Soviet missiles were discovered in Cuba, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; joined American naval forces blockading the island during negotiations with the Soviet Union over the issue. When the Soviet Government withdrew the strategic weapons, the destroyer returned to Newport.

On 7 January 1963, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; got underway from Newport bound for the Caribbean and another training cruise. Following her return to Newport, she conducted local operations for the Destroyer School. The tragic loss of nuclear submarine off Boston on 10 April 1963 caused the destroyer to support emergency investigations of the disaster.

For the remainder of 1963 and into the first few months of 1964, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; continued to train officer students. On 1 April 1964, the destroyer was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force, and her homeport was changed to New York City. Departing Newport on 13 April, the warship proceeded to New York and took on her selected reserve crew. Her cruises with the reserves embarked were devoted mostly to ASW exercises and took the ship to Canadian ports such as Halifax, Nova Scotia; Saint John, New Brunswick; and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in the north; and to Palm Beach, Florida, in the south.

After the collision of the Australian aircraft carrier and destroyer , which resulted in the sinking of &quot;Voyager&quot; on 10 February 1964, the United States offered &quot;The Sullivans&quot; to Australia along with sister ship as a temporary replacement. The Royal Australian Navy instead accepted the British Royal Navy&#x27;s offer of the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer , which was of the same class as &quot;Voyager&quot;.

==Museum ship==
&quot;The Sullivans&quot; received nine battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean service. On 7 January 1965, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and she remained in reserve into the 1970s. In 1977, she and cruiser were processed for donation to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park in Buffalo, New York. The ship now serves as a memorial and is open for public tours.

The ship was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. On 26 February 2021 it was reported that &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was taking on water and listing. It was stated that the ship&#x27;s age and possible weather damage were the most likely cause for the leak below the waterline.

On 14 April 2022, the ship began to list and appeared to sit lower in the water than usual; crews told a reporter that electrical power to the ship had been lost. A later public statement reported &quot;a serious hull breach&quot; that was under investigation, with part of the ship resting on the riverbed, but still mostly above water. An assessment below deck in May called the damage to the ship&#x27;s interior considerable.

In August 2022, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; reopened for visits after repairs.

In summer 2023, the park began work to winterize the ship to protect her. This included adding an improved communications and sensor system to warn of leaks, replacing mooring lines, shoring up bulkheads and replacing gaskets, and adding dehumidifiers and other equipment. The park has plans to drydock the ship by late 2024 in either Erie or Cleveland, but must raise substantial amounts of money to accomplish the move and tow, as well as drydock repairs. Estimates are that at least $10-$12 million is required for the towing. 

As of June 2024, the ship&#x27;s lower decks were closed to visitors and only the main deck and part of the superstructure were open.

== Awards ==
&quot;The Sullivans&quot; earned nine battle stars in World War II and another two more during the Korean War.

<text>Valentine Dyall (7 May 1908 – 24 June 1985) was an English character actor. He worked regularly as a voice actor, and was known for many years as &quot;The Man in Black&quot;, the narrator of the BBC Radio horror series &quot;Appointment with Fear&quot;.

He was the son of the actor Franklin Dyall and the actress and author Mary Phyllis Joan Logan, who acted and wrote as Concordia Merrel.

== 1930s to 1950s ==
In 1934, Dyall appeared with his father, actor Franklin Dyall, at the Manchester Hippodrome in Sir Oswald Stoll&#x27;s presentation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, playing the roles of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Captain Gower, and a cardinal of France. He also appeared in one movie with his father, the 1943 spy thriller &quot;Yellow Canary&quot;; Dyall&#x27;s part was that of a German U-boat commander attempting to kidnap a British agent from a ship in the Atlantic, while his father played the ship&#x27;s captain. 

In the same year he had a small role as a German officer in &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; and, the following year, played the Duke of Burgundy in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film version of &quot;Henry V&quot;.

In 1946, he appeared, uncredited, as the character Stephen Lynn in the romantic film drama &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;; Lynn is protagonist Alec Harvey&#x27;s friend whose unexpected arrival spoils Alec&#x27;s opportunity of consummating his romance.

Dyall&#x27;s film career peaked in the late 1940s; in 1949 he appeared in 12 films in that single year. However, those film roles varied greatly in size: two of them were leading roles (in &quot;Doctor Morelle&quot; and &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot;) whilst several others were just bit parts.

During the 1950s, Dyall made several guest appearances in episodes of the BBC Home Service radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, parodying his familiar radio persona.

In 1960, he played the witch Jethrow Keane in &quot;The City of the Dead&quot; (known as &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; in the United States).

== 1960s ==
Dyall appeared in Robert Wise&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Haunting&quot; as Mr. Dudley, the sinister caretaker of the haunted Hill House. Also that year, he played the central character Lord Fortnum in Spike Milligan and John Antrobus&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot;, set in the aftermath of nuclear war. The play opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 31 January. Dyall narrated the mondo documentary &quot;The Mystery and the Pleasure&quot; in 1966, and part-narrated the pseudo-documentary &quot;The Naked World of Harrison Marks&quot; in 1967. In the same year he voiced the character of evil mastermind Dr. Noah in the James Bond parody film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;; as well as the unseen God in Faust Legend-inspired comedy &quot;Bedazzled&quot;, for which he was uncredited. He later provided the voice of the mummy narrator in &quot;Secrets of Sex&quot; (1969).

With Dusty Springfield, Dyall co-hosted the BBC music variety series &quot;Decidedly Dusty&quot; in 1969; no complete episode has survived.

== 1970s and 1980s ==
In 1975, at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre, Dyall played Dr. Rance in a major revival of Joe Orton&#x27;s play &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;. Between 1977 and 1979, he appeared as Dr. Pascal Keldermans in the BBC television series &quot;Secret Army&quot;. He was in the cast of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to portray the Black Guardian in several serials (&quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot; from 1979 and the &quot;Mawdryn Undead&#x27;Terminus&#x27;Enlightenment&quot; trilogy in 1983). At around the same time as &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;, he featured in the radio version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, playing Gargravarr. In the TV and LP versions, he voiced the computer Deep Thought. He also played the character Norl in the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;City at the Edge of the World&quot; and Lord Angus in the 1983 &quot;Black Adder&quot; episode &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;. Also in 1983, he joined many other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cast and crew members at Longleat for the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary celebrations.

In 1984, Dyall appeared in the BBC &quot;Miss Marple&quot; episode &quot;The Body in the Library&quot;. His last role on television was as Marcade in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. His role as Captain Slarn in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; radio serial &quot;Slipback&quot; was recorded on 10 June 1985, just 14 days before his death, and was broadcast posthumously.

The 1985 Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons album, First Quest, credits narration by the late Valentine Dyall.

<text>Ostuni (; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot;, located about 8 km from the coast, in the province of Brindisi, region of Apulia, Italy. The town has a population of about 32,000 during the winter, but can swell to 200,000 inhabitants during summer, being among the main towns attracting tourists in Apulia. It also has a continuous British and German immigrant community and an industrial zone. The region is a producer of high quality olive oil and wine.

== History ==

The region around Ostuni has been inhabited since the Stone Age. The town is reputed to have been originally established by the Messapii, a pre-classic tribe, and was nearly completely destroyed by Hannibal during the Punic Wars. Later it was re-built by the Romans.

Little is also known about the etymology of the name Ostuni. According to one theory, the name could derive from Messapic. Others think it derives from the Greek &quot;Astu néon&quot; (&quot;new town&quot;). It could derive from the Latin &quot;Hostium Unio&quot;, which indicates &quot;a group of people of different origins&quot;.

Sacked after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in 996 AD the town became part of the Norman County of Lecce. The Normans built their medieval town around the summit of the hill (229 m), with a castle (only remains can be seen) and city walls with four gates. From 1300 to 1463 it was part of the Principality of Taranto and from 1507 (together with what is now the &quot;frazione&quot; of Villanova and Grottaglie) passed to Isabella, Duchess of Bari, wife of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. Under Isabella&#x27;s rule, Ostuni thrived during the Italian Renaissance. Isabella protected humanists and people of art and letters, including bishop Giovanni Bovio. She died in 1524 and Ostuni passed as a dowry to her daughter Bona Sforza, wife-to-be of Sigismund I of Poland, King of Poland. During Bona Sforza&#x27;s government, Ostuni continued to enjoy a stable rule. In 1539 she had towers built along all the shoreline as protection against anticipated attacks from Turks who controlled the Balkans. These towers (still extant, including Pozzella Tower, the Pylon, Villanova and others), were garrisoned and communicated using fiery beacons.

== Main sights ==

The &quot;Old Town&quot; is Ostuni&#x27;s citadel built on top of a hill and still fortified by the ancient walls. Ostuni is commonly referred to as &quot;the White Town&quot; (&quot;La Città Bianca&quot; in Italian) for its white walls and its typically white-painted architecture. Monuments in their own right, the town&#x27;s largest buildings are the Ostuni Cathedral and the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, together with a number of palazzi of local aristocratic families: Aurisicchio, Ayroldi, Bisantizzi, Falghieri, Ghionda, Giovine, Jurleo, Marseglia, Moro, Palmieri, Petrarolo, Sansone, Siccoda, Tanzarella, Urselli and Zaccaria.

In the surrounding countryside there are typical Pugliese &quot;masserie&quot;, fortified large estate-farms, one of which, San Domenico, was once held by the Knights of Malta.

== Tourism ==

Ostuni is the fifth city in Italy by percentage of British residents and the first for sale of houses and villas. Starting from 2010, Ostuni and its nearest towns were characterized by so many arrivals from foreign countries, that some local and national newspapers coined a new term, &quot;salentoshire&quot; to describe this phenomenon, taking the term from the useful &quot;chiantishire&quot;, taken for the similar phenomenon that has characterized Tuscany some years ago.

<doc id="596503" wikidata="Q1397913" url="?curid=596503" title="Fat tree">
<text>The fat tree network is a universal network for provably efficient communication. It was invented by Charles E. Leiserson of the MIT in 1985. k-ary n-trees, the type of fat-trees commonly used in most high-performance networks, were initially formalized in 1997.

In a tree data structure, every branch has the same thickness (bandwidth), regardless of their place in the hierarchy—they are all &quot;skinny&quot; (&quot;skinny&quot; in this context means low-bandwidth). In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are &quot;fatter&quot; (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy. In a telecommunications network, the branches are data links; the varied thickness (bandwidth) of the data links allows for more efficient and technology-specific use.

Mesh and hypercube topologies have communication requirements that follow a rigid algorithm, and cannot be tailored to specific packaging technologies.

==Applications in supercomputers==
Supercomputers that use a fat tree network include the two fastest as of late 2018, Summit and Sierra, as well as Tianhe-2, the Meiko Scientific CS-2, Yellowstone, the Earth Simulator, the Cray X2, the Connection Machine CM-5, and various Altix supercomputers.

Mercury Computer Systems applied a variant of the fat tree topology—the hypertree network—to their multicomputers. In this architecture, 2 to 360 compute nodes are arranged in a circuit-switched fat tree network. Each node has local memory that can be mapped by any other node. Each node in this heterogeneous system could be an Intel i860, a PowerPC, or a group of three SHARC digital signal processors.

The fat tree network was particularly well suited to fast Fourier transform computations, which customers used for such signal processing tasks as radar, sonar, and medical imaging.

==Related topologies==
In August 2008, a team of computer scientists at UCSD published a scalable design for network architecture that uses a topology inspired by the fat tree topology to realize networks that scale better than those of previous hierarchical networks. The architecture uses commodity switches that are cheaper and more power-efficient than high-end modular data center switches.

This topology is actually a special instance of a Clos network, rather than a fat-tree as described above. That is because the edges near the root are emulated by many links to separate parents instead of a single high-capacity link to a single parent. However, many authors continue to use the term in this way.

<doc id="596516" wikidata="Q8195084" url="?curid=596516" title="Mahjong tiles">
<text>Mahjong tiles () are tiles of Chinese origin that are used to play mahjong as well as mahjong solitaire and other games. Although they are most commonly tiles, they may refer to playing cards with similar contents as well.

== Development ==

The earliest surviving mahjong sets date to the 1870s when the game was largely confined to Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu. They already exhibited various traits found in modern sets. The core of the set is the 108 suited tiles which were inherited from Chinese money-suited playing cards. The Wind honor tiles and the Four Seasons tiles were also found in the earliest sets. The honor tiles known as Arrows (Dragons in English) developed to their current form by 1890 concurrent with a new style of play called &quot;Zhōngfā&quot; (中發). Flower tiles, once known as Outer Flowers (), were not universally accepted until the 1920s. In contrast, many early sets contained wild cards with specific powers known as Inner Flowers () which disappeared from most of China but are still found in Vietnam and Thailand.

== Contents ==
===Full set===

A set of Mahjong tiles will usually differ from place to place. It usually has at least 136 tiles (four copies of each of the Suit and Honor Tiles), most commonly 144, although sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will usually feature more tiles in the form of flowers or Jokers. Some sets also contain blank tiles which owners can use to replace damaged or missing tiles.

Mahjong tiles can be organized into several categories:

=== Suited tiles ===
&quot;Suited tiles&quot; (; also ; also ) have a suit and a rank. There are three money-based suits with ranks ranging from one to nine. There are four tiles of each rank and suit combination, thus there are 36 tiles in a suit, and 108 suited tiles in total. To refer to a suited tile, the rank is named, followed by the suit. The ones and nines of each suit () are collectively referred to as the &quot;terminal tiles&quot;. Suited tiles may be used to form melds.

==== Circles ====
The &quot;circle (dot, coin, wheel, stone) suit&quot; (; also ) is represented by a series of circles.

The 1 Circle is generally a large circle of multiple colors, while the rest of the circle tiles consist of smaller circles, each circle being of one color. The 2 Circle consists of a green and a blue circle, the 3 consisting of one green, one red, and one blue circle arranged diagonally (the order the circles appear in, as well as the orientation, differs between sets). The 4 Circle has two blue circles and two green circles, arranged in a rectangle with circles of like color in opposite corners. The 5 Circle is similar to the 4 Circle, with another circle (its color depending on the set) in the middle. The 6 Circle consists of two green circles at the top and four red circles in the bottom (with a space between the green and red circles). The 7 Circle is similar to the 6 Circle, but has 3 green circles arranged diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. The 8 Circle has eight blue circles arranged in a 2x4 rectangle. The 9 Circle has three each of green, red, and blue circles, with each color occupying a row. There is some space between each row, and the middle row is always of the red circles (the blue and green, of course, depends on the orientation of the tile).

Because of the large size of the circle in the 1 Circle, it is commonly nicknamed &quot;da bing&quot; (大餅 pinyin &quot;dàbǐng&quot;, literally: &quot;big pancake&quot;).

From the monetary origin of this suit, the circles represent the copper coins known in English as &quot;cash&quot;. (1銅=one copper coin).

==== Bamboo ====

The &quot;bamboo (stick, string, bam) suit&quot; (; also ), with the exception of the 1 Bamboo, which is commonly represented by a bird (like , or ), is represented by outlines of sticks.

 or
The 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 Bamboo are represented entirely out of green sticks only or blue and green sticks, while the middle stick in the 5 Bamboo, the top stick of the 7 Bamboo, and the sticks along the center column of the 9 Bamboo are red. Some sets may also have the sticks along the bottom row or center column of the 7 Bamboo in blue. The 8 Bamboo has its sticks forming an M-shape and its mirror image.

From the monetary origin of this suit, the sticks are actually rope strings (索) that tie 100 Chinese copper coins together by the square holes in the middle. (1索=100銅) The repeated bumps in the sticks depict the individual coins in the strings, but they were mistaken by Joseph Park Babcock as the knots on the bamboo plants, hence the English name of the suit. The 1 Bamboo, as it commonly depicts a bird, is often referred as &quot;the sparrow&quot; (麻雀 - &quot;má què&quot;); in Japan it is most commonly a peacock. In early sets, there was no bird but a single bent string of cash capped with a red knot ().

==== Characters ====

The &quot;character (myriad, number, crack) suit&quot; () is represented by Chinese characters.

The rank of the tile is represented at the top, in blue, with Chinese numerals, while the character below (萬 &quot;wàn&quot;, meaning myriad) is in red. Older sets used the cursive character 万 when tiles were still hand-carved. Fujianese sets use 品 (&quot;pǐn&quot;, rank). Most sets use the character 伍 () for five instead of 五 ().

From the monetary origin of this suit, the myriads (10,000) are actually 100 strings of coins described in the bamboo suit section above. One myriad equals ten thousand coins or 100 strings of 100 coins. (1萬=100索×100銅)

==== Red tiles ====
&quot;Red tiles&quot; () are unique to the Japanese set. They appear as a red version of tiles from each suit and are not quadruplicated. They first appeared in the 1970s with the Red 5 Circle which were followed with red 5 tiles for the other suits. Red 3s and 7s later appeared and were followed by red 1s and 9s although they are much less commonly found in sets than red 5s. There is also a rare red white dragon (白ポッチ, &quot;shiro pocchi&quot;) which can act as a wild card if &quot;tsumo&quot; conditions are met.

 These tiles are entirely optional. When inserted into play, one copy of its regular non-red counterpart is removed. They increase the score when melded. Japanese sets typically do not include the Four Gentlemen flower tiles to make room for the red tiles as flower tiles are rarely used in Japanese Mahjong anyway. Some mahjong parlours will have their own house tiles which may be red tiles for even ranks, even higher-scoring green tiles or gold tiles (), or colored wind tiles.

=== Honor tiles ===
&quot;Honor tiles&quot; (字牌, pinyin: &quot;zìpái&quot;, Japanese romaji: &quot;jihai&quot;, meaning &#x27;word tiles&#x27;; or 番子, jyutping: &quot;faan1zi2&quot;, &#x27;exponentials&#x27;) have neither rank nor suit but like suited tiles they are also formed into melds. They are divided into two categories: four Wind tiles (風牌/风牌, pinyin: &quot;fēngpái&quot;, jyutping: &quot;fung1paai2&quot;, Japanese romaji: &quot;fompai&quot; or &quot;kazehai&quot;) and three Dragon tiles (三元牌, pinyin: &quot;sānyuánpái&quot;, jyutping: &quot;saam1jyun4paai2&quot;, Japanese romaji: &quot;sangempai&quot;), each of which is quadruplicated. Thus, there are 16 wind tiles and 12 Dragon tiles for 28 honor tiles.

==== Winds ====
The four types of &quot;Wind tiles&quot; are:

* East (),
* South (),
* West (), and
* North ().

Their Chinese characters are usually in blue, like 東, 南, 西 and 北.

Each type of Wind tiles corresponds to a point along the compass, written in blue traditional Chinese characters (even for sets where the Character tiles are written in simplified Chinese). Bonus points are scored if melds match the seat wind or prevailing wind or both. They are also known as the Four Joyous Tiles ().

==== Dragons ====
The three types of &quot;Dragon tiles&quot; are:

 or
 or
* White (; also ) - a tile which can be without any markings like , although most modern sets employ tiles with a blue border (like or ) to distinguish them from replacement tiles. Anglophone sets may also have a black letter P in the center of the tile, denoting the first letter of the Wade-Giles romanization of 白 (&quot;pai&quot;). Japanese tiles of this kind have no mark on them, and are occasionally dubbed &quot;tofu&quot; (bean curd) in some Japanese mahjong clubs. As noted above, there is a Japanese red tile version ().
* Green (; also ; also ) - a tile with a green traditional Chinese character (發), even for sets where the Character tiles are written in simplified Chinese. Often the variant character U+24F35 𤼵 (癶 over 弓矢 instead of 弓殳) is used. It is a contraction of 發財/发财 (pinyin: &quot;fā cái&quot;) which loosely means &quot;to strike it rich&quot;). Some sets, notably American, use a green dragon in place of the character or may also have a black letter F in a corner of the tile, denoting the first letter from its transliteration. This tile was absent in the earliest sets. Some tiles have the traditional Chinese character &quot;鳳&quot; () or a green dragon icon.
* Red (; also ) - a tile with a red traditional Chinese character (中) meaning center or middle. Sets for English speakers may also have a black letter C in a corner of the tile, denoting the first letter of the Wade-Giles romanization of 中 (&quot;chung&quot;). One of the earliest sets did not include these tiles. Some tiles have the traditional Chinese character &quot;龍&quot; () or a red dragon icon.

The Chinese name for the Dragon tiles means &quot;three fundamental tiles&quot; (三元牌). They are also known as the arrow tiles (箭牌). The English name (&quot;Dragons&quot;) was an invention by Babcock. They are like wind tiles except melding them will always score bonus points regardless of the prevailing or seat wind. These tiles were invented after the wind tiles beginning with the whites which were developed from replacement tiles, followed by the reds circa 1870, and finally the greens which entered the set by 1890.
Chinese characters occur in the design of the Characters, the Winds and the Dragons. Regular script (楷書) is usually used in the areas of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canton, China and Southeast Asia, while Semi-cursive script (行書) is usually used in Japan.

=== Flower tiles ===
&quot;Flower tiles&quot; () are not used in melds. When drawn, they are set aside and the player gets to draw again but from the dead wall. These tiles usually depict stylized representations of flowers in many colors (hence the name). Nevertheless, other non-floral themes also exist, which vary from set to set. In American Mahjong, they are treated as honor tiles but from the 1930s to 1960 they were considered jokers. Some Japanese players treat them as higher scoring honors that cannot be used to form &#x27;eyes&#x27; (pairs). Generally, however, they are not used in Japanese mahjong.

==== Quartets ====
The average set, if it contains flower tiles, will have two quartets of flower tiles, differentiating the color and/or style of the labels. Each quartet contains four unique tiles, which are numbered from 1 to 4 or otherwise distinctly labelled (common Chinese sets will have one quartet with blue Arabic numerals and the other group having red Chinese numerals). Each number matches a seat (1=East, 2=South, 3=West, 4=North). Winners can double their score if the number on their flowers matches their seat number. There are also bonuses from collecting an entire quartet and in some variations, immediately winning from collecting all the flowers. As they reward points for pure luck, many games do not include them or are considered optional.

The four tiles in the Four Seasons () quartet are:

 or or 
# Spring ()
# Summer ()
# Autumn ()
# Winter ()

The representative patterns of the four seasons tiles are not fixed. The more common ones are &quot;spring&quot; with various spring flowers, such as peonies, or multiple blooming flowers; &quot;summer&quot; with lotus; &quot;autumn&quot; with autumn fruits; and &quot;winter&quot; with daffodils.

The four tiles in the Four Gentlemen () quartet are:

 or or 
# Plum ()
# Orchid ()
# Chrysanthemum ()
# Bamboo ()
Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian mahjong sets contain two more quartets of flower tiles in addition to the Four Seasons and Four Gentlemen. These are the usual subjects:

*Four Arts ():

# Guqin ()
# Go ()
# Calligraphy ()
# Painting ()

*Four Noble Professions ():

# Fisherman (): a fishing pole behind a fishing basket
# Woodcutter (): a tied up bundle of wood
# Farmer (): a rake behind a hat
# Scholar (): a book or scroll

While some Vietnamese sets use the Four Arts and the Four Noble Professions, most of them use emperors () and empresses (). They are not decorated with pictures but just the number and character (&quot;e.g.&quot; Third Emperor 三皇, Fourth Empress 四后).

The earliest known Chinese sets contained twelve flowers but no Four Gentlemen tiles and the Four Seasons were unadorned. Sets with large numbers of flowers were once popular in Northern China to play the game of &quot;Flower Mahjong&quot; (花麻雀). They typically had 20 or more flowers with some described as having up to 44.

American sets are based on an earlier Chinese set, before the Four Gentlemen became standardized. The &quot;Three Stars&quot; () and &quot;Nobility&quot; are typically used in its place, with the usual tiles being:

# Fortune (): a boat at the mercy of the sea
# Prosperity (): a nicely dressed man next to a multi-story building with what appears to be oil fields
# Longevity (): the Old Man of the South Pole holding a Peach of Immortality
# Nobility (): what appears to be a tree

==== Animal tiles ====
&quot;Animal tiles&quot; () are unnumbered flowers that automatically match the player&#x27;s seat. These tiles are found in pairs with their subjects usually based on popular Chinese fables. Immediate payment may occur if both tiles in a pair or all the animals are collected. Singaporean sets contain two pairs of animal tiles while Thai and four-player Malaysian sets have four pairs. Some examples of tile pairs include:

* Cat () &amp; Mouse ()
* Rooster () &amp; Centipede ()
* Caishen (the god of wealth in Chinese folk religion and Taoism) &amp; Sycee (an ancient, custom-made gold or silver ingot)
* Jiang Ziya (an 11th-century BC military strategist who, according to legend, fished without bait, believing the fish would come on their own) &amp; Fish
* Liu Haichan (a legendary Taoist immortal) &amp; Jin Chan (a mythical three-legged toad that attracts wealth)
* Dragon &amp; Flaming pearl (a legendary treasure said to grant wishes)
* Hou Yi (an archer) &amp; Three-legged crow with an arrow through it. Some modern sets as seen in the image above use cupid &amp; heart to be more kid-friendly.

Three-player Malaysian sets have two pairs of animals accompanied with a quartet of identical animal tiles decorated with a face, usually that of a clown. These are known as heads (人头), faces (人臉), clowns (小丑) or snowmen (雪人). Sometimes, these four heads will be replaced with a pair of male heads (male clowns, male faces) and a pair of female heads (female clowns, female faces).

 or 

=== Joker tiles ===

&quot;Joker tiles&quot; (百搭牌, pinyin &quot;bǎidāpái&quot;) can be used to replace any suited or honor tile in putting together a hand subject to local restrictions. Four jokers are sometimes used in certain variants of Southeast Asian and Chinese mahjong, including Shanghainese mahjong. American mahjong uses eight jokers.

==== General-purpose ====
All-purpose jokers may have these inscriptions: 百搭 (&quot;bǎidā&quot;, &#x27;hundred uses&#x27;), 聽用 (&quot;tīngyòng&quot;, &#x27;many uses&#x27;), 飛 (&quot;fēi&quot;, &#x27;flying&#x27;), or simply &quot;Joker&quot; in American sets.

 or or or 

==== Suit-restricted ====
Vietnamese and Thai mahjong are related to extinct Chinese variants which used specialized jokers such as &quot;King Mahjong&quot; (王麻雀). Vietnamese mahjong sets commonly contain eight unique jokers:
*Blue/green jokers (&quot;khung xanh&quot;):
**Circle joker (筒, &quot;thùng&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Bamboo joker (索, &quot;soọc&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Character joker (萬, &quot;màn&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Universal joker (縂, &quot;tổng&quot;) : In King Mahjong it is a Suit and Honor joker, in Vietnamese mahjong it can also be used like the flower joker. Hong Kongers may use the 皇 character but this is not found in Vietnam because a flower quartet also uses it (see above).&lt;br&gt; or 
*Red jokers (&quot;khung đỏ&quot;):
**Suit joker (合, &quot;hợp&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Dragon joker (元, &quot;nguyên&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Wind joker (喜, &quot;hỷ&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
**Flower joker (花, &quot;hoa&quot;) : Like an animal tile but scores two doubles; it replaced the King Mahjong joker that functioned as a second Suit and Honor joker (陞王).&lt;br&gt;
***Honor joker (番 or 字 or 元喜, &quot;nhị khẩu&quot;) : A newer Vietnamese tile, it is an alternative to the dragon or wind joker. In Hong Kong, it is an alternative to the flower joker.&lt;br&gt;

The first four jokers have a long lineage. They are found in the earliest sets and were inspired by the suit-restricted jokers in older Chinese card games. After 1975, modern Vietnamese sets triplicated or quadruplicated all eight jokers but each copy will have a different frame (rectangle, circle, lozenge, and hexagon) which allows them to be melded with each other. This means a total of 32 jokers, 36 if the alternate honor jokers are also included.

==== Rank-restricted ====

In Hong Kong, Vietnamese style sets may also contain rank-restricted jokers, either as alternatives to the flower joker, or in addition to the usual eight:
*Terminal joker (么, jyutping: &quot;jiu1&quot;, &#x27;ace&#x27;) : Replaces one or nine of any suit&lt;br&gt;
*147 joker (仕, &quot;si6&quot;) : Replaces one, four, or seven of any suit&lt;br&gt;
*258 joker (將, &quot;zoeng3&quot;) : Replaces two, five, or eight of any suit&lt;br&gt;
*369 joker (兵, &quot;bing1&quot; or 卒, &quot;zeot1&quot;) : Replaces three, six, or nine of any suit&lt;br&gt; or 

The Chinese characters from the latter three comes from Xiangqi pieces. These sets may have suit, dragon, wind, and rank-restricted jokers adorned with multiple characters representing the tiles they can replace, instead of a single Chinese character.

== Comparison ==

===Footnotes===
=== Regional design ===
Designs of mahjong tiles are different between regions. Here are some examples.
== Construction ==
Traditionally, Mahjong tiles were made of bone, often backed with bamboo. Bone tiles are still available but most modern sets are constructed from various plastics such as bakelite, celluloid, nylon and PET (often, recycled PET). There are a small number of sets that have been made with ivory or jade, but these are exceedingly rare: most sets sold as ivory are in fact made from bone. Regardless of the material used to construct the tiles, the symbols on them are almost always engraved or pressed into the material. Some expert players can determine the face value of their tiles without actually looking at them by feeling these engravings with their fingers.

There are generally two size categories available, the larger mainland-China size and the smaller Taiwanese/Japanese/American size. However, within the former category (Mainland Chinese), 4 sizes have been roughly standardized:

*Size 8: 
*Size 7.5: 
*Size 7: 
*Size 6: 

The length to thickness ratio in all of these must be above 1:1.5, so that the tiles can steadily stand upright, since Chinese players use no racks to support their tiles in hand during play.

The sizes within the second category (Taiwanese/Japanese/American tiles) have lengths that vary roughly between . However, the Japanese tiles set themselves apart within this class by virtue of their thickness, which allows them to stand upright—despite their diminutive overall size. This enables Japanese mahjong players also to dispense with the use of racks (these are pervasive in the American game, in combination with slimmer tiles).

== Unicode ==
Mahjong tiles were added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.

The Unicode block for mahjong tiles is U+1F000–U+1F02B:
The Red Dragon tile also exists as in a non-emoji form as 🀄︎.

<doc id="596517" wikidata="Q5291988" url="?curid=596517" title="Don't Tell the Band">
<text>Don&#x27;t Tell the Band, is the seventh studio album released by the Athens, GA based band Widespread Panic. It was released on June 19, 2001, in two forms, a single disc and a double disc release. It was the second release through the band&#x27;s own label, Widespread Records, in conjunction with UK-based label Sanctuary Records. The album covered a wide variety of styles, from rock to Latin and grunge to soul, yet did not depart from this jam band&#x27;s signature sound.

Randall Bramblett, a solo musician and member of Steve Winwood&#x27;s touring band, joined Widespread Panic on the tenor saxophone for a cover of Firehose&#x27;s &quot;Sometimes.&quot; &quot;Big Wooly Mammoth,&quot; a long-time crowd favorite sung by John &quot;JoJo&quot; Herman, was finally brought to the studio for this release. Unknown at the time, this would be Michael Houser&#x27;s last studio album with Widespread Panic, before his cancer-related death in 2002.

Songs from Disc Two comprise the first five tracks of the band&#x27;s June 2002 release Live in the Classic City and are from the opening of the band&#x27;s April 1, 2000 performance at the Classic Center Theater in Athens, GA. Track 1, &quot;Action Man,&quot; appears in its original instrumental form unlike the album version, which contains lyrics. The songs &quot;Action Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Give&quot; also appeared in the EA Sports video game NASCAR 2001.

The album reached a peak position of #57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album also reached a peak position of #12 on the Top Internet Albums chart.

<text>A weapons platform is generally any structure, vehicle or mechanism on which a weapon can be installed (via various mounting mechanisms) for optimal stability and performance. The mounted weapons, the platform and all other associated supporting equipments together form the weapon system.

In more general use, a weapons platform could be structured around a gun, such as a gun turret on a ship, or bracing on an aircraft. For example, a jet aircraft is a weapons platform for missiles, bombs or autocannons, and the resultant weapon system is the fighter jet; a motorboat can serve as a weapons platform for automatic weapons, torpedoes and flamethrowers, resulting in weapon systems such as gunboats and fast attack crafts. Land vehicles, either wheeled, tracked or mixed, are also considered weapons platforms for grenade launchers, machine guns, recoilless guns and some missile launchers, which transform the vehicles into weapon systems such as armored cars (such as the Humvee), IFVs and technicals (improvised from civilian pickup trucks). In addition, artificial satellites have been proposed as potential space weapon platforms. These satellites could carry an arsenal of weapons, such as to threaten other countries with the possibility of an orbital nuclear strike (see Rods from God).

The earliest weapons platforms were chariots, followed by war wagons. The ancient Greek Helepolis, a massive siege tower which mounted catapults, could also be considered a weapons platform. The next attempt to mount weapons on platforms was made at sea, with catapults and eventually cannon mounted on their final form as ships of the line before the advent of ironclad warships mounting turrets.

On land, the attempt to mount weapons on mobile platforms in the modern period was first made with railway guns. These, as forms of artillery, were the last vestiges of development of the super-weapon thinking before the advent of the tanks that changed the use of weapons platforms in warfare, although the largest railway guns were still used during the Second World War on the Eastern Front.

<text>Raimo Ilmari Helminen (born 11 March 1964 in Tampere, Finland) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey player. He is often called &quot;Raipe&quot; or &quot;Maestro&quot; by his fans. He is the world record holder for most international games played by a hockey player, as well as for tied for being the hockey player in the most Olympic Games, and his 26 seasons as a professional is one of the longest careers in professional hockey history. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2012.

In the 2022-23 season he is serving as the assistant coach of Ilves. Helminen is credited with invention of the saucer pass.

==Personal life==
He has a wife, Leena, and two children, Anssi and Nelli.

==Professional career==

===Early years===
Helminen has himself said that he developed most of his skills when he was young and spent all his free time playing in outdoor ice rinks in Koivistonkylä, Tampere. Before he focused on ice hockey he had also played football.

Helminen started his career in his native town, playing for one of oldest teams in the country, Ilves. After two gold medals in junior leagues, Helminen got to play for Ilves in the SM-liiga, Finland&#x27;s top ice hockey league, in 1982. His first international success came in 1984 when Finland won silver in the U20 World Championship tournament in Sweden. Helminen broke the record for most points scored in an under-20 tournament and was selected for the All-Star team. This attracted the attention of people scouting new talent for the professional teams in the National Hockey League in North America. That spring Helminen also took part in his first Olympic Games in Sarajevo.

===NHL===
The following season he was one of the best players for Ilves, being the second highest scorer for his team and third overall in the league. As the centre of the first line, he led Ilves to a league championship victory for the first time in the league&#x27;s history.

The New York Rangers drafted him in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft as their second pick (2nd round, number 35), and Helminen headed for the NHL in the fall of 1985. He finished his rookie season with an outstanding 40 points in 66 games. The next fall, however, the new team management sold most of their young players and Helminen ended up with the Minnesota North Stars.

===Difficulties and success===
The next season proved more difficult, and Helminen ended up playing a lot in the minor leagues. In the fall of 1987 he returned to home soil to play for Ilves again. He proved to be a success and secured a place in the national team for the 1988 Winter Olympics. There he helped his country win their first Olympic medal (silver) in ice hockey.

His performance included 10 points in seven games and assisting two goals in Finland&#x27;s surprise 3–1 victory over gold medal hopefuls Canada. The tournament left NHL scouts wondering why this player was not playing in North America. Eventually Helminen got another chance to play in the NHL, this time for the New York Islanders.

===Back problems and Sweden===
In the spring of 1988 Helminen started having back problems that would hinder his career for the next couple of years. Because of this injury his 1988–89 season for the Islanders was a disappointment—although he played spectacularly for New York&#x27;s AHL Springfield Indians farm team for a month—and he left the Islanders for Malmö IF in Sweden.

Helminen&#x27;s play in Malmö IF was at times very good and he earned the respect of the fans. However, his back would not heal properly until the summer of 1992 after Malmö had won the Swedish Elitserien, the top ice hockey league in the country. After being Elitserien&#x27;s first ever foreign scoring winner in 1993, Helminen helped Malmö IF win another championship in 1994.

===Late career===
In 1996 Helminen returned again to his home town to play for Ilves and quickly became a fan favorite again. In 1998 Ilves won silver medals in the SM-liiga and Helminen was voted the best player of the season. He was also selected for the league&#x27;s All-Star team in three consecutive years having remained one of the top scorers. Helminen also made the SM-liiga record for most penalty minutes in one game with (55PIM), when he first spat towards the referee and after that tried to assault him, first with his stick and then with his fists, verbally abusing the referee all the while. In 2014 Markus Palmroth broke the record with 59 PIM. Helminen served as the captain of Ilves from 1999 until the end of his career in 2008, although he was temporarily stripped of his captaincy during the 2006–07 season after being thrown out during a game (he was reinstated after one game). At 44 years of age, Helminen was the oldest active player during the SM-liiga 2007–08 season.

Helminen officially retired after the 2007–08 SM-liiga season ended for Ilves, when they were defeated by Kärpät in the quarter-finals of the SM-liiga playoffs.

==International play==






Helminen played in a few international tournaments throughout the 1980s and was on the silver winning team of the 1988 Winter Olympics. This was almost the last international glory Helminen was ever to get as then current National team head coach Pentti Matikainen decided that Helminen&#x27;s time in the national team was over. After Matikainen was fired and the new head coach, Swede Curt &quot;Curre&quot; Lindström took over in 1994 Helminen was re-instated to the national team. In the 1990s Finland began gaining consistent success in international ice hockey. This included World Championship medals 1994 (silver) and 1995 (gold) and Olympic medals in 1994 (bronze) and 1998 (bronze). Helminen remained a favourite pick in the national team consistently through the decade and played an important role in the national team&#x27;s successes. Helminen participated in 11 World Championships tournaments between 1985 and 2002. Helminen holds a world record of most international games. Helminen played a total of 331 times for Finland and scored 52 goals and assisted 155, totaling 207 points.
His number originally was 14, but he had to change it to 41 when Ilves retired 14 in honour of Lasse Oksanen, a former player of the team. Helminen continued to wear 14 when he played for Team Finland. At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Ilves announced that Helminen&#x27;s number 41 would also be retired.

The 2002 World Championship Tournament was Helminen&#x27;s last World Championship tournament callup since Helminen was dropped as the last player from the 2003 World Championship squad by Hannu Aravirta

In February 2008, Helminen returned to the national team for one game, his farewell match. Finland faced the Czech Republic in the LG Hockey Tournament, which is part of the European Hockey Tour. Although the tournament is held in Sweden, the match was played in Tampere, which is Helminen&#x27;s hometown. Helminen recorded an assist on a goal scored by Tuomas Pihlman four seconds before the end of the game. Finland won the game 6–1.

In 1998, Helminen and Dieter Hegen (Germany) became the third and fourth ice hockey players to compete at five Olympics, after Udo Kießling (Germany) and Petter Thoresen (Norway). Helminen&#x27;s appearance at the 2002 Olympics made him the first ice hockey player to compete at six Olympics, with compatriot Teemu Selänne becoming the second in 2014.

==Coaching career==
Helminen has been assistant coach of Ilves since late parts of the 2009–10 season, when Juha Pajuoja got the job as the head coach. Pajuoja was sacked in late October in 2011 and replaced by Seppo Hiitelä.

He was also assistant coach of the Finnish U20 team in the 2010 and 2011 World Championship, before being promoted to head coach for the 2012 tournament.

<doc id="596532" wikidata="Q301639" url="?curid=596532" title="PZL.23 Karaś">
<text>The PZL.23 &quot;Karaś&quot; (&quot;crucian carp&quot;) was a Polish light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft designed in the mid-1930s by PZL in Warsaw.

During the interwar period, the Polish High Command had placed considerable emphasis upon the role of armed aerial reconnaissance aircraft. To meet this interest, during 1931, PZL decided to embark on the development of a new combat aircraft to meet this role. An earlier proposal for a fast single-engine passenger airliner, designated the &quot;PZL.13&quot;, was adopted as the basis of the new design. The new aircraft, which was designated as the PZL.23, a relatively modern design, which integrated features such as an all-metal body and unconventional wing construction. As the British Bristol Pegasus radial engine was licensed for use in Poland only, export aircraft were instead equipped with the Gnome-Rhône 14N engine. Powered as such and along with some airframe changes, the PZL.23 became the PZL.43.

It was the primary Polish reconnaissance bomber in use during the invasion of Poland. On 2 September 1939, a single PZL.23B of the 21st Escadrille was responsible for the bombing of a factory in Ohlau, inside Germany; the attack represented the first bombing raid to be conducted against a target in territory within the Third Reich. During the following days, the PZL.23 bomber escadrilles were deployed to attack several advancing German armoured columns; they often conducted these attacks at low altitudes, which made them vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. By the end of 1939, around 120 PZL.23s (86 per cent of the Polish Air Force&#x27;s inventory of the type) were destroyed; however, of these, only 67 had been lost as a direct result of enemy actions.

==Development==
===Background===
As a result of wartime experiences acquired by the Polish armed forces during the 1919-1921 Polish–Soviet War, during the 1920s and 1930s (now known as the interwar period), a great emphasis was placed upon the role of armed aerial reconnaissance aircraft. According to aviation historian J. B. Cynk, the role was recognised by the Polish High Command as being, aside from the basic fighter aircraft, the most important type of aerial unit in their doctrine. As such, considerable resources and effort was placed upon the creation of sizable army cooperation escadrilles, which were initially principally equipped with foreign-built biplanes such as the French Breguet 19 and Potez 25.

During the late 1920s, it had become increasingly obvious that the existing types used for the aerial reconnaissance role would need to be replaced, which led to the Ministry of War&#x27;s Aviation Department defining a set of a broad performance requirements desired in an aircraft to fulfil the role. Around the same time, at the Polish state-owned aviation works PZL, the aircraft designer Stanisław Prauss had been studying options for a new fast single-engine airliner, to be designated the &quot;PZL.13&quot;. An advanced low-wing cantilever monoplane design proposal with an all-metal structure and a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp radial engine was selected for further development, however during early 1931, the Ministry of Transport cancelled the project and terminated its sponsorship amid a lack of interest. Accordingly, PZL were keen to embark upon a replacement project in the place of the PZL.13 venture. Following a series of consultations between the company and the Aviation Department, it was decided to embark upon the design of a three-man armed reconnaissance-bomber, using the abortive PZL.13 passenger transport airliner as a starting point for the new aircraft. The resulting design, designated the &quot;PZL.23&quot;, was only one of several proposals to be produced; alternatives included the &quot;PWS.19&quot;, a high-wing monoplane, and the Lublin R.XVII, a clean twin-seat biplane with a retractable undercarriage. During late 1931, the Aviation Department decided to opt for the PZL submission.

===Design phase===
During early 1932, PZL were authorised to formally proceed with preliminary design work on what would become the PZL.23. An early key design decision was the selection of the British Bristol Pegasus radial engine to power the type, which was domestically produced by Skoda in their Warsaw plant. The emerging design was for a modern combat aircraft, integrating features such as an all-metal body and unconventional wing construction, being built around light closed profiles instead of spars (this wing design had been previously introduced on the PZL.19).

During the spring of 1932, the preliminary design was approved in principle by the Aviation Department, however, in accordance with the department&#x27;s expressed preferences, the ventral gun turret was redesigned for increased field of fire, as well as to accommodate more capable bomb-aiming equipment. During late 1932, authorisation to proceed with the construction of a batch of three prototypes along with one static-test airframe. However, development would not prove to be a straightforward venture. The diverse requirements of the PZL.23 imposed considerable hurdles in the design phase; in order to produce a relatively fast aircraft, a heavy airframe was practically necessitated, however, it was also important for the type to be able to operate from constrained austere airstrips rapidly established on the front lines of warzones; producing a suitable compromise was not easy.

The venture has been considered to be pioneering in some aspects of its design, which contributed to its design complications. Static testing by the Institute of Aviation Technical Research (ITBL) was both protracted and determined some components to process insufficient strength; these were not completed until 1933. However, completion of the prototypes was delayed to incorporate modifications to address the findings. The name &quot;Karaś&quot; was selected for the type around this time.

===Into flight===
On 1 April 1934, the &quot;P.23/I&quot; first prototype conducted its maiden flight; it was quickly followed by the second &quot;P.23/II&quot; prototype. Early flight testing revealed several issues that needed to be resolved, including tail flutter and vibration in the rear fuselage area; another difficulty identified even prior to the first flight was the inadequate visibility from the cockpit for both the pilot and observer. Various measures to rectify these issues were incorporated onto the second and third prototypes.

During the following year, the third &quot;P.23/III&quot; prototype was completed; on this aircraft, various further refinements were included, such as the pilot&#x27;s seat having been raised into a new fully glazed canopy arrangement and the engine being positioned lowered down, giving the aircraft a characteristic hump-nose, as to improve the pilot&#x27;s external field of vision. The fuselage bomb bay of the earlier prototype was eliminated; instead, the entire payload was carried externally on racks fixed onto the underside of the wing&#x27;s center-section. Various other alterations were made to the wings, including the adoption of more effective slotted ailerons, improved flaps and center-section slots, the latter feature served to smooth the airflow over the tail when flown at high angles of incidence.

During mid-1935, the second prototype was lost in a crash shortly after a take-off conducted at the maximum loading weight, killing the crew on board. The remaining airworthiness tests and service acceptance trials were completed successfully using the third prototype. Further refinements had been incorporated into the third prototype during the test programme to eventually conform with the standards of subsequent production-standard aircraft. Amongst the final changes were the adoption of a Pegasus VIII engine, after which it was used as the development aircraft for the &quot;PZL.23B&quot; variant of the type.

As a consequence of its favourable flight test programme, the aircraft was approved to enter full-scale production during the second half of 1935. The first series, which was given the designation of &quot;PZL.23A&quot;, was fitted with a single Bristol Pegasus IIM2 engine, which possessed an upper thrust capability of 670 hp (500 kW) thrust. Early on, the limited availability of the Pegasus engine led to production delays. However, since this engine proved to be unreliable during testing, the final variant, which was designated &quot;PZL.23B&quot;, was fitted with the newer Pegasus VIII model, which was capable of generating a maximum of 720 hp (537 kW) of thrust.

===Further development===
The Bristol engines were licensed for use in Poland only, so for export purposes the Gnome-Rhône engines were used in a variety of PZL designs. A development of the PZL.23 was the PZL.43 light bomber powered by a Gnome-Rhône 14N engine, with significant changes in the fuselage structure compared to its predecessor. The final export variant to be developed was &quot;PZL.43A&quot;; it was furnished with a single 1,020 hp Gnome-Rhône 14N-01 engine. 52 PZL.43s were made in total, all for Bulgaria only. The new engine improved the aircraft&#x27;s performance considerably, resulting in the maximum speed being increased to 365 km/h.

During 1936, 40 PZL.23As were produced. Between late 1936 and February 1938, 210 PZL.23Bs were produced with the new engines. They were also known as Karaś A and B or Karaś I and II. All PZL.23s had military numbers from 44.1 to 44.250.Sometimes the aircraft is called the &quot;PZL P.23&quot;, but despite an abbreviation P.23 painted on a tail fin, the letter &quot;P&quot; was generally reserved for fighters of Pulawski&#x27;s design (like PZL P.11). In November 1936, one aircraft was shown at the Paris Air Show, where it was met with interest.

During this period, PZL developed the PZL.46 Sum, a new light bomber, which was partly based on the PZL.23 design. However, only a pair of prototypes were completed during 1938. There was also a single experimental version designated as &quot;PZL.42.&quot; This version featured a double tail fin configuration and a modified bombardier gondola which was retractable into the fuselage.

==Design==
The PZL.23 Karaś was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, featuring all-metal, metal-covered construction. The crew of three consisted of a pilot, a bombardier, and a rear gunner. The bombardier&#x27;s combat station was situated in a gondola underneath the hull, where he could also operate an underbelly machine gun. The pilot was positioned within a fully enclosed air-conditioned and heated cockpit, while the observer was seated directly behind him and could descend into the ventral gondola during applicable parts of a given mission. The fixed undercarriage comprised a pair of cantilever struts and single tail skid, all of which were outfitted with pneumatic shock absorbers built by Czechoslovakian company Avia. When prepared for operating from rough or austere airfields, the streamlined fairings over the wheels would have to be removed in advance.

The aircraft were equipped with one of the following engines: Bristol Pegasus IIM2 normal: 570 hp (425 kW), maximum: 670 hp (500 kW) - PZL.23A; Pegasus VIII normal: 650 hp (485 kW), maximum: 720 (537 kW) - PZL.23B. Early Polish-built engines had encountered several common issues, including crankshaft fractures and reduction gears jamming; the original engine manufacturer, Bristol, had not amended the drawings and specifications provided to Poland to incorporate their latest improvements to the Pegasus, which addressed these issues. For the export market, it was outfitted with either the Gnome-Rhône 14K or Gnome-Rhône 14N-01 engines. Regardless of the engine adopted, the aircraft was always outfitted with a two-blade propeller.

One of the more unusual features of the PZL.23 was the design of its three-piece low-mounted wing. In order to produce a wing that was both light and strong, Prauss had opted to use a relatively new wing structure which had been recently designed by Polish engineer Fraciszek Misztal. This wing combined a revolutionary heavy-gauge corrugated duralumin center box and a multi-cellular trailing edge, along with a partially stressed exterior skin composed of duralumin; according to Cynk, it was one of the earliest implementations of a metal sandwich structure in the field of aviation.

The fuselage of the PZL.23 had an oval-section structure, composed of a mixture of duralumin frames and stringers, which were strengthened via several struts on the middle section. The exterior of the fuselage was covered with smooth duralumin sheet, which was internally reinforced in some areas by corrugated sheeting. The rear fuselage featured a semi-monocoque structure. A cantilever structure composed of ribs and spars was used for the tail unit; the fin and tailplane were covered by duralumin sheeting, while the rudder and elevators had finely corrugated exterior surfaces.

The aircraft&#x27;s offensive payload consisted of bombs. These were carried underneath the wings using racks; the maximum load was (6 x 100 kg and 2 x 50 kg). While plans to incorporate the Swiatecki bomb-release gear had been mooted, however, they were eliminated from the design during the prototype stage due to disagreements between the Aviation Department and the inventor regarding the manufacturing arrangements. The PZL.23 was also armed with several machine guns, including a defensive ventral gun turret; additional positions, such as a twin-gun mounting on the upper fuselage were considered but never pursued. A typical gun armament included either one or a pair of 7.92 mm fixed guns, along with two single 7.92 mm movable guns.

==Operational history==
During late 1936, a batch of 40 PZL.23As were delivered to the Polish Air Force. Due to engine faults, these aircraft were initially flown with a limited service ceiling and they were used exclusively in the training role, being fitted with dual controls to fit this usage. From 1937, a total of 210 PZL.23Bs were delivered to the Air Force. Around this time, the type became the main armament of Polish bomber and reconnaissance &quot;line squadrons&quot;, having replaced the majority of Breguet 19, Potez 25 and Potez 27 biplanes. By August 1939, there had been 23 reported crashes involving the type, which was deemed to have been an average safety result.

However, due to rapid advances in the field of aviation during the late 1930s, by 1939 the aircraft was considered to be approaching obsolescence. There were increasing questions over the validity of prior air doctrine, leading to a major reorganisation of the PZL.23 squadrons during 1938–1939. The main deficiency of the PZL.23 was its relatively low speed compared to newer aircraft that were then entering service with neighbouring nations. Other issues with the aircraft included a lack of manoeuvrability and unfavourable characteristics when flown at high speeds (the maximum speed of the PZL.23B was 365 km/h, but it was forbidden to exceed 319 km/h due to dangerous flight characteristics). However, at the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland, it remained Poland&#x27;s primary light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft.

During late August 1939, in anticipation of imminent hostilities with Nazi Germany, all Polish combat units were relocated from their peacetime bases to secret combat airfields, so they avoided destruction on the ground. Some PZL.23s were also used in wartime improvised units with 114 PZL.23Bs deployed in combat units (a further 75 PZL.23B and 35 PZL.23A were in air schools, held in reserve or under repair). In total, the PZL.23B were operational with five bomber escadrilles (&quot;Eskadra Bombowa&quot;) of the Bomber Brigade and seven Army reconnaissance escadrilles, each of which equipped with ten aircraft. In Bomber Brigade there existed also bigger units (&quot;Dywizjon Bombowy&quot;), consisting of two escadrilles each, and traditionally translated as squadron (two other squadrons of the Bomber Brigade were equipped with the PZL.37 Łoś bomber). In addition, a pair of PZL.43A bombers that had been produced for the Bulgarian order were impressed into Polish service in the 41st Escadrille.

On 2 September 1939, a single PZL.23B of the 21st Escadrille was responsible for the bombing of a factory in Ohlau, inside Germany, the first bombing raid to be conducted against a target within the Third Reich. Over the following days, the PZL.23 bomber squadrons commenced attacks upon several advancing German armoured columns, which were responsible for knocking out as many as thirty per cent of the German ground vehicles. One such high-profile engagement occurred on 3 September 1939. Despite this offensive use of the type, the main task of the Army escadrilles was to perform reconnaissance missions. The five escadrilles of the Bomber Brigade delivered about 52-60 tons of bombs during the campaign, while the Army escadrilles were responsible for the deployment of roughly another dozen tons.

Due to the plane&#x27;s low speed, light armour and, perhaps most importantly, a lack of supporting protection from friendly fighter aircraft, the PZL.23 suffered heavy combat losses. Many were shot down by German fighter aircraft, but they were also able to fight back and were responsible for shooting down several in return. Despite the lack of protective armour, Polish aircrews often conducted attacks upon German columns while flying at low altitudes, which made their aircraft particularly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. Reportedly, around twenty aircraft were lost in crash landings on the improvised and rough airfields. During 1939, around 120 PZL.23s (86 per cent of the Polish Air Force&#x27;s inventory) were destroyed. However, only 67 of these had been due to direct enemy action. Additionally, only a small number of PZL.23s were destroyed on the ground at various airfields; the only large-scale &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; success of this type occurred on 14 September, at Hutniki airfield, against the PZL.23Bs of the Bomber Brigade.

During late 1939, at least 21 PZL.23s were evacuated to Romania, of which at least 19 were subsequently used by the Romanian Air Force against the Soviet Union (USSR) during Operation Barbarossa, the costly Axis invasion of the USSR. In addition to Romania&#x27;s use of the type, a total of 50 PZL.43s and PZL.43As (one pair were delivered by the Germans) were used in Bulgaria for training purposes; the type, which was known by the Bulgarians as the &quot;Chaika&quot;, were used in this role until 1946. There are no known PZL.23s survivors of the war.

<text>Stanley Raymond &quot;Bucky&quot; Harris (November 8, 1896 – November 8, 1977) was an American professional baseball second baseman, manager and executive. While Harris played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers, it was his long managerial career that led to his enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1975.

Hired by the Senators to act as player-manager at the age of 27, Harris would lead the team to the 1924 World Series title, becoming the youngest manager to win a championship and the first rookie manager to do so (four other rookies have accomplished the feat since). Harris managed 29 seasons, fourth most in MLB history. In his tenure as manager for five teams (with three terms for Washington and two for Detroit), Harris won over 2,150 games, three league pennants and two World Series championships (1924 with the Senators and 1947 with the New York Yankees); the gap between Harris&#x27;s World Series appearances (22 years) and championships (23) are the longest in major league history.

==Early life==
Stanley Raymond &quot;Bucky&quot; Harris was born on November 8, 1896, in Port Jervis, New York, and raised after the age of six in Pittston, Pennsylvania. He was of Swiss and Welsh descent. His father, Thomas, had emigrated from Wales, while his mother, Catherine (Rupp), hailed from Hughestown, near Pittston. His elder brother, Merle, was a minor league second baseman. Bucky Harris left school at age 13 to work at a local colliery, the Butler Mine, as an office boy and, later, a weigh master. In his spare time, Harris played basketball for the Pittston YMCA team as well as sandlot baseball.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Harris was listed as tall and ; he threw and batted right-handed. In 1916, when Harris was 19, Pittston native Hughie Jennings, then the manager of the Detroit Tigers, signed him to his first contract and farmed him to the Class B Muskegon Reds of the Central League, where he struggled as a batsman and was released. Harris then caught on with the Scranton Miners, Norfolk Tars and Reading Pretzels through 1917, before reaching the highest level of minor league baseball with the 1918–1919 Buffalo Bisons of the International League. Harris improved his batting skills during the latter season with the Bisons, making 126 hits and raising his average to .282.

===Washington Senators (1919–1928)===
Harris then was recommended to the Washington Senators by baseball promoter Joe Engel, who led the Chattanooga Lookouts at Engel Stadium. In August 1919, at the age of 22, he came up to Washington but was unimpressive at first, batting a meager .214 and getting into only eight games that first season. Despite this poor showing, owner-manager Clark Griffith made him Washington&#x27;s regular second baseman in 1920, and before long Harris was batting .300 and making a mark for himself as a tough competitor, standing up to even ferocious superstar Ty Cobb, who threatened Harris when he tagged Cobb in their first encounter.

Harris spent most of his playing career as a second baseman with the Senators (1919–1928). In 1924, he was named player-manager; at the age of 27 he was the youngest manager in the Majors. He proceeded to lead the Senators to their only World Series title in Washington in his rookie season, and was nicknamed &quot;The Boy Wonder.&quot; He won a second consecutive American League pennant in 1925, but the Senators lost the 1925 World Series in Pittsburgh in the late innings of Game 7 after leading 3–1 in the Series. Baseball historian William C. Kashatus wrote of his dominant play in the 1924 World Series: &quot;Not only did he set records for chances accepted, double plays and put-outs in the exciting seven-game affair, but he batted .333 and hit two home runs&quot; — including an important roundtripper in Game 7 which opened the scoring and gave Washington a 1–0 lead in the 4th inning. These feats are even more impressive considering that the light-hitting Harris only hit nine home runs during his entire career.

After Harris‘ back-to-back pennants in 1924–1925, he was able to keep the Senators in the first division for the next three seasons, but their win totals declined, from 96 (1925) to 81 (), then 85 ().

===Detroit Tigers (1929, 1931)===
When, in , they won only 75 games (against 79 losses), Griffith traded Harris to Detroit and changed managers, with Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson named as his successor. The Tigers had won only 68 games, and Harris&#x27; edition offered only a slight improvement, winning 70. Harris’ initial departure from the Senators in 1928 (he would twice return to manage them again from 1935–1942 and 1950–1954) came in a trade to the Tigers as player-manager. Although he retired as a player after the 1931 season, his playing career effectively ended with his trade to Detroit. Harris only made 11 cameo appearances in the Tiger lineup: seven in 1929 and four in 1931. In all, he appeared in 1,263 games over all or portions of 13 seasons, and collected 1,297 hits, with 224 doubles, 64 triples, nine home runs, 472 bases on balls, and 167 stolen bases. Harris batted .274 lifetime with 508 career runs batted in.
In five full seasons as the Tigers&#x27; manager, he produced only one winning year, , when Detroit went 76–75 and finished fifth and games behind the Yankees. In the waning days of , Harris stepped down. His eventual successor, Mickey Cochrane, a future Hall-of-Fame catcher who was acquired from the Philadelphia Athletics, would lead the Tigers as a player-manager to back-to-back pennants in 1934–1935 (and their first-ever world championship in the latter year).

===Boston Red Sox (1934)===
Harris signed as manager of the Red Sox for . Boston was then a habitual tail-ender in the American League, and had registered 15 consecutive losing seasons since its world championship. The 1933 Red Sox had won only 63 games and finished seventh in the eight-team AL under Marty McManus, but their wealthy new owner, Tom Yawkey, had begun a major rebuilding of both the ball club and Fenway Park. Yawkey jettisoned McManus and personally selected Harris as his new manager, and his 1934 Red Sox, despite an injury-riddled season by newly purchased ace left-handed pitcher Lefty Grove, broke the losing-season streak, finishing at .500 (76–76). But Harris&#x27;s stay in the Boston dugout lasted only one season. He and Eddie Collins, the Red Sox&#x27; general manager, had feuded since their playing days and Yawkey may have hired Harris without consulting Collins. When Joe Cronin, the hard-hitting, 28-year-old playing manager of the Senators, became available on the trade market, Yawkey and Collins moved quickly, sending shortstop Lyn Lary and $225,000 to Washington on October 26, 1934, for Cronin, and then naming him manager for . Harris then took Cronin&#x27;s old job, returning to Clark Griffith and the Senators.

===Second stint with Washington Senators (1935–1942)===

Harris&#x27; second term in Washington lasted for eight seasons (1935–1942), his longest tenure as a skipper. However, he never approached the highs of 1924 or 1925. Only one of his teams, the 1936 Senators, had a winning record (82–71) and first-division finish. Harris kept the club out of the American League basement, but three consecutive seventh-place finishes from 1940–1942 led to his departure.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1943)===
His only season in the National League was spent as skipper of the 1943 Phillies.

Perhaps the worst team (42–109, .278) in baseball in , the Phillies had just been sold to lumberman William D. Cox. Under Harris, the 1943 edition improved to play .424 baseball (39–53) by July 27, with just three fewer victories than they had in all of 1942. However, Harris chafed at Cox&#x27; constant interference. When Harris protested, Cox abruptly fired him after only 92 games.

Harris then played a role in Cox&#x27; banishment from professional baseball for betting on games. On the day after his firing, Harris dropped a bombshell at his hotel room — he had evidence that Cox was betting on baseball. Harris&#x27;s friends, outraged at his firing, informed Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis that Cox was violating baseball&#x27;s anti-gambling mandate. Landis then summoned Harris to his office to testify in person about Cox&#x27; behavior. The owner was suspended indefinitely three months later and banned from baseball outright soon afterward. The Phillies were sold to R. R. M. Carpenter in November 1943.

===New York Yankees (1947–1948)===

Harris then spent three seasons out of the big leagues, serving as general manager (1944–1946) and field manager (1944–1945) of the Buffalo Bisons, his old team in the International League. In August 1946, the Yankees&#x27; co-owner and GM, Larry MacPhail, appointed Harris to a front-office position.

The tumultuous season saw MacPhail employ three managers — Joe McCarthy, Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun — and finish third, 17 games in arrears of the pennant-winning Red Sox. At the close of the season, MacPhail named Harris the Bombers&#x27; 1947 manager, and he led them to his third American League pennant — the Yankees&#x27; 15th league title.

Behind Most Valuable Player Joe DiMaggio and newly acquired starting pitcher Allie Reynolds, the 1947 Yanks won 97 games and prevailed over the Tigers by a 12-game margin. Then they won Harris&#x27;s second World Series championship, defeating the Jackie Robinson-led Brooklyn Dodgers in a thrilling, seven-game Fall Classic.

MacPhail sold his stake in the Yankees and left baseball immediately after the 1947 Series and Harris returned for a second season as manager. His 1948 Yankees won 94 games to finish a close third in a hectic pennant race, two games behind the Cleveland Indians and Red Sox, who ended the regular season in a tie for first place. But the result dissatisfied the Yankees&#x27; post-MacPhail ownership team, Dan Topping and Del Webb, and their new general manager, George Weiss, and they replaced Harris with Casey Stengel. Stengel would lead New York to ten American League pennants and seven World Series titles in the next 12 seasons.

===Third stint with Washington Senators (1950–1954)===
Harris returned to the minor leagues in 1949 as manager of the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, before launching his third stint as skipper of the Senators, coming off a 104-loss 1949 season. His first campaign, , saw a 17-game improvement for Washington, then he led the Senators to a winning (78–76) mark in , but the team could not escape the second division in Harris&#x27;s five-year, final term as Washington&#x27;s manager.

===Detroit Tigers (1955–1956)===
Nevertheless, the Tigers chose Harris to replace Fred Hutchinson as their manager for , and in the first season of his second term in Detroit, Harris again produced a turnaround. The 1955 Tigers won 79 games (eleven more than &#x27;s edition) and had their first above-.500 season since . Pitcher Ned Garver described Harris as &quot;sympathetic,&quot; recalling that he would wait until an inning was over before replacing a pitcher on the mound. Then, Detroit won 82 games in . But the Tigers finished fifth each season, and were experiencing turmoil in their front office; outspoken owner Walter Briggs Jr. was harshly critical of Harris and his coaches during the season and was in the process of selling the team. Fired by new owner Fred Knorr, Harris closed out his 29-year MLB managing career with a win–loss record of 2,158–2,219 (.493). As of September 2019, Harris ranked seventh in MLB manager career wins.

===Managerial record===
==Front office career==
In 1957, at 60, Harris rejoined the Red Sox in a front office capacity. He was assistant general manager to Joe Cronin for two seasons, and then, when Cronin was named president of the American League, succeeded him as GM in January 1959, 24 years after Cronin had displaced Harris as Boston&#x27;s field manager. Harris served for two losing seasons as general manager of the Red Sox before his firing in late September 1960. On his watch, the Red Sox finally broke the baseball color line by promoting Pumpsie Green from Triple-A on July 21, 1959, more than a dozen years after Robinson&#x27;s debut with the Dodgers. They were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to integrate.

But the Red Sox went 75–79 in and fell into the second division, beginning a streak of eight straight losing seasons. Then, in , Hall of Famer Ted Williams&#x27;s final season, they won only 65 games and finished seventh in the eight-team league. Rightfielder Jackie Jensen, still productive at age 33 — he had been &#x27;s American League MVP and the AL&#x27;s 1959 runs batted in leader — sat out the entire 1960 campaign in retirement due to his fear of flying.

Harris made a flurry of minor trades in an attempt to shake up his faltering team. His two highest-profile transactions, which occurred during the 1959–1960 offseason, saw him send left-handed pitcher and former bonus baby Frank Baumann to the Chicago White Sox and veteran starting catcher Sammy White to the Indians. But Baumann led the AL in earned run average with the 1960 Chisox (while the player Harris obtained, first baseman Ron Jackson, struggled through only ten games with Boston before being traded away again) and White abruptly retired rather than report to Cleveland, canceling his trade. Harris also ran afoul of Yawkey when he fired Yawkey associate Pinky Higgins as manager and replaced him with Billy Jurges, a Senators&#x27; coach, on July 3, 1959, without consulting the owner. Jurges lasted less than a calendar year as the Red Sox&#x27; pilot before his firing in June 1960 — and replacement by Higgins. Harris&#x27;s dismissal followed not quite four months later.

Harris ended his long MLB career as a scout for the White Sox (1961–1962) and special assistant for the new expansion Washington Senators franchise that played in D.C. from 1961 to 1971 before moving on to Arlington, Texas. All told, he spent over 55 years in baseball. He died in Bethesda, Maryland, on his 81st birthday. According to his obituary in the November 10, 1977 Washington Post, Harris died after a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Hughestown.

==Personal life==
Harris&#x27;s father-in-law during his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1951, was Howard Sutherland, former United States Senator from West Virginia.

As a flag officer, Rooke commanded a division of the Royal Navy during their defeat at the Battle of Beachy Head. He also commanded a division at the Battle of Barfleur and distinguished himself at the Battle of La Hogue. He was later defeated while escorting a convoy at the Battle of Lagos.

Rooke commanded the unsuccessful allied expedition against Cádiz but on the passage home he destroyed the Spanish treasure fleet at the Battle of Vigo Bay in the opening stages of the War of the Spanish Succession. He also commanded the allied naval forces at the capture of Gibraltar and attacked the French fleet at the Battle of Málaga.

==Early career==
Born the son of Colonel Sir William Rooke and Jane Rooke (née Finch), Rooke joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1672. Promoted to lieutenant later in the year, he was appointed to the first-rate HMS &quot;London&quot;, flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Spragge, and saw action when a combined British and French fleet was surprised and attacked by the Dutch, led by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, at the Battle of Solebay off the Suffolk coast in May 1672 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. He transferred to the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal Prince&quot;, flagship of the Duke of York, in 1673 and saw action again at the Battle of Schooneveld in June 1673.

Promoted to captain on 13 November 1673, Rooke was given command of the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Holmes&quot; and was deployed on convoy duties. After a period of service in the Army, Rooke transferred to the command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Nonsuch&quot; in April 1677 and conveyed Prince William of Orange to England in October 1677. He transferred to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; in the Mediterranean in July 1680 to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;St David&quot; in the English Channel April 1683 and to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Deptford&quot; in the Mediterranean in April 1688. In &quot;Deptford&quot; he saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689 when a French fleet tried to land troops in Southern Ireland to fight against Prince William during the Williamite War in Ireland. In August the same year he cleared Belfast Lough of French shipping, allowing Marshal Schomberg&#x27;s force to land in Ulster where they successfully laid siege to Carrickfergus and advanced south to Dundalk Camp.

==Senior command==
Promoted to rear admiral in early 1690, Rooke hoisted his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Duchess&quot; and commanded the rear division of the centre squadron during the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690 during the Nine Years&#x27; War. His tactics during the battle were subsequently severely criticised at the inquiry but he was nevertheless cleared of blame. Promoted to vice-admiral on 20 January 1692, he hoisted his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; and served under Admiral Edward Russell commanding the vanguard division of the rear squadron at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692. After temporarily transferring his flag to the third-rate HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, he distinguished himself in a night attack on the French fleet at Battle of La Hogue when he succeeded in burning twelve of the enemy&#x27;s ships. Knighted on 20 February 1693, he commanded the escort for Smyrna convoy, which was scattered and partly captured by the French Admiral Anne Hilarion de Tourville near Lagos, Portugal, in June 1693. He was promoted to full admiral in July 1693.

Rooke joined the Board of Admiralty led by Admiral Edward Russell in May 1694. He also became commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1695 and then returned to England in April 1696. Promoted to Admiral of the Fleet shortly afterwards, he was given command the Channel Fleet but was unable to stop the French squadron which sailed from Toulon from reaching Brest and was criticised at the subsequent inquiry. He was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Portsmouth in Autumn 1698 and played an active part as spokesman for the Admiralty presenting, for example, an estimate of the navy debt to the House in April 1699. He was advanced to Senior Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board in May 1699.

Rooke hoisted his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Shrewsbury&quot; in Spring 1700 and took command of an Anglo-Dutch Squadron, which while working in co-operation with a Swedish fleet under Admiral-General Hans Wachtmeister, attacked Copenhagen so facilitating the landing of King Charles XII of Sweden and his army in Denmark in August 1700 in the opening phase of the Great Northern War. When the Admiralty was reconstituted under a council headed by the Lord High Admiral (an office vested at that time in the Earl of Pembroke), Rooke was appointed a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral in January 1702. He was also appointed Vice-Admiral of England later that year.

The Allies resolved upon an expedition, led by Rooke, to capture the southern Spanish port of Cádiz, and at a stroke cut off Spain&#x27;s transatlantic trade. However, on arrival in August 1702 the Allies made little or no progress in the assault on Cádiz. Fort Matagorda held out, and after several days Rooke declared that even if the fort was taken, another stronghold guarding the entrance to the Puntales (a sandy spit near the entrance to the inner harbour) would prevent the fleet from navigating the narrow passage: and so the mission was abandoned. However the English Government had become aware that a Spanish treasure fleet was sitting in Vigo Bay and instructed Rooke to intercept it in October 1702. The third-rate HMS &quot;Torbay&quot;, commanded by Thomas Hopsonn, led the assault on the boom across the bay and, once it was breached, there was not a single French or Spanish vessel that had not been either captured or destroyed at the Battle of Vigo Bay. Rooke received the thanks of Parliament in this important action in the opening stages of the War of the Spanish Succession.

Rooke safely delivered Archduke Charles of Austria (the claimant to the Spanish throne) to Windsor Castle in December 1703. Flying his flag in the second rate HMS &quot;Royal Katherine&quot;, he commanded the allied naval forces who arrived in Gibraltar in August 1704: after a bombardment by 22 ships directed by Admiral George Byng a landing party disembarked, hoisted the Union Flag and captured Gibraltar. Rooke also attacked the French fleet at the Battle of Málaga later that month.

Suffering severely from gout, he retired from the navy on account of ill-health in January 1705, stood down from the council of the Lord High Admiral in June 1705 and gave up his seat in Parliament in 1708. He died at his home, Lawrence House in Canterbury, on 24 January 1709 and was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Church in Canterbury. In November 2004 Peter Caruana, Chief Minister of Gibraltar, unveiled a statue of Rooke as part of the 300th anniversary celebration of the capture of Gibraltar.

==Family==

In around October 1684 Rooke married Mary Howe. After the death of his first wife he married Mary Luttrell in January 1701; they had one son. After the death of his second wife, he married Catherine Knatchbull in January 1706.

==Honours==
The ship&#x27;s badge of HMS &quot;Hogue&quot;, a chess rook on a field blue within a chaplet of laurel gold, was derived from his coat of arms.

<doc id="596556" wikidata="Q1567607" url="?curid=596556" title="Hartley transform">
<text>In mathematics, the Hartley transform (HT) is an integral transform closely related to the Fourier transform (FT), but which transforms real-valued functions to real-valued functions. It was proposed as an alternative to the Fourier transform by Ralph V. L. Hartley in 1942, and is one of many known Fourier-related transforms. Compared to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform has the advantages of transforming real functions to real functions (as opposed to requiring complex numbers) and of being its own inverse.

The discrete version of the transform, the discrete Hartley transform (DHT), was introduced by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1983.

The two-dimensional Hartley transform can be computed by an analog optical process similar to an optical Fourier transform (OFT), with the proposed advantage that only its amplitude and sign need to be determined rather than its complex phase. However, optical Hartley transforms do not seem to have seen widespread use.

==Definition==
The Hartley transform of a function formula_1 is defined by:

formula_2

where formula_3 can in applications be an angular frequency and

formula_4

is the cosine-and-sine (cas) or &quot;Hartley&quot; kernel. In engineering terms, this transform takes a signal (function) from the time-domain to the Hartley spectral domain (frequency domain).

=== Inverse transform ===
The Hartley transform has the convenient property of being its own inverse (an involution):

formula_5

=== Conventions ===

The above is in accord with Hartley&#x27;s original definition, but (as with the Fourier transform) various minor details are matters of convention and can be changed without altering the essential properties:
*Instead of using the same transform for forward and inverse, one can remove the formula_6 from the forward transform and use formula_7 for the inverse—or, indeed, any pair of normalizations whose product is (Such asymmetrical normalizations are sometimes found in both purely mathematical and engineering contexts.)
*One can also use formula_8 instead of formula_9 (i.e., frequency instead of angular frequency), in which case the formula_6 coefficient is omitted entirely.
*One can use formula_11 instead of formula_12 as the kernel.

==Relation to Fourier transform==
This transform differs from the classic Fourier transform 
formula_13 in the choice of the kernel. In the Fourier transform, we have the exponential kernel,

where formula_14 is the imaginary unit.

The two transforms are closely related, however, and the Fourier transform (assuming it uses the same formula_15 normalization convention) can be computed from the Hartley transform via:

formula_16

That is, the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform are simply given by the even and odd parts of the Hartley transform, respectively.

Conversely, for real-valued functions the Hartley transform is given from the Fourier transform&#x27;s real and imaginary parts:

formula_17

where formula_18 and formula_19 denote the real and imaginary parts.

== Properties ==
The Hartley transform is a real linear operator, and is symmetric (and Hermitian). From the symmetric and self-inverse properties, it follows that the transform is a unitary operator (indeed, orthogonal).

Convolution using Hartley transforms is
formula_20
where formula_21 and formula_22

Similar to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform of an even/odd function is even/odd, respectively.

=== cas ===

The properties of the &quot;Hartley kernel&quot;, for which Hartley introduced the name &quot;cas&quot; for the function (from &quot;cosine and sine&quot;) in 1942, follow directly from trigonometry, and its definition as a phase-shifted trigonometric function For example, it has an angle-addition identity of:

formula_23

Additionally:

formula_24

and its derivative is given by:

formula_25

<text>The Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS), originally called the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, was a savings bank headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. PSFS was founded in December 1816, the first savings bank to organize and do business in the United States. The bank would develop as one of the largest savings banks in the United States and became a Philadelphia institution. Generations of Philadelphians first opened accounts as children and became lifelong depositors.

The bank was organized by a group of men led by Condy Raguet, who had read about the concept of savings banks becoming popular in Great Britain. The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches, and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s, PSFS had the most depositors of any savings bank in the United States; it was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children to put money into savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS.

In the 1970s, changes in the personal finance industry led to smaller banks struggling to stay open. A government solution had such banks merge with healthier ones and in 1982, the Western Savings Fund Society was merged with PSFS. The merger deal and changes in regulations allowed PSFS to expand into new business ventures. PSFS quickly began expanding into other fields such as corporate finance, mutual funds, and real estate development.

In 1984 PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. The new business venture led to the company losing millions of dollars; it was forced to sell off many of its subsidiaries and PSFS bank branches. Despite the effort, Meritor continued to lose money.

On December 11, 1992, federal regulators seized the 176-year-old bank and placed it into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC then sold its remaining assets to Mellon Financial for US$335 million (equivalent to $ in ). Mellon renamed the former PSFS branches Mellon PSFS, a name which lasted the end of 2001, when the branches were acquired by Citizens Financial Group.

==History==
===Founding===
Founded in 1816, the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society was the first savings bank to organize and do business in the United States. Savings banks had existed in Europe for years and in the early 1810s had grown rapidly through Great Britain. This growth became the topic of numerous journals and pamphlets, some of which were brought to the attention of Philadelphia businessman Condy Raguet in late November 1816.

Interested in the idea, Raguet approached associates, Richard Peters, Clement C. Biddle and Thomas Hale on creating a similar institution in Philadelphia. A meeting was held on November 25 to discuss the plan. A total of twelve men agreed to work together to form the bank. Along with Raguet, Peters, Biddle, and Hale, the other men, called associate founders, were Charles N. Bancker, Andrew Bayard, Samuel Breck, John McCrea, William Schlatter, John C. Stocker, John Strawbridge and Roberts Vaux. Over several meetings the group figured out the bank&#x27;s structure and positions. Andrew Bayard was elected the first president of the bank during the third meeting on November 28. The bank was named the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society because Raguet felt the name &quot;bank&quot; was unpopular and calling it a society would make it easier to receive a charter from the state legislature.

On December 4, 1816, the Articles of Association, which contain the earliest written use of the name Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, were adopted. The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society (PSFS) opened two days before on December 2 in the office of the Saving Fund Society&#x27;s first Secretary and Treasurer, George Billington. The office was located on the west side of South Sixth Street, between Chestnut and Market Streets. Depositing five dollars, the first depositor was Curtis Roberts, Raguet&#x27;s African American servant. On February 25, 1819, the Governor of Pennsylvania approved the Pennsylvania legislature&#x27;s act of incorporating the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society.

===Growth===
PSFS grew slowly, but as early as August 1817 there were resolutions authorizing setting up branch offices outside of Philadelphia in Northern Liberties and Southwark. At first PSFS was open only on Mondays for receiving deposits and Thursdays for giving payments. While PSFS soon opened daily for business, deposits and payments were still only taken on those days. In 1835 PSFS expanded giving out deposits and payments on both Mondays and Thursdays, and in 1865 it was open for all business daily.

In 1818, PSFS issued its first home mortgage to architect William Strickland for US$7,000 (). That same year PSFS moved its offices to Sixth and Minor Streets. In the 1820s PSFS moved three more times, to Decatur Street in 1821 and Third and Walnut Streets in 1826. The latter office proved too small, so PSFS quickly bought its own building elsewhere on Walnut Street and moved there on October 2, 1827. By 1833 PSFS again needed more room and PSFS bought property on which the bank built a structure designed by Thomas U. Walter. PSFS moved into the new building in February 1840.

In 1865 PSFS again began looking for a new location and in 1866 a location was found on Seventh and Walnut Streets. Designed by architect Addison Hutton construction began in 1868 and the PSFS Headquarters building was opened for business on October 11, 1869. Forced to expand even more, additions were later made in 1885-86 by Hutton and in 1897–98, designed by Frank Furness.

===20th century===
By 1917 the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society had the largest number of depositors of any savings bank in the United States and was second only to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. In 1923 PSFS began the first in-school banking program at William Penn School for Girls. The program was intended to teach children to save by allowing them to deposit money at the bank. In junior high schools PSFS had students work as tellers to collect and record deposits. PSFS also provided a separate counter just for student accounts at their headquarters. The School Accounts Counter included step stools for the youngest depositors. The program helped several generations of Philadelphians open up accounts as children, leading many to become lifelong customers.

Another way PSFS taught children to save money in savings banks was a program that produced pageants for playgrounds and settlement houses. The pageants included songs about thriftiness set to popular music, cheers, speeches that quoted historical figures&#x27; opinions on thriftiness, and a play. In the plays, costumed children warned the audience about spending money on treats, movies, and penny arcades instead of putting the money in a savings bank where it would grow.

By the end of the 1920s PSFS was the third largest savings bank in the United States and in 1935 was ranked thirty-fourth largest savings bank in the world. In 1932 PSFS built a new headquarters building on Market Street. The new PSFS Building was the first international style skyscraper built in the United States. The modern skyscraper was designed by George Howe and William Lescaze and is topped with the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society&#x27;s initials in red neon letters.

In 1948, PSFS was the second largest savings bank in the United States with deposits totaling US$594,460,363 (equivalent to $ in ). In the 1960s PSFS, along with three other Philadelphia savings banks, established a US$20 million (equivalent to $ in ) pool to finance mainly low and moderate income minority families.

===Expansion and crisis===
The United States in the 1970s saw numerous changes to personal finance such as the advent of credit cards, money-market funds and automated teller machines. These changes resulted in a crisis for traditional community banks. The crisis prompted the government to step in with a solution to force mergers between troubled banks and healthy banks such as PSFS. In April 1982, PSFS merged with the Western Savings Fund Society, receiving US$294 million (equivalent to $ in ) in assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The merger gained PSFS US$2 billion (equivalent to $ in ) in assets. FDIC also credited PSFS with US$800 million (equivalent to $ in ) in &quot;supervisory goodwill&quot;.

The deals also allowed the merged banks to expand into new business ventures. PSFS soon began expanding into new services such as equipment leasing, corporate finance and real estate development. In September 1983, PSFS converted from a mutual organization to a stock organization selling 35 million shares at US$11.25 each. In January 1984, PSFS began expanding into financial service by buying a loan portfolio and mortgage business from General Electric Credit Corp. for US$568 million (equivalent to $ in ). In April 1985, the company acquired four savings and loans in Florida and began paying five cents per share quarterly dividend to stockholders. In September of that year, PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. In 1986, Meritor began operating mutual funds through a subsidiary, completing the transition to a full-service financial institution.

In 1986, the bank went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend itself against a claim sexual harassment. In &quot;Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson&quot;, the court found the bank liable under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Things soon took a turn for the worse as the company began losing millions through its new business ventures as its competitors began encroaching on Meritor&#x27;s home market. Meritor&#x27;s stock prices continuously dropped from almost the moment they were first issued. In August 1985, Meritor revealed it invested $215 million (equivalent to $ in ) in a Virginia mortgage company that went bankrupt, and in October 1987, Meritor halted its dividend after announcing a third-quarter loss of $379.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). That same month the company also announced plans to sell some of its operations.

In January 1988 venture capitalist Frank Slattery bought 5.5 percent of Meritor&#x27;s stock, becoming the controlling shareholder. Slattery began pushing for changes and in June, with help from others, was able to demote chairman and CEO Frederick S. Hammer to president and replace him with Roger S. Hillas. To try to stanch the losses Hillas sold Meritor&#x27;s credit-card portfolio and some of its subsidiaries. Continuing to lose money, Meritor sold 54 suburban branches of PSFS, more than half of its branches, to Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank for US$335 million (equivalent to in ) in 1989. The deal, which included selling Mellon Bank the right to use the name PSFS, shed US$4.9 billion (equivalent to $ in ) in assets from Meritor. Earlier that year an extra &quot;s&quot; was added to the word &quot;Saving&quot; in the bank branches&#x27; name, becoming the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. When the deal went into effect in 1990 Meritor turned off the PSFS on the PSFS Building saying it was inappropriate to use the sign. Turning off the sign provoked protest from the public, historians and architecture buffs and Meritor and Mellon Bank agreed to relight the sign.

Despite the effort, conditions continued to deteriorate for Meritor and other banks around the United States. Not helping matters was a poor commercial real-estate market that left Meritor with empty Philadelphia office buildings and half-finished suburban strip shopping malls valued at fractions of their original cost. In February 1991, regulators demanded higher capital standards which Meritor failed to meet. A few months later in August, Meritor ending a troublesome dispute with bondholders by giving up 37 percent of its common stock plus cash to redeem US$115 million (equivalent to $ in ) in debt.

By October 1992, bank analysts had listed Meritor among institutions most likely to be seized by the end of the year. In the next month, worried depositors withdrew more than US$100 million (equivalent to $ in ) from PSFS branches. On December 4, Meritor sold off its Florida-based savings and loan subsidiary, the company&#x27;s last out-of-state banking operation. On December 11, 1992, the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Meritor and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC, who sold Meritor&#x27;s 27 remaining branches to Mellon Bank for US$181 million (equivalent to $ in ).

==Aftermath==

===Mellon PSFS===
After purchasing the PSFS bank branches and the PSFS name from Meritor, Mellon began operating its bank branches as Mellon PSFS. Acquiring the remainder of the PSFS branches from Meritor in 1992, Mellon continued to expand in the 1990s including the construction of combination Mellon PSFS and Acme Markets branches, the first of which opened in 1994. In 2001, Mellon PSFS had 350 branches and 650,000 customers in Pennsylvania, South New Jersey and Delaware. Mellon PSFS&#x27;s parent company, Mellon Financial, was interested in abandoning its retail banking assets and focus on high income investments. On July 17, 2001, Mellon Financial announced it was selling its retail banking business, including Mellon PSFS, to Citizens Financial Group for US$2 billion (equivalent to $ in ). At the end of November 2001, all Mellon PSFS branches became branches of the newly formed Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania.

===Lawsuit===
The money Mellon Bank paid went to the FDIC, leaving Meritor&#x27;s stockholders with nothing. In 1993 Slatterywho had long opposed government interference in businesssued the FDIC, claiming regulators reneged on their 1982 promise to permit goodwill in the company&#x27;s merger with Western Savings Fund Society. The lawsuit kept the stock for the now defunct company alive with speculators buying shares for as little as 5 cents with hopes of a government payout to settle the case. Most of the 55 million outstanding Meritor shares are believed to be owned by speculators or PSFS depositors who had bought shares when the company first went public.

Over the next decade there was little news on the progress of the case, with a website, meritorpsfs.com, the main source of information. On August 16, 2002, a judge ruled that the FDIC was wrong in seizing Meritor and that shareholders were entitled to damages. On February 10, 2006, Meritor investors were awarded US$371.7 million (equivalent to $ in ), totaling US$6.75 a share.

In &quot;Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S.&quot;, after losing before a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, the government petitioned for a rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the &quot;en banc&quot; court agrees and finds that appropriated funds may not be used to pay judgments against NAFI&#x27;s, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government is arguing that Congress has no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.

<doc id="596565" wikidata="Q1033439" url="?curid=596565" title="Cannock Chase District">
<text>Cannock Chase is a local government district in Staffordshire, England. It is named after and covers a large part of Cannock Chase, a designated National Landscape. The council is based in the town of Cannock. The district also contains the towns of Hednesford and Rugeley, as well as a number of villages and surrounding rural areas.

The district borders South Staffordshire to the west, the Borough of Stafford to the north, Lichfield District to the east, and the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall to the south.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering two former districts plus a single parish from a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Brindley Heath parish from Lichfield Rural District
*Cannock Urban District
*Rugeley Urban District

The new district was named Cannock Chase after the landscape and former royal forest which covers much of the area.

==Governance==
Cannock Chase District Council, which styles itself &quot;Cannock Chase Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Staffordshire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

The council&#x27;s logo is a deer, referencing the area&#x27;s past as a royal hunting forest and the fact that deer are common in the area. A survey in 2022 found that the deer population was growing.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2024 election.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2005 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council is:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes took effect in 2024, the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 12 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office. Staffordshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

The district covers the same area as the Cannock Chase (UK Parliament constituency). Until the 2010 general election the constituency also included the adjacent village of Huntington in South Staffordshire. From 2010 onwards the constituency has exactly the same boundaries as the district.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Beecroft Road in Cannock. The building was purpose-built for the council between 1978 and 1981.

==Demography==
According to data from the 2011 United Kingdom census, Cannock Chase has a population of 100,600, with 49,500 males and 51,100 females. 62.5% of the population is between the ages of 16–64, of which 88.7% is economically active, 11.2% above the West Midlands regional average.

==Media==

The &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; is the local newspaper that cover the district. 

==Towns and parishes==
Much of the district is covered by eight civil parishes. The exception is certain parts of Cannock, which are unparished. The parish councils for Hednesford and Rugeley have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

When the district was created in 1974 it only contained one parish, being Brindley Heath; the former Rugeley Urban District and Cannock Urban District were both unparished. In 1988 two parishes called Rugeley and Brereton were created covering the former Rugeley Urban District, and four parishes called Bridgtown, Cannock Wood, Heath Hayes and Wimblebury, and Norton Canes were created covering parts of the former Cannock Urban District. The parish of Hednesford was subsequently created in 2000 from another part of the former Cannock Urban District.

The parishes are:

*Brereton and Ravenhill
*Bridgtown
*Brindley Heath
*Cannock Wood
*Heath Hayes and Wimblebury
*Hednesford (town)
*Norton Canes 
*Rugeley (town)
Other areas and settlements include:

<doc id="596566" wikidata="Q191644" url="?curid=596566" title="Eva Green">
<text>Eva Gaëlle Green (; ; born ) is a French British-based actress, known for her roles in blockbuster independent films and for her eccentric, graphic, and sexually charged roles. The daughter of actress Marlène Jobert, she began her career in theatre before making her film debut in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003). She portrayed Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem in Ridley Scott&#x27;s historical epic &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005). The following year, she played Bond girl Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), for which she received the BAFTA Rising Star Award.

Green has since starred in numerous independent films, including &quot;Cracks&quot; (2009), &quot;Womb&quot; (2010), and &quot;Perfect Sense&quot; (2011). In 2014, she played Artemisia in the &quot;300&quot; sequel &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot; and Ava Lord in Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; sequel &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;. Green is also known for her collaborations with director Tim Burton, starring as Angelique Bouchard in the horror comedy film &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012), the titular character of the fantasy film &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot; (2016), and Colette Marchant in the fantasy film &quot;Dumbo&quot; (2019). For her role as an astronaut mother in the drama film &quot;Proxima&quot; (2019), she earned a nomination for the César Award for Best Actress.

Green starred as Morgan Pendragon in the Starz historical fantasy series &quot;Camelot&quot; (2011). She also starred as Vanessa Ives in the Showtime horror drama series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016), earning critical acclaim and a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.

== Early life ==

Eva Gaëlle Green was born on 6 July 1980, two minutes earlier than her fraternal twin sister Joy. She is the daughter of French actress and author Marlène Jobert and Dr Walter Green, a Swedish dental surgeon and occasional actor in his youth (&quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; directed by Robert Bresson).

Green is of Jewish descent through her Algerian-born mother. Green has described herself as &quot;a secular Jew who never attended synagogue as a girl&quot; and feels &quot;like a citizen of the world&quot;. She has described her family as &quot;bourgeois&quot; and has said that her sister is very different from her. Green is naturally dark blonde; she has dyed her hair brown since she was 15 years old. She is the great-granddaughter of French composer Paul Le Flem and of Swedish photographer Mia Green, the niece of actress Marika Green and the maternal first cousin of singer Elsa Lunghini and actress Joséphine Jobert. The surname &quot;Green&quot; is derived from the Swedish word &quot;gren&quot;, which means &quot;tree branch&quot;.

Green was raised in France and attended the American University of Paris, an English-speaking institution. She also spent time between London and Ireland growing up. She was quiet in school and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven. At age 14, after seeing Isabelle Adjani in &quot;The Story of Adele H.&quot;, Green decided to become an actress. Her mother initially feared that an acting career would be too much for her sensitive daughter, but later came to support her ambitions. Eva Green has a keen interest in psychology. She has mentioned in interviews that she finds the human mind fascinating and enjoys exploring complex characters with psychological depth in her roles. Green continued her studies at Cours Eva Saint Paul in Paris and took an acting course at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After that, Green returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays. Green stated that when she was in drama school, she &quot;always picked the really evil roles&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s a great way to deal with your everyday emotions&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 2001–2005 ===

Green appeared on stage in &quot;Jalousie en Trois Fax&quot; (2001) for which she was nominated for a Molière Award. She also appeared in &quot;Turcaret&quot; (2002).

In 2002, Green had her film debut, when director Bernardo Bertolucci cast her for the role of Isabelle in &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and rear nude scenes as well as graphic sex scenes. Green told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to &quot;have the same destiny as Maria Schneider&quot;, because of Schneider&#x27;s traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. Green said that with Bertolucci&#x27;s guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, &quot;[T]here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex.&quot; Her next film was &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot; (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin&#x27;s love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.

Her performance in &quot;The Dreamers&quot; led Ridley Scott to cast Green in &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005), a film about the Crusades where she played Sibylla, Princess of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began. Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and she liked the film&#x27;s ambiguity in approaching its subject matter. To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon.com&quot; praised her performance: &quot;She doesn&#x27;t quite know what to do with her character&#x27;s stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice.&quot; Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character &quot;limp&quot;. Green was satisfied when her character&#x27;s complex subplot was restored in the director&#x27;s cut. &quot;Total Film&quot; said the new scenes completed her performance: &quot;In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he&#x27;s afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he&#x27;s been crowned king.&quot;
=== 2006–2013 ===
Green was considered for roles in &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; (a role that went to Rachel Weisz) and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. She was cast at the last minute for the role of Vesper Lynd in the 2006 &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down. Principal photography was already underway, and director Martin Campbell said casting the role was difficult because &quot;we didn&#x27;t have the final script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits &#x27;n&#x27; ass.&quot; Campbell saw Green&#x27;s performance in the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, and approached Green again. She read the script, and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls. Green&#x27;s performance was well received: &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called her the fourth-best Bond girl of all time; IGN named her the best &quot;femme fatale&quot;, stating, &quot;This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond&quot;; and she won a BAFTA and an &quot;Empire&quot; award for her performance. Both awards were voted for by the British public.

Green portrayed the witch Serafina Pekkala in the 2007 film adaptation of &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;. Green hoped the religious themes of the book would be preserved, but references to Catholicism were removed from the film. Green next appeared in &quot;Franklyn&quot;, as the tormented artist Emilia, (who Green compared to real-life figures Sophie Calle and Tracey Emin) and the mysterious Sally, who she described as, &quot;full of life, very witty, big sense of humor&quot;. She also filmed &quot;Cracks&quot;, the directorial debut of Jordan Scott, Ridley Scott&#x27;s daughter, where she plays a teacher at a girls&#x27; school named Miss G, who falls in love with one of her pupils. In March 2009, she appeared in &quot;Womb&quot;, where she plays a woman who clones her dead boyfriend. It is a collaboration between actor Matt Smith and director Benedek Fliegauf.

She was considered for the role eventually played by Cécile de France in &quot;Un Secret&quot; (2007). Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier&#x27;s controversial film &quot;Antichrist&quot; (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film&#x27;s pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role. Green later said that she got along well with Trier, &quot;but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on. It got a bit too far ... It was my dream to work with him, but it&#x27;s a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened. I&#x27;m sure I would have been trashed doing that film&quot;.

In 2011, Green signed with United Talent Agency in the US, remaining represented by Tavistock Wood in the UK. Green then starred in the first season of Starz&#x27;s series, &quot;Camelot&quot;, as the sorceress Morgan le Fay. Green stated, &quot;This is such an iconic story and you have 10 episodes to explore a character. It&#x27;s not a girlfriend role that you could have in a movie. It&#x27;s a real ballsy character. She has some guts.&quot; 
=== 2014–2018===

In 2014, she played Artemisia in the &quot;300&quot; sequel, &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot; for which she received excellent reviews. Rafer Guzman in his &quot;Newsday&quot; review stated, &quot;The one bright spot is Eva Green as Xerxes&#x27; machinator, Artemesia, a raccoon-eyed warrior princess... Green plays a snarling, insatiable, self-hating femme fatale and completely steals the show.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; exclaimed, &quot;&quot;Rise of an Empire&quot; might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!&quot;

Between May 2014 and 2016, Green starred in the Showtime horror drama series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; as Vanessa Ives. Her performance earned her a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards. She also played the titular role of Ava Lord in the &quot;Sin City&quot; sequel film, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; (2014).

In 2016, Green reunited with Tim Burton in &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;, a film based on the 2011 novel by Ransom Riggs. Green collaborated once more with Burton in Disney&#x27;s 2019 live-action adaptation of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, co-starring with Colin Farrell and Michael Keaton. In 2018, she was appointed as a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an honorary award given by the French government.

In 2019, she starred in the French drama film &quot;Proxima&quot; directed by Alice Winocour. Green&#x27;s performance in the movie was met with critical acclaim and she was eventually nominated for the César Award for Best Actress. In 2020, she starred as Lydia Wells in the BBC One miniseries &quot;The Luminaries&quot;, based on the 2013 novel by Eleanor Catton.

=== &quot;A Patriot&quot; film abandonment and lawsuit ===

In April 2018, it was announced that Green would star in the sci-fi thriller film &quot;A Patriot&quot;. In August 2020, it was reported that the actress, who was also an executive producer on the project, was suing the production company, White Lantern Film, because it had refused to pay her an £800,000 ($1.04 million) fee after the project was abandoned, and a pay-or-play contract had been agreed on. In its own suit, White Lantern claims Green derailed the film, for example demanding that additional expensive crew be hired. The company also claimed Green owed it more than £1 million ($1.3 million) after walking away from the project. Green won the lawsuit in April 2023.

During the lawsuit WhatsApp messages between Green and friends included references to her describing potential crew members as &quot;shitty peasants&quot;, the production as a &quot;B-shitty-movie&quot; and producer Jake Seal as &quot;pure vomit&quot;. However, the Judge found: &quot;She may have said some extremely unpleasant things about Mr Seal and his crew at Black Hangar, but this was borne from a genuine feeling of concern that any film made under Mr Seal’s control would be of very low quality and would not do justice to a script that she and the former directors were passionate about.&quot;

=== 2022–present ===
Green appeared in &quot;Nocebo&quot;, a thriller produced by teams from Ireland and the Philippines, released on 4 November 2022 in the US and on 9 December 2022 in the UK and Ireland. In June 2021, it was announced that Green would serve as the lead character in the British-French Apple TV+ series &quot;Liaison&quot;, co-starring Vincent Cassel. The series premiered on 24 February 2023.

In 2023, she portrayed Milady de Winter in two French film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;; &quot;The Three Musketeers: D&#x27;Artagnan&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers: Milady&quot;, both directed by Martin Bourboulon.

== Personal life ==
Green has been living in London since 2005. She has stated that she is happier in England than in France. &quot;The London parks, the people, the humour, it&#x27;s a great place. You can tell by the different taxi drivers. London taxi drivers are polite and friendly. Parisian ones are just so unhappy. For them the world has too many problems,&quot; she said.

Green considers herself &quot;nerdy&quot;. She also says, &quot;When people first meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so drawn to acting. It allows me to wear a mask.&quot; She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she is not working. When asked in an interview what people would be surprised to find out about her, she responded, &quot;I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. Boring, huh?&quot; Green has expressed interests in taxidermy and entomology; she collects preserved skulls and insects.

When asked about her preference to play graphic, sexually charged roles, Green described it as &quot;paradoxical&quot; given her self-confessed shyness. She commented humorously, &quot;I don&#x27;t really understand why I do that. I need to go through therapy!&quot; Green also favours dark, twisted characters, as they allow her to feel liberated. She spoke about her role in &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; as, &quot;it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t have a corset anymore when I&#x27;m playing Vanessa, you know? People will think that it&#x27;s terrible to have fun in a show like that. But I do.&quot; However, she has tried to take more diverse roles in order to avoid being typecast.

Green is non-religious Jewish, though she describes herself as &quot;very spiritual&quot; and having complex beliefs about supernatural forces.

Green has expressed interest in returning to theatre. She says she has no plans to work in Hollywood full-time because &quot;the problem with Hollywood is that the studios are super powerful, they have far more power than the directors... [my] ambition at this moment is just to find a good script&quot;.

From 2005 to 2009, she was in a romantic relationship with her &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; co-star Marton Csokas.

In 2017, she revealed that Harvey Weinstein made an inappropriate advance during a business meeting but she &quot;pushed him off&quot;.

<text>The Peekskill riots took place at Cortlandt Manor, New York in 1949. The catalyst for the rioting was an announced concert by black singer Paul Robeson, who was well known for his strong pro-trade union stance, civil rights activism, communist affiliations, and anti-colonialism. The concert, organized as a benefit for the Civil Rights Congress, was scheduled to take place on August 27 in Lakeland Acres, just north of Peekskill.

==Paul Robeson&#x27;s remarks in Paris, 1949==

Robeson had given three earlier concerts in Peekskill without incident, but in the years leading up to the riots, Robeson had been increasingly vocal against the Ku Klux Klan and other forces of white supremacy, both domestically and internationally. Robeson specifically made a transformation from someone who was primarily a singer into a political persona who vocally supported what were, at the time, considered &quot;communist&quot; causes, including the decolonization of Africa, anti-Jim Crow legislation, and peace with the Soviet Union. Robeson had also appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities to oppose a bill that would require communists to register as foreign agents and, just months before the concerts in 1949, he had appeared at the Soviet-sponsored World Peace Conference in Paris. Referring to the growing tensions between the Americans and the Soviets, he stated:

We in America do not forget that it was the backs of white workers from Europe and on the backs of millions of blacks that the wealth of America was built. And we are resolved to share it equally. We reject any hysterical raving that urges us to make war on anyone. Our will to fight for peace is strong... We shall support peace and friendship among all nations, with Soviet Russia and the People&#x27;s Republics.

What came over the wires to news agencies via the AP in the United States was as follows,

We colonial peoples have contributed to the building of the United States and are determined to share its wealth. We denounce the policy of the United States government which is similar to Hitler and Goebbels... It is unthinkable that American Negros would go to war on behalf of those who have oppressed us for generations against the Soviet Union which in one generation has lifted our people to full human dignity.

Later examination of time records showed that the AP dispatched this fabricated version on its wires as Robeson began speaking. The comment was not investigated by the American press for its veracity and there was nationwide condemnation of Robeson. In the early stages of the Cold War and its accompanying wide anti-communist sentiments in the West, this statement was seen by many as very anti-American. The local paper, the Peekskill &quot;Evening Star&quot;, condemned the concert and encouraged people to make their position on communism felt, but did not directly espouse violence. The riots were explicitly racist, with the rioters shouting racist terms for African Americans and Jews, burning crosses, and lynching effigies of Robeson both in Peekskill and in other areas of the United States.

==First concert==
The concert, organized as a benefit for the Civil Rights Congress, was scheduled to take place on August 27 in Lakeland Acres, just north of Peekskill. Before Robeson arrived, a mob of locals attacked concert-goers with baseball bats and rocks. The local police arrived hours later and did little to intervene. Thirteen people were seriously injured, Robeson was lynched in effigy, and a cross was seen burning on an adjacent hillside. The concert was then postponed until September 4. Following the concert, request for Klan memberships from the Peekskill area numbered 748 persons.

Robeson&#x27;s longtime friend and Peekskill resident, Helen Rosen, who had agreed to collect Robeson at the train station, had heard on the radio that protesters were massing at the concert grounds. Robeson drove with Rosen and two others to the concert site and saw marauding groups of youngsters, a burning cross on a nearby hill and a jeering crowd throwing rocks and chanting &quot;Dirty Commie&quot; and &quot;Dirty Kikes.&quot; Robeson made more than one attempt to get out of the car and confront the mob but was restrained by his friends.

The media were flooded with reactions and charges. The Joint Veterans Council of Peekskill refused to admit any involvement, describing its activities as a &quot;protest parade...held without disorder and...perfectly disbanded.&quot; Peekskill police officials said the picnic grounds had been outside their jurisdiction; a state police spokesman said there had never been a request for state troopers. The commander of Peekskill Post 274 of the American Legion stated: &quot;Our objective was to prevent the Paul Robeson concert and I think our objective was reached.&quot;

===Meetings to protest the first riot===
Following a meeting of local citizens, union members, and Robeson supporters who formed The Westchester Committee for Law and Order, it unanimously was determined that Robeson should be invited back to perform at Peekskill. Representatives from various left wing unions - the Fur and Leather Workers, the Longshoremen and the United Electrical Workers - all agreed to converge and serve as a wall of defense around the concert grounds. Ten union men slept on the property of the Rosens, effectively guarding it. A call was put out by the Emergency Committee to Protest the Peekskill Riot. On Tuesday, August 30, an overflow crowd of 3,000 people assembled peacefully and without incident at the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem to hear Robeson speak,

==Second concert==
The rescheduled September 4, 1949 concert was free from violence, but marred by the presence of a police helicopter overhead and the flushing out of at least one sniper&#x27;s nest. The concert was located on the grounds of the old Hollow Brook Golf Course in Cortlandt Manor, near the site of the original concert. 20,000 people showed up. Security was organized by the Communist Party and Communist-dominated labor unions. The men were directed by the Communist Party and some unions to form a line around the outer edge of the concert area and were sitting with Robeson on the stage. They were there to fight any protestors who objected to Robeson&#x27;s presence. They effectively kept the local police from the concert area. The musicians performed without incident.

===Setlist===

* Sylvia Kahn: &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;
* Piano performances by Leonid Hambro and Ray Lev including works by Chopin and Bach, Prokofiev and Ravel
* Singing by soprano Hope Foye
* Pete Seeger: &quot;T For Texas&quot;, &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;, and another song
* Paul Robeson: &quot;Go Down Moses&quot;, the English ballad &quot;No John No&quot;, and &quot;Farewell, My Son, I&#x27;m Dying&quot; (, &quot;Proshchay, moy syn, umirayu...&quot;), the final aria from &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;
* Appeal for funds
* Paul Robeson: Seven other songs, including &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and Negro spirituals ending with &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;

Robeson&#x27;s accompaniment was provided by Larry Brown.

===Aftermath===
The aftermath of the concert, however, was far from peaceful. After some violence to south-going buses near the intersection of Locust Avenue and Hillside Avenue, Hillside Avenue having since been renamed Oregon Road, concertgoers were diverted to head northward to Oregon Corners and forced to run a gauntlet miles long of veterans and their families, who threw rocks through windshields of the cars and buses. Much of the violence was also caused by anti-Communist members of local Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion chapters. Standing off the angry mob of rioters chanting &quot;go on back to Russia, you niggers&quot; and &quot;white niggers&quot;, some of the concertgoers and union members, along with writer Howard Fast and others assembled a non-violent line of resistance, locked arms, and sang the song &quot;We Shall Not Be Moved.&quot; Some people were reportedly dragged from their vehicles and beaten. Over 140 people were injured and numerous vehicles were severely damaged as police stood by. 

;Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie
One car carried Woody Guthrie, Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, Seeger&#x27;s wife Toshi, and his infant children. Guthrie pinned a shirt to the inside of the window to stop it shattering. &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, Woody pinned up a red shirt,&quot; Hays was to remember. Seeger used some of the thrown rocks to build the chimney of his cabin in the Town of Fishkill, New York, to stand as a reminder of the incident.

;Eugene Bullard
Eugene Bullard, the first black combat pilot and decorated World War I veteran, was knocked to the ground and beaten by the mob, which included white members of state and local law enforcement. The beating was captured on film and can be seen in the 1970s documentary &quot;The Tallest Tree in Our Forest&quot; and the Oscar-winning, Sidney Poitier-narrated documentary &quot;Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist&quot;. Despite recorded evidence of the beating, no one was prosecuted for the assault. Graphic photos of Eugene Bullard being beaten by two policemen, a state trooper and concert-goer, were published in &quot;The Whole World in His Hands: A Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson&quot;, by Susan Robeson.

===Protests afterwards===
Following the riots, more than 300 people went to Albany, New York to express their indignation to Governor Thomas Dewey, who refused to meet with them, blaming communists for provoking the violence. Twenty-seven plaintiffs filed a civil suit against Westchester County and two veterans&#x27; groups. The charges were dismissed three years later.

===Reactions in the U.S. House of Representatives===

Following the Peekskill riots, Democratic House Representative John E. Rankin of Mississippi condemned Robeson on the house floor. When New York Congressman Jacob Javits, a liberal Republican, spoke to the United States House of Representatives, deploring the Peekskill riots as a violation of constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and free assembly, Rankin replied angrily: &quot;It was not surprising to hear the gentlemen from New York defend the Communist enclave.&quot; Rankin said that he wanted it known that the American people are not in sympathy &quot;with that Nigger Communist and that bunch of Reds who went up there.&quot; On a point of order, American Labor Party House Representative Vito Marcantonio protested to House Speaker Sam Rayburn that &quot;the gentlemen from Mississippi used the word &#x27;nigger.&#x27; I ask that the word be taken down and stricken from the RECORD inasmuch as there are two members in this house of Negro race.&quot; Rayburn claimed that Rankin had not said &quot;nigger&quot; but &quot;Negro&quot; but Rankin yelled over him saying &quot;I said Niggra! Just as I have said since I have been able to talk and shall continue to say.&quot; Speaker Rayburn then defended Rankin, ruling that &quot;the gentlemen from Mississippi is not subject to a point of order...referred to the Negro race and they should not be afraid of that designation.&quot; Then Democratic Representative Edward E. Cox of Georgia denounced Robeson on the House floor as a &quot;Communist agent provocateur.&quot;

===Aftermath===
Within a few days, hundreds of editorials and letters appeared in newspapers across the nation and abroad by prominent individuals, organizations, trade unions, churches and others. They condemned the attacks and the failure of Governor Dewey and the State Police to protect the lives and property of citizens as well as called for a full investigation of the violence and prosecution of the perpetrators. Despite condemnation from progressives and civil rights activists, the mainstream press and local officials overwhelmingly blamed Robeson and his fans for &quot;provoking&quot; the violence. Following the Peekskill riots, other cities became fearful of similar incidents, and over 80 scheduled concert dates of Robeson&#x27;s were canceled.

On September 12, 1949, in response to Robeson&#x27;s controversial status in the press and leftist affiliations, the National Maritime Union convention considered a motion that Robeson&#x27;s name be removed from the union&#x27;s honorary membership list. The motion was withdrawn for lack of support among members. Later that month, the All-China Art and Literature Workers&#x27; Association and All-China Association of Musicians of Liberated China protested the Peekskill attack on Robeson. On October 2, 1949, Robeson spoke at a luncheon for the National Labor Conference for Peace held at the Ashland Auditorium in Chicago, referred the riots in his remarks.

==Legacy and reconciliation ceremonies==
In recent years, Westchester County has gone to great lengths to make amends to the survivors of the riots by holding a commemorative ceremony, at which an apology was made for their treatment. In September 1999, county officials held a &quot;Remembrance and Reconciliation Ceremony, 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1949 Peekskill riots.&quot; It included speakers Paul Robeson, Jr., folk singer Peter Seeger and several local elected officials.

==The Peekskill riots in fiction==
*The Peekskill riots appear in E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;. Paul Isaacson (a fictionalized version of Julius Rosenberg) leaves the bus to reason with the mob, and is beaten up by them.
*The riots figure prominently in T. C. Boyle&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;. The protagonist&#x27;s adoptive parents serve as local, assistant organizers of the concert (alias of &quot;Peterskill&quot; riots within the book).
* In George Mandel&#x27;s &quot;Flee the Angry Strangers&quot;, published in 1952, there is brief mention of the riots.
* In Ring Lardner Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Ecstasy of Owen Muir &quot; (1954), there is an extensive segment concerning the incidents at Peekskill.

<doc id="596574" wikidata="Q592237" url="?curid=596574" title="John Benbow">
<text>Vice-Admiral John Benbow (10 March 16534 November 1702) was an English Royal Navy officer. He joined the Navy in 1678, seeing action against Barbary pirates before leaving to join the Merchant Navy in which Benbow served until the 1688 Glorious Revolution, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned.

Benbow fought against the French Navy during the Nine Years&#x27; War, serving on and later commanding several English warships and taking part in the battles of Beachy Head and Barfleur and La Hogue in 1690 and 1692. He went on to achieve fame during his military accomplishments, which included fighting against Barbary pirates such as the Salé Rovers, besieging Saint-Malo and seeing action in the West Indies against the French during the War of the Spanish Succession.

Benbow&#x27;s fame and success earned him a promotion to the rank of vice-admiral. He subsequently fought at the action of August 1702, in which a number of his captains refused to support him in attacking the French. Benbow instigated the court-martial and subsequent imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results, dying of wounds sustained in battle. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in popular culture.

== Family and early years ==
Benbow was born the son of William and Martha Benbow. The astrologer John Partridge recorded the exact time and date of his birth as being at noon on 10 March 1653, and this is the date used by the National Museum of the Royal Navy, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and the local historical accounts of Joseph Nightingale published in 1818. A biography within an 1819 publication of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, however, records in a short biography entitled &quot;Life and Exploits of Admiral Benbow&quot; by D. Parkes that he was born in 1650, as does the 1861 &quot;Sea kings and naval heroes&quot; by John George Edgar. Edgar records that Benbow&#x27;s father died when Benbow was very young, while Parkes&#x27; account describes his father as being in the service of the Army under Charles I and not dying until Benbow was in his teens. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; writes that Benbow&#x27;s father was in fact a tanner. Meanwhile, his uncle, Thomas, was executed by Charles I. Both Parkes and the National Museum of the Royal Navy concur that Benbow was born in Coton Hill in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Nightingale asserts that the death of both uncle and father, and the family&#x27;s association with Charles I in the years following his execution, ensured that the &quot;family were brought very low&quot;. Benbow&#x27;s lack of possessions, Nightingale writes, turned him to a career at sea.

== Naval career ==
=== Early years ===
Benbow entered the Royal Navy on 30 April 1678, aged 25 years. He became master&#x27;s mate aboard the 64-gun under the command of Captain Arthur Herbert, while she was fitting out at Portsmouth. He sailed with her to the Mediterranean, where Herbert was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral while serving under the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir John Narborough. During this period the English fleet was often in action against the Barbary pirates of North Africa that were actively preying upon European shipping. &quot;Rupert&quot; herself captured an Algerine warship in 1678, which was later commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Tiger Prize&quot;. Benbow distinguished himself well in a number of actions against the Algerine vessels, and won Herbert&#x27;s approval. On Narborough&#x27;s return to England, Herbert was appointed acting commander-in-chief, and made Benbow master aboard on 15 June 1679. &quot;Nonsuch&quot; would remain at Tangiers and off the African coast and had a number of successive captains who would go on to achieve flag rank, including George Rooke, Cloudesley Shovell and Francis Wheler. All were impressed by Benbow, and would afterwards help to advance his career.

&quot;Nonsuch&quot; was next in action on 8 August 1681, this time against the Algerine warship &quot;Golden Horse&quot;. &quot;Golden Horse&quot; had been engaged by , under the command of Captain William Booth, and when &quot;Nonsuch&quot; arrived on the scene &quot;Golden Horse&quot; surrendered. A dispute then arose over the question of the prize money and how it should be shared out, and comments were made amongst &quot;Nonsuch&quot;″s crew against those of &quot;Adventure&quot;. Benbow&#x27;s repetition of these eventually came to Booth&#x27;s knowledge, and the captain brought a court-martial against Benbow; however, this revealed that Benbow had only been repeating these words rather than being their originator. Benbow was ordered to forfeit three months&#x27; pay, amounting to £12 15s., to &quot;Adventure&quot;″s crew, and to &quot;ask Captain Booth&#x27;s pardon on board His Majesty&#x27;s ship &quot;Bristol&quot;, declaring that he had no malicious intent in speaking those words; all the commanders being present, and a boat&#x27;s crew of each ship&#x27;s company&quot;.

=== Merchant trading ===
&quot;Nonsuch&quot; then returned to England and was paid off on 9 November 1681. Benbow left the Royal Navy and entered the merchant service, sailing a merchant vessel from London and Bristol to ports in Italy and Spain. By 1686 he was a &quot;tough merchant seaman&quot; and the owner and commander of a frigate named &quot;Benbow&quot;, trading with the Levant. In May 1687 he commanded a merchant vessel, &quot;Malaga Merchant&quot;, and was aboard her when she was attacked by the Salé Rovers. He mounted a successful defence and beat off the attack. It was claimed afterwards that he cut off and salted the heads of thirteen North African pirates who were slain aboard his ship, and then took them into Cadiz to claim a reward from the city&#x27;s magistrates. A North African kufi, &quot;coated with varnish and set in silver&quot; and bearing the inscription &quot;First adventure of Captain John Benbow, and gift to Richard Ridley, 1687&quot; is referred to in 1844 by Charles Dickens in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; where he speaks of Shrewsbury&#x27;s history, and the 1885 &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; also relates the story.

=== Return to the Navy ===

Benbow only returned to the Royal Navy after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. His first recorded commission was to the post of third lieutenant of on 1 June 1689, under the command of Captain David Mitchell. His first command came on 20 September of that year, when he was appointed captain of . He was transferred to on 26 October and then to on 12 November.

Benbow&#x27;s next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He then moved to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he intermittently held for the next six years. He was master of HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not, however, testify during Torrington&#x27;s court-martial in December that year.

Benbow continued aboard &quot;Sovereign&quot; throughout 1691, and by the summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard &quot;Britannia&quot;. Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell&#x27;s first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell&#x27;s clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet. He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid as a master, in addition to his master attendant&#x27;s wage, presumably as an acknowledgement of his special services.

=== With the bomb flotillas ===

Benbow returned to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the second engineer of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun and began the bombardment on 26 November. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An attempt was made to bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable damage was done, and Benbow&#x27;s forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disable it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer. There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective.

Benbow&#x27;s experience led to him being promoted to a similar flotilla, this time to be deployed against Dunkirk under the command of Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow&#x27;s attacking fleet was covered by Shovell&#x27;s fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow&#x27;s squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.

=== Rise to admiral ===

Benbow was soon at sea again in March 1695, being appointed commander-in-chief of His Majesty&#x27;s ships which were then off the coast of France. His squadron was highly successful, taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes. Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley, who had served with Benbow at Saint-Malo, to be promoted to rear-admiral at the next opportunity, and in the meantime he was appointed to the command of the 70-gun . He was soon joined by a volunteer – his then fourteen-year-old son – also named John Benbow. Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant-admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint-Malo, intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area. Benbow moved to command , to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships, nine English bomb vessels, and seventeen small boats and vessels. They began operations on their arrival off Saint-Malo on 4 July, remaining in action until evening the next day when they withdrew, without having achieved any decisive result. Several houses had been destroyed for the damage and loss of a few of the bomb vessels. Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast. He attacked Granville on 8 July, shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours, and departed having set the town ablaze.

=== Public and private reception ===
The outcome of the operations had left Benbow in a tense relationship with his immediate superiors. Berkeley had been accused of excessive timidity in his actions, which it was believed had led to the failure of the attack on Dunkirk. Benbow on the other hand was widely lauded for his fearless inshore attacks with his bomb vessels. Berkeley wrote on 28 July:

As to Captain Benbow, I know of no difference between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called in some of the foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.

However, the Admiralty approved of Benbow&#x27;s conduct and ordered him &quot;to be paid as Rear-Admiral during the time he has been employed this summer on the coast of France ... as a reward for his good service.&quot; Benbow was then appointed to the grand committee of sixty men to oversee the plans for Greenwich Hospital in December 1695, but the issue dragged on until 1 May 1696. The Admiralty again stepped in, and Benbow was finally promoted and appointed commander-in-chief of the squadron before Dunkirk as &quot;Rear-Admiral of the Blue for the duration of this present expedition&quot; and moved aboard the 70-gun . His orders were to protect English and Dutch shipping, especially from the squadron of the privateer Jean Bart. Bart, however, was mostly successful in evading pursuit, usually escaping into Dunkirk when Benbow&#x27;s force drew near.

Benbow was appointed to command a squadron in the Soundings in December 1696. He carried out a number of cruises between March and August 1697, protecting allied trade and escorting the West Indian and Virginian merchant fleets into port. These activities marked the last English naval expedition of the war. He also carried out reconnaissance activities on the French fleet in port in Brest in July, before resuming patrol operations off Dunkirk, this time in concert with a number of Dutch ships under Rear-Admiral Philips van der Goes, until the end of the war in September 1697.

=== Appointment to the West Indies ===
Benbow was made commander-in-chief of the King&#x27;s ships in the West Indies on 9 March 1698, and instructed to tackle the issue of piracy. He sailed in November, the first leg taking him from Portsmouth to Madeira. Sailing under his protection from the Salé Rovers was &quot;Paramore&quot;, under Edmond Halley, then sailing to the North Atlantic to carry out experiments to observe magnetic variations. Benbow finally reached Barbados in February 1699, and moved to the Spanish Main aboard his flagship, the 60-gun . He threatened the governor of Cartagena with a blockade, and so compelled him to restore two English merchant ships that he had detained. These ships had been intended to take part in an expedition against the Scottish Darién scheme. Without the ships, this became impossible and the colonists were saved for the time being. This was counter to the English government&#x27;s desire to see the end of the Scottish colonising efforts, and in June Benbow and the other West Indies governors received orders &quot;not to assist the Scotch colony in Darien&quot;.

Benbow then sailed as far north as Newfoundland in order to drive the pirates away, but they evaded capture. Benbow returned to England in the summer of 1700, and was appointed to the command of a fleet in the Downs. Benbow served there until summer 1701, under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the red on 14 April, followed by vice-admiral of the blue on 30 June. He then flew his flag in the 70-gun .

=== Spanish treasure fleet, West Indies, the action of 1702 ===
With the peace becoming increasingly uneasy, the English government became concerned over the possible fate of the Spanish silver fleet, due to arrive in European waters from America. They were worried that the French would intercept the ships and use the treasure for war preparations. Benbow was issued secret instructions to find the fleet, and then &quot;to seize and bring them to England, taking care that no embezzlement be made&quot;. Benbow&#x27;s squadron was detached on 2 September and sailed for the West Indies, arriving on 14 November, and was at the Jamaica Station in mid-December. He remained there for several months, being joined on 8 May 1702 by several vessels under Captain William Whetstone. Whetstone was made Rear-Admiral under Benbow, who had been promoted to Vice-Admiral of the White on 19 January 1702

By now, the War of the Spanish Succession had broken out, and news of its declaration reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would call at the port on his voyage to Cartagena, and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.
By the time that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow&#x27;s force subsequently sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.

The action quickly revealed a breakdown in discipline amongst Benbow&#x27;s captains. He had intended that the 64-gun under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow decided to take the lead himself, and &quot;Breda&quot; pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. &quot;Ruby&quot; was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action at two in the morning on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on &quot;Breda&quot; from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.

Benbow was determined to continue the pursuit, despite his wounds and despite Captain Kirkby&#x27;s arrival on board, attempting to persuade Benbow to abandon the pursuit. Benbow summoned a council of war, and the other captains agreed, signing a paper drafted by Kirkby which declared that they believed &quot;that after six days of battle the squadron lacked enough men to continue and that there was little chance of a decisive action, since the men were exhausted, there was a general lack of ammunition, the ships&#x27; rigging and masts were badly damaged, and the winds were generally variable and undependable.&quot; They recommended breaking off the action and following the French to see if the situation improved. Benbow had &quot;seen the cowardly behaviour of some of them before, [and] had reason to believe that they either had a design against him or to be traitors to their country if an opportunity happened that the French could have destroyed the Admiral&quot;. He, therefore, ordered the squadron to return to Jamaica. On their arrival, he ordered the captains to be imprisoned, awaiting a trial by court-martial.

Benbow received a letter from du Casse after the engagement:
Sir,&lt;br&gt;
I had little hopes on Monday last but to have supped in your cabin: but it pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up, for by God they deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
Yours,&lt;br&gt;
Du Casse.
=== Trial of the captains ===
Acting Rear-Admiral Whetstone returned to Port Royal, having spent 62 days cruising off Hispaniola, and preparations were made for the trial. Before it could begin, Captain Thomas Hudson died, who had commanded . The remaining captains appeared at the court-martial which convened on &quot;Breda&quot;, held between 19 and 23 October. Due to his injuries, Benbow passed to Whetstone the role of presiding over the court, but he was present at the trial. The court found Captain Kirkby of and Cooper Wade of guilty of breach of orders, neglect of duty, and the &quot;ill signed paper and consultation ... which obliged the Admiral ... to give over the chase and fight&quot;, and condemned them to be shot.

John Constable of was found guilty of breach of orders and drunkenness and was cashiered. Samuel Vincent of &quot;Falmouth&quot; and Christopher Fogg of &quot;Breda&quot; were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains&#x27; resolution, but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely, and their sentences were remitted by the Lord High Admiral. The sentences were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings. After her consideration in January 1703, she allowed the sentences to proceed and Constable, Kirkby, and Wade were returned to England as prisoners. Constable was imprisoned until 1704, when the Queen pardoned him. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton. Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702. Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action.

== Death and burial ==
Benbow died at Port Royal, Kingston, Jamaica on 4 November 1702. Whetstone reported that the cause of death was &quot;the wound of his leg which he received in battle with Monsieur Du Casse, it never being set to perfection, which malady being aggravated by the discontent of his mind, threw him into a sort of melancholy which ended his life as before.&quot; He was buried on 16 November in the chancel of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Kingston. A marble slab was later laid over the grave, emblazoned with a coat of arms and inscribed:

Here lyeth the Body of John Benbow, Esq., Admiral of the White, a true pattern of English Courage, who lost his life in Defence of his Queene &amp; Country, November the 4th, 1702, In the 52nd year of his age, by a wound in his Legg. Received in an Engagement with Monsr. Du Casse; being Much Lamented.

Secretary of State Lord Nottingham wrote to Benbow in January 1703, before news of his death had reached London, to inform him that the queen was &quot;extremely well pleased with your conduct and much offended with the baseness of those officers who deserted and betrayed you.&quot; Meanwhile, the cabinet was preparing to promote him to vice-admiral of the white and to dispatch him to transport troops to Newfoundland.

==Personal life and legacy==
Benbow married a woman named Martha (died 1722) after his return to England in 1681. The couple had at least seven children, including daughter Martha and sons Richard and John. Another son Solomon was baptised in 1686 but died in infancy. There are also records of two more sons named Richard who were born in Kent, and another daughter named Katherine. Son John went on to serve in the Royal Navy. The family lived in the parish of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. In 1709, Katherine married Paul Calton of Milton, Berkshire, where Benbow is said to have stayed in the 1690s.
According to Parish Records William Benbow son of Admiral John Benbow was buried at St Nicholas Parish Church, Deptford, Kent (now SE London) on 7 April 1729. One of the admiral&#x27;s granddaughters married the Rev. John Simpson, who commissioned the current Stoke Hall, Derbyshire, following his acquisition of the estate upon their marriage.

===Benbow and Peter the Great===
Benbow signed a three-year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696, a house belonging to diarist John Evelyn. Six months later, Evelyn wrote to a friend complaining, &quot;I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing everyday much of my former labours and expenses there impairing for want of a more polite tenant.&quot; In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, in order to be able to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with &quot;much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed&quot;. Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it &quot;entirely ruined&quot;. Benbow lost &quot;twenty fine paintings&quot; and &quot;several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea&quot; from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.

===&quot;Brave Benbow&quot;===
Benbow&#x27;s fame led to his name entering popular culture. A monument by sculptor John Evan Thomas was erected in 1843 by public subscription in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury commemorating Benbow as &quot;a skillful and daring seaman whose heroic exploits long rendered him the boast of the British Navy and still point him out as the Nelson of his times.&quot; A 74-gun ship of the line and two battleships were named .
There are a number of real life &quot;Admiral Benbow&quot; public houses around the world, and other institutions that have borne his name. Whether they are named as a result of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s use of &quot;The Admiral Benbow Inn&quot; in his novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or if they&#x27;re named for the Admiral himself, it is impossible to say. It is alleged that Stevenson named the Hawkins&#x27; Inn after the arrest of several members of the &quot;Benbow Brandy Men&quot; smuggling gang that frequented the Benbow pub in Penzance shortly before he visited in August 1877.

===&quot;Admiral John Benbow&quot; (song)===
The incident of August 1702 also took hold on the popular imagination, and was celebrated in an alehouse song, listed as number 227 in the Roud Folk Song Index:

&lt;poem&gt;
Come all you seamen bold
and draw near, and draw near,
Come all you seamen bold and draw near.
It&#x27;s of an Admiral&#x27;s fame,
O brave Benbow was his name,
How he fought all on the main,
you shall hear, you shall hear.

Brave Benbow he set sail
For to fight, for to fight
Brave Benbow he set sail for to fight.
Brave Benbow he set sail
with a fine and pleasant gale
But his captains they turn&#x27;d tail
in a fright, in a fright.

Says Kirby unto Wade:
We will run, we will run
Says Kirby unto Wade, we will run.
For I value no disgrace,
nor the losing of my place,
But the enemy I won&#x27;t face,
nor his guns, nor his guns.

The Ruby and Benbow
fought the French, fought the French
The Ruby and Benbow fought the French.
They fought them up and down,
till the blood came trickling down,
Till the blood came trickling down
where they lay, where they lay.

Brave Benbow lost his legs
by chain shot, by chain shot
Brave Benbow lost his legs by chain shot.
Brave Benbow lost his legs,
And all on his stumps he begs,
Fight on my English lads,
&#x27;Tis our lot, &#x27;tis our lot.

The surgeon dress&#x27;d his wounds,
Cries Benbow, cries Benbow
The surgeon dress&#x27;d his wounds, cries Benbow.
Let a cradle now in haste,
on the quarterdeck be placed
That the enemy I may face
&#x27;Til I die, &#x27;Til I die.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Its musical theme forms one of the three arrangements on which English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams based his &quot;Sea Songs&quot;, originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of his &quot;English Folk Song Suite&quot;, and subsequently re-arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer.

The song was collected in the oral tradition from traditional singers in England in the twentieth century. A recording of Sam Bennett of Ilmington, Warwickshire made by James Madison Carpenter in the 1930s can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library Website. The Copper Family also have a traditional version of the song which was passed down through several generations and is available online.

Another song has survived from the period with different air and rhythm but also known as &quot;Admiral Benbow&quot;, and it is often sung by folksingers. It begins &quot;We sailed from Virginia and thence to Fayal&quot;.

<text>Naḥal Sorek (; ), also Soreq, is one of the largest, most important drainage basins in the Judean Hills. It is mentioned in the Book of Judges 16:4 of the Bible as the border between the ancient Philistines and the Tribe of Dan of the ancient Israelites. It is known in Arabic as Wadi es-Sarār, sometimes spelled Surar, and by various names along different segments, such as Wadi Qalunya near Motza, Wadi al-Tahuna, and Nahr Rubin further downstream.

==Etymology==
Folk etymology mentioned in the Midrash (&quot;Numbers Rabbah&quot; 9) states that the &quot;sorek&quot; is a &quot;fruitless tree&quot; (the word means &quot;empty&quot; in Hebrew), implying a moral lesson and metaphor suggesting that Samson&#x27;s involvement in his affair with Delilah was eventually &quot;fruitless&quot;. 

Etymology suggests that &quot;sorek&quot; means &quot;special vine&quot; and refers to the grapes and wines grown in the area.

==In the Bible==
Nahal Sorek was the place where Delilah lived, and Samson came to meet her for the first time. It was also the place she enticed him to tell her the secret of his strength, and where he was eventually captured by the Philistines:
==Land property along the river==
In 1921, lands that bounded Nahal Sorek () which passed to the south of Artuf were designated as &quot;Mara land,&quot; meaning, pasture land reserved primarily for the use of the adjoining villages.

==Road and railway==

In the 19th century, Nahal Sorek served as an important connection between the two major cities in the area, Jaffa and Jerusalem. Because railways at the time were reliant on water sources, several surveyors who planned the first railway in the Middle East, the Jaffa–Jerusalem line, decided to use Nahal Sorek as the main route for the line. The line was inaugurated in 1892, following Nahal Sorek until its junction with the Valley of Rephaim, after which it follows the Valley of Rephaim into Jerusalem. While the Tel Aviv-to-Jerusalem high-speed railway line is designed to avoid the Nahal Sorek route and shorten the line, the older railway along Nahal Sorek has been refurbished and remains in use. It connects the country&#x27;s two largest cities and its main international airport, running in a westerly-easterly direction between Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport, Lod, Ramla, Beit Shemesh and Jerusalem. However, today the rail line mainly serves as a scenic route used by tourists. Several small water reservoirs exist along its route, notably near Tal Shahar and Yesodot. Waterfalls are located on several of its tributaries, including Ayanot Dekalim in Beit Shemesh, Ein Sifla on Nahal HaMe&#x27;ara, and others.

==Nature Reserve==
The Nahal Sorek Nature Reserve, first declared in 1965, and since expanded, spans over 11000 dunams, from the Avshalom Cave Nature Reserve near Beit Shemesh, to moshav Nes Harim.

==Desalination plants==
Near the mouth of the Sorek River are two large seawater desalination plants, Palmachim and Sorek, the latter being, when used at full capacity, the largest of its kind in the world (as of 2013).

<doc id="596580" wikidata="Q1017331" url="?curid=596580" title="Westport, County Mayo">
<text>Westport (, historically anglicised as &quot;Cahernamart&quot;) is a town in County Mayo in Ireland. It is at the south-east corner of Clew Bay, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean on the west coast of Ireland. Westport is a tourist destination and scores highly for quality of life. It won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition three times in 2001, 2006 and 2008. In 2012 it won the Best Place to Live in Ireland competition run by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

Westport is designated as a heritage town, and is one of only a few planned towns in Ireland. The town centre was laid-out in the Georgian architectural style, and incorporates the Carrow Beg river into the design composition. This provides for tree lined promenades (known as The Mall) and several stone bridges.

The pilgrimage mountain of Croagh Patrick, known locally as &quot;the Reek&quot;, lies some 10 km west of the town near the villages of Murrisk and Lecanvey. The mountain forms the backdrop to the town.

==History==
===Name===
Westport originates and gets its name in the Irish language from a 16th-century castle - Cathair na Mart (meaning &quot;the stone fort of the beeves&quot;- and surrounding settlement, belonging to the powerful local seafaring Ó Máille clan, who controlled the Clew Bay area, then known as Umaill.

===Development===
The original village of Cathair na Mart existed somewhere around what is now the front (east) lawn of Westport House. It had a high street, alleys down to the river and a population of around 700. A small port also existed at the mouth of the Carrowbeg river. Roads lead from the village to the west (West Road), the south (Sandy Hill Road) and the east (Old Paddock Road). The intention of John Browne, later the First Earl of Altamont to move the existing Cahernamart settlement to facilitate the landscaping of parklands around Westport House was outlined to Richard Pococke when he visited Browne in 1752.

The first clear evidence for the development of the new town is in an advertisement in &quot;Faulkner&#x27;s Dublin Journal&quot; on 17 March 1767, stating &#x27;a New Town is immediately to be built near the old town of Westport...according to Plans and Elevations already prepared&#x27;. The focal point was to be a &#x27;large and elegant market house&#x27; situated in an octagonal market area enclosed by 12 &#x27;large well-finished slated Houses. There were to be &#x27;three avenues for streets of thirty slated Houses&#x27; and &#x27;several very large streets for great numbers of thatched Houses and cabbins, to be built separately&#x27; at a cost of 20-40 guineas each. Workmen were to contact Peter Brown-Kelly, son of the Earl or the architect William Leeson
Westport is designated as a heritage town and is unusual in Ireland in that it is one of only a few planned towns in the country. Unfortunately, the original plans for the town are not available.

Its layout follows the medieval principles of urban design introduced by the Normans in the 13th century. A particular feature is the incorporation of the river into the composition, contained for two blocks by low stone walls producing, on each side of the river, tree-lined promenades (The Mall) with several stone bridges over the river Carrow Beg. The Malls were built by the First Marquess of Sligo after 1800. William Bald&#x27;s map of Mayo which Was surveyed between 1809 and 1817, as well as Henry Browne&#x27;s map from the same period, shows that the basic framework of Westport&#x27;s streets including the Malls was present.

In 1778 Peter Browne, 2nd Earl of Altamont engaged James Wyatt (1746-1813) to redesign parts of Westport House, including its dining room. This led to a lasting belief that the well-known Wyatt designed the town, but work was already well advanced on the town when he started work. If he did have any design input into the town project it could only have been to later stages such as the Malls. Westport House was originally built by Richard Cassels (also known as Richard Castle), the German architect, in the 1730s, near the site of the original Ó Máille Castle.
===Revolutionary period===
After the Easter Rising, in Westport over 30 Irish Volunteers and Sinn Fein supporters were arrested by the RIC under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 on the orders of Resident magistrate John Charles Milling and the local District Inspector, Shore.
Those arrested included Joe Ring, Tom Derrig and PJ Doris, editor of the Mayo News. They were sent to Frongoch internment camp in Wales. Joe Ring and others were released at Christmas 1916.
On 29 March 1919, Milling, resident magistrate to County Mayo since 1915, was killed by the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) at his home on Newport Road, Westport.

During the Irish War of Independence, on 26 March 1921, following the killing of a constable by the IRA four days earlier, the Westport RIC left their barracks to punish the town and area. Homes and businesses of IRA families were targeted. The home and business of Charles Hughes, chairman of the Urban District Council, was destroyed. Similarly destroyed was the pub and shop of Thaddeus Walsh, chairman of the Rural District Council. Other houses in the town and houses in Carrowkennedy, Drummindoo and Carrowbawn were destroyed or burned. The IRA were not deterred by the destruction.

A company of the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary were based in Westport from June 1921.

Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Royal Irish Constabulary pulled out of their barracks for the last time on Monday 12 February 1922 and formally handed over the next day.

===Civil War===
Early in the Civil War Mayo including Westport was controlled by the Anti-Treaty side. On the evening of 1 April 1922 Joe Ring was arrested in Westport by the IRA and held in Castlebar jail on charges of recruiting for the new National Army. He went on hunger strike and he was released on 13 April and received a hero&#x27;s welcome in Westport.

A cross-channel ferry, the SS Minerva, was kitted out as a troop carrier by the National Army and left North Wall Dublin on 22 July, sailing around Ireland and arriving in Clew Bay on 24 July 1922. Col. Comdt. Christopher (‘Kit’) O’Malley from the Dublin Guard was in command and accompanied by Brigadier-General Joe Ring. It carried 400 troops and a Rolls-Royce 1920-pattern armoured car, nicknamed the Big Fella, with a Vickers machine gun and an 18-pounder artillery as well as 600 rifles and 150 bicycles. It anchored off Inishlyre. General Ring led a successful landing by sea. First the Coastguard station at Rosmoney was captured by 40 National Army troops, freeing 90 pro-treaty prisoners who were held there. Ring then landed his men and armoured car at Westport Quay. The Republicans, who had not at all expected their arrival, set fire to the barracks and withdrew from the town. The pro-treaty forces were stationed at Westport Town Hall. The troops billeted at there shot off the head of the Clendenning statue.

===Modern period===
Since the late 20th century, Westport has expanded with several new housing estates. Some of these include Springfield, the Carrowbeg Estate, Horkans Hill, Cedar Park, Fairways, Knockranny Village and Sharkey Hill.

===Westport House===
The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick, and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was Grace O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter. The house then did not have a lake or a dam, and the tide rose and fell against the walls.Peter Browne, 2nd Earl of Altamont acquired slave plantations in Jamaica by marriage. His grandson Howe Peter Browne (2nd Marquess of Sligo) was the Governor of Jamaica when the slaves were freed.

Designed by the architects Richard Cassels, Thomas Ivory and James Wyatt in the 18th century, Westport House is situated in a parkland setting with a lake, terraces, gardens and views overlooking Clew Bay, the Atlantic Ocean, Achill, Clare Island and Ireland&#x27;s Holy Mountain, Croagh Patrick.

In January 2017, it was announced that a local family had purchased the house and grounds.

==Economy==
AbbVie a global biopharmaceutical company employs 1,400 people in Westport. AbbVie acquired Allergan in 2020. The global clothing manufacturing company and family business Portwest is based in Westport and was founded there in 1904.

==Demographics==

Between the censuses of 2011 and 2016, the town showed a limited growth from 5,543 to 6,198 inhabitants.

==Culture==

People from Westport town are traditionally known as &quot;Coveys&quot;. Some decades ago the Covey dialect still existed and was unintelligible to outsiders. For example, the Covey word for a woman was a &quot;doner&quot;.

Matt Molloy of the Chieftains has a pub and music venue on Bridge Street.

Another entertainment venue is the Westport Town Hall Theatre on the Octagon. This was established in the early 1900s, and renovated and refurbished in 2015. The theatre hosts events, artists and musicians, local theatre groups and children&#x27;s puppet shows.

The Custom House Studios and Gallery is the centre of the local arts scene.

==Media==
===Newspaper===
Westport has a regional newspaper based in the town, &quot;The Mayo News&quot;, founded in 1892 by William and Patrick Dorris. Other newspapers available are the &quot;Mayo Advertiser&quot;, &quot;Western People&quot; and the &quot;Connaught Telegraph&quot;.

===Radio===
Local radio is delivered by Westport Radio 98.2 FM.

==Tourism==

Westport is County Mayo&#x27;s premier tourist destination, visited by holidaymakers from all over the world and Ireland.

In 1842, the English novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray, visited Westport and wrote of the town:

&quot;The most beautiful view I ever saw in the world. It forms an event in one&#x27;s life to have seen that place so beautiful that is it, and so unlike other beauties that I know of. Were such beauties lying on English shores it would be a world&#x27;s wonder perhaps, if it were on the Mediterranean or Baltic, English travellers would flock to it by hundreds, why not come and see it in Ireland!&quot;

Visitors visit Westport for the scenery, the pubs and restaurants in the town, blue flag beaches, and Croagh Patrick. Its proximity to Connemara, Achill, Clew Bay and Croagh Patrick, and its hotels and guest houses, make it a base for holidaymakers to tour the region.

Westport House and its Pirate Adventure Park attracts families. Westport has an 18-hole golf course and nearby a 9-hole course.

In January 2008, Westport became Google Earth&#x27;s first fully 3D town.

===Festivals and events ===
Several festivals and events are held in and around Westport each year. These include the Westport Music and Arts Festival (which was rebranded as &quot;Westival&quot; in 2018 and moved from September to October), a Croagh Patrick walking festival in March, a sea angling festival in June, and The Saltwater Festival (of &quot;Music, Food, Art &amp; Culture&quot;) in May.

==Religion==
There are four churches in the town: The Elim Pentecostal church; Amazing Grace Fellowship, the Catholic Church, St Mary&#x27;s; the Anglican church, Holy Trinity; the Evangelical church, Calvary Church Westport;

In 1787 Lord Altamont gave the Catholic Parish Priest Dr Charles Lynagh a lease for a Catholic chapel and parochial house at Riverside. A temporary structure may have been erected as the chapel was not commenced for a quarter century later. The foundation stone was laid in 1813. Dr Oliver Kelly received support in this from Catholics and Protestants alike. The building was of cut stone in the Gothic revival style, and fronted onto the Malls which were under construction. The cost of the church was about £6000. By the 1920s the original gothic building was too small and the administrator Father Patterson raised funds for a new church. This cost £30000 and incorporated the old gothic facade in the Mall. The dedication occurred in 1932. Work began to build the present St Mary&#x27;s church in 1957 with the demolition of the old church and completed by 1961.

The old parish church of the Church of Ireland was built in 1797 beside the Carrowbeg River in the demesne of Westport House. That first church cost £617. 10s. 9d which was a gift from the Board of First Fruits, a body established to fund the building and repair of church buildings in the Church of Ireland in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. William Thackeray described a &#x27;pretty little church&#x27; on the &#x27;pleasure grounds surrounding Westport House. The ruins of the church are still visible today.

By 1855 the Church of Ireland Community was too large for the existing church due to the expansion of the town and the growth of tourism. Not everyone could be accommodated at services and the building was in serious disrepair. The local Select Vestry promised a local contribution of £1200 on condition that the church would be rebuilt in its existing site. In 1868 an appeal was launched which announced that the Marquess of Sligo had donated by the Marquess of Sligo (the present location on Newport Road. The first plans were approved by Joseph Welland in 1869, these were not used apart from the distinctive pencil spire. Thomas Newenham Deane designed the second church. Holy Trinity church displays many features of the neo-Gothic style favoured by John Ruskin. The new Church was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of Tuam in 1872. The three main doors are made of iron wrought to create floral forms. The vestry door is on the East Side and is made of wood. The interior of the church is highly decorated. The upper walls of the nave are decorated with murals depicting scenes from the Gospels, erected around 1878. Canon James Owen Hannay whose pen name was George A. Birmingham served as rector from 1892 to 1913. By 1984 the restoration of the church became necessary and as there were only 40 parishioners remaining a Restoration Committee was formed with six Holy Trinity parishioners and six from St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church. A total of £50,000 was raised by 1986 and the work completed.

In 2004 during the structural repairs of St. Mary&#x27;s church the Select Vestry in Holy Trinity were able to offer St Mary&#x27;s parishioners hospitality. Weekday and some weekend Masses were celebrated in Holy Trinity.

Historically, a Methodist church existed on the Mall and a Presbyterian church on Distillery Road.

Church records for the 19th century (Church of Ireland, Methodist, Roman Catholic, civil, gravestone inscriptions, etc.) and other historical records for the Westport area are held at the South Mayo Family Research Centre in Ballinrobe and the Clew Bay Heritage Centre at Westport Quay.

===Religious Orders===
The two main religious orders historically associated with Westport are the Congregation of Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy. Dean Bernard Burke wrote to the founder of the Sisters of Mercy Catherine McAuley in 1841 asking for sisters for Westport. None were immediately available but following a renewed request six months after the death of the foundress, the first three sisters arrived in Westport on 9 September 1842. The Dean gave them his own house, Carrowbeg House as a temporary residence, while he went into lodgings for two years. On 24 December 1842 Lord Altamont agreed to Dean Burke&#x27;s request for a site for a Convent for the Sisters. Dean Burke travelled all over Ireland and raised £3000 for the project. In the spring of 1843, the foundation stone of the new Convent was laid and the Convent built by John Gibbons to the same plan as the Convent in Carlow. Sister Paul Cullen was appointed by Archbishop McHale as the first Reverend Mother of the new convent. She was a sister of Cardinal Paul Cullen.

The Congregation of Christian Brothers arrived in Westport in 1865. They took over the Castlebar Street School for Primary and Secondary students. Initially, they were accommodated in Carrowbeg House. In 1922 they acquired Grove House on Mill Street from the Sisters of Mercy. Then they moved to their new residence on Newport Road where they lived until they left Westport in 2002

==Education==
Westport has two secondary schools, five primary schools and Westport College of Further Education, which opened in 2009.

The secondary schools are Rice College (528 pupils, all-boys) and Sacred Heart School (over 500 pupils, all-girls).

In 2006, Scoil Phadraig na mBráithre (tr. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Christian Brothers&#x27; School) and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Mercy National School amalgamated to form Scoil Phádraig (tr. St Patrick&#x27;s School), a Catholic primary school under the patronage of the Archbishop of Tuam. It is the largest primary school in Westport with 300+ pupils and is located on Newport Road on the site of the old Christian Brothers School.

An all-Irish Catholic Primary School, Gaelscoil na Cruaiche was founded in 1995. It received official recognition in 2000 and moved into a permanent school building in June 2011. There are currently 207 pupils attending the school with eleven teachers.

Holy Trinity National School is a Co-educational National School on Newport Road under the patronage of the Church of Ireland.
The Newport Road School was a Church of Ireland school for boys and girls set up under the Kildare Street and Tuam Diocesan Societies and lodged in a new building (later called the lecture hall). The building was declared unfit following an inspection in 2010. The school is currently full with 62 pupils.

In February 2022 it was announced that the new school will be located on the grounds of the former Scoil Padraig on Altamont Street and not co-located with Educate together as previously stated. In 2020 staff and pupils had objected to the school being Co-located with Westport Educate Together

The Quay School, also known as Saint Columbkille&#x27;s Primary School is located at the Quay, Westport.

A new primary school, Westport Educate Together opened in 2019. At first located at Sharkey Hill Community Centre, it is moving to new temporary premises at Westport Woods Hotel for the 2022–23 school year.

===History===
The educational facilities for boys in Westport were for many years associated with the Congregation of Christian Brothers. The first of these facilities was established in Castlebar Street in 1865 before transferring to the Newport road in 1962 where the former national school can still be seen today.

In 1987 the secondary school Rice College was built on Castlebar Road in order to cater for the increased educational requirements.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The town is the terminus of a 250 km Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line from Dublin Heuston in Dublin. This railway connects the town to Castlebar. Westport railway station opened on 28 January 1866. The line originally ran through to Westport Quay station (opened on 1 January 1875 and closed in April 1977). This line was lifted overnight in 1977 by Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ). In order to pacify local concern, the bulk of the trackbed of this extension was converted to a public walkway, still open today. There was also a branch to Achill Island branching off after the station, but this closed in 1937.

===Port (Westport Quay)===

Westport has a small adjoining port, the quay, once busy but no longer used for commercial shipping. In 1894, the harbour was the scene of the Clew Bay Drowning. 

The quay is situated some distance from the deep waters of Clew Bay, a defensive advantage in the towns development which was noted in an &quot;Irish Times&quot; article of 1884: 
:&quot; &quot;The port of Westport somewhat resembles Sligo and Ballina in regard to its inaccessibility from the sea. The ancient West Coast population were not anxious to be within easy reach of the pirates and freebooters, who dwelt in the islands or on remote promontories, and accordingly the wealthier inhabitants built their towns where opportunities existed for ensuring a de-fence against a sudden landing. The channel leading from Westport quay is nearly six miles long before it reaches the roadstead of Innislyre, in which ships of burden can anchor or make an immediate run out to sea.&quot;&quot;

The quay area is now home to a number of warehouse conversions, and has several restaurants and pubs. The Clew Bay Heritage Centre, a small museum celebrating the history of Westport and the maritime history of Clew Bay, is open to the public here.

<text>Christian Pollas (b. 1947) is a French astronomer, known for the discovery and observation of minor planets and supernovae.

Pollas is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 26 asteroids, some co-discovered with Eric W. Elst, including the near-Earth asteroids: (belonging to the Aten group of asteroids), 4179 Toutatis (belonging to the Apollo group of asteroids) and 9950 ESA (belonging to the Amor group of asteroids).

The main-belt asteroid 4892 Chrispollas is named in his honor.

<text>Rubber band ligation (RBL) is an outpatient treatment procedure for internal hemorrhoids of any grade. There are several different devices a physician may use to perform the procedure, including the traditional metal devices, endoscopic banding, and the CRH O&#x27;Regan System.

With rubber band ligation, a small band is applied to the base of the hemorrhoid, stopping the blood supply to the hemorrhoidal mass. The hemorrhoid will shrink and fibrose within a few days with shriveled hemorrhoidal tissue and band falling off during normal bowel movements - likely without the patient noticing.

Rubber band ligation is a popular procedure for the treatment of hemorrhoids, as it involves a much lower risk of pain than surgical treatments of hemorrhoids, as well as a shorter recovery period (if any at all). It is a very effective procedure and there are multiple methods available. When done with the CRH O’Regan System, it is also associated with a recurrence rate of 5% at 2 years. The procedure is typically performed by gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and general surgeons.

==History==
Ligation of hemorrhoids was first recorded by Hippocrates in 460 BC, who wrote about using thread to tie off hemorrhoids.

In modern history, ligation using rubber band was introduced in 1958 by Blaisdell and refined in 1963 by Barron, who introduced a mechanical, metal device called the Barron ligator (similar to the McGivney).

Dr. Patrick J. O’Regan, a laparoscopic surgeon, invented the disposable CRH O’Regan System. In 1997, the ligator was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemorrhoids.

==Procedure==
Rubber band ligation procedure is as follows:

# Pre-treatment diagnosis and prescribed medications
#* A physician diagnoses the condition of hemorrhoids during a colonoscopy, or an anoscopy/proctoscopy
# Preparation
#* RBL does not require any patient preparation
# Positioning
#* The patient is generally placed on a proctology table in the kneeling position or, less commonly, on the left side on an exam table, with knees drawn up (fetal position)
# Application of the band
#* With traditional RBL, a proctoscope is inserted into the anal opening. The hemorrhoid is grasped by forceps and maneuvered into the cylindrical opening of the ligator. The ligator is then pushed up against the base of the hemorrhoid, and the rubber band is applied. Reusable instruments have also been available for many decades to use suction rather than forceps to draw tissue into the instrument so the rubber band can be deployed.
#* The CRH O&#x27;Regan ligation system also eliminates the use of forceps. It is much more expensive on a per-case basis than the reusable suction ligator. It is rarely used by full-time colon and rectal surgeons (Proctologists), but recently has been adopted by many Gastroenterologists to increase the revenue to their practice. The device applies gentle suction which allows the doctor to place a small rubber-band around the base of the hemorrhoid. Three banding sessions are typically required at 2 week intervals for a complete treatment. More bands can be applied if the patient is under general anesthetic, although the recovery time may be prolonged and more painful.

==Complications==
Possible complications from rubber band ligation include:
* Pain
* Bleeding
* Infection and pelvic sepsis
* Thrombosed hemorrhoids
* Non-healing ulcer

==Post-procedure instructions for patients==
* In some cases, patients may experience some bleeding, especially after bowel movements, up to 2 weeks after the banding (though this may be from the untreated hemorrhoids as well). This may last for several days or more. If the patient thinks it is severe or persistent (more than one tablespoon of blood), the patient should contact their doctor immediately.
* A warm bath for about 10 minutes, 2-3 times a day, may help.
* No heavy lifting or strenuous activities the day of the procedure (and up to 4 days in some cases).
* A stool softener such as Surfak is recommended once a day for about 3 days. Stool softeners are available over the counter at any drug store.
* Patient should avoid straining to have a bowel movement. If patient does not succeed at first, he/she should try getting in a warm bath for about 10 minutes.
* In order to avoid constipation, a fiber supplement should be taken daily while increasing water intake to 8 glasses daily (circa 2 liter/ 4 pints).

<doc id="596593" wikidata="Q665" url="?curid=596593" title="Lugdunum">
<text>Lugdunum (also spelled Lugudunum, ; modern Lyon, France) was an important Roman city in Gaul, established on the current site of Lyon. 

The Roman city was founded in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, but continued an existing Gallic settlement with a likely population of several thousands. It served as the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and was an important city in the western half of the Roman Empire for centuries. Two emperors, Claudius and Caracalla, were born in Lugdunum. In the period 69–192 AD, the city&#x27;s population may have numbered 50,000 to 100,000, and possibly up to 200,000 inhabitants.

The original Roman city was situated west of the confluence of the Rhône and Saône, on the Fourvière heights. By the late centuries of the empire much of the population was located in the Saône River valley at the foot of Fourvière.

==Name==
The Roman city was founded as &quot;Colonia Copia Felix Munatia&quot;, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as &quot;Lugdunum&quot; (and occasionally &quot;Lugudunum&quot;) by the end of the 1st century AD. During the Middle Ages, &quot;Lugdunum&quot; was transformed to &quot;Lyon&quot; by natural sound change.

&quot;Lugdunum&quot; is a Latinization of the Gaulish &quot;*Lugudunon&quot;, meaning &quot;Fortress (or hill) of (the god) &quot;Lugus&quot;&quot; or, alternately, &quot;Fortress of the champion&quot; (if &quot;*lugus&quot; is a common noun cognate with Old Irish &quot;warrior, hero, fighter&quot;).

The Celtic god Lugus was apparently popular in Ireland and Britain as is found in medieval Irish literature as &quot;Lug(h)&quot; and in medieval Welsh literature as Lleu (also spelled Llew).

According to Pseudo-Plutarch, Lugdunum takes its name from an otherwise unattested Gaulish word &quot;lugos&quot;, that he says means &quot;raven&quot; (κόρακα), and the Gaulish word for an eminence or high ground (τόπον ἐξέχοντα), &quot;dunon&quot;.

An early interpretation of Gaulish &quot;Lugduno&quot; as meaning &quot;Desired Mountain&quot; is recorded in a gloss in the 9th-century Endlicher&#x27;s Glossary, but this may in fact reflect a native Frankish speaker&#x27;s folk-etymological attempt at linking the first element of the name, &quot;Lugu-&quot; (which, by the time this gloss was composed, would have been pronounced &quot;lu&#x27;u&quot;, the -g- having become silent) with the similar-sounding Germanic word for &quot;love&quot;, &quot;*luβ&quot;.

Another early medieval folk-etymology of the name, found in gloss on the Latin poet Juvenal, connects the element Lugu- to the Latin word for &quot;light&quot;, (&quot;luci&quot;- in compounds) and translates the name as &quot;Shining Hill&quot; (&quot;lucidus mons&quot;).

==Pre-Roman settlements and the area before the founding of the city==
 
Archeological evidence shows Lugdunum was a pre-Gallic settlement as far back as the neolithic era, and a Gallic settlement with continuous occupation from the 4th century BC, during the La Tène period. It was situated on the Fourvière heights above the Saône river. There was trade with Campania for ceramics and wine, and use of some Italic-style home furnishings before the Roman conquest.

The Romans controlled the southern portion of Gaul by the 2nd century BC, founding the province of Gallia Transalpina in 121 BC. Gaul was conquered for the Romans by Julius Caesar between 58 and 53 BC. His description of the country in his &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; is our principal written source of knowledge for pre-Roman Gaul, but there is no specific mention of the area in or around Lugdunum.

==Founding of the Roman city==
Roman colonization of Lugdunum began during the War of Mutina, one of the conflicts that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. According to the historian Cassius Dio, in 43 BC the Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus and Lepidus, governors of central and Transalpine Gaul respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (a town about to the south) by the Allobroges and were encamped at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers. Dio Cassius says this was to keep them from joining Mark Antony and bringing their armies into the developing conflict. Epigraphic evidence suggests Munatius Plancus was the principal founder of Lugdunum.

Lugdunum seems to have had a population of several thousand at the time of the Roman foundation. The citizens were administratively assigned to the Galerian tribe. The aqueduct of the Monts d&#x27;Or, completed around 20 BC, was the first of at least four aqueducts supplying water to the city.

Within 50 years Lugdunum increased greatly in size and importance, becoming the administrative centre of Roman Gaul and Germany. By the end of the reign of Augustus, Strabo described Lugdunum as the junction of four major roads (the &quot;Via Agrippa&quot;): south to Narbonensis, Massilia and Italy, north to the Rhine river and Germany, northwest to the sea (the English Channel), and west to Aquitania.

The proximity to the frontier with Germany made Lugdunum strategically important for the next four centuries, as a staging ground for further Roman expansion into Germany, as well as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital city and administrative centre of the Gallic provinces. Its large and cosmopolitan population made it the commercial and financial heart of the northwestern provinces as well.

Lugdunum became an imperial mint during the reign of Augustus, in 15 BC, replacing mints in Hispania. It was probably chosen because of its convenient location between sources of silver and gold in Hispania and the legions on the Rhine and Danube. After 12 BC, it was the sole mint producing gold and silver coinage for the whole Roman Empire, a position it retained until Nero moved production back to Rome in 64 AD.

==Attention from the emperors==

In its 1st century, Lugdunum was many times the object of attention or visits by the emperors or the imperial family, with its matrimonial regime of power using killing family members. Agrippa, Drusus, Tiberius, and Germanicus (born himself in Lugdunum) were among the gubernatorial generals who served in Lugdunum. Augustus is thought to have visited at least three times between 16 and 8 BC. Drusus lived in Lugdunum between 13 and 9 BC. In 10 BC his son Claudius (the future emperor) was born there. Tiberius stopped in Lugdunum in 5–4 BC, on his way to the Rhine, and again in 21 AD, campaigning against the Andecavi. Caligula made a longer visit in 39–40, as documented by Suetonius. Claudius and Nero also contributed to the city&#x27;s importance and growth.

In 12 BC, Drusus completed an administrative census of the area and dedicated an altar to his stepfather Augustus at the junction of the two rivers. Perhaps to promote a policy of conciliation and integration, all the notable men of the three parts of Gaul were invited. Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus, a member of the Aedui tribe, was installed as the first priest of the new imperial cult sanctuary, which was subsequently known as the Junction Sanctuary or the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls. The altar, with its distinctive vertical end poles, was engraved with the names of 60 Gallic tribes, and was featured prominently on coins from the Lugdunum mint for many years. The &quot;council of the three Gauls&quot; continued to be held annually for nearly three centuries, even after Gaul was divided into provinces.

Southeastern Gaul became increasingly Romanized. By 19 AD at least one temple, and the first amphitheatre in Gaul (now known as the Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls) had been built down the slopes of the Croix-Rousse hill, next to the Vaise district where Gallic workers worked with precious metals, copper and also glass or pottery on both sides of the Saône lived (the space between Rhone and Saône was a swamp often flooded)

In 48 AD, emperor Claudius asked the Senate to grant the notable men of the three Gauls the right to accede to the Senate.
His request was granted and an engraved bronze plaque of the speech (the &quot;Claudian Tables&quot;) was erected in Lugdunum. 
Today, the pieces of the huge plaque are the pride of the Gallo-Roman Museum in Lyon.

Caligula spent time in Lugdunum in 39–40 AD, at the beginning of his third consulate; the historian Suetonius described the visit as characteristic of this emperor&#x27;s strange and extravagant reign. Spectacles were staged at the amphitheater to honor and entertain Caligula and his guest, Ptolemy, king of Mauretania (whom the emperor later had murdered). A rhetoric contest was held in which the losers were required to expunge their work with their tongues. He auctioned furniture brought from the palace in Rome, assigning prices and purchasers. When Caligula wanted to get rid of Herod Antipas, Jewish tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, he sent him to exile in Lugdunum.
Claudius was born in Lugdunum in 10 BC and lived there for at least two years. As emperor, he returned in 43 AD en route to his conquest of Britain and stopped again after its victorious conclusion in 47. A fountain honoring his victory has been uncovered. He continued to take a supportive interest in the town, making its noblemen eligible to serve in the Roman Senate, as described above.

During Claudius&#x27; reign, the city&#x27;s strategic importance was enhanced by the bridging of the Rhône river. Its depth and swampy valley had been an obstacle to travel and communication to the east. The new route, termed the &quot;compendium&quot;, shortened the route south to
Vienne and made the roads from Lugdunum to Italy and Germany more direct. By the end of his reign, the city&#x27;s official name had become Colonia Copia Claudia Augusta Lugudunenisium, abbreviated &quot;CCC AVG LVG&quot;.

Nero also took an interest in the city. Citizens of Lugdunum contributed four million sesterces to the recovery after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. In the same year, the Lugdunum mint was closed and production shifted to Rome. A few years later, Nero contributed four million sesterces to the rebuilding of Lugdunum after a similarly devastating fire. Although the destructiveness of the fire is described in a letter from Seneca to Lucilius, archeologists have not been able to uncover a confirmatory layer of ash.

The Lyonnais admiration of Nero was not universally shared; tyranny, extravagance, and negligence fostered resentment, and coups were planned. In March 68 AD, a Romanized Aquitainian named Caius Julius Vindex, who was governor of Gallia Lugdunensis led an uprising intended to replace Nero with Galba, a Roman governor of Spain. The citizens of Vienne, however, responded more enthusiastically than the Lyonnais, most of whom remained loyal to Nero. A small force from Vienne briefly besieged Lugdunum, but withdrew when Vindex was defeated by the Rhine legions a few weeks later at Vesontio. Despite the defeat of Vindex, rebellion grew. Nero committed suicide in June and Galba was proclaimed emperor. The loyalty of Lugdunum to Nero was not appreciated by his successor, Galba, who punished some of Nero&#x27;s supporters by confiscations of property.

In another turnabout for Lugdunum, Galba&#x27;s policies were immediately unpopular, and in January 69 AD, the Rhine legions quickly threw their support to Vitellius as emperor. They arrived at friendly Lugdunum, where they were persuaded by the Lyonnais to punish nearby Vienne. Vienne quickly laid down weapons and paid a &quot;ransom&quot; to forestall plundering. Meanwhile, Vitellius arrived in Lugdunum, where, according to Tacitus, he formally declared himself Imperator, punished unreliable soldiers, and celebrated with feasts, and with games in the amphitheater. Fortunately for Lugdunum, the would-be emperor and his army hurried into Italy, defeated Otho, and was in turn defeated by Vespasian and the army of the East, bringing the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors to an end. Under Vespasian, the city briefly resumed production of bronze coinage, ending a shortage in the money supply that had developed in the previous years.

Despite a lack of imperial visits for most of the next century, Lugdunum prospered, until Septimius Severus and the Battle of Lugdunum (see below) brought devastation in 197 AD.

==Growth and prosperity in the first centuries of the Empire==

In the 2nd century, Lugdunum prospered and grew to a population of 40,000 to 200,000 persons. Four aqueducts brought water to the city&#x27;s fountains, public baths, and wealthy homes. The aqueducts were well engineered and included several siphons. 
It continued to be a provincial capital with additional government functions and services such as the mint and customs service. Lugdunum had at least two banks and became the principal manufacturing center for pottery, metal working, and weaving in Gaul. Lyonnais terra cotta, pottery and wine were traded throughout Gaul, and many other items were crafted for export.

The city itself was run by a &quot;senate&quot; of decurions (the &quot;ordo decurionum&quot;) and a hierarchy of magistrates: quaestors, aediles, and duumvirs. The social classes of the time consisted of the decurions at the top, who could aspire to Senate status, followed by the knights (equites), and the Augustales, six of whom were in charge of the municipal imperial cult. This latter status was the highest distinction to which a wealthy freedman could aspire. Many of the wealthy merchants and craftsmen were freedmen. Below them were the workmen and slaves.

The Rhône and Saône rivers were navigable, as were most of the rivers of Gaul, and river traffic was heavy. The Lyonnais company of boatmen (&quot;nautae&quot;) was the largest and &quot;most honored&quot; in Gaul. Archeological evidence suggests the right bank of the Saône had the largest concentration of wharves, quays and warehouses. Lyonnais boatmen dominated the wine trade from Narbonensis and Italy, as well as oil from Spain, to the rest of Gaul.

The heavy concentration of trade made Lugdunum one of the most cosmopolitan cities of Gaul, and inscriptions attest to a large foreign-born population, especially Italians, Greeks, and immigrants from the oriental provinces of Asia Minor and Syria-Palestine.

There is evidence of numerous temples and shrines in Lugdunum. Traditional Gallic gods like mallet-bearing Sucellus and the mother goddesses called the Matres (depicted with cornucopiae) continued to be worshiped somewhat syncretistically along with the Roman gods. Additional religious cults came with the oriental immigrants, who brought the eastern mystery religions to the Rhône valley. A major shrine of the Phrygian goddess Cybele was built in nearby Vienne, and she also seems to have found special favor in Lugdunum in the late 1st century and 2nd century.

==Christianity and the first martyrs==

The cosmopolitan hospitality to eastern religions may have allowed the first attested Christian community in Gaul to be established in Lugdunum in the 2nd century, led by a bishop Pothinus—who probably was Greek. In 177 it also became the first in Gaul to suffer persecution and martyrdom.

The event was described in a letter from the Christians in Lugdunum to counterparts in Asia, later retrieved and preserved by Eusebius. There is no record of a cause or a triggering event but mob violence against the Christians in the streets culminated in a public interrogation in the forum by the tribune and town magistrates. The Christians publicly confessed their faith and were imprisoned until the arrival of Legate of Lugdonensis, who gave his authority to the persecution. About 40 of the Christians were savagely martyred—tortured, dying in prison, beheaded, or killed by beasts in the arena as a public spectacle. Among the latter were Bishop Pothinus, Blandina, Doctor Attalus, Ponticus, and the deacon Sanctus of Vienne. Their ashes were thrown into the Rhône.

Nevertheless, the Christian community either survived or was reconstituted, and under Bishop Irenaeus it continued to grow in size and influence.

==Battle of Lugdunum==

The 2nd century ended with another struggle for imperial succession. The emperor Pertinax was murdered in 193, and four generals again &quot;contended for the purple&quot;. Two of the rivals, Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus, initially formed a political alliance. Albinus was a former legate of Britannia and commanded legions in Britain and Gaul. Septimius Severus commanded the Pannonian legions, and led them successfully against Didius Julianus near Rome in 193, and defeated Pescennius Niger in 194. Severus consolidated his power in Rome and broke his alliance with Albinus. The Senate supported Severus and declared Albinus a public enemy.

Clodius Albinus had settled with his army near Lugdunum early in 195. There, he had himself proclaimed Augustus and made plans to counter Severus. Albinus reopened the mint at Lugdunum, for the first time in over a century, issuing coins celebrating his &quot;clemency&quot;, as well as one dedicated to the &quot;Genius of Lugdunum.&quot; He was joined by an army under Lucius Novius Rufus, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis. They successfully attacked the German troops of Virius Lupus but were unable to deter them from supporting Severus.

Severus brought his army from Italy and Germany toward the end of 196. The armies fought an initial, inconclusive engagement at Tinurtium (Tournus), about up the Saône from Lugdunum. Albinus retreated with his forces toward Lugdunum.

On 19 February 197, Severus again attacked Clodius Albinus to the northwest of the city. Albinus&#x27; army was defeated in the bloody and decisive Battle of Lugdunum. Dio Cassius described 300,000 men involved in the battle: although this was one of the largest battles involving Roman armies known, this number is assumed to be an exaggeration. Albinus committed suicide in a house near the Rhône; his head was sent to Rome as a warning to his supporters. His defeated cohorts were dissolved and the victorious legions punished those in Lugdunum who had supported Albinus, by confiscation, banishment, or execution. The city was plundered or at least severely damaged by the battle. Legio I &quot;Minervia&quot; remained camped in Lugdunum from 198 to 211.

==Decline of Lugdunum and the Empire==

Historical and archeological evidence indicates that Lugdunum never fully recovered from the devastation of this battle.

When mints began to be set up outside Rome after 260 AD, there was a Gallic mint which may have been located at Lugdunum, but more likely at Trier, which was definitely the mint of the Gallic Empire. Aurelian transferred minting from Trier to Lugdunum in 274 AD; it was the sole mint for the western empire.

A major reorganization of imperial administration begun at the end of the 3rd century during the reign of Diocletian and completed a few decades later by Constantine further reduced the importance of Lugdunum. This reorganization standardized size and status of provinces, splitting many of the larger. The new provinces were grouped in larger administrative districts. Lugdunum became the capital of a much smaller region containing only two cities besides Lugdunum: Autun and Langres. The new governor bore the title of consularis. The mint was retained at Lugdunum, as was an administrative tax office and a state-run wool clothing factory.

Lugdunum was no longer the chief city and administrative capital of Gaul. Although the city continued, there seems to have been a population shift from the Fourviere heights where the original Roman city was situated to the river valley below. Other evidence suggests other cities surpassed Lugdunum as trading centers.

Though the Western Roman Empire persisted until 476 AD, the border regions extending along the Rhine River in Germany to the Danube River in Dacia became far more important from a military and strategic standpoint. Cities like Augusta Treverorum (Trier) eclipsed Lugdunum in importance. The status of the western provinces declined further when Constantine made Byzantium (later named Constantinople after his death) the capital of the Eastern part of the Empire.

As the Western Empire disintegrated in the 5th century, Lugdunum became the principal city of the Kingdom of the Burgundians in 443 AD. The Lugdunum mint remained in operation under the new rulers.

<text>James Philip Bagian (born February 22, 1952), is an American physician, engineer, and former NASA astronaut of Armenian descent. During his career as an astronaut, he logged 337 hours of space-flight, over two missions, STS-29 (in 1989) and STS-40 (in 1991). After leaving NASA in 1995, Bagian was elected as a member of the Institute of Medicine. He was also elected as member into the National Academy of Engineering in 2000 for the integration of engineering and medical knowledge in applications to aerospace systems, environmental technology, and patient safety. 

Bagian is currently the Director of the Center for Healthcare Engineering and Patient Safety at the University of Michigan.

Bagian is the only person of Armenian descent to have been in space.

== Education ==
Bagian graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1969; received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University in 1973, graduating first in his class, and a Doctor of Medicine degree from Thomas Jefferson University in 1977, where he was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha.

== Experience ==
Bagian worked as a process engineer for the 3M Company in Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1973, and later as a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River, Maryland, from 1976 to 1978, and at the same time, pursued studies for his medical degree. Upon graduating from Thomas Jefferson University in 1977, Bagian completed one year of general surgery residency with the Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania.

He subsequently went to work as a flight surgeon and research medical officer at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1978, while concurrently completing studies at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, where he graduated first in his flight surgeons class. He was completing a residency in anesthesiology at the University of Pennsylvania when notified of his selection by NASA for the astronaut candidate program. Bagian received his Professional Engineers Certification in 1986 and was board-certified in aerospace medicine by the American College of Preventive Medicine in 1987.

Since 1981, Bagian has been active in the mountain rescue community and has served as a member of the Denali Medical Research Project on Denali. He has been a snow-and-ice rescue techniques instructor on Mount Hood during this period. Bagian is a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and is the pararescue flight surgeon for the 939th Air Rescue Wing. He is a USAF-qualified freefall parachutist, holds a private pilot&#x27;s license and has logged over 1,500 hours flying time in propeller and jet aircraft, helicopters, and gliders.

== NASA experience ==
Bagian became a NASA astronaut in July 1980. He took part in both the planning and provision of emergency medical and rescue support for the first six Shuttle flights. He served as the Astronaut Office coordinator for Space Shuttle payload software and crew equipment, as well as supporting the development of a variety of payloads and participating in the verification of Space Shuttle flight software.

In 1986, Bagian served as an investigator for the 51-L accident board. He was responsible for the development program and implementation of the pressure suit used for crew escape and various other crew survival equipment to be used on future Shuttle missions, and is in charge of Shuttle search and rescue planning and implementation for the Astronaut Office. Bagian was a member of the NASA Headquarters Research Animal Holding Facility Review Board.

He has authored numerous scientific papers in the fields of human factors, environmental and aerospace medicine. A veteran of two space flights (STS-29 in 1989 and STS-40 in 1991), Bagian has logged over 337 hours in space. In 2003 Bagian served as the Chief Flight Surgeon and Medical Consultant for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and currently serve as a member of the NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.

== STS-29 ==

Bagian first flew on the crew of STS-29, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;, on March 13, 1989. During this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station &quot;heat pipe&quot; radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. Bagian was the principal investigator and performed Detailed Supplementary Objective 470 which described, by the use of transcranial Doppler, the changes of cerebral blood flow and its relationship to Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS) and Space Motion Sickness (SMS).

Bagian was the first person to treat SMS with the drug Phenergan by intramuscular injection. This represented the first successful treatment regimen for SMS and has now been adopted by NASA as the standard of care for the control of SMS in Shuttle crews and is routinely used. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 80 orbits and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 18, 1989. With the completion of this mission, he logged over 119 hours in space.

== STS-40 ==
Bagian served as the Lead Mission Specialist on the crew of STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences, the first dedicated space and life sciences mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 5, 1991. SLS-1 was a nine-day mission during which crew members performed experiments that explored how the heart, blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and hormone-secreting glands respond to microgravity, the causes of space sickness, and changes in muscles, bones, and cells which occur in humans during space flight.

Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation. In addition to the scheduled payload activities on STS-40, Bagian was successful in personally devising and implementing repair procedures for malfunctioning experiment hardware which allowed all scheduled scientific objectives to be successfully accomplished. Following 146 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Columbia&quot; and her crew landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 14, 1991.

Completion of this flight logged him an additional 218 hours in space.

== Post-NASA ==
Bagian left NASA in 1995. He was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. Bagian was the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Patient Safety Officer, and Director of the VA National Center for Patient Safety.

Bagian was the first and founding director of the VA National Center for Patient Safety and as the Department of Veterans Affairs first Chief Patient Safety Officer where he developed numerous patient safety related tools and programs that have been adopted nationally and internationally.

Bagian is currently the Director of the Center for Healthcare Engineering and Patient Safety at the University of Michigan and is currently a professor at the University of Michigan with appointments in the Department of Anesthesia and the College of Engineering.

Bagian participated in the 2022 Starmus Festival held in Yerevan, Armenia in September 2022.

<doc id="596599" wikidata="Q645959" url="?curid=596599" title="List of places named after Joseph Stalin">
<text>During Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule (1922–1953), many places, mostly cities, in the Soviet Union and other communist countries were named or renamed in honour of him as part of the cult of personality surrounding him. Most of these places had their names changed back to the original ones shortly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956 or after the beginning of de-Stalinization in 1961.

In some countries, including those in the West, there are streets, squares, etc. named after Stalingrad (and hence indirectly after Stalin) in honour of the courage shown by the defenders at the battle of Stalingrad against Nazi Germany. These names have not been changed since they refer to the battle of Stalingrad rather than the city itself.

<text>In mathematics, a relatively compact subspace (or relatively compact subset, or precompact subset) of a topological space is a subset whose closure is compact.

==Properties==
Every subset of a compact topological space is relatively compact (since a closed subset of a compact space is compact). And in an arbitrary topological space every subset of a relatively compact set is relatively compact.

Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is relatively compact. In a non-Hausdorff space, such as the particular point topology on an infinite set, the closure of a compact subset is &quot;not&quot; necessarily compact; said differently, a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff space is not necessarily relatively compact.

Every compact subset of a (possibly non-Hausdorff) topological vector space is complete and relatively compact.

In the case of a metric topology, or more generally when sequences may be used to test for compactness, the criterion for relative compactness becomes that any sequence in has a subsequence convergent in . 

Some major theorems characterize relatively compact subsets, in particular in function spaces. An example is the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. Other cases of interest relate to uniform integrability, and the concept of normal family in complex analysis. Mahler&#x27;s compactness theorem in the geometry of numbers characterizes relatively compact subsets in certain non-compact homogeneous spaces (specifically spaces of lattices).

==Counterexample==
As a counterexample take any finite neighbourhood of the particular point of an infinite particular point space. The neighbourhood itself is compact but is not relatively compact because its closure is the whole non-compact space.

== Almost periodic functions ==

The definition of an almost periodic function at a conceptual level has to do with the translates of being a relatively compact set. This needs to be made precise in terms of the topology used, in a particular theory.

<text>George Kearsley Shaw (10 December 1751 – 22 July 1813) was an English botanist and zoologist.

==Life==
Shaw was born at Bierton, Buckinghamshire, and was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, receiving his M.A. in 1772. He took up the profession of medical practitioner. In 1786, he became the assistant lecturer in botany at the University of Oxford. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1789.

In 1791, Shaw became assistant keeper of the natural history department at the British Museum, succeeding Edward Whitaker Gray as keeper in 1806. He found that most of the items donated to the museum by Hans Sloane were in very bad condition. Medical and anatomical material was sent to the museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, but many of the stuffed animals and birds had deteriorated and had to be burnt. He was succeeded after his death by his assistant Charles Konig. Shaw&#x27;s library of natural history books and some of his specimens and equipment were sold at auction by Leigh &amp; Sotheby in London on 9 March 1814 (and two following days); a copy of the catalogue is in Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.162(8)).

==Works==

Shaw published one of the first English descriptions with scientific names of several Australian animals in his &quot;Zoology of New Holland&quot; (1794). He was among the first scientists to examine a platypus and published the first scientific description of it in &quot;The Naturalist&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; in 1799.

In the field of herpetology, he described numerous new species of reptile and amphibian.

His other publications included:
*&quot;Musei Leveriani explicatio, anglica et Latina&quot;&#x27;, containing select specimens from the museum of the late Sir Ashton Lever (1792–96), which had been moved to be displayed at the Blackfriars Rotunda.
*&quot;General Zoology, or Systematic Natural History&quot; (16 vol.) (1809–1826) (volumes IX to XVI by James Francis Stephens) 
*&quot;The Naturalist&#x27;s Miscellany: Or, Coloured Figures of Natural Objects; Drawn and Described Immediately From Nature&quot; (1789–1813) with Frederick Polydore Nodder (artist and engraver).

The standard botanical author abbreviation G.Shaw is applied to species he described.

<text>Ellen Louise Shulman Baker (born April 27, 1953) is an American physician and a former NASA astronaut. Baker is a veteran of three shuttle flights and logged more than 686 hours in space. Baker served as Chief of the Education/Medical Branch of the NASA Astronaut Office until her retirement in 2011 after more than 30 years of service to NASA.

== Family ==
The daughter of physician Mel and politician Claire Shulman, she was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, but raised in New York City. She is married to Kenneth J. Baker. They have two daughters.

== Education ==
Baker graduated from:
* Bayside High School in Queens in 1970.
* University at Buffalo, Bachelor of Arts degree in geology in 1974
* Cornell University, doctorate in medicine in 1978
* University of Texas School of Public Health, Master&#x27;s Degree in Public Health in 1994

== Medical career ==
After completing medical school, Baker trained in internal medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. In 1981, after three years of residency training in internal medicine, she was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine.

== NASA career ==
In 1981, following her parents, Baker joined NASA as a medical officer at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. That same year, she graduated from the Air Force Aerospace Medicine Course at Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Prior to her selection as an astronaut candidate, she served as a physician in the Flight Medicine Clinic at the Johnson Space Center. Selected by NASA in May 1984, Baker became an astronaut in June 1985. Since then, she has had a variety of jobs at NASA in support of the Space Shuttle program and Space Station development. She was a mission specialist on STS-34 in 1989, STS-50 in 1992, and STS-71 in 1995 and has logged over 686 hours in space. She then served as Chief of the Astronaut Office Education/Medical Branch.

=== Spaceflight experience ===

STS-34 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (October 18–23, 1989) launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. During the mission, the crew deployed the Galileo probe to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, conducted several medical experiments, and numerous scientific experiments. Mission objectives were accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth, traveling 1.8 million miles in 119 hours and 41 minutes.

STS-50 &quot;Columbia&quot; (June 25, 1992 – July 9, 1992) launched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. STS-50 was the first flight of the United States Microgravity Laboratory and the first Extended Duration Orbiter flight. Over a two-week period, the crew conducted scientific experiments involving crystal growth, fluid physics, fluid dynamics, biological science, and combustion science. Mission objectives were accomplished in 221 orbits of the Earth, traveling 5.7 million miles in 331 hours 30 seconds and 4 minutes in space.

STS-71 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (June 27 – July 7, 1995) launched from the Kennedy Space Center with a seven-member crew and returned there with an eight-member crew. STS-71 was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station &quot;Mir&quot;, and involved an exchange of crews. The &quot;Atlantis&quot; Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. It also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections. Mission accomplished in 153 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.1 million miles in 235 hours and 23 minutes.

He has two children.

==Naval service==
After graduation, Baker completed flight training and earned his Wings of Gold as a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Chase Field, Beeville, Texas, in 1977. In 1978, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 56 (VA-56), embarked on the aircraft carrier , homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, where he flew the A-7 Corsair II. In late 1980, he was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 30 as the Air Wing Landing Signal Officer.

He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1981 and, after graduation, was assigned to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. While there, Baker conducted carrier suitability structural tests, aircraft carrier catapult and arresting gear certification tests, and automatic carrier landing system certification and verification tests on the various aircraft carriers of the Navy&#x27;s fleet in the A-7 Corsair II aircraft.

In 1983, he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor. He was then assigned as the U.S. Navy exchange instructor at the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in Boscombe Down, England, teaching performance, flying qualities and systems flight test techniques.

He has logged over 5,400 hours flying time in approximately 50 different types of airplanes, including tactical jets, VSTOL, multi-engine transport and rotary wing aircraft, and has over 300 carrier landings to his credit.

==NASA==

Selected by NASA in June 1985, Baker became an astronaut in July 1986 upon completion of a one-year training and evaluation program.

Following the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, Baker was assigned from January 1986 to December 1987 as a member of the team that was pursuing redesign, modification and improvements to the Shuttle Landing and Deceleration Systems, to include nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and drag chute, in an effort to provide greater safety margins during landing and rollout. He was then assigned to the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, where he was involved in the checkout and verification of the computer software and hardware interfaces for STS-26 (the return-to-flight mission) and subsequent flights.

Baker then served as an ascent, entry and orbit spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for Shuttle missions STS-27, STS-29, STS-30, STS-28, STS-34, STS-33, STS-32, STS-36, STS-31, STS-38, and STS-35. His duties included communication with the Shuttle crew during simulations and actual missions, as well as working procedural problems and modifications between missions. He served as the leader of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center for Shuttle missions STS-44, STS-42 and STS-45. He was assigned as the Flight Crew Operations Directorate Representative to the Space Shuttle Program Office from December 1992 to January 1994.

Between March and October 1995, he served as the Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. He was responsible for the coordination and implementation of mission operation activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. From October 1997 to August 2001, he was the assistant director of Johnson Space Center (JSC) for Human Space Flight Programs, Russia and was responsible for implementation and integration of NASA&#x27;s Human Space Flight Programs in Russia. Those activities included International Space Station (ISS) training, operations, technical liaison, logistics and personnel administration support. He also served as the NASA JSC representative to the Russian Space Agency, Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City; Mission Control Center-Moscow, Energia Rocket and Spacecraft Corporation, Krunichev State Scientific and Production Space Center and other Russian government agencies and manufacturers involved in the ISS program. After his return to JSC in August 2001, he was assigned as the International Space Station Program Manager for International Operations responsible for the coordination of program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities with the International Partners.

===Space flights===
A veteran of four space flights, Baker has logged 965 hours in space. He served as pilot on STS-43 (August 2–11, 1991) and STS-52 (October 22 to November 1, 1992), and was the mission commander on STS-68 (September 30 to October 11, 1994) and STS-81 (January 12–22, 1997).

STS-43 Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 2, 1991. During the flight, crew members deployed the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and life science experiments, mostly relating to the Extended Duration Orbiter and Space Station Freedom. After 142 orbits of the Earth, the 9-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991. Mission duration was 213 hours, 21 minutes, 25 seconds.

STS-52 Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 22, 1992. During the mission crew members deployed the Italian Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS), used to measure movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload 1 (USMP-1). Additionally, the Advanced Space Vision System (SVS) developed by the Canadian Space Agency was tested by the Canadian payload specialist and the crew using a small target assembly that was released from the remote manipulator system. The SVS will be used for Space Station construction. These three primary payloads together with numerous other payloads operated by the crew encompassed geophysics, materials science, biological research and applied research for Space Station Freedom. Following 159 orbits of the Earth, the 10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center on November 1, 1992. Mission duration was 236 hours, 56 minutes, 13 seconds.
STS-68 Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. This flight was the second flight of the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL), which consists of a large radar called SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). As part of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL was an international, multidisciplinary study of global environmental change, both natural and man-made. The primary objective was to radar map the surface of the Earth to help us understand the contributions of ecology, hydrology, geology, and oceanography to changes in our Planet&#x27;s environment. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided in interpretation of the radar images. This SRL mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours, 46 minutes, 10 seconds.

STS-81 Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 12, 1997. STS-81 was the fifth in a series of joint missions between the U.S. Space Shuttle and the Russian Space Station Mir and the second one involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes.
