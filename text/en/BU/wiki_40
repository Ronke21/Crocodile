<text>Kelucharan Mohapatra (8 January 1926 – 7 April 2004) was a legendary Indian classical dancer, guru, and exponent of Odissi dance, who is credited with the revival and popularizing of this classical dance form in the 20th century.
He is the first person to receive the Padma Vibhushan from Odisha.

A noted Sanskrit poet of India writes on this &quot;Guru&quot;: &quot;Saango-paanga-subhangi-laasya-madhuram samteerna-nrutyaarnavam&quot;, which translates as – &quot;Each fraction of his dancing body leads to paramount sweetness, through miraculous poses and postures. In fact, Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra crossed the ocean of styles.&quot;

==Early life and history==
In his youth, Kelucharan Mohapatra performed Gotipua – a traditional dance form of Odisha where young boys dress up as woman to praise Lord Jagannath. Later in his life he did extensive research on Gotipua and Mahari dance, which lead him to restructure Odissi dance. Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra was a master in Percussion instruments – Mardala and Tabla, which clearly resonates in his dance compositions. He was also skilled in the traditional Pattachitra painting.

Kelucharan Mohapatra along with his wife, Laxmipriya Mohapatra, herself a dancer, and their son Ratikant Mohapatra built Srjan in 1993. Kelucharan Mohapatra was conferred a Doctorate by the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal in 1981.

==Quotes made by Kelucharan Mohapatra ==
* &quot;Odissi is not a mere dance form to entertain people but to inspire and elevate. I don&#x27;t actually dance but pray in compassion and the spectators say that this `form&#x27; is dancing.&quot;
* &quot;The real dance must convey the feeling of undivided existence, that a spectator can feel that he is not different from the thing observed&quot;.

<text>1373 Cincinnati, provisional designation , is an asteroid in a comet-like orbit from the Cybele region, located at the outermost rim of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was the only asteroid discovery made by famous American astronomer Edwin Hubble, while observing distant galaxies at Mount Wilson Observatory in California on 30 August 1935. The rather spherical X-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.3 hours. It was named for the Cincinnati Observatory.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; orbits the Sun in the outermost asteroid belt at a distance of 2.3–4.5 AU once every 6 years and 4 months (2,311 days; semi-major axis of 3.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 39° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Mount Wilson in August 1935.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot;, a non-family asteroid of the main belt&#x27;s background population, is located in the orbital region of the Cybele asteroids, the last outpost of an extended asteroid belt beyond the Hecuba-gap asteroids. Due to its high inclination, and contrary to all other Cybele asteroids, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; is the only one that is above the center of the ν6 secular resonance with Saturn. The asteroid&#x27;s high inclination and eccentricity also results in a Tisserand&#x27;s parameter (TJupiter) of 2.719, which makes it a true asteroid in cometary orbit (ACO) for having a TJupiter value below 3.

== Naming ==

Recommended by the Minor Planet Center, this minor planet was named after the Cincinnati Observatory, whose staff provided most of the orbit computations. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 31 January 1962 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; is a Xk-type, a subtype that transitions from the X-type to the uncommon K-type asteroids, while the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer classifies it as a metallic M-type asteroid. By 2014, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; is the only of three Cybele asteroids for which a spectral type has been determined; the other two are 522 Helga and 692 Hippodamia, an X- and S-type, respectively.

=== Rotation period ===

In January 2018, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Cincinnati&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by Henk de Groot. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 magnitude (). The low brightness amplitude is indicative that is asteroid is rather spherical than elongated in shape.

Alternative period determinations were made by French amateur astronomer René Roy (5.274 h; Δ0.21 mag) in August 2004 (). Two more lightcurves were obtained by Brian Warner at this Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado, United States, in August 2004 and August 2010, who measured a period of 4.930 and 5.28 hours with an amplitude of 0.11 and 0.14 magnitude, respectively.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s WISE telescope, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; measures between 19.4 and 19.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.15–0.16, while the Japanese Akari satellite determined a diameter of 22.16 kilometers with an albedo of 0.12. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 27.9 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.5.

<text>Evil Angels (released as A Cry in the Dark outside Australia and New Zealand) is a 1988 Australian drama film directed by Fred Schepisi. The screenplay by Schepisi and Robert Caswell is based on John Bryson&#x27;s 1985 book of the same name. It chronicles the case of Azaria Chamberlain, a nine-week-old baby girl who disappeared from a campground near Uluru in August 1980, and the struggle of her parents, Michael Chamberlain and Lindy Chamberlain, to prove their innocence to a public convinced that they were complicit in her death. Meryl Streep and Sam Neill star as the Chamberlains.

The film was released less than two months after the Chamberlains were exonerated by the Northern Territory Court of Appeals of all charges filed against them. The film received generally favourable reviews, with Streep&#x27;s performance receiving high praise and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, but was a box office disappointment, grossing only $6.9 million against its $15 million budget.

==Plot==
Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy Chamberlain, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Australian Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family enjoys a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying Azaria, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events as true.

However, the tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, cold-hearted, and accepting of the disaster that has befallen the family. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple&#x27;s religious beliefs are not widely practiced in the country, and when the media report a rumour that the name Azaria means &quot;sacrifice in the wilderness&quot;, the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.

Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and circumstantial evidence and reopen the investigation, eventually charging Lindy with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys&#x27; advice to play to the jury&#x27;s sympathy and appears stoic on the stand, convincing some onlookers of her guilt. As the trial progresses, Michael&#x27;s faith in his religion and his belief in his wife falter, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and immediately sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month suspended sentence.

More than three years later, while searching for the body of an English tourist who fell from Uluru, police discover a dingo lair with clothing that is identified as the jacket Lindy had insisted Azaria was wearing over her jumpsuit, which had been recovered early in the investigation. Lindy is immediately released from prison, the case is reopened and all convictions against the Chamberlains are overturned. The film ends with Michael commenting on the ongoing battle to clear the family&#x27;s name.

==Production==
John Bryson&#x27;s book &quot;Evil Angels&quot; was published in 1985 and film rights were bought by Verity Lambert, who got the interest of Meryl Streep. Robert Caswell wrote a script and Fred Schepisi agreed to direct. The movie was one of the most expensive and elaborate ever shot in Australia, with 350 speaking cast and 4,000 extras.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Evil Angels&quot; grossed A$3,006,964 at the box office in Australia. This was considered a disappointment considering the publicity and subject matter.

===Critical reception===
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby said the film &quot;has much of the manner of a television docudrama, ultimately being a rather comforting celebration of personal triumph over travails so dread and so particular that they have no truly disturbing, larger application. Yet &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; is better than that, mostly because of another stunning performance by Meryl Streep, who plays Lindy Chamberlain with the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting ... Though Sam Neill is very good as Lindy Chamberlain&#x27;s tormented husband, Miss Streep supplies the guts of the melodrama that are missing from the screenplay.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Schepisi has chosen to present the terrible events in the outback in such a way that there&#x27;s never any doubt in the audience&#x27;s mind about what happened. The audience doesn&#x27;t worry about the fate of the Chamberlains as much as it worries about the unconvincing ease with which justice is miscarried. Mr. Schepisi may have followed the facts of the case, but he has not made them comprehensible in terms of the film. The manner by which justice miscarries is the real subject of the movie. In this screenplay, however, it serves only as a pretext for a personal drama that remains chilly and distant ... As a result, the courtroom confrontations are so weakened that &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; becomes virtually a one-character movie. It&#x27;s Mr. Schepisi&#x27;s great good fortune that that one character is portrayed by the incomparable Meryl Streep.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed, &quot;Schepisi is successful in indicting the court of public opinion, and his methodical (but absorbing) examination of the evidence helps us understand the state&#x27;s circumstantial case. In the lead role, Streep is given a thankless assignment: to show us a woman who deliberately refused to allow insights into herself. She succeeds, and so, of course, there are times when we feel frustrated because we do not know what Lindy is thinking or feeling. We begin to dislike the character, and then we know how the Australian public felt. Streep&#x27;s performance is risky and masterful.&quot;

In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley said, &quot;Streep – yes, with another perfect accent – brings her customary skillfulness to the part. It&#x27;s not a showy performance, but the heroine&#x27;s internal struggle seems to come from the actress&#x27; pores. Neill, who costarred with Streep in &quot;Plenty&quot;, is quite good as a humble, bewildered sort who finally breaks under cross-examination.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; made note of the &quot;intimate, incredible detail in the classy, disturbing drama.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 94% from 31 reviews.

===Accolades===
==In popular culture==
In 2005, the phrase &quot;The dingo took my baby!&quot;, was nominated by the American Film Institute in its list of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The quote, often incorrectly quoted as &quot;a dingo ate my baby&quot;, became part of pop culture after the release of the movie, appearing on such shows as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Baby Daddy&quot;, as well as &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; and &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;.

In June 2008, the AFI revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Evil Angels&quot; was acknowledged as ninth best in the courtroom drama genre.

<text>Bogusław Linda (; born 27 June 1952) is a Polish actor known from films such as &quot;Psy&quot; and &quot;Tato&quot;. He appeared in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s &quot;Man of Iron&quot; and &quot;Danton&quot; and in Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Blind Chance&quot; and the seventh episode of Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Dekalog&quot;. He is regarded as one of the most popular Polish film actors.

== Biography ==
He was born on 27 June 1952 in Toruń, where he graduated from the Secondary School of General Education. He graduated from the Secondary School in Toruń and is a graduate of the Krakow Academy of Dramatic Arts and a co-founder and lecturer at Warsaw Film School.

As a student, Linda made contact with Kraków&#x27;s Stary Teatr. His debut was as Mikolka in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, directed by Maciej Prus, 1977. From 1978 through 1981 he worked at the Wrocławski Teatr Współczesny in such plays as Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; and Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot; (1980). In the early 1980s he was an actor in Warsaw&#x27;s Studio Theatre.

His first major role came in 1980 with the Polish film &quot;Fever&quot;, directed by Agnieszka Holland, in which he portrayed an anarchist named Gryziaka. Then followed roles in the films: &quot;A Lonely Woman&quot; (1981) by the same director; &quot;Man of Iron&quot; by Andrzej Wajda; &quot;Blind Chance&quot; by director Krzysztof Kieślowski (1981); and &quot;The Mother of Kings&quot; by Janusz Zaorski (1982) – all roles of characters marked by existential anxiety, and forced to struggle hopelessly against a hostile reality.

Linda had a breakthrough role in the Jacek Bromski film, &quot;Kill Me, Cop&quot; (1987), playing George Malik, a dangerous criminal. In 1992, he starred as Franz Maurer in &quot;Pigs&quot; by director Władysław Pasikowski. This role shaped the image of Linda as a cynical &quot;tough guy&quot;, an image strengthened by roles in the films &quot;Pigs 2: The Last Blood&quot; (reprising the role of Franz Maurer), &quot;Sara&quot; by Maciej Ślesicki, &quot;A Trap&quot; by Adek Drabiński, and &quot;Demons of War&quot; by Władysław Pasikowski. In the film Sara, the actor performed a cover of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;.

The 90s brought him critical acclaim with roles in Jan Jakub Kolski&#x27;s &quot;Johnnie Waterman&quot; (1994) (also known as Johnnie the Aquarius); as Michał Sulecki, a father fighting for custody of his 7-year-old daughter in &quot;Tato&quot;, directed by Maciej Ślesicki (1995); and as Father Robak, a priest, in &quot;Pan Tadeusz: The Last Foray in Lithuania&quot; by Andrzej Wajda (1999). In 1996, during the Festival of Stars in Misdroy left a hand mark on the Promenade of Stars.

In 2001&#x27;s Reich, directed by Władysław Pasikowski, he played Alex, a gangster, alongside Mirosław Baka and Aleksandra Nieśpielak. It was the seventh production in which Linda worked with director Pasikowski, after which he began trying to escape from the image of a tough guy with a gun in his hand. In the fall of 2002, he hosted the talk show &quot;Co ty wiesz o gotowaniu, czyli Linda w kuchni.&quot; The show was pulled from the schedule after six episodes due to low viewership scores.

In the same year he also starred as Petronius in Jerzy Kawalerowicz&#x27;s &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. On the Polish cinema screens also entered his second season on the bream. The actor played the role of a cop whose wife left. It was also a road movie about a young offender who attacked the bank. Main Roles played with him Anna Przybylska, Gabriel Fleszar, Edyta Olszówka and Marian Dziędziel.

In 2005, he starred in the Polish-American production of Summer Love. In the same year he recorded with the band Fireflies an album titled &quot;Las putas melancólicas&quot;. He played a comedic role in the film &quot;Time Surfers&quot; and starred in sitcoms and &quot;Wilds 2: Duel&quot;.

In 2006 Linda tried his hand as a director with the film Skylights, a story about two young girls whose lives are intertwined with the difficult economic situation in Poland after the fall of communism.

Three years later, Linda proved himself as a comedic actor in the film Blind Date, directed by Wojciech Wojcik. Linda played the role of seducer Cezary there.

On 5 October 2009 at the hands of the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Culture, Piotr Żuchowski, he picked up a Silver Medal Gloria Artis.

On 1 April 2011 the film &quot;Three minutes&quot; by Maciej Ślesicki was released, where he played the role of a painter.

On 19 April 2012 he directed Merlin his Mongol. It was his theatre directorial debut, and the first time he had been involved with the theatre in 15 years.

On 16 May 2014 he was awarded the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta &quot;for outstanding services for Polish culture, for achievements in artistic and creative work, and social activity&quot;.

He was honoured in the Walk of Fame in his hometown of Toruń (where he studied and lived), where d the second in a series of &quot;katarzynki&quot; – signatures of famous inhabitants of Toruń was unveiled in the old town.

==Private life==

He is concerned about his privacy and rarely gives interviews or consents to articles about his private life.

<doc id="595911" wikidata="Q462225" url="?curid=595911" title="Amleth">
<text>Amleth (; Latinized as &quot;Amlethus&quot;) is a figure in a medieval Scandinavian legend, the direct inspiration of the character of Prince Hamlet, the hero of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;. The chief authority for the legend of Amleth is Saxo Grammaticus, who devotes to it parts of the third and fourth books of his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, completed at the beginning of the 13th century. Saxo&#x27;s version is supplemented by Latin and vernacular compilations from a much later date. In all versions, prince Amleth (&quot;Amblothæ&quot;) is the son of Horvendill (&quot;Orwendel&quot;), king of the Jutes. It has often been assumed that the story is ultimately derived from an Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem has been found; the extant Icelandic versions, known as the &quot;Ambales-saga&quot; or &quot;Amloda-saga&quot;, are considerably later than Saxo. Amleth&#x27;s name is not mentioned in Old-Icelandic regnal lists before Saxo. Only the 15th-century &quot;Sagnkrønike&quot; from Stockholm may contain some older elements.

==Name==
The Old Icelandic form &quot;Amlóði&quot; is recorded twice in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. According to the section &quot;Skaldskaparmal&quot;, the expression &quot;Amlóða mólu&quot; (&#x27;Amlóði&#x27;s quern-stone&#x27;) is a kenning for the sea, grinding the skerries to sand. In a poem by the 10th-century skald Snæbjörn the name of the legendary hero Amlóði is intrinsically connected to the word &quot;líðmeldr&quot; (&#x27;ale-flower&#x27;), leading to the conclusion that the nine mermaids, who operated the &quot;hand-mill of the sea&quot;, &quot;long ago ground the ale-flour of Amlóði&quot;. The association with flour milling and beer brewing, the gold carried around, the net used to catch people and the association with the nine female waves place Amleth on a par with the deity Aegir and his wife Rán.

The late 12th-century &quot;Amlethus&quot;, &quot;Amblothæ&quot; may easily be latinizations of the Old Norse name. 
The etymology of the name is unknown, but there are various suggestions.

Icelandic &quot;Amlóði&quot; is recorded as a term for a fool or simpleton in reference to the character of the early modern Icelandic romance or folk tale.
One suggestion is based on the &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;trickster&quot; interpretation of the name, composing the name from Old Norse &quot;ama&quot; &quot;to vex, annoy, molest&quot; and &quot;óðr&quot; &quot;fierceness, madness&quot; (also in the theonym &quot;Odin&quot;). The Irish and Scottish word &quot;amhlair&quot;, which in contemporary vernacular denotes a dull, stupid person, is handed down from the ancient name for a court jester or fool, who entertained the king but also surreptitiously advised him through riddles and antics.

A more recent suggestion is based on the Eddaic kenning associating &quot;Amlóði&quot; with the mythological mill &quot;grótti&quot;, and derives it from the Old Irish name &quot;Admlithi&quot; &quot;great-grinding&quot;, attested in &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot;.

Attention has also been drawn to the similarity of &quot;Amleth&quot; to the Irish name &quot;Amhladh&quot; (variously &quot;Amhlaidh, Amhlaigh, Amhlaide&quot;), itself a Gaelic adaptation of the Norse name Olaf.

In a controversial suggestion going back to 1937, the sequence &quot;æmluþ&quot; contained in the 8th-century Old Frisian runic inscription on the Westeremden yew-stick has been interpreted as a reference to &quot;Amleth&quot;. Contemporary runic research does not support this conclusion.

==Scandinavian legend==
It has frequently been assumed that the Scandinavian legend ultimately goes back to an Old Norse (Old Icelandic) poem of about the 10th century.
Nevertheless, no such poem has survived, and the late 12th-century Latin version of the story told by Saxo Grammaticus is the oldest source. There are, however, striking parallels with Gaimar&#x27;s 12th-century Anglo-Norman &quot;Lay of Haveloc&quot; and the subsequent English romance of Havelok the Dane. Like the story of Amleth, that of Haveloc is set in Jutland in a more or less maritime context. Both protagonists fake madness. Still, Haveloc has special abilities that we do not find in Amleth, such as a fire coming from his mouth during sleep, an oversized stature, a birth-mark indicating his royal descent and the ability to blow a miraculous horn. Comparable motifs emerge in the romance of Bevis of Hampton. Saxo Grammaticus must also have been inspired by the classical story of Brutus (see below).

There was in addition an early modern (17th century) Icelandic version of the tale. Historian Thormodus Torfæus had asserted that a story of &quot;Amlodi&quot; was part of popular folklore in the mid-17th century, but it is unclear whether the early modern Icelandic tale is substantially influenced by Saxo&#x27;s account, or if it represents an independent tradition derived from the unattested Old Icelandic source.

===Saxo&#x27;s version===

Gervendill, governor of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, on his return from a Viking expedition in which he had slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; they had a son, Amleth. However, Feng murdered Horvendill out of jealousy and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife on the plea that he had committed the crime for no other reason than to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father&#x27;s fate, pretended to be an imbecile. However, Feng&#x27;s suspicions put him to various tests related in detail. Among other things, they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. However, when Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden, like Polonius in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, in his mother&#x27;s room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man&#x27;s madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter urging the country&#x27;s king to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to instead direct the king to kill the attendants and give Amleth his daughter in marriage.

After marrying the princess, Amleth returned to Denmark at the end of a year. Of the wealth he had accumulated, he took with him only certain hollow sticks filled with gold. He arrived in time for a funeral feast to celebrate his supposed death. During the feast, he plied the courtiers with wine. He executed his vengeance during their drunken sleep by fastening down over them the woolen hangings of the hall with pegs he had sharpened during his feigned madness, then setting fire to the palace. He slew Feng with his own sword. After a long harangue to the people, he was proclaimed king. Returning to Britain for his wife, he found that his father-in-law and Feng had pledged each to avenge the other&#x27;s death. The English king, unwilling to personally carry out his pledge, sent Amleth as proxy wooer for the hand of a terrible Scottish queen, Hermuthruda, who had put all former wooers to death but fell in love with Amleth. On his return to Britain, his first wife, whose love proved stronger than her resentment, told him of her father&#x27;s intended revenge. In the ensuing battle, Amleth won the day by setting up the fallen dead from the day before on stakes, thereby terrifying the enemy.

He then returned with his two wives to Jutland, where he encountered the enmity of Wiglek, Rørik&#x27;s successor. He was slain in a battle against Wiglek. Although she had promised to die with him, Hermuthruda instead married the victor. Saxo states that Amleth was buried on a plain (or &quot;heath&quot;) in Jutland, famous for his name and burial place. Wiglek later died of illness and was the father of Wermund, from whom the royal line of Kings of Mercia descended.
===Gesta Danorum pa Danskæ and Sagnkrønike===
Late compilations such as the &quot;Gesta Danorum pa danskæ&quot; (dating around 1300) and the &quot;Compendium Saxonis&quot; (mid-14th century) summarize the story. References can also be found in the &quot;Annales Ryenses&quot;, the &quot;Annales Slesvicensis&quot;, and several runic manuscripts summarizing the Danish kings. None of these, however, precedes Saxo Grammaticus. According to Marijane Osborn the 15th-century &quot;Sagnkrønike&quot; from Stockholm contains several elements that may have been derived from an older story. Much confusion has arisen as Eric V. Gordon (1927) incorrectly interpreted the &quot;Gesta&quot; as an adaptation of the 12th-century &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Lejre&quot;. This claim, however, is not supported by modern historiography.

According to the Danish &quot;Gesta&quot; the legendary King Rorik Slengeborre of Denmark made Orwendel and Feng rulers in Jutland, and gave his daughter to Orwendel as a reward for his good service. Orwendel and the daughter had a son, Amblothæ.
The jealous Feng killed Orwendel and took his wife. Amblothæ understood that his life was in danger and tried to survive by pretending to be insane. Feng sent Amblothæ to the king of Britain with two servants, who carried a message directing the British king to kill Amblothæ. While the servants slept, Amblothæ carved off the (probably runic) message and wrote that the servants were to be killed and that he should be married to the king&#x27;s daughter. The British king did what the message said. 
Exactly one year later, Feng drank to the memory of Amblothæ, but Amblothæ appeared and killed him, burnt Feng&#x27;s men to death in a tent, and became the ruler of Jutland. Then he went back to Britain to kill the British king, who wanted to avenge Feng&#x27;s death and marry Scotland&#x27;s queen. Amblothæ went back to Jutland and was killed in battle upon arrival.

According to the &quot;Sagnkrønike&quot; Amlæd was killed by his brother in law, the King of Norway (Shakespeare&#x27;s Fortinbras) in a sea battle on the Øresund, as he tried to gain control over the neighbouring territory. His death was avenged, however, by his widow queen Yngafred, who slew the Norwegian king and many of his men.

===Icelandic versions===
In Iceland, the early modern &quot;Ambale&#x27;s Saga&quot; is a romantic tale (the earliest manuscript dates from the 17th century). 
Thormodus Torfæus recorded in 1702 that he &quot;often heard the story of Amlod related in Iceland by old women&quot; in his youth.
The folk-tale of Brjam was put in writing in 1707. In the &quot;Ambale&#x27;s Saga&quot;, besides romantic additions, some traits point to an earlier version of the tale.

Also comparable is the medieval &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;, where the brothers Helgi (known as Halga in &quot;Beowulf&quot;) and Hroar (Hroðgar) take the place of the hero (corresponding to the tale of Harald and Halfdan in the seventh book of Saxo Grammaticus); Helgi and Hroar, like Harald and Halfdan, avenge their father&#x27;s murder by their uncle by burning the uncle in his palace. Harald and Halfdan escape after their father&#x27;s death by being brought up with dogs&#x27; names in a hollow oak, and subsequently by feigning madness. In the case of the other brothers, there are traces of a similar motive since the boys are called by dogs&#x27; names. Thomas Spray has shown that many of the Icelandic sagas are clearly structured similarly to the Hamlet narrative.

==Comparative mythology==
The similarities of Saxo&#x27;s version with the classical tale of 
Lucius Junius Brutus as told by Livy, by Valerius Maximus, and by Dionysius of Halicarnassus are likely deliberate, as the incident of the gold-filled sticks could hardly appear fortuitously in both, and a comparison of the harangues of Amleth (Saxo, Book iv.) and Brutus (Dionysius, iv. 77) shows marked similarities.
In both tales, the usurping uncle is ultimately succeeded by the nephew. The latter has escaped notice during his youth by a feigned madness. Nevertheless, the parts played by the personages who in Shakespeare became Ophelia and Polonius, the method of revenge, and the whole narrative of Amleth&#x27;s adventure in England, have no parallels in the Latin story.

Further resemblances exist in the &quot;Ambale&#x27;s Saga&quot; with the tales of Bellerophon, of Heracles, and of Servius Tullius. This concerns especially the episode of the &quot;traitorous letter&quot; (ordering the death of the bearer), also found in the Old French (13th-century) &quot;Dit de l&#x27;empereur Constant&quot;, and further afield in various Arabian and Indian tales.

There are also striking similarities between the story of Amleth and that of Kai Khosrow in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (Book of the King) of the Persian poet Firdausi. 
In ancient Egyptian mythology, a similar tale of a king who is murdered by a jealous brother but avenged by his son appears in the narrative of Osiris, Set and Horus.

==16th-century reception==

Outside Scandinavia, the story of Amleth or Hamlet was popularized through François de Belleforest&#x27;s French &quot;Histoires tragiques&quot; (Paris, Chez Jean Hupeau, 1572, Fueil 149), where it appears as the fifth story of the fifth volume. An English version, &quot;The Hystorie of Hamblet&quot;, was published in 1608. An English stage version, conventionally known as the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;, appeared by 1589. The play is lost but is mentioned in a few other sources, the first being Thomas Nashe&#x27;s 1589 preface to Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Menaphon&quot;.

William Shakespeare wrote his play &quot;Hamlet&quot; sometime between 1599 and 1602. The &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is thought to be his primary source; his version owes but the outline of the story to Saxo. In character, Shakespeare&#x27;s Prince Hamlet is diametrically opposed to his prototype. Amleth&#x27;s madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity to the words of Hamlet. However, he resembles him in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies&#x27; plans.

==Modern adaptations==
Henry Treece adapted the story of Amleth from Saxo for his 1966 novel &quot;The Green Man&quot;.

The legend was taken as the basis of a 1994 film by Gabriel Axel, &quot;Prince of Jutland&quot; (also known as &quot;Royal Deceit&quot;), with Gabriel Byrne as Fenge, Helen Mirren as Geruth and Christian Bale as Amled.

The Amleth story was also the basis for the 1994 Disney film &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

The legend, woven together with Shakespeare&#x27;s play, forms the basis for Alan Gordon&#x27;s novel &quot;An Antic Disposition&quot; (2004), the fifth novel in Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Fools&#x27; Guild&quot; series.

Amleth&#x27;s story was also adapted into the 2022 film &quot;The Northman&quot;, directed by the American director Robert Eggers who also co-wrote the script with Icelandic author Sjón, with Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth.

<doc id="595917" wikidata="Q1707792" url="?curid=595917" title="Space Harrier">
<text>is a third-person arcade rail shooter game developed by Sega and released in 1985. It was originally conceived as a realistic military-themed game played in the third-person perspective and featuring a player-controlled fighter jet, but technical and memory restrictions resulted in Sega developer Yu Suzuki redesigning it around a jet-propelled human character in a fantasy setting. The arcade game is controlled by an analog flight stick while the deluxe arcade cabinet is a cockpit-style linear actuator motion simulator cabinet that pitches and rolls during play, for which it is referred as a &quot;taikan&quot; (体感) or &quot;body sensation&quot; arcade game in Japan.

It was a commercial success in arcades, becoming one of Japan&#x27;s top two highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade games of 1986 (along with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Hang-On&quot;). Critically praised for its innovative graphics, gameplay and motion cabinet, &quot;Space Harrier&quot; is often ranked among Suzuki&#x27;s best works. It has made several crossover appearances in other Sega titles, and inspired a number of clones and imitators, while Capcom and PlatinumGames director Hideki Kamiya cited it as an inspiration for him entering the video game industry.

&quot;Space Harrier&quot; has been ported to over twenty different home computer and gaming platforms, either by Sega or outside developers such as Dempa in Japan and Elite Systems in North America and Europe. Two home-system sequels followed in &quot;Space Harrier 3-D&quot; and &quot;Space Harrier II&quot; (both released in 1988), and the arcade spin-off &quot;Planet Harriers&quot; (2000). A polygon-based remake of the original game was released by Sega for the PlayStation 2 as part of their &quot;Sega Ages&quot; series in 2003.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Space Harrier&quot; is a fast-paced rail shooter game played in a third-person perspective behind the protagonist, set in a surreal world composed of brightly colored landscapes adorned with checkerboard-style grounds and stationary objects such as trees or stone pillars. At the start of gameplay, players are greeted with a voice sample speaking &quot;Welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready!&quot;, in addition to &quot;You&#x27;re doing great!&quot; with the successful completion of a stage. The title player character, simply named Harrier, navigates a continuous series of eighteen distinct stages while utilizing an underarm jet-propelled laser cannon that enables Harrier to simultaneously fly and shoot. The objective is simply to destroy all enemies—who range from prehistoric animals and Chinese dragons to flying robots, airborne geometric objects and alien pods—all while remaining in constant motion in order to dodge projectiles and immovable ground obstacles.

Fifteen of the game&#x27;s eighteen stages contain a boss at the end that must be killed in order to progress to the next level; the final stage is a rush of seven past bosses encountered up to that point that appear individually and are identified by name at the bottom of the screen. The two other levels are bonus stages that contain no enemies and where Harrier mounts an invincible catlike dragon named Uriah, whom the player maneuvers to smash through landscape obstacles and collect bonus points. After all lives are lost, players have the option of continuing gameplay with the insertion of an extra coin. As &quot;Space Harrier&quot; has no storyline, after the completion of all stages, only &quot;The End&quot; is displayed before the game returns to the title screen and attract mode, regardless of how many of the player&#x27;s extra lives remain.

==Development==
The game was first conceived by a Sega designer named Ida, who wrote a 100-page document proposing the idea of a three-dimensional shooter that contained the word &quot;Harrier&quot; in the title. The game would feature a player-controlled fighter jet that shot missiles into realistic foregrounds, a concept that was soon rejected due to the extensive work required to project the aircraft realistically from varying angles as it moved around the screen, coupled with arcade machines&#x27; memory limitations. Sega developer Yu Suzuki therefore simplified the title character to a human, which required less memory and realism to depict onscreen. He then rewrote the entire original proposal, changing the style of the game to a science-fiction setting while keeping only the &quot;Harrier&quot; name. His inspirations for the game&#x27;s new design were the 1984 film &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, the 1982 anime series &quot;Space Cobra&quot;, and the work of artist Roger Dean. Certain enemies were modelled on characters from the anime series &quot;Gundam&quot;. Suzuki included a nod to the original designer in the finished product with an enemy character called Ida, a large moai-like floating stone head, because the designer &quot;had a really big head&quot;. Three different arcade cabinets were produced: an upright cabinet, a sit-down version with a fixed seat, and its best known incarnation: a deluxe cockpit-style rolling cabinet that was mounted on a motorised base and moved depending on the direction in which players pushed the joystick. Sega was hesitant to have the cabinets built due to high construction costs; Suzuki, who had proposed the cabinet designs, offered his salary as compensation if the game failed, but it would instead become a major hit in arcades.

Suzuki had little involvement with the game after its initial release: the Master System port was developed by Mutsuhiro Fujii and Yuji Naka, and they added a final boss and an ending sequence which were included in subsequent ports. The game was too successful for Sega to abandon the series, and other Sega staff, such as Naoto Ohshima (character designer for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;), Kotaro Hayashida (planner of &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;), and Toshihiro Nagoshi (director of &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;) have had involvement in various sequels. In a 2015 interview, Suzuki said that he would have liked to create a new &quot;Space Harrier&quot; by himself, and was pleased to see it ported to the Nintendo 3DS.

===Hardware===

&quot;Space Harrier&quot; was one of the first arcade releases to use 16-bit graphics and scaled sprite (&quot;Super Scaler&quot;) technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to display 32,000 colors on screen. Running on the &quot;Sega Space Harrier&quot; arcade system board previously used in Suzuki&#x27;s 1985 arcade debut &quot;Hang-On&quot;, pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling is used for the stage backgrounds while the character graphics are sprite-based. Suzuki explained in 2010 that his designs &quot;were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from &quot;Hang-On&quot;. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D&quot;.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack is by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who composed drafts on a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and wrote out the final versions as sheet music, as he had no access to a &quot;real&quot; music sequencer at the time. A Zilog Z80 CPU powering both a Yamaha YM2203 synthesis chip and Sega&#x27;s PCM unit that was used for audio and digitized voice samples. &quot;Space Harrier&quot; utilized an analog flight stick as its controller that allowed onscreen movement in all directions, while the velocity of the character&#x27;s flight is unchangeable. The degree of push and acceleration varies depending on how far the stick is moved in a certain direction. Two separate &quot;fire&quot; buttons are mounted on the joystick (a trigger) and on the control panel; either one can be pressed repeatedly in order to shoot at enemies.

The deluxe arcade cabinet is a cockpit-style motion simulator cabinet that pitches and rolls during play, for which it is referred to as a &quot;taikan&quot; (&quot;body sensation&quot;) arcade game in Japan. It is often mistakenly referred to as a hydraulic cabinet, as a pair of motorized linear actuators in the base tilted the cabinet in two axes.

==Ports==
&quot;Space Harrier&quot; has been ported to numerous home computer systems and gaming consoles, with most early translations unable to reproduce the original&#x27;s advanced visual or audio capabilities while the controls were switched from analog to digital. The first port was released in 1986 for the Master System (&quot;Mark III&quot; in Japan), developed by Sega AM R&amp;D 4. The first two-megabit cartridge produced for the console, the game was given a plot in which Harrier saves the &quot;Land of the Dragons&quot; (rather than the &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot;) from destruction, with a new ending sequence in contrast to the arcade version&#x27;s simple &quot;The End&quot; message. All eighteen stages were present but the backdrops therein were omitted, leaving just a monochromatic horizon and the checkerboard floors. An exclusive final boss was included in a powerful twin-bodied fire dragon named Haya Oh, who was named after then-Sega president Hayao Nakayama. Hayo Oh has also been included as a boss in the Game Gear, X68000 and Nintendo 3DS versions of the game. The 1991 Game Gear port is based on its Master System counterpart, but with redesigned enemies and only twelve stages, while Rutubo Games produced a near-duplicate of the arcade version in 1994 for the 32X add-on for the Sega Genesis. Both games featured box art by Marc Ericksen.

Other releases were developed for non-Sega gaming systems such as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Famicom, while Europe and North America saw 8-bit home computer ports by Elite Systems for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 in 1986, and later in 1989 for the 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST. The Commodore 64 received two conversions, one originating in the UK and the other from the USA.

M2, in collaboration with Sega CS3, ported &quot;Space Harrier&quot; to the handheld Nintendo 3DS console in 2013, complete with stereoscopic 3D and widescreen graphics—a process that took eighteen months. Sega CS3 producer Yosuke Okunari described the game&#x27;s 3D-conversion process as &quot;almost impossible. When you take a character sprite that was originally in 2D and bring it into a 3D viewpoint, you have to build the graphic from scratch&quot;. During development, M2 president Naoki Horii sought opinions from staff members regarding the gameplay of the arcade original: &quot;They&#x27;d say it was hard to tell whether objects were right in front of their character or not. Once we had the game in 3D, the same people came back and said, &#x27;OK, now I get it! I can play it now!&#x27;&quot; The port included a feature that allowed players to use the 3DS&#x27;s gyroscope to simulate the experience of the original motorised cabinet by way of a tilting screen, compounded by the optional activation of the sounds of button clicks and the cabinet&#x27;s movement. Horii recalled in a 2015 interview that he was intrigued by the possibility of crafting &quot;Space Harrier&quot; and past Sega arcade games for the 3DS using stereoscopic technology: &quot;Both SEGA and M2 wanted to see what would happen if we added a little bit of spice to these titles, in the form of modern gaming technology. Would it enhance the entertainment factor? I think the reception that the releases have had from critics highlights that these games are as relevant today as ever, and that means we&#x27;ve succeeded&quot;.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
The game was commercially successful upon its initial arcade release. Sega unveiled &quot;Space Harrier&quot; at the 1985 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, where it was the most popular game. In January 1986, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Space Harrier&quot; as being the top-grossing title on the monthly upright/cockpit arcade cabinet charts in Japan. It remained at the top of the upright/cockpit arcade charts for much of 1986, through February, March and early April, then returning to the top in May, remaining at the top through June, July and August, and then topping the charts again in October. Overall, the &quot;Space Harrier&quot; rolling type cabinet was Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade cabinet during the first half of 1986 (below only &quot;Hang-On&quot;), and the overall highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game during the latter half of 1986. It was later Japan&#x27;s seventh highest upright/cockpit arcade game of 1987.

The arcade game was positively received by critics upon release. Reviewing the game at the 1986 Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London, Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; hailed it as a &quot;crowd stopper&quot; due to its &quot;realistic&quot; moving cockpit, graphical capabilities and &quot;amazing technicolour landscapes&quot; but cautioned: &quot;Unless you are an expert, you will find it very difficult&quot;. Mike Roberts of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine praised the &quot;extremely good&quot; graphics, the &quot;quite good&quot; 3D effects, and the cockpit simulator cabinet. The July 1986 issue of Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; ranked &quot;Space Harrier&quot; at number one on its list of best Sega arcade games.

===Ports===
The game was also positively received upon its home releases. The home computer conversion of &quot;Space Harrier&quot; was in the top five of the UK sales chart in December 1986, and was tied as runner-up with the Commodore 64 title &quot;Uridium&quot; for Game of the Year honors at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards. 

Ed Semrad of &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; gave the Master System port a 9/10 rating, and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; deemed it &quot;the best arcade shoot-&#x27;em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played&quot;. Phil Campbell of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the 1989 Amiga conversion as &quot;absorbing&quot; and &quot;a faithful copy of the original&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called the port &quot;an entirely unpretentious computer game full of weird and wacky nasties&quot;. Paul Mellerick of &quot;Sega Force&quot; wrote that the Game Gear version was &quot;amazingly close to the original ... the scrolling&#x27;s the speediest and smoothest ever seen&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the 32X version had &quot;straightforward controls&quot;, graphics relatively close to the arcade version, and was &quot;a nice trip down memory lane&quot;, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; dubbed it as decent, solid game. AllGame called the game &quot;a must-have&quot; title for 32X system.

Lucas Thomas of IGN rated the 2008 Wii port a 4.5 score out of 10, citing its &quot;poor visuals and poor control&quot; and &quot;dulled&quot; color palette. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb, in his review of &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;, criticized the &quot;Space Harrier&quot; emulation&#x27;s &quot;numerous audio issues that make it sound completely different from the way the original game sounds&quot;. Bob Mackey of USGamer was critical to Nintendo 3DS port.

===Retrospective===
The game continues to garner praise for its audio, visual, and gameplay features. &quot;GameSetWatch&#x27;s&quot; Trevor Wilson remarked in 2006: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to see why the game is so well-loved to this day, with its blinding speed and classic tunes&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; editor Darran Jones described the game as &quot;difficult&quot;, but &quot;a thing of beauty [that] even today ... possesses a striking elegance that urges you to return to it for just one more go&quot;. That same year, IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan opined: &quot;Even today, &quot;Space Harrier&quot; is a sight to behold, a hellzapoppin&#x27; explosion of light, color, and imagination&quot;. Eric Twice of &quot;Snackbar Games&quot; noted in 2013: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to just see it as just a game in which you press the button and things die, but Suzuki is a very conscious designer. He has a very specific vision behind each of his games, and nothing in them is ever left to chance&quot;. In a 2013 Eurogamer retrospective on the series, Rich Stanton observed: &quot;The speed at which &quot;Space Harrier&quot; moves has rarely been matched. It&#x27;s not an easy thing to design a game around. Many other games have fast parts, or certain mechanics tied to speed—and it&#x27;s interesting to note how many take control away at this point. Every time I play &quot;Space Harrier&quot; ... the speed blows me away one more time. It is a monster&quot;.

Eric Francisco of &quot;Inverse&quot; described the game&#x27;s visuals in 2015: &quot;Imagine an acid trip through an &#x27;80s anime, a Robert Jordan novel, and early Silicon Valley binge coding sessions&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked the arcade original&#x27;s bonus stage among the &quot;25 best bonus levels of all time&quot; in 2014, likening it to players piloting &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;&#x27;s dragon character Falkor. Kotaku named the &quot;Space Harrier&quot; tribute stage from &quot;Bayonetta&quot; in their 2013 selection of &quot;the trippiest video game levels&quot;. Also in 2013, Hanuman Welch of &quot;Complex&quot; included &quot;Space Harrier&quot; among the ten Sega games he felt warranted a &quot;modern reboot&quot;, citing its &quot;kinetic pace that would be welcome on today&#x27;s systems&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Space Harrier&quot; spawned two home-system sequels in 1988. The Master System exclusive &quot;Space Harrier 3-D&quot; utilized Sega&#x27;s SegaScope 3-D glasses, and featured the same gameplay and visuals as the port of the original game while containing new stage, enemy, and boss designs. &quot;Space Harrier II&quot; was one of six launch titles for the Japanese debut of the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis), and released as such in the United States in August 1989. In December 2000, fifteen years after the original game&#x27;s debut, Sega released the loose arcade sequel &quot;Planet Harriers&quot;, which again continued the gameplay style of the franchise but featured four new selectable characters each possessing distinct weapons, in addition to five fully realized stages and a new option of purchasing weapon power-ups. However, &quot;Planet Harriers&quot; had only a minimal presence in the United States due to its faltering arcade scene, and it was never given a home release. In 2003, a remake of the original &quot;Space Harrier&quot; was developed by Tamsoft as part of the Japanese &quot;Sega Ages&quot; classic-game series (&quot;Sega Classics Collection&quot; in North America and Europe) for the PlayStation 2. The graphics are composed of polygons instead of sprites while several characters are redesigned, and a selectable option allows players to switch to a &quot;fractal mode&quot; that replaces the traditional checkerboard floors with texture-mapped playfields and includes two new underground stages. Power-ups such as bombs and lock-on targeting fly toward and are caught by the player during gameplay.

The original &quot;Space Harrier&quot; was packaged with three of Yu Suzuki&#x27;s other works—&quot;After Burner&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;, and &quot;Super Hang-On&quot;—for the 2003 Game Boy Advance release &quot;Sega Arcade Gallery&quot;. The &quot;Space Harrier Complete Collection&quot; (&quot;Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 20: Space Harrier II&quot; in Japan), developed by M2 for the PlayStation 2, followed on October 27, 2005 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, and was composed of all the official series releases &quot;to go with the various generations of our customers&quot;, according to Yosuke Okunari. Bonus content included a record-and-replay feature and an arcade promotional-material gallery, in addition to images of Hiroshi Kawaguchi&#x27;s sheet music and notes for the original game&#x27;s soundtrack. The 1991 Game Gear port is hidden therein as an Easter egg.

&quot;Space Harrier&quot; was re-released for Nintendo Switch, as part of the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; lineup.

===Other appearances===
&quot;Space Harrier&quot; has shared an unofficial connection with another Sega shooter franchise, &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot;, which debuted in Japanese arcades in March 1986. Both series are believed to be set in the same universe; &quot;Space Harrier&#x27;s&quot; opening line of dialogue at the start of gameplay (&quot;Welcome to the Fantasy Zone&quot;) has been cited as a reason, but this was dispelled by &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; director Yoji Ishii in a 2014 interview. A 1989 port of &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; for the Japan-exclusive Sharp X68000 contains a hidden stage called &quot;Dragon Land&quot; that features &quot;Space Harrier&quot; enemy characters and is accessible only by following a specific set of instructions. In 1991, NEC Avenue developed &quot;Space Fantasy Zone&quot; for the CD-ROM, featuring &quot;Fantasy Zone&#x27;s&quot; main character Opa-Opa navigating nine levels of combined gameplay elements and enemies from both franchises. Despite a December 1991 preview in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and advertising designed by artist Satoshi Urushihara, &quot;Space Fantasy Zone&quot; was never released due to a legal dispute with Sega over NEC&#x27;s unauthorized use of the &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; property. However, bootleg copies were produced after a playable beta version of the game was released on the Internet. Opa-Opa is included in &quot;Planet Harriers&quot; as a hidden character, while one of three available endings in the 2007 PlayStation 2 release &quot;Fantasy Zone II DX&quot; has Harrier and Uriah attempting to eliminate a turned-evil Opa-Opa bent on destroying the game&#x27;s eponymous Fantasy Zone.

The arcade version of &quot;Space Harrier&quot; is included in the 1999 Dreamcast action-adventure title &quot;Shenmue&quot; as a minigame, and as a full port in the 2001 sequel &quot;Shenmue II&quot;. &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot; and the 2010 action-adventure game &quot;Bayonetta&quot; feature &quot;Space Harrier&quot;-inspired minigames. The title is available as an unlockable game in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009), for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, though with sound emulation differences. In the 2012 title &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, a remixed version of the &quot;Space Harrier&quot; main theme plays during the &quot;Race of Ages&quot; stage, in which a holographic statue of Harrier and a flying dragon appear in the background. In addition, &quot;Shenmue&quot; character Ryo Hazuki pilots a flying &quot;Space Harrier&quot; sit-down arcade cabinet during airborne levels. Sega included an emulation of the original title as a minigame in several titles of their &quot;Yakuza&quot; series, such as the 2015 release &quot;Yakuza 0&quot;, and the 2018 releases &quot;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&quot;, &quot;Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise&quot; and &quot;Judgment&quot;.

===Influenced games===
The success of &quot;Space Harrier&quot; resulted in the development of other first/third-person rail shooters that attempted to emulate its three-dimensional scaling, visuals, and gameplay capabilities, causing them to be labeled &quot;&quot;Space Harrier&quot; clones&quot;. One of the most notable examples was the 1987 Square title &quot;The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner&quot; for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System, which was followed by Pony Canyon&#x27;s 1987 Famicom release &quot;Attack Animal Gakuen&quot; and other Japan-exclusive games such as Namco&#x27;s &quot;Burning Force&quot;, Asmik&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Epsilon&quot;, and Wolf Team&#x27;s &quot;Jimmu Denshō&quot;, all released in 1989. According to &quot;AllGame&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993) &quot;was influenced by early first-person 3D shooters such as&quot; &quot;Space Harrier&quot;.

According to &quot;The One&quot; magazine in 1991, Sega &quot;arguably pioneered the deluxe ground-ride cabinet cum video game with classics such as&quot; &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. Sega went on to produce &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;better&quot; motion simulator cabinets for arcade flight games such as &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987) and the R360 cabinet for &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot; (1990).

Hideki Kamiya, the director of PlatinumGames and creator of the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series, cited &quot;Space Harrier&quot; as an inspiration for his entering the video game industry in a 2014 interview: &quot;There were so many trend-setting definitive games that came out [in the 1980s], like &quot;Gradius&quot; and &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. All these game creators were trying to make original, really creative games that had never existed before&quot;.

Game composer Yuzo Koshiro was a fan of the game&#x27;s music. He said &quot;Space Harrier&quot; was the first time he had heard FM synthesis music, and the game inspired him to become a video game music composer. He considers &quot;Space Harrier&quot; composer Hiroshi Kawaguchi to be one of Sega&#x27;s best ever composers.

<text>The Battle of Glorieta Pass was fought March 26–28, 1862, in the northern New Mexico Territory, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. While not the largest battle of the New Mexico campaign, the Battle of Glorieta Pass ended the Confederacy&#x27;s efforts to capture the territory and other parts of the western United States.

The battle took place at the eponymous mountain pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in what is now Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Confederate forces sought to break the Union&#x27;s possession of the West along the base of the Rocky Mountains, with the ultimate aim of controlling strategically valuable mines, railroads, and cities throughout the region. The invasion was the westernmost military operation of the war, and the South&#x27;s only real attempt to conquer and occupy Union territory.

A skirmish occurred on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push Union forces back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules were killed or driven off. Eventually, the invading force was forced to withdraw entirely from the territory, with the Union retaking full control by June.

As the Confederacy never attempted another invasion of the region, Glorieta Pass represented the climax of the ambitious New Mexico campaign, remaining an important event in New Mexico&#x27;s Civil War history.

==New Mexico campaign==

The southern portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following secession moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862, the Confederacy established the Confederate Arizona Territory, which included the southern halves of both modern Arizona and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at Mesilla, some from El Paso and near today&#x27;s major city of Las Cruces. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the Colorado Territory and the seaports in Southern California, and thus evade the Union naval blockade.

The commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley and Union Col. Edward Canby. Sibley attempted to capture Fort Craig, completely outmaneuvering Canby at the Battle of Valverde in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby&#x27;s surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the Rio Grande Valley, occupying Santa Fe on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley&#x27;s logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at Albuquerque.

In March, Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200–300 Texans under the command of Maj. Charles L. Pyron on an advance expedition over the Glorieta Pass, a strategic location on the Santa Fe Trail at the southern tip of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains southeast of Santa Fe. Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the High Plains and make an assault on Fort Union, a Union stronghold on the route northward over Raton Pass. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.

==Opposing forces==
===Union (North)===
Union forces were led by Col. John P. Slough of the 1st Colorado Infantry, with units under the command of Maj. John M. Chivington. Canby had called up local militia and volunteer forces, as well as volunteers from Colorado. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the 1st and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments. During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments, and two artillery batteries. Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, James Hobart Ford&#x27;s independent company from the 2nd Colorado, and some New Mexico militiamen.

===Confederate===
The Confederates were led by Charles L. Pyron and William Read Scurry. From late summer to early autumn of 1861, the Confederacy raised a brigade of three volunteer mounted regiments—the 4th, 5th and 7th Texas Mounted Volunteers—along with supporting artillery and supply units. Virtually every field officer was a veteran of the Indian Wars or the Mexican-American War. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles, four companies of the 5th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons; Scurry&#x27;s force included nine companies of the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.

==Battle==
Prior to the battle, Union forces performed a forced march from Denver, over Raton Pass, to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.

===Apache Canyon===

Pyron&#x27;s force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass, and on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon, Chivington&#x27;s men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington&#x27;s men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron&#x27;s men again and punished them with enfilade fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski&#x27;s Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough&#x27;s army.

No fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry&#x27;s troops arrived at 3:00 am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits. Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300.

===Glorieta Pass===

Both Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough&#x27;s main force had engaged their front. Chivington did as ordered, and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. Instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, though, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard were left at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch, while the rest of the Confederate force—more than 1000 men—marched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.

When Slough found the Texans so far forward, he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00 am, some from Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail. The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled. Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates&#x27; numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan&#x27;s line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion, but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings. Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch, with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road, and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.
Scurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right and Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support. The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads &quot;with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.&quot; At around 3:00 pm, the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as &quot;Sharpshooters Ridge&quot;), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski&#x27;s Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.

====Johnson&#x27;s Ranch====
With the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. Manuel Chaves of the 2nd New Mexico Infantry, commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington&#x27;s force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side. They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski&#x27;s Ranch. With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. Thanks to Chaves&#x27; assistance, the Union had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the New Mexico Territory.

Parts of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield are preserved in Pecos National Historical Park and are the site of an annual NPS Civil War Encampment event commemorating the battle.

==Controversy==
Many New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson&#x27;s Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a Bureau of Indian Affairs official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked President Lincoln to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for &quot;distinguished service&quot; in the battle. On March 8, the &quot;Rio Abajo Press&quot; of Albuquerque complained about &quot;Col. Chivington&#x27;s strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis&quot; (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, &quot;Someone of the party&quot; suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after &quot;two hours persuasion.&quot; Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was &quot;viewing the scene from afar&quot;.

A more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry&#x27;s flank as he had been ordered.

==Aftermath==

In the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential, though historians have remarked that its nickname &quot;the Gettysburg of the West&quot; vastly inflates its importance and &quot;serves the novelist better than the historian.&quot; Despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory. Further, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley&#x27;s plan to obtain his key objective - the capture of the federal base at Fort Union. That may have compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.

In any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation. Furthermore, the approach of the Federal &quot;California Column&quot; eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region.

==Battlefield preservation==

In 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified. On August 5, 1990, Maj. Shropshire&#x27;s remains were reburied next to his parents in his family&#x27;s cemetery in Bourbon County, Kentucky. The remaining 30 Confederates were reinterred in the Santa Fe National Cemetery.

In 1993, the congressionally appointed Civil War Sites Advisory Commission issued its &quot;Report on the Nation&#x27;s Civil War Battlefields&quot;. The commission was tasked with identifying the nation&#x27;s historically significant Civil War sites, determining their importance and providing recommendations for their preservation to Congress.

Of the roughly 10,500 actions of the U.S. Civil War, 384 (3.7%) were identified by the commission as principal battles and rated according to their significance and threat of loss. The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating, the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as Gettysburg and Antietam. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only 10 other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.

Since 1993 portions of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield have become a unit of the National Park Service. The Glorieta Pass unit (Pigeon&#x27;s Ranch) comprises roughly 20% of the total battlefield. The remaining 80% is in private ownership. Glorieta Pass Battlefield is managed by Pecos National Historical Park and supported by the Glorieta Battlefield Coalition, a non-profit citizens&#x27; organization. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Glorieta Pass battlefield as of mid-2023.

The Glorieta Pass Battlefield is also designated as a National Historic Landmark.

==Depictions in popular culture==
The 1966 Sergio Leone film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; refers obliquely to the battle, setting one scene during the post-battle retreat of Sibley&#x27;s men.

The battle is described in the 1999 historical novel &quot;Glorieta Pass&quot; by P. G. Nagle.

The events at Johnson&#x27;s Ranch are depicted in Elmer Kelton&#x27;s 2009 novel, &quot;Many A River&quot;, with some changes to fit them to his plot.

The journey of Scurry&#x27;s Confederate and Slough&#x27;s Union forces to the battleground, as well as a detailed narrative of the fight, are described in Tom Bensing&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;Silas Soule, A Short, Eventful Life of Moral Courage&quot;.

The battle is given a full chapter in historian Megan Kate Nelson’s 2020 book &quot;The Three-Cornered War&quot;, which was a finalist for the 2021 Pulitzer Prize.

<text>Juan Prim y Prats, 1st Count of Reus, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos, 1st Viscount of Bruch (; ; 6 December 1814 – 30 December 1870) was a Spanish general and statesman who was briefly Prime Minister of Spain until his assassination.

==Biography==

Born in Reus on 6 December 1814, Prim was the son of lieutenant colonel Pablo Prim. He entered the free corps known as the &quot;tiradores de Isabel II&quot; and met his baptism of fire on 7 August 1834, during the First Carlist War, facing the Carlist party of Triaxet.

Over the course of the war, he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and had two orders of knighthood conferred upon him. After the pacification of 1839, as a progressist opposed to the dictatorship of General Espartero, he was sent into exile. However, in 1843 he was elected deputy for Tarragona, and after defeating Espartero at Bruch he entered Madrid in triumph with General Serrano. The regent Maria Christina promoted him major-general, and made him &quot;conde de Reus&quot; (Count of Reus) and &quot;vizconde del Bruch&quot; (Viscount of Bruch).

General Narváez, the prime minister, failed to understand what constitutional freedom meant, and General Prim, on showing signs of opposition, was sentenced to six years imprisonment in the Philippine Islands. The sentence was not carried out, and Prim remained an exile in England and France until the amnesty of 1847. He then returned to Spain, and was first employed as captain-general of Puerto Rico (Governor of Puerto Rico) and afterwards as military representative with the sultan during the Crimean War. In 1854 he was elected to the Cortes, and gave his support to General O&#x27;Donnell, who promoted him lieutenant-general in 1856. In the war with Morocco he did such good service at Castillejos (Fnideq), Cabo Negro, Guad al Gelu and Campamento in 1860 that he was made &quot;marqués de los Castillejos&quot; (Marquess of los Castillejos) and &quot;Grande de España&quot; (Grandee of Spain).

Prim commanded the Spanish expeditionary army in Mexico in 1862, when Spain, Great Britain, and France sought forced payment from the liberal government of Benito Juárez for loans. Prim was a sympathizer with the Mexican liberal cause, thus he refused to consent to the ambitious schemes of French emperor Napoleon III, and withdrew Spanish forces following a meeting with Manuel Doblado. Prim was a staunch supporter of the Union in the American Civil War and on his trip to the United States, where he visited New York and Philadelphia, he met with Lincoln in Washington.

On Prim&#x27;s return to Spain, he joined the opposition, heading &quot;pronunciamentos&quot; in Catalonia against generals Narváez and O&#x27;Donnell. All his attempts failed until the death of Narváez in April 1868, after which Queen Isabella became increasingly tyrannical until at last even Serrano was exiled. In September 1868 General Serrano and General Prim returned, and Brigadier Topete, commanding the fleet, raised the standard of revolt at Cádiz. In July 1869 General Serrano was elected regent, and Prim became president of the council and was made a marshal.

On 6 November 1870 Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, was elected king of Spain, but General Prim, on leaving the chamber of the Cortes on 28 December, was shot by unknown assassins and died two days later. The Cortes took his children as wards of the country; three days afterwards King Amadeo I swore in the presence of the corpse to observe the new Spanish constitution. This is due to the fact that Prim had searched all the European courts of the time trying to find a monarch who was not opposed to being democratically elected. He is quoted for saying that &quot;looking for a democratic monarch in Europe is like trying to find an atheist in heaven&quot;. After France had rejected the almost-elected Leopold of Hohenzollern because of their fear that Prussia might thereby become more powerful, Amadeo of Savoy was the most fitting who consented.

The workshop of metalworker Plácido Zuloaga was commissioned to make a monumental sarcophagus for Prim. Completed in 1875 in Eibar, this now resides in the cemetery at Reus.

<doc id="595929" wikidata="Q27135598" url="?curid=595929" title="S-Adenosyl methionine">
<text>&quot;S&quot;-Adenosyl methionine (SAM), also known under the commercial names of SAMe, SAM-e, or AdoMet, is a common cosubstrate involved in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. Although these anabolic reactions occur throughout the body, most SAM is produced and consumed in the liver. More than 40 methyl transfers from SAM are known, to various substrates such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and secondary metabolites. It is made from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM was first discovered by Giulio Cantoni in 1952.

In bacteria, SAM is bound by the SAM riboswitch, which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. In eukaryotic cells, SAM serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including DNA, tRNA, and rRNA methylation; immune response; amino acid metabolism; transsulfuration; and more. In plants, SAM is crucial to the biosynthesis of ethylene, an important plant hormone and signaling molecule.

==Structure==
&quot;S&quot;-Adenosyl methionine consists of the adenosyl group attached to the sulfur of methionine, providing it with a positive charge. It is synthesized from ATP and methionine by &quot;S&quot;-Adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme through the following reaction:

: ATP + -methionine + HO formula_1 phosphate + diphosphate + &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--methionine

The sulfonium functional group present in &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine is the center of its peculiar reactivity. Depending on the enzyme, &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine can be converted into one of three products:
*adenosyl radical, which converts to deoxyadenosine (AdO): classic rSAM reaction, also cogenerates methionine
*&quot;S&quot;-adenosyl homocysteine, releasing methyl radical
*methylthioadenosine (SMT), homoalanine radical

== Biochemistry ==

=== SAM cycle ===

The reactions that produce, consume, and regenerate SAM are called the SAM cycle. In the first step of this cycle, the SAM-dependent methylases (EC 2.1.1) that use SAM as a substrate produce &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl homocysteine as a product. &quot;S&quot;-Adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all SAM-dependent methylases despite their biological diversity. This is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine by &quot;S&quot;-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase EC 3.3.1.1 and the homocysteine recycled back to methionine through transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, by one of the two classes of methionine synthases (i.e. cobalamin-dependent (EC 2.1.1.13) or cobalamin-independent (EC 2.1.1.14)). This methionine can then be converted back to SAM, completing the cycle. In the rate-limiting step of the SAM cycle, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.

=== Radical SAM enzymes ===
A large number of enzymes cleave SAM reductively to produce radicals: 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical, methyl radical, and others. These enzymes are called radical SAMs. They all feature iron-sulfur cluster at their active sites. Most enzymes with this capability share a region of sequence homology that includes the motif CxxxCxxC or a close variant. This sequence provides three cysteinyl thiolate ligands that bind to three of the four metals in the 4Fe-4S cluster. The fourth Fe binds the SAM.

The radical intermediates generated by these enzymes perform a wide variety of unusual chemical reactions. Examples of radical SAM enzymes include spore photoproduct lyase, activases of pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic sulfatases, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and various enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis, peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, etc. Some radical SAM enzymes use a second SAM as a methyl donor. Radical SAM enzymes are much more abundant in anaerobic bacteria than in aerobic organisms. They can be found in all domains of life and are largely unexplored. A recent bioinformatics study concluded that this family of enzymes includes at least 114,000 sequences including 65 unique reactions.

Deficiencies in radical SAM enzymes have been associated with a variety of diseases including congenital heart disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and increased viral susceptibility.

=== Polyamine biosynthesis ===
Another major role of SAM is in polyamine biosynthesis. Here, SAM is decarboxylated by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) to form &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethioninamine. This compound then donates its &quot;n&quot;-propylamine group in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine from putrescine.

SAM is required for cellular growth and repair. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood, such as epinephrine. Methyltransferases are also responsible for the addition of methyl groups to the 2′ hydroxyls of the first and second nucleotides next to the 5′ cap in messenger RNA.

== Therapeutic uses ==
===Osteoarthrtitis pain===
As of 2012, the evidence was inconclusive as to whether SAM can mitigate the pain of osteoarthritis; clinical trials that had been conducted were too small from which to generalize.

===Liver disease===
The SAM cycle has been closely tied to the liver since 1947 because people with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver would accumulate large amounts of methionine in their blood. While multiple lines of evidence from laboratory tests on cells and animal models suggest that SAM might be useful to treat various liver diseases, as of 2012 SAM had not been studied in any large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that would allow an assessment of its efficacy and safety.

===Depression===
A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that for major depressive disorder, &quot;Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further.&quot;

A 2020 systematic review found that it performed significantly better than placebo, and had similar outcomes to other commonly used antidepressants (imipramine and escitalopram).

=== Anti-cancer treatment ===
SAM has recently been shown to play a role in epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is a key regulator in epigenetic modification during mammalian cell development and differentiation. In mouse models, excess levels of SAM have been implicated in erroneous methylation patterns associated with diabetic neuropathy. SAM serves as the methyl donor in cytosine methylation, which is a key epigenetic regulatory process. Because of this impact on epigenetic regulation, SAM has been tested as an anti-cancer treatment. In many cancers, proliferation is dependent on having low levels of DNA methylation. In vitro addition in such cancers has been shown to remethylate oncogene promoter sequences and decrease the production of proto-oncogenes. In cancers such as colorectal cancer, aberrant global hypermethylation can inhibit promoter regions of tumor-suppressing genes. Contrary to the former information, colorectal cancers (CRCs) are characterized by global hypomethylation and promoter-specific DNA methylation.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Oral SAM achieves peak plasma concentrations three to five hours after ingestion of an enteric-coated tablet (400–1000 mg). The half-life is about 100 minutes.

In Canada, the UK, and the United States, SAM is sold as a dietary supplement under the marketing name SAM-e (also spelled SAME or SAMe). It was introduced in the US in 1999, after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994.

It was introduced as a prescription drug in Italy in 1979, in Spain in 1985, and in Germany in 1989. As of 2012, it was sold as a prescription drug in Russia, India, China, Italy, Germany, Vietnam, and Mexico.

== Adverse effects ==
Gastrointestinal disorder, dyspepsia and anxiety can occur with SAM consumption. Long-term effects are unknown. SAM is a weak DNA-alkylating agent.

Another reported side effect of SAM is insomnia; therefore, the supplement is often taken in the morning. Other reports of mild side effects include lack of appetite, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, and anxiety/nervousness, but in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects occur at about the same incidence in the placebo groups.

===Interactions and contraindications===
Taking SAM at the same time as some drugs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially dangerous condition caused by having too much serotonin. These drugs include, but are certainly not limited to, dextromethorphan (Robitussin), meperidine (Demerol), pentazocine (Talwin), and tramadol (Ultram).

SAM can also interact with many antidepressant medications — including tryptophan and the herbal medicine &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; (St. John&#x27;s wort) — increasing the potential for serotonin syndrome or other side effects, and may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. SAM can increase the risk of manic episodes in people who have bipolar disorder.

=== Toxicity ===
A 2022 study concluded that SAMe could be toxic. Jean-Michel Fustin of Manchester University said that the researchers found that excess SAMe breaks down into adenine and methylthioadenosine in the body, both producing the paradoxical effect of inhibiting methylation. This was found in laboratory mice, causing harm to health, and in &quot;in vitro&quot; tests on human cells.

<text>The Monteiro&#x27;s hornbill (Tockus monteiri) is a species of hornbill that is native to the dry woodlands of southwestern Africa. It is a common, near-endemic species in Namibia, with a total population estimated at 340,000 individuals.

==Description==
It is a medium-sized bird, in length. With a body mass of , it appears to be the largest hornbill of the relatively diminutive &quot;Tockus&quot; genus. The species is characterized by a white belly, black back, with white spots on the wings and white secondary flight feathers. The outer feathers of the long tail are also white. Females are smaller than males and can be recognized by their turquoise facial skin. The eyes are black and the beak is red.

==Range and habitat==
Its habitat is the savannah and dry thornveldt of northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola.

==Habits==
Unlike other hornbills, which are omnivorous, the Monteiro&#x27;s hornbill feeds exclusively on insects and other small arthropods. In springtime, Monteiro&#x27;s hornbills migrate to the southern Windhoek region to nest. They are adapted to the arid environment, and drinking is not a vital necessity for them. They breed at the end of a good rainy season, laying 3 to 5 greyish-white eggs, which hatch after about 45 days. The nest is built on rock faces or in trees.

<text>Bradfield&#x27;s hornbill (Lophoceros bradfieldi) is an African hornbill. It is a medium-sized bird, in length, characterized by black back and wings and a white belly. The tip feathers of the long tail are white. Females are smaller than males and can be recognized by turquoise facial skin. The eyes are yellow and the beak is red. The beak is long and presents no casque.

This is an uncommon resident of the mopane woodlands and mixed thorn fields of northeastern Namibia (especially on the Waterberg plateau), northern Botswana, southern Angola and eastern Zimbabwe. They feed on fruits, large insects, nuts and small reptiles.

The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the South African naturalist R. D. Bradfield (1882-1949).

<text>Masters of the Universe (sometimes referred to as the He-Man or She-Ra series) is a sword and planet-themed media franchise created by Mattel. The main premise revolves around the conflict between He-Man (the alter ego of Prince Adam) and Skeletor on the planet Eternia, with a vast lineup of supporting characters in a hybrid setting of medieval sword and sorcery, and sci-fi technology. A follow-up series, &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; revolves around He-Man&#x27;s sister She-Ra and her rebellion against The Horde on the planet Etheria. Since its initial launch, the franchise has spawned a variety of products, including multiple lines of action figures, six animated television series, several comic series, video games, books and magazines, a daily newspaper comic strip, and two feature films (one animated, one live action).

==Series overview and main characters==
He-Man and the accompanying Masters of the Universe franchise would make their debut in 1982 with Mattel&#x27;s release of the original &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; 5.5-inch action-figure toy line. Masters of the Universe, often abbreviated as MOTU, would begin its mythos through the minicomics that accompanied the toys throughout the 1980s. These initial mini comics were soon followed by several children&#x27;s books and issues of DC Comics. However, the Masters of the Universe franchise would become best known through Filmation&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; animated series. Debuting in the fall of 1983, the Filmation series ran 130 episodes over two seasons until November 1985.

Since its inception, Masters of the Universe has usually placed its focus on the two primary characters, the blond muscular He-Man, &quot;the most powerful man in the Universe,&quot; and his nemesis, the evil skull-faced, blue-skinned sorcerer Skeletor and their many moral-themed encounters on the planet Eternia. Set in a hybrid world of sword and sorcery and technological sci-fi, He-Man battles with Skeletor to prevent him from conquering Eternia and discovering the secrets of Castle Grayskull—a mysterious ancient fortress with a skull-shaped facade, containing great power and magic. As with many toy franchises that have been transferred to several different media, there are a number of story differences between the various versions of Masters of the Universe. In most continuities from the Filmation series onward, He-Man is the secret identity of Prince Adam, the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena, the ruling royal family of Eternia. Adam becomes He-Man by holding aloft his magic Power Sword and uttering the words &quot;By the power of Grayskull…&quot; and serves as the protector of good on Eternia. He is first given this ability by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, a powerful magic user and mystic guardian of the castle, who in many depictions is able to transform herself into the falcon Zoar. Upon Adam&#x27;s transformation into He-Man, his cowardly green pet tiger Cringer becomes the mighty Battle Cat, a giant armored feline that He-Man often rides into battle.

He-Man&#x27;s most prominent allies include Man-At-Arms, a wise loyal veteran soldier and inventor; and his adopted daughter Teela, a spirited and skillful female warrior, often portrayed as captain of the Eternian Royal Guard and a potential love interest of He-Man/Prince Adam. The childlike Trollan magician Orko also often features as one of He-Man&#x27;s closest allies; as does Stratos, a flying bird-man from the kingdom of Avion; Ram-Man, a stout dimwitted warrior with springlike legs and a large helmet that encloses his head and upper torso; and Man-E-Faces, an actor with face-changing abilities.

Skeletor is originally described as an evil being from another dimension and in some later MOTU lore as a disfigured and vengeful relative of the royal family, known as Keldor. From his lair on Snake Mountain, Skeletor would assemble his &quot;Evil Warriors&quot; to assist in his various schemes to conquer Eternia. These core minions usually include Beast Man, an orange-furred, apelike master of beasts; Mer-Man, an aquatic fishlike ocean warlord; Evil-Lyn, a powerful sorceress and one of Skeletor&#x27;s most feared and competent associates; Trap Jaw, an iron-jawed criminal with a mechanical arm that can be fitted by a various assortment of weapons; and Tri-Klops, a mercenary swordsman with a rotating three-eyed visor.

The series overall would feature a wide and ever-expanding cast of heroic and villainous characters added to the toy line, the Filmation cartoon, and other media; with the franchise far outshining prior expectations, continuing to grow through 1983 and 1984. The release of the animated cartoon movie &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot; in the spring of 1985 introduced He-Man&#x27;s twin sister She-Ra (with her secret alter ego Princess Adora) and the arch-villain Hordak (leader of the Evil Horde and the former master of Skeletor) on the planet Etheria. Stemming from the animated movie, Filmation went on to produce 93 episodes of the series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, which ran until the end of 1987, along with the &quot;He-Man &amp; She-Ra: Christmas Special.&quot; Other main characters of the She-Ra series would include Swift Wind, winged unicorn and alter ego of She-Ra&#x27;s trusty steed Spirit; Light Hope, mystical living beam of light and mentor to She-Ra; and her Great Rebellion allies Glimmer, magically inclined onetime leader of the rebellion; Bow, skilled archer and the main male protagonist of the series; Kowl, Bow&#x27;s owllike, rainbow-eared companion; Madame Razz, absent-minded witch with her sarcastic sentient Broom; and Queen Angella, Glimmer&#x27;s mother and angel-winged queen of the Bright Moon; along with Hordak&#x27;s spell-casting witch Shadow Weaver; shape-shifting spy Imp; bumbling bug-eyed henchman Mantenna; Force Squad captain Catra; evil scientist Modulok; beastly warrior Grizzlor; energy-draining Leech; and thuggish henchwoman Scorpia.

Various children&#x27;s books, magazines, comics, read-along records/cassette tapes, and other merchandise were also released worldwide around this time, with much of the content based primarily on the Filmation He-Man and She-Ra series. The live-action film &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; was released in 1987 by Cannon Films, starring Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella. The later 1980s mini comics, Marvel comics series, and UK magazine comics continued the adventures of He-Man and She-Ra past the end of the two Filmation series. However, popularity had waned by the end of 1987 and a planned continuation of the original toy line under the heading of &quot;The Powers of Grayskull&quot; (set in ancient Eternia, featuring the villain King Hiss and He-Man&#x27;s ancestor He-Ro) was started, but eventually scrapped.

He-Man would be brought back in 1989 in an entirely new and space-based cartoon series and toy line known as &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man.&quot; Only He-Man and Skeletor would return as major characters to join the battle between Galactic Guardians and Space Mutants on the planet Primus. Jetlag Productions would go on to produce 65 episodes of the New Adventures cartoon, with a few mini comics and adventure magazines also created for this new series. Ultimately, though, the series would not be as successful and the entire franchise would go on a hiatus for more than a decade.

After some success with a &quot;Commemorative Series&quot; rerelease of the classic action figures in 2000, Mattel relaunched the toy line with all-new action figures, playsets, and vehicles, sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios in 2002. As part of the relaunch, a modern updated animated series was also created by Mike Young Productions, lasting for 39 episodes; featuring He-Man and his ensemble of heroic warriors, now called the &quot;Masters of the Universe,&quot; battling Skeletor&#x27;s minions and, later, King Hiss, the ancient and evil lord of the Snake Men. Characters such as Mekaneck, heroic warrior with a mechanical extending neck; Buzz-Off, heroic beelike flying Andreenid warrior; Clawful, large villainous crab-like henchman; Whiplash, evil reptilian Caligar with a deadly tail; Stinkor, foul-smelling mutated Paleezean; and many others would gain more prominent backstories during this series. Several volumes of comic books were also produced to go along with the series by Image Comics and MVCreations. Although popular with longtime fans and collectors (with mini-statue figures being released by NECA until 2007), the new series failed to catch on with a larger audience and was canceled in 2004.

From 2008 to 2020, a new assortment of Masters of the Universe action figures has been released under the banner of &quot;Masters of the Universe Classics.&quot; Primarily geared toward the collector&#x27;s market, the series made up an entirely new story in &quot;Classics bios&quot; and used various elements from previous Masters of the Universe lore, many times changing those elements to suit the new story, with characters from all previous incarnations (and also featured a continuation of the original mini comics line). DC Comics would soon follow suit and relaunch a new grittier, contemporary version of the Masters of the Universe franchise, releasing various new comic book series from 2012 until 2020; featuring crossovers with the DC Comics Universe, ThunderCats, and a new origin for She-Ra, culminating in Hordak&#x27;s conquest of Eternia.

In 2020, Mattel released a new line of 5.5&quot; scale action figures, vehicles and playsets under the Masters of the Universe Origins line.

Netflix and DreamWorks released an animated series entitled &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; in 2018, which released five seasons until 2020. This was followed in 2021 by Masters of the Universe Revelation, a new Netflix animated series produced by Kevin Smith.

==History and versions of the franchise==

===Origin of the franchise===
Mattel began development of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe in the late 1970s with &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;–inspired concepts from Roger Sweet, Mark Taylor, Donald F. Glut, and several other contributors. The catalyst for the creation of He-Man began in 1976, when Mattel&#x27;s CEO Ray Wagner declined a request to produce a toy line of action figures based on the characters from the George Lucas film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with the film&#x27;s toy rights being acquired by Kenner instead. Upon the commercial success of the film trilogy and all related merchandise during the next few years, Mattel attempted to launch several unsuccessful toy lines, none of which captured the public&#x27;s imagination or made a significant dent in the toy market.

In the race to design the next hit action figure, Roger Sweet, a lead designer working for Mattel&#x27;s Preliminary Design Department throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, according to his book &quot;Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea&quot;, was the first to conceptualize the idea of He-Man. However, this is not officially acknowledged by Mattel, and authorship of the He-Man character has been subject to debate. According to various former Mattel designers, Roger Sweet drew inspiration for the designs of his first He-Man prototypes from fantasy drawings of Mattel packaging designer Mark Taylor, which included a drawing of a He-Man-like character called Torak.

Roger Sweet presented the He-Man concept to Ray Wagner at the Mattel Product Conference, in the form of three large three-dimensional plaster prototype models, which Sweet dubbed the &quot;He-Man Trio.&quot; These prototypes were molded from extensively modified Big Jim action figures (Battle Cat would also be adapted from a tiger in the Big Jim toy line). The He-Man Trio models were an axe-wielding barbarian, a tank-headed soldier, and a spaceman with a Boba Fett–like helmet. Out of the three concepts, the barbarian version of He-Man was chosen to be the basis of the toy line (this original trio-prototype idea was released around 30 years later as the figure Vykron, and the barbarian concept on its own as Vikor, in the &quot;Masters of the Universe Classics&quot; line).
&quot;The only way I was going to have a chance to sell this [to Wagner] was to make three 3D models—big ones. I glued a Big Jim figure [from another Mattel toy line] into a battle action pose and I added a lot of clay to his body. I then had plaster casts made. These three prototypes, which I presented in late 1980, brought He-Man into existence. I simply explained that this was a powerful figure that could be taken anywhere and dropped into any context because he had a generic name: He-Man!&quot;

—Roger Sweet
Originally set under the working title &quot;Lords of Power,&quot; the name &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; came into being when it was suggested that the former name of the toy line was too religious in nature. The roster of characters would soon expand past the main hero, He-Man, and Mark Taylor would draw inspiration for the series main villain, Skeletor, from his 1971 sketch entitled The King of Styx, along with early renderings of his characters Demo-Man and D-Man. Taylor would create preliminary designs for several other original characters as well, with additional ideas or direction from Mark Ellis and Paul Cleveland, among others, but the premise behind the toy line had not yet been fully established. The backstory of He-Man was first conceptualized for special mini-comic books that Mattel marketing director Mark Ellis promised distributors would accompany the toys. Mattel had DC Comics mock up a comic book, with the earliest storybooks written by Donald F. Glut. With major distributor Toys &quot;R&quot; Us concerned that &quot;five-year-olds don&#x27;t read&quot;, Mark Ellis then first proposed the idea of an animated TV special. This would eventually lead to a meeting with Filmation head Lou Scheimer and the creation of the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; animated series.

Earlier in 1980, the rights-holders of Conan the Barbarian had been negotiating the character&#x27;s toy rights with Mattel and they entered into an agreement the following year regarding characters from the 1982 Conan movie. However, with Mattel introducing the Masters of the Universe toy line in 1982, the rights-holders sued Mattel claiming the character was an infringement on the character of Conan. Mattel eventually won the lawsuit and after legal agreements were dissolved, it was stated that the toy line was never intended for the Conan film. However, some Conan influence can be seen, as Roger Sweet has claimed to have drawn some inspiration from the paintings of Frank Frazetta, a fantasy artist with many works depicting Conan the Barbarian, when creating He-Man.

===Early action figures and comics===

====Original action figures and mini comics (1981–1982)====
The &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toy line was created by Mattel in 1981, and first released to stores in 1982 as 5½-inch action figures (as opposed to the 3¾-inch size used by Kenner&#x27;s Star Wars and Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero lines). The two main characters, He-Man (&quot;the most powerful man in the universe&quot;) and his arch-enemy Skeletor (&quot;evil lord of destruction&quot;) were the first released in action figure form, along with other core characters of the series: Man-At-Arms (&quot;heroic master of weapons&quot;), Beast Man (&quot;Skeletor&#x27;s savage henchman&quot;), and Battle Cat (&quot;He-Man&#x27;s fighting tiger&quot;).

Later on that year, the first wave of action figures in 1982 would also include Teela (&quot;heroic warrior goddess&quot;), Mer-Man (&quot;evil ocean warlord&quot;), Stratos (&quot;heroic winged warrior&quot;), and Zodac (&quot;the cosmic enforcer&quot;). The Teela action figure was originally proposed as representing both the Sorceress character (when wearing the figure&#x27;s &quot;snake armor&quot;) and the Teela character (when without the &quot;snake armor&quot;), as Mattel believed there would not be enough demand for two female action figures in the initial wave. Alongside the first wave of figures were the Battle Ram (&quot;mobile launcher&quot;) and Wind Raider (&quot;assault lander&quot;) vehicles and the playset Castle Grayskull (&quot;fortress of power and mystery&quot;). These first figures as well as Castle Grayskull were primarily designed by Mark Taylor, although the final production sculpt of the original He-Man action figure was completed by Tony Guerrero and the first vehicles were designed by Ted Mayer.

Brief descriptions of the characters would appear on the packaging and box art (with illustrations by Errol McCarthy, Rudy Obrero, William Garland, William George, and others). However, the lore of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; would be first fully explored through the mini-comics that accompanied the action figures throughout the duration of the line (with 49 distinct comics being issued from 1981 until 1987). The original four mini comics, &quot;He-Man and the Power Sword&quot;, &quot;The King of Castle Grayskull&quot;, &quot;Battle in the Clouds&quot;, and &quot;The Vengeance of Skeletor&quot; were made by Mattel in 1981 and written by Donald F. Glut, with artwork by Alfredo Alcala. He-Man is introduced in the first mini comic, &quot;He-man and the Power Sword&quot;, as a wandering barbarian, leaving behind his jungle tribe on Eternia. The world of Eternia is initially depicted as dealing with the aftermath of a great war that has devastated once-powerful civilizations, leaving behind their fantastical machinery and weapons. The events of the war have also opened a rift between dimensions, which has allowed the evil warlord Skeletor to travel into Eternia. This inaugural incarnation of Skeletor sets his sights on obtaining both halves of the Power Sword (originally split in two in these early stories), in order to gain entry into the ancient Castle Grayskull (depicted, in these early comics, as being inhabited by the ghostly &quot;Spirit of Castle Grayskull&quot;). The main premise being that whoever attains control of Castle Grayskull will gain the power to become Master of the Universe. To combat Skeletor, He-Man is given special powers, armor, and weapons by the Sorceress (she has green skin in her debut appearance and is wearing the &quot;snake armor&quot; that came with the original Teela action figure, instead of adorning her more familiar birdlike attire, as seen in the Filmation series). He-Man (not yet with the dual identity of Prince Adam) is supported in these initial stories by his heroic allies: Battle Cat (without the dual form of Cringer), Man-At-Arms, Teela, and Stratos, the winged warrior (who erroneously came fighting on the side of Skeletor in the initial mini-comic). Skeletor, in turn, enlists the help of the brutish apelike Beast Man and fishlike Mer-Man to battle He-Man or his heroic warriors.

====Second wave of action figures and mini comics (1983)====
Other major characters introduced the following year in these early waves of action figures included He-Man&#x27;s allies Ram Man (&quot;heroic human battering ram&quot;; with spring-loaded legs), Man-E-Faces (&quot;heroic human…robot…monster&quot;; with three alternate faces), and Zoar (&quot;the fighting falcon&quot;; whose sculpt was taken from the &quot;Big Jim&quot; toy line&#x27;s &quot;Eagle of Danger Peak&quot;); along with Skeletor&#x27;s evil warriors Tri-Klops (described on his packaging as &quot;evil and sees everything&quot;; with a three-eyed rotating visor), Trap Jaw (&quot;evil and armed for combat&quot;; with alternate weapons to place in his arm socket), Panthor (Skeletor&#x27;s &quot;savage cat&quot;; a fuzzy purple adaptation of Battle Cat&#x27;s toy mold), Screeech (Skeletor&#x27;s &quot;barbarian bird&quot;; a purple recast of the orange Zoar), Faker (&quot;evil robot of Skeletor&quot;; a blue-skinned clone of He-Man, seldom featured in MOTU media, without an introductory mini-comic during his initial release), and Evil-Lyn (&quot;evil warrior goddess&quot;; the last figure released in this wave, she would not yet feature in any MOTU media until her prominent role in the Filmation animated series). The Attak-Trak vehicle and the Point Dread &amp; Talon Fighter playset were also released in the 1983 line.

This second series, consisting of seven new mini-comics and released in 1982–83, was produced by DC Comics, written by Gary Cohn and featured artwork by Mark Texeira. These mini-comics would devote several issues toward introducing the new action figure characters into the line. Cohn did not continue the same canon as was set in the first four minicomics. He-Man&#x27;s new ally Ram Man is initially tricked into fighting on the side of Skeletor in &quot;He-Man Meets Ram-Man&quot;. Man-E-Faces is introduced in &quot;The Ordeal of Man-E-faces&quot; as an Eternian actor turned into a monster by Skeletor, freed by the Sorceress, only to be magically possessed by three multiple personalities: man, monster, and robot. Skeletor&#x27;s evil warriors also get their own introductory mini comics, with Tri-Klops as a skilled swordsman/mercenary in &quot;The Terror of Tri-Klops&quot; and Trap Jaw portrayed in &quot;The Menace of Trap Jaw&quot; as a criminal from another dimension. In these pre-Filmation stories, the primary characters of Prince Adam, Cringer, Orko, and Evil-Lyn did not yet feature in the series; although the Eternian Palace and Royal Court with King Randor and Queen Marlena (both yet unnamed, looking decidedly older than in the later series) are featured in several of these DC mini-comics, as are the mystical falcon Zoar (not yet an alternate form of the Sorceress) and the Attak-Trak (battle machine, based on the toy, and not yet a robotic-voiced van-like vehicle, as in the Filmation cartoon). The storyline concept of Teela as the secret daughter of the Sorceress (albeit as a clone) and adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms was first introduced at this time as well in the mini comic &quot;The Tale of Teela&quot;. A special comic and record entitled &quot;The Power of Point Dread/Danger at Castle Grayskull&quot; was also produced for the Talon Fighter and Point Dread playset.

Additional waves of action figures, creatures, vehicles, and playsets were released every year until 1987, totaling 70 distinct figures in all (including 24 creatures, 12 vehicles, six playsets, and 10 accessories) with the final overseas releases from the original line coming from Italy in 1988. A major proponent of the 1980s action-figure boom, &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; figures proved to be very popular and were produced and marketed all over the world. Most of action figures were made in Taiwan and Malaysia. However, Mattel also had production facilities in the United States, Mexico, France, Spain, and joint ventures with Leo Toys of India, Top Toys of Argentina, Estrela of Brazil, Rotoplast of Venezuela and Takara of Japan.

====DC Comics – 1980s series (1982–1983)====
In July 1982, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe would appear for the first time in the pages of DC Comics with &quot;DC Comics Presents Issue #47&quot;, in the story &quot;From Eternia With Death&quot;, followed by a special insert comic in many DC&#x27;s titles from November 1982, entitled &quot;Fate is the Killer&quot;. In these first two DC MOTU stories, Superman ends up on Eternia, joining with He-Man to combat Skeletor and his minions. He-Man&#x27;s original DC comic run finished up with a three-issue miniseries at the start of 1983 (all written by Paul Kupperberg, with artwork by Curt Swan and George Tuska). These issues would introduce the Eternian Royal Family, most notably Prince Adam (DC Comics Presents #47), and his transformation into He-Man in the series. This version of Adam, however, was originally depicted wearing a blue vest and portrayed as somewhat of a philanderer, rather than his later more wholesome pink-vest-wearing character. Also unique to these issues, Adam transforms inside the &quot;Cavern of Power,&quot; instead of his more famous &quot;By the power of Grayskull!&quot; line. The Sorceress, now residing in the Cavern of Power, is still depicted wearing the Teela Snake Armor, and is often referred to as &quot;The Goddess&quot; throughout the series. Other entries into the Masters of the Universe mythos, such as Cringer as the alter ego of Battle Cat, Zodac as a neutral cosmic enforcer, Stratos as leader of his home world of Avion, and Adam&#x27;s mother, Queen Marlena, as an astronaut hailing from Earth, were all partly introduced in these early DC issues.

===Filmation animated series era===

====&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; – Filmation animated series (1983–1984)====
In 1983, Masters of the Universe would debut perhaps its most famous incarnation, with the animated series &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;. Created by Filmation under the direction of executive producer Lou Scheimer, the cartoon made its television debut on September 5, 1983, with the episode &quot;The Diamond Ray of Disappearance&quot;. Running through two seasons, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; was one of the first animated series produced directly for weekday syndication, as opposed to reruns primarily based on Saturday mornings. Totaling 130 episodes, with each season of 65 episodes stretching across 13 weeks, the series last episode, &quot;The Cold Zone,&quot; on November 21, 1985.

Similar to the comics that came before, the series is set on Eternia, which is ruled by King Randor and Queen Marlena (visibly younger in age and with more colorful attire than their previous comic versions). Their son, Prince Adam (now wearing his more familiar pink vest), pretends to be somewhat lazy, clumsy, and irresponsible, much like his pet tiger Cringer (depicted in the series as being very cowardly and with the ability to speak). For the first time, Prince Adam is shown to transform into He-Man by holding aloft his magic sword and saying the magic words, &quot;By the power of Grayskull…&quot;I have the power!!!&quot;&quot; It is revealed in the introduction that Prince Adam&#x27;s secret identity of He-Man is known only by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull (now with the familiar birdlike costume, who often takes the form of Zoar the falcon), Man-At-Arms (now sporting a mustache and often referred to by his first name Duncan; he is portrayed as scientific inventor as well as a warrior), and Orko (making his full debut as a mainstay in the franchise, Orko is presented as a floating childlike Trollan magician, often used for comic relief and as a point-of-view character for children). Rounding out the main cast of heroes is Teela (now firmly depicted with red hair, she is the Captain of the Royal Guard, the adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms, and secret child of the Sorceress; who serves as a teasing and semi-antagonistic love interest of Adam and He-Man throughout the series). Also featuring in the series with semi-regularity are Stratos (the flying leader of the bird people of Avion) and Ram-Man (portrayed as a dim-witted but likable bouncing warrior). Appearing with much less frequency in the series are He-Man&#x27;s recurring allies Zodac (less neutral and more of an omniscient cosmic peacekeeper, often assisting He-Man), Man-E-Faces (presented this time as a master of disguise, an actor who occasionally employs his abilities to help He-Man), Buzz-Off (leader of a race of bee people), Fisto (debuts as powerful loner and adversary of He-Man before joining forces), Mekaneck (loyal warrior with a bionic neck, searching for his lost son), Roboto (robotic alien explorer marooned on Eternia), Sy-Klone (spinning tornado-like warrior, who appears without a backstory), Moss Man (transforming plant being and spy), and several characters that would not receive action-figure releases in the original line such as Lizard-Man, the Royal Archeologist Melaktha, Trollans Dree-Elle and Montork, Avion bird people Delora and Hawke, Adam&#x27;s grandfather King Miro, Squinch and the Widgets, and the wise and ancient dragon Granamyr.

He-Man&#x27;s nemesis, the evil wizard Skeletor (now famously portrayed by voice actor Alan Oppenheimer as a cackling and more comedic villain), still wishes to conquer Castle Grayskull and learn of its secrets, but also now desires to take over the royal palace and rule Eternia; often seeking ancient and mysterious beasts and artifacts to try and stop He-Man and his allies. Skeletor often hosts his rogues gallery inside his headquarters, Snake Mountain, gathered around his bone-filled throne, plotting and peering through a magic orb to spy on He-Man and his friends. Often this group of evil minions consists of the cunning female sorcerer Evil-Lyn (making her full debut into the MOTU mythos as Skeletor&#x27;s most dangerous counterpart in the Filmation series) and his most frequent sidekicks: the bumbling Beast Man (who possesses the ability to control various creatures through telepathy) and the equally inept weapon-armed Trap Jaw. Skeletor&#x27;s original henchmen in the cartoon also include Mer-Man (with a distinctive gurgling voice portrayal, also by Alan Oppenheimer), Tri-Klops (with a more robotic voice and persona), and Skeletor&#x27;s purple pet feline Panthor. Other henchmen making a few appearances later in the series are Webstor (one of Skeletor&#x27;s more intelligent henchmen, often paired with Kobra Khan), Kobra Khan (menacing Repton able to spray sleeping gas from his cobra hood), Two-Bad (bumbling henchman with two often arguing heads), Spikor (depicted as possibly Skeletor&#x27;s most dimwitted minion in all of the Filmation series), Modulok (deranged and mutated scientist, once known as Galen Nycroft), Clawful (a far more cunning villain in this version than other representations of the character), and Whiplash (appearing the most out of the later henchmen). Some of Skeletor&#x27;s rogues would appear only once in the Filmation cartoon, such as Faker (appearing only briefly as a magical clone of He-Man before being tossed into the bottomless abyss outside Castle Grayskull), Jitsu (called &quot;Chopper&quot; in the script), Batros, Icer, Fang-Man, Dragoon, and Strong-Arm. Other villains not allied with Skeletor would occasionally appear as well, such as the powerful wizard Count Marzo, the plant-demon Evilseed, Kothos, Shokoti, Negator, and the rabbitlike space pirate Plundor, to name a few.

Despite the limited animation techniques that were used to produce the series, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; was notable for breaking the boundaries of censorship that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children&#x27;s TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time, a cartoon series could feature a muscular superhero who engage in on-screen combat (although most of the time wrestling-style moves were utilized instead of direct violence). The cartoon was also groundbreaking in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys, as advertising directly to children was controversial during this period. As an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by these controversies, a &quot;life lesson&quot; or &quot;moral of the story&quot; was played at the end of each episode, which was usually tied to the action or central theme of the episode in question (although in the United Kingdom, the closing &quot;morals&quot; were often edited out of the original broadcasts).

The series featured the voice talents of John Erwin, who starred as He-Man/Prince Adam, Beast Man, Ram Man, Webstor, Whiplash, and many others; the aforementioned Alan Oppenheimer, voicing Skeletor, Man-At-Arms, Battle Cat/Cringer, Mer-Man, Buzz-Off, and many others; Linda Gary as much of the female cast with Teela, the Sorceress, Evil-Lyn, and Queen Marlena; and executive producer Lou Scheimer providing the voice work for a multitude of other characters such as Orko, King Randor, Stratos, Trap Jaw, Tri-Klops, Man-E-Faces, Mekaneck, Fitso, Clawful, Kobra Khan, Spikor, and Two Bad, to name a few. The series was often produced by Lou Scheimer and Hal Sutherland and directed by Gwen Wetzler, Marsh Lamore, Lou Kachivas, Steve Clark, Ernie Schmidt, Ed Friedman, and others; with Tom Sito serving as a main storyboard artist, along with Tom Tataranowicz, Warren Greenwood, Robert Lamb, Don Manuel, Bob Arkwright, and many other contributors. Writers on the show included Larry DiTillio, David Wise, Robby London, Michael Reaves, Doug Booth, J. Brynne Stephens, and many others, including early script-writing work from &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski, Paul Dini of &quot;&quot; fame, and one episode, &quot;Battle Cat,&quot; by D. C. Fontana of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame.

The series, although still popular, would not be renewed for a third season in 1985. However, the characters would make occasional guest appearances in the &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power Series&quot;, which was set in the same universe and followed the same continuity. The She-Ra series began with a 5-part animated serial which was later condensed into the animated movie &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot;, released theatrically in the spring of 1985 and featuring most of the main characters from both cartoons. The characters would continue to appear in guest roles throughout the She-Ra series, as well as a Christmas Special. The very last appearance of Filmation&#x27;s He-Man and Skeletor is in one of the final She-Ra episodes, entitled &quot;Assault on the Hive,&quot; airing December 13, 1986.

====Filmation-era MOTU action figures and mini comics (1984–1985)====
Sales of the toy line continued to increase with the exposure of the animated series, and new waves of figures and vehicles were produced during this peak of popularity. First introduced into the action figure line in 1984 were new &quot;Battle Armor&quot; versions of He-Man and Skeletor, who could be &quot;battle damaged&quot; when the mechanism on the figure&#x27;s chest was pressed. These new renditions of He-Man and Skeletor did not appear in the animated series or the mini comics, but several new characters in the Filmation series found releases in these third and fourth waves of action figures. Making their toy-line debuts in 1984 were He-Man&#x27;s allies Buzz-Off (&quot;heroic spy in the sky&quot;; beelike insectoid warrior with wings), Fisto (&quot;heroic hand-to-hand fighter&quot;; bearded warrior with a large smashing fist as an action feature), and Mekaneck (&quot;heroic human periscope&quot;; featuring an extending bionic neck). The first action figures for Prince Adam (&quot;heroic secret identity of He-Man&quot;) and Orko (&quot;heroic court magician&quot;; utilizing a pull-cord feature that sent the figure spinning around when placed on a flat surface) were also produced in this third wave. Skeletor&#x27;s evil warriors received new recruits as well, with Clawful (&quot;warrior with the grip of evil&quot;; crab-like creature with an oversize pincer for a hand), Jitsu (&quot;evil master of martial arts&quot;; human warrior with a gold chopping hand action feature), Kobra Khan (&quot;evil master of snakes&quot;; reptilian warrior able to be filled with water to spray &quot;poison&quot; mist on his enemies), Webstor (&quot;evil master of escape&quot;; spider-faced warrior with a working grappling hook/backpack pulley system), and Whiplash (&quot;evil tail-thrashing warrior&quot;; reptilian with a rubber tail) all added to the line in 1984. Vehicles produced in 1984 include the Dragon Walker (&quot;sidewinding beast/vehicle&quot;), Road Ripper (&quot;warrior carrier,&quot; with a fast-action pull cord), Roton (&quot;evil assault vehicle,&quot; with a round rotating outer disc), and Stridor (&quot;heroic armored war horse,&quot; often paired with Fisto). The major playset that year was Skeletor&#x27;s evil stronghold, Snake Mountain (looking quite unlike the Filmation version, with a giant ghoulish face molded into the plastic and a voice-distorting wolf-headed microphone).

Series three of Mattel&#x27;s MOTU mini comics contained stories similar to the Filmation animated series, with mini comics such as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gift&quot;, &quot;Masks of Power&quot;, and &quot;Double-Edge Sword&quot; adapting stories straight from the first-season episodes of the same name. There were some differences from Filmation, however, as can be seen in &quot;The Temple of Darkness&quot; mini comic with the Sorceress, now in her birdlike Filmation attire, but in an all-white version of the costume. The mini comics &quot;He-Man and the Insect People&quot; and &quot;The Clash of Arms&quot; included many of the new characters from the toy line such as Buzz-Off, Mekaneck, Fisto, Stridor, Webstor, Clawful, and Whiplash; while others such as &quot;The Secret Liquid of Life&quot;, &quot;Slave City&quot;, and &quot;The Siege of Avion&quot; had less to do with the toy line and introduced new original mini-comic characters instead, such as He-Man&#x27;s childhood friend Prince Dakon, the evil Geldor, the Kobold master Lodar, and Haramesh the demon.

The 1985 wave of action figures again included new versions of He-Man and Skeletor with special action features: Thunder-Punch He-Man (whose backpack could be loaded with plastic ring caps to create a loud &quot;bang&quot; when turning He-Man&#x27;s waist) and Dragon Blaster Skeletor (which included a small water-squirting dragon chained to Skeletor&#x27;s armor). Heroic warriors included in the line were Moss Man (&quot;heroic spy and master of camouflage&quot;; a fuzzy pine-scented retooling of the Beast-Man mold), Roboto (&quot;heroic mechanical warrior&quot;; featuring moving gears and multiple weapons that could be inserted into his arm socket), and Sy-Klone (&quot;heroic fist-flinging tornado&quot;; with a dial on his waist allowing his torso to be spun around continuously). Evil warriors in 1985 consisted of Spikor (&quot;untouchable master of evil combat&quot;; covered in purple rubber spikes with a trident for an arm), Two Bad (&quot;double-headed evil strategist&quot;; whose spring-action arms allowed the figure to punch himself in either face), and Stinkor (&quot;evil master of odors&quot;; a foul-smelling reworking of the Mer-Man mold and the only character from the 1985 line that would not make an appearance in the Filmation cartoon). Vehicles produced in this fourth wave were Bashasaurus (&quot;heroic combat vehicle&quot;; with a large bashing club arm), Battle Bones (&quot;collector&#x27;s carry case&quot; and dinosaur skeleton brought to life in the mini comics), Land Shark (&quot;evil monster/vehicle&quot;; Skeletor&#x27;s tank with a purple chomping shark mouth), Night Stalker (&quot;evil armored battle steed&quot;; a recolored Stridor toy, often associated with Jitsu), and Spydor (&quot;evil stalker&quot;; Skeletor&#x27;s giant mechanical spider).

The largest addition to the 1985 Masters of the Universe toy line came in the form of the Evil Horde, whose characters were set to debut in the animated &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot; motion picture. Although villains in the soon-to-debut &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; animated series, five out of the six initial Evil Horde action figures were produced for the Masters of Universe line instead of the Princess of Power toy line (with the Horde villainess Catra being the sole exception). The new main villain Hordak (&quot;ruthless leader of the Evil Horde&quot;) was followed in action-figure form by his underlings, Mantenna (&quot;evil spy with the pop-out eyes&quot;), Leech (&quot;evil master of power suction&quot;, with suction-cup hands and mouth), Grizzlor (&quot;hairy henchman of the Evil Horde&quot;, with actual imitation fur), and Modulok (&quot;evil beast with a thousand bodies&quot;; a unique figure with 22 segmented body parts that could be taken apart and reassembled into more than 1,000 different combinations). Hordak&#x27;s lair, the Fright Zone, was also released as a playset in 1985, although it bore no resemblance at all to the mechanical-/industrial-looking Fright Zone seen in the animated She-Ra series.

Series four of the mini comics in 1985 began to depart from some aspects of Filmation&#x27;s continuity, as each member of the Evil Horde appeared in their own titular mini comic, focusing more on their attempts to attack He-Man and invade Eternia rather than anything She-Ra/Princess of Power–related. Likewise, Skeletor&#x27;s dragon-blaster and He-Man&#x27;s thunder-punch powers were never seen in the animated series, but debut here in the mini comics &quot;Skeletor&#x27;s Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Treachery of Modulok&quot;. Roboto also received an alternate origin story in &quot;The Battle of Roboto&quot;, being a creation of Man-At-Arms rather than a wandering alien, as in the Filmation series. Stinkor and Spikor starred in their own mini comics as well, in &quot;The Stench of Evil&quot; and &quot;Spikor Strikes&quot;, which also included Moss Man, Sy-Klone (referred to as &quot;Tornado&quot;), and the Spydor vehicle. Only the mini comic &quot;The Obelisk&quot; followed the established continuity more closely and did not feature any of the new characters or vehicles. Michael Halperin and Christy Marx wrote many of the 1984 and 1985 mini comics, while Lee Nordling often served as editor. Larry Houston, Michael Lee, and Alfred Alcala composed most of the artwork for these issues, while DC Comics&#x27; Bruce Timm was the illustrator for &quot;Grizzlor - The Legend Comes Alive!&quot;

====The introduction of She-Ra and &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; animated feature (1985)====
In 1984, Mattel and Filmation decided to diversify the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; line beyond its traditional realm of &quot;male action,&quot; in the hopes of bringing in a young female audience as well. Thus, She-Ra, a feminine warrior-woman heroine, in the same vein as He-Man, was proposed with an all new line of dolls/action figures for girls. In conjunction with the toy line, Filmation would begin work on a new animated series titled &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, featuring this new main character. She-Ra would be revealed as Princess Adora, the long-lost twin sister of Prince Adam/He-Man, living on Eternia&#x27;s sister planet of Etheria, ruled by Hordak, the main antagonist of the new series and the tyrannical leader of the Evil Horde. She-Ra would first be introduced in the animated feature &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot;, released in theaters on March 22, 1985. The film would feature most major characters from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and introduce many of the new characters and concepts behind the new series (with the backstory developed by Filmation writers Larry DiTillio and J. Michael Straczynski).

====&quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; – Filmation animated series (1985–1987)====
Filmation&#x27;s &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; first aired &quot;The Sword of She-Ra Part 1: Into Etheria&quot; on September 9, 1985. &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; animated movie from earlier that spring was essentially a compilation of what would become the first five episodes of the She-Ra cartoon series. The series would run for two seasons, 93 episodes, from 1985 to 1987. &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; was produced in lieu of continuing &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; for a third year; however, He-Man often appeared in episodes of &quot;She-Ra&quot; to aid his sister, and several other characters from &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, both heroic and evil, also appeared in multiple crossovers.

She-Ra was born as Princess Adora on Eternia, Prince Adam/He-Man&#x27;s twin sister and daughter of King Randor and Queen Marlena. As an infant, Adora is kidnapped by Hordak (vampire/demon-faced sorcerer with a cowl of bones, who can transform his body into various mechanical devices) and Skeletor (Hordak&#x27;s apprentice at the time) and taken to the world of Etheria (a planet ruled by the Horde, and the main setting of the She-Ra series). Adora is raised and brainwashed by Hordak and his confidant Shadow Weaver (a red-robed witch with a hidden face, powerful in dark magic), to eventually become Force Captain of the Horde. After encountering her brother He-Man (who is on a mission from the Sorceress to find her on Etheria), she eventually acquires the Sword of Protection and seeks to learn the true evil of the Horde. After first transforming into She-Ra and seeing the error of her ways, she becomes a member of the Great Rebellion; a secret small band of rebels, living in the Whispering Woods and fighting to free Etheria from the tyrannical rule of Hordak. Just as Prince Adam transforms into He-Man with the use of his Sword of Power, Adora transforms into She-Ra via her Sword of Protection, a replica of He-Man&#x27;s sword featuring a smooth blue gem in its hilt. Unlike He-Man&#x27;s sword, She-Ra&#x27;s possesses the ability to transform into different weapons and accessories, such as a lasso, a shield, or a flaming blade. Like her brother Adam, however, Adora&#x27;s transformation into She-Ra is similarly triggered by holding her sword over her head, but with her own unique invocation: &quot;For the honor of Grayskull…I am She-Ra!&quot; Also similar to He-Man and Cringer/Battle Cat, She-Ra transforms her horse Spirit into the flying unicorn Swift Wind. Though strong like He-Man, She-Ra is shown to have additional powers as well, such as the ability to heal with her touch and communicate with animals via telepathy.

The premise of the &quot;She-Ra&quot; TV series was the reverse of the He-Man cartoon, where the heroes are actually rebels countering an evil establishment (rather than Skeletor trying to conquer Eternia). The Great Rebellion is originally led by Queen Angela (winged queen of Bright Moon, freed by She-Ra from the clutches of Hunga the Harpy) and her daughter Glimmer (pink-haired magic user with the ability to manipulate light), with the main cast of the &quot;Princess of Power&quot; cartoon also including the skilled archer Bow (the main male heroic character of the series), Bow&#x27;s timid companion Kowl (a flying owl-/koala-like creature with large rainbow-colored ears), and the absent-minded magician Madame Razz and her wise-cracking sidekick, Broom. Also appearing in many episodes are the small imp-like forest-dwelling Twiggits (mainly Sprockett, Spritina, and Spragg) and the mystical Light Hope, who serves as a &quot;Sorceress of Grayskull–type&quot; guide to She-Ra, residing high atop Mount Skydancer in the Crystal Castle. Throughout the series, recurring characters and members/allies of the Rebellion included Adora&#x27;s swashbuckling love interest Sea-Hawk, the flirtatious ice queen Frosta, powerful sorcerer queen Castaspella, the mermaid princess Mermista, flower-loving Perfuma, net-tossing Netossa, far-seeing Peekablue, butterfly-like Flutterina, and the intergalactic scout Sweet Bee. With the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; cartoon no longer in production, MOTU toy-line characters also appeared in the She-Ra series, such as the elephant warrior Snout Spout (referred to as &quot;Hose Nose&quot;), and the Comet Warriors Rokkon and Stonedar. A special character, Loo-Kee, was also introduced, hiding somewhere in the background of nearly every episode of the series; emerging at the end of the episode, revealing to viewers where he had been hiding and relating the moral of the story.

The ruling antagonist faction of the series, the Evil Horde (whose members are often depicted with a bat-like insignia), is led on Etheria by Hordak (as voiced by George DiCenzo, portrayed with a snorting laugh and temperament slightly more fearsome than Skeletor&#x27;s), who rules Etheria from the industrial-/technological-looking monstrosity known as the Fright Zone. The Horde enslaves the people of Etheria through Hordak&#x27;s legions of armored robot-like Horde Troopers, mechanized vehicles, and his special task force of henchman known as the Force Squad. The Force Squad, lead originally by Adora and now by Catra (raven-haired villainess with a magic mask, giving her the ability to turn into a vicious panther), consists of the bug-eyed Mantenna (whom Hordak loves to torment, often dropping him through trapdoors), the fearsome Beast Island operator Grizzlor, the hulking life-force-draining amphibian-like Leech, the whiny shape-shifting Imp, and the pincer-clawed scorpion woman Scorpia. The Horde was later joined by others, including Skeletor&#x27;s former scientist henchman Modulok, his robotic creation Multi-Bot, the future Snake Men Tung-Lashor and Rattlor, Entrapta the evil inventor with deadly braids, the octopus woman Octavia, the Horde zookeeper Vultak, and the robot Horde Trooper commander Dylamug. The overarching interplanetary supreme leader of the Horde, Horde Prime, who held leadership over both Hordak and Skeletor, was also introduced during the She-Ra Filmation series. Some of the other popular one-off heroes and villains were Spinnerella, Huntara, General Sunder, False-Face, Colonel Blast, the Red Knight, Granita the comet warrior, Sorrowful the Dragon, the Meteorbs, and the Star Sisters.

She-Ra and Adora were voiced in the series by Melendy Britt (who also voiced Catra, Castaspella, Mermista, and Octavia); George DiCenzo was the voice of Hordak, Bow, Sea-Hawk, Tung-Lashor, and a few others; and Diane Pershing provided the voice for Netossa and Spinnerella. Alan Oppenheimer and John Erwin would reprise their roles from the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; series, as would Linda Gary with Teela and the Sorceress, while providing additional voice work for Glimmer, Madame Razz, Sweet Bee, Shadow Weaver, Scorpia, and Entrapta. Credited as &quot;Erik Gunden,&quot; Lou Scheimer returned as well to provide voices for a plethora of characters, including Swift Wind, Kowl, Light Hope, Broom, Mantenna, Leech, Grizzlor, Modulok, Horde Prime, Multi-Bot, Rattlor, Orko, the Horde Troopers, and many of the Twiggits; while his daughter, Erika Scheimer, took a more prominent role in this series, providing the voices for Loo-Kee, Queen Angella, Frosta, Imp, and several of She-Ra&#x27;s female associates. &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; would air its final episode, &quot;Swifty&#x27;s Baby,&quot; on December 12, 1987, with no real finale for either the She-Ra or He-Man Filmation series.

====Princess of Power – Mattel toy line (1985–1987)====
Released in 1985, Mattel&#x27;s toy line Princess of Power (sometimes abbreviated as POP) featured almost exclusively female characters, all of whom featured an emphasis on hair and clothing, with &quot;real&quot; hair and partially soft-goods costumes. Described as &quot;fashion action dolls,&quot; essentially the line attempted to fuse the appeal of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; with Mattel&#x27;s successful line of fashion dolls, Barbie, and added many &quot;Fantastic Fashions&quot; clothing accessories packs to complement the female action figures.

The 1985 line of &quot;Princess of Power&quot; figures included She-Ra (without a separate action figure for Princess Adora), Bow (the only male figure in the POP line, without his moustache, as seen in the cartoon series), Glimmer (&quot;the guide who lights the way&quot;), Kowl (&quot;the know-it owl&quot;), Angella (&quot;angelic winged guide&quot;), Frosta (&quot;ice empress of Etheria&quot;), Castaspella (&quot;enchantress who hypnotizes&quot;), Catra (&quot;jealous beauty&quot; and the main female antagonist), and Double Trouble (&quot;glamorous double agent&quot;; created only for the toy line and mini comics, never appearing in the Filmation cartoon series). She-Ra&#x27;s main playset was Crystal Castle, a &quot;shimmering castle of fantasy and fun for She-Ra and her friends!&quot; Enchanta, a large swan creature/vehicle, was also produced in the first wave of toys, as were several horses to accompany the figures: Swift Wind for She-Ra, Arrow for Bow, and Storm for Catra.

The Princess of Power toy line ran from 1985 to 1987, for which Mattel would release a total of 22 action figure/dolls (with 12 creatures, two playsets, and 16 clothing accessories). Apart from the main Princess of Power line, the preeminent villains of the She-Ra series, Hordak and the Evil Horde (originally created by Filmation in collaboration with Mattel), were released by Mattel under the Masters of the Universe branding. The character Catra was the only villain to be released in the first wave of the Princess of Power figures, with Mattel downplaying her connection to the Evil Horde in the toy line. In 1986, a new &quot;Scratchin&#x27; Sound&quot; version of Catra was joined by her feline pet Clawdeen and fellow Horde-Villainess Entrapta. She-Ra (with a new &quot;Starburst&quot; version) was accompanied in the second wave by her allies Flutterina, Mermista, Peekablue, Perfuma, and Sweet Bee. &quot;Crystal&quot; translucent plastic versions of Swift Wind and the horses Sun Dancer and Moonbeam were also released in wave two, along with the Butterflyer and Sea Harp creature/vehicles and the Crystal Falls playset.

The third and final wave saw diminished sales and production in 1987, with the releases of Netossa, Spinnerella, and Loo-Kee; along with &quot;Bubble Power&quot; She-Ra, &quot;Royal&quot; Swift Wind, &quot;Silver&quot; Storm, and &quot;Shower Power&quot; Catra. Several recurring characters from the She-Ra cartoon did not receive action figures in either the original POP or MOTU toy lines—such as Madame Razz (or her Broom), Light Hope, the Twiggits, Sea-Hawk, Shadow Weaver, Scorpia, Imp, Octavia, or Hunga the Harpy, though nearly all of these omitted (from the original toy-lines)characters would receive action figures in the 2008-2016 produced Masters of The Universe Classics revival line for collectors. She-Ra would also feature in 13 of her own mini comics (packaged with the figures), along with several children&#x27;s books, comic magazines, and read-along record/cassette-tape books.

===Last years of the original toy line===

====Final action figures and mini comics (1986–1988)====
The final series of action figures and mini comics, in 1986 and 1987, would continue on the adventures past the animated series and its sequel in the She-Ra line, introducing new characters not seen in the cartoon series such as the heroic warriors: Rio Blast (&quot;transforming gunslinger&quot;), Clamp Champ (&quot;master of capture&quot;), and Extendar (&quot;master of extension&quot;); the evil warriors: Blast-Attak (&quot;blast-apart robotic warrior&quot;), Ninjor (&quot;evil ninja warrior&quot;), and Scare-Glow (&quot;evil ghost of Skeletor&quot;); the Snake Men: King Hiss (&quot;dreadful disguised leader of the Snake Men&quot;), Sssqueeze (&quot;evil long-armed viper&quot;), and Snake-Face (&quot;most gruesome of the Snake Men&quot;); the Hordesmen: Dragstor (&quot;transforming warrior/vehicle&quot;) and Mosquitor (&quot;energy-draining insectoid&quot;); and the spinning-top-like Energy Zoids: Rotar and Twistoid. Aside from these new characters, longtime MOTU staple characters King Randor (&quot;heroic ruler of Eternia&quot;) and the Sorceress (&quot;heroic guardian of Castle Grayskull&quot;) were finally represented in action-figure form. Other later MOTU characters that had only appeared in the &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; animated series also saw release in the form of the elephant-headed Snout Spout (&quot;heroic water-blasting firefighter&quot;); the rock warriors: Rokkon (&quot;young heroic comet warrior&quot;) and Stonedar (&quot;heroic rock people leader&quot;); the Snake Men: Tung Lashor (&quot;evil tongue-shooting Snake Men creature&quot;) and Rattlor (&quot;evil Snake Men creature with the quick-strike head&quot;); and the Horde members: Multi-Bot (&quot;evil robot of a thousand bodies&quot;, similar to the prior interchangeable body-segment Modulok figure) and the Horde Trooper (&quot;evil collapsing robot&quot; and the only generic troop/soldier figures of the toy line). New versions of the lead characters were also produced, with &quot;Flying Fists&quot; He-Man, &quot;Terror Claws&quot; Skeletor, and Hordak in two new forms (&quot;Hurricane&quot; Hordak and &quot;Buzz-Saw&quot; Hordak).

The Evil Horde obtained their first vehicle/creatures in the toy line with Mantisaur (&quot;the evil insectoid steed&quot;) and Monstroid (&quot;the ultimate battling monster&quot;, that had an entirely different depiction in the animated series); while the Horde&#x27;s Slime Pit playset (a dinosaur-skull-headed torture device) proved to be quite popular in 1986, coming complete with canisters of green ooze to pour over the action figures, while held in place with a giant claw. Also that same year, &quot;the land and sky disc launcher&quot;, Blaster Hawk, and &quot;the road rocket&quot;, Laser Bolt, were produced for He-Man&#x27;s heroic warriors; while Skeletor gained the &quot;dragonfly attack vehicle&quot;, known as the Fright Fighter. At a less expensive price point, several accessory packs of smaller vehicle/weapons included the Megalaser, Jet Sled, and Stilt Stalkers in 1986; and the Scubattack, Tower Tools, Cliff Climber, Beam Blaster, and Artilleray set and several small transforming egg-shaped creatures, known as Meteorbs, late into the line in 1987.

Also late into the line in 1987 were three original characters from the live-action movie: Blade (&quot;evil masters of swords&quot;), Saurod (&quot;evil spark-shooting reptile&quot;), and Gwildor (&quot;heroic creator of the Cosmic Key&quot;), with their entry into the MOTU mythos explained in one of the last original mini comics, &quot;The Cosmic Key&quot;. No other movie-related figures were produced; however, in 1988, the final action figures of the original toy line, the &quot;Laser Power&quot; versions of He-Man and Skeletor, did bear some resemblance to their live-action movie counterparts and were released only to European markets.

One of the main storylines of the later mini comics, released with these later waves of action figures, was the introduction of a new major villain faction known as the Snake Men, first appearing in the mini comic &quot;King of the Snake Men&quot;. Kobra Khan, Tung-Lashor, and Rattlor (who previously appeared in the He-Man and She-Ra cartoon series with Skeletor, and/or as members of the Horde), were now under the leadership of the ancient Eternian King Hiss, whose Snake Men army rose from Eternia&#x27;s past, joining forces with Skeletor to once again rule Eternia (additional Snake Men were later added to the roster in the form of the long-armed Sssqueeze and the medusa-like Snake Face in the mini comic &quot;Revenge of the Snake Men&quot;). Another major mini comic storyline of this period included the introduction of the three-towered fortress of Eternia in &quot;The Ultimate Battleground&quot;, which was a massive final playset for MOTU, one of the biggest of all 1980s toy lines, complete with a motorized monorail circling the towers. Other notable mini comics included the debut of Hordak&#x27;s gruesome mind-altering Slime Pit in &quot;Escape from the Slime Pit&quot;, one of several origin stories for Rokkon and Stonedar in &quot;Rock People to the Rescue&quot;, cybernetic Horde experiments resulting in the creation of the warriors Dragstor and Extendar in &quot;The Warrior Machine&quot;, and the suggested origin of Skeletor as Keldor in &quot;The Search for Keldor&quot; (which also included the only mini comic appearances for He-Man&#x27;s ally Clamp Champ, and Skeletor&#x27;s minions Ninjor, Scare Glow, and Faker). All of this was leading toward what would have been a continuation of the series in &quot;The Powers of Grayskull&quot; line, before being discontinued. These series five and six mini comics were often edited by Lee Nordling with art direction from Ron Cook, and included writing by Tim Kiplin, Phil White, and Steven Grant, with the artwork of Bruce Timm, Jim Mitchell, Chris Carlson, Charles Simpson, and Larry Houston, among others.

====&quot;The Powers of Grayskull&quot; (1987)====
The proposed exploration of the distant past of Eternia, dubbed &quot;Preternia,&quot; forms the basis of what was originally to be the next incarnation of the toy line, entitled &quot;The Powers of Grayskull.&quot; However the toy line was canceled very early on, with only a few toys released (like the dinosaur-themed creatures Turbodactyl, Bionatops, Tyrantisaurus Rex, and the rare Italian-only-released giant figures Tytus and Megator). The main story information originates from the final mini comic &quot;The Powers of Grayskull—The Legend Begins!&quot;, which was intended as the first of a three-part series; however, only this issue appeared.

The proposed storyline was to focus on Ancient Eternia, which was populated by many creatures, including the aforementioned cybernetic dinosaurs and giants. When the Sorceress and He-Man arrive, followed by Skeletor, they find King Hiss leading an attack on a village in the hope of drawing out &quot;The Elders,&quot; using some of the cybernetic dinosaurs to their advantage. Hiss serves an &quot;unnamed one&quot; and agrees to unite with Skeletor on the basis that he might be an emissary. Seeing Skeletor&#x27;s interference, the Sorceress allows He-Man to enter the battle but, &quot;for reasons that will be made clear to you in the future,&quot; he had to be disguised. He finds himself overwhelmed, but then a shadowy figure appears who turns the odds with a powerful wand. The stranger then sends the Snake Men back to their base and all the time travelers home. The Sorceress describes the intervener as &quot;the Greatest Sorcerer of all&quot; and He-Man is left asking, &quot;But who is he?&quot; No further story information is given and it remains unclear how the giants mentioned and released as toys would fit into the story. However, some marketing press releases and prototypes have shed further information on this.

The wizard was to be He-Ro, an ancestor of He-Man. Raised by his mentor Eldor and discovering special powers in a cave, He-Ro would have led the fight against the Snake Men. According to the mini comics&#x27; writers, it was intended that the central antagonist would be Keldor, a character revealed similarly late in the line to have been He-Man&#x27;s uncle and also strongly hinted to have been the former identity of Skeletor. Whether or not Keldor was also supposed to be the &quot;Unnamed One&quot; Hiss served is not clear, although in an interview writer Steven Grant vaguely recalls that the intention was that the Unnamed One would be a greater evil who, as the Emperor was to Darth Vader, was intended to be the one who caused Keldor to become Skeletor.

On April 25, 2022, the complete series was released for the first time on DVD in the UK by Fabulous Films.

===Other comics, books, and media===

====Marvel comics, daily newspaper strips, and fan-club magazines (1985–1988)====
In the years after the animated series ended, generally going along with the established Filmation continuity, Marvel Comics would release a younger-skewing Star Comics Masters of the Universe series that ran from 1986 to 1988 bimonthly and produced 13 issues; featuring many of the later characters introduced in the toy line, as well as new ones such as Lieutenant Andra. Apart from the standard comic-book format, there was a &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Magazine&quot;, a U.S.-based fan-club magazine featuring puzzles, fan letters, feature stories, and comic strips (running 16 issues, 1985–88; She-Ra also with a similar magazine, running six issues). This magazine series featured well-rendered covers and posters by artist Earl Norem and a create a character contest, with the winner, Nathan Bitner, revealed in the spring 1986 issue. Bitner&#x27;s creation, Fearless Photog, was never realized in the 1980s and an action figure was not produced until the Masters of the Universe Classics collector&#x27;s toy line in 2012.

Daily Masters of the Universe comic strips were also in newspaper syndication from 1985 until 1989. The strips were primarily written by Chris Weber and edited by Karen Willson, with distribution in the U.S. and worldwide in countries such as Brazil, India, Greece, and the former Yugoslavia. The newspaper strips were generally lesser known to the wider fan base until 1,639 of the 1,674 daily strips were finally collected in hardcover format with &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips&quot;, released by Dark Horse Books in 2017.

====International publications (1983–1990)====
Various comics and magazines containing Masters of the Universe–related content were also released outside the United States, in the United Kingdom, Germany, France (as &quot;Musclor&quot; et les Maîtres de l&#x27;univers), Finland, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Italy, and several other countries in the late 1980s. One of the most notable was produced by Egmont&#x27;s London Editions in the United Kingdom, which published 72 issues biweekly of their &quot;By The Power Of Grayskull...Masters Of The Universe&quot; comic magazine from 1986 to 1988. The series was headed by Brian Clarke, and is often noted for in-depth stories expanding the canon and the origins of many Masters of the Universe characters. In addition, London Editions would introduce several new characters, such as &quot;Scrollos,&quot; who served as an in-universe editor and guide to the series. From issue 50 onward, the series would begin to reprint many translated and reworked versions of Ehapa&#x27;s German Language comics, although original content was still produced for &quot;the Secret Files of Scrollos&quot; portion of the comic magazine until its demise in late 1988. Fourteen issues of &quot;For the Honor of Grayskull She-Ra&quot; were also produced by London Editions from 1986 to 1987, as were several one-shot special issues, which included a dual He-Man and She-Ra feature-length adventure in &quot;Twins of Power&quot;. Starting in 1987, London Editions added a second larger monthly comic magazine entitled &quot;Masters of the Universe Adventure&quot;, which ran for 18 issues before turning into a New Adventures themed magazine &quot;He-Man Adventure&quot; for six more issues, before ending the series with four final issues in a best-of format of reprints in 1991.

Original comic-book content was created in Germany as well, first by Interpart/Condor for 18 issues from 1984 to 1987, then in Egmont&#x27;s Ehapa Masters of the Universe comics for 21 issues from 1987 to 1989, with promotional content also appearing in several German Micky Maus comics from the time period. Both the German and British comics were often translated to provide content for other countries (although Italy&#x27;s &quot;Più&quot; and &quot;Magic Boy&quot; magazines provided some original material, as did various South American publishers, notably Estrela and Editora Abril in Brazil). In addition, a few promotional comics and mini comics were also produced by Mattel for various European department stores, often featuring reworked versions of existing comic stories, with few exceptions.

====Children&#x27;s books (1983–1990)====
Masters of the Universe and the Princess of Power featured in many children&#x27;s books from the 1980s, with one of the main producers of these titles, Golden Books, publishing several series of hard and softcover children&#x27;s books from 1983 to 1986. The first few releases of the Golden books material is more in line with the early Mattel mini comics, with the later books following the Filmation cartoon series. New elements were also introduced by Golden Books, notably the character of Goat-Man in the book &quot;Secret of the Dragon&#x27;s Egg&quot; in 1985. World I.P. also produced annual Masters of the Universe and Princess of Power storybooks in the UK from 1984 until the New Adventures line in 1990. Most World I.P. storybooks would loosely follow the established Filmation continuity, although the 1984 annual edition was written in a pre-Filmation style, naming prominent characters Orko and King Randor as &quot;Gorpo&quot; and &quot;King Miro,&quot; respectively. Euredif France produced several Maîtres de l&#x27;Univers volumes as well, almost all of them directly based on various episodes of Filmation&#x27;s &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; series. Also notable in the 1980s were the various combination book, record, and cassette tape read-along adventure stories. These included many small hardcover book and cassette tapes produced by Ladybird Books out of the UK, several record and tape read-along book sets from Kid Stuff Records in the U.S., and two book and audio adventures by Mattel, packed in with a rare action-figure two-pack and with the Point Dread and Talon Fighter playset.

====Games, audio plays, Power Tour, and other media (1983–1987)====
Several video game adaptations of the franchise were released from 1983 through to 1987. Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man was released by Intellivision for Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 1983. Two games, Masters of the Universe: The Arcade Game and Masters of the Universe: The Super Adventure, were developed by Adventure Soft and released by U.S. Gold for Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in 1987, although the Commodore 64 version of Masters of the Universe: The Arcade Game was retitled Masters of the Universe: The Ilearth Stone. A video game based on the 1987 live-action movie, Masters of the Universe: The Movie, was released by Gremlin Graphics for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum also in 1987. Additionally, various Masters of the Universe board games were released throughout the 1980s, and role-playing game publisher FASA produced The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game in 1985 with sets of die-cast miniatures created by Grenadier Models.

Throughout the 1980s, a wide array of He-Man merchandise was released, including coloring books, activity books, Panini Sticker books, toothbrush holders, costumes, bed sheets, and many other items. Several read-along audio plays were created by Kid Stuff and by Pickwick/Ladybird in the United Kingdom. Notably, a complete Masters of the Universe audio-play adventure LP record was released by Kid Stuff Records in 1983, written and produced by John Braden, with a new He-Man theme song and original voice acting. Also notable were a series of audio cassettes, released in Germany by Europa, consisting of 37 episodes of more than 40 minutes in length, with an additional 10 Princess of Power tapes, and six specials. These cassettes would continue to add to the expanding Masters of the Universe mythos, introducing the world of Anti-Eternia, with an evil alternate universe version of He-Man.

Home video releases of Filmation&#x27;s animated series were produced by RCA/Columbia on VHS and Betamax for 11 volumes with red framed box art, before switching to their Magic Window brand with &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; movie in 1985, for 12 additional &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; volumes and 10 &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; VHS releases. &quot;Golden Books&quot;, Germany&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;, and various others also released Masters of the Universe video content in the 1980s.

A Masters of the Universe &quot;Power Tour&quot; live stage show toured across the United States and Canada in 1987, with 19 consecutive performances at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. Directed by Tony Christopher, husband-and-wife team Jack and Leslie Wadsworth portrayed He-Man and She-Ra, while Khalos Planchart and Eric Van Baars played lead villains Hordak and Skeletor, respectively. The production also featured lesser used characters such as Rio-Blast, Clamp-Champ, Snout-Spout, Rokkon, Ninjor, Blast-Attak, and songs by an original character, Songster (performed by Doug Howard).

===Live-action &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; film (1987)===
In 1987, a live-action He-Man film was made by Cannon Films entitled &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, released in the United States on August 7, 1987. The film was directed by Gary Goddard and starred Dolph Lundgren in the title role of He-Man, Frank Langella as Skeletor, with Courteney Cox, Robert Duncan McNeill, and James Tolkan in supporting roles (as Julie Winston, Kevin Corrigan, and Detective Lubic, respectively). The other characters from the original cartoon to appear in the film are Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster), Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher), Teela (Chelsea Field), Beast Man (Tony Carroll), and the Sorceress (Christina Pickles). A new character, Gwildor (Billy Barty), is included in place of Orko, as the special effects of the time were deemed insufficient and too costly. Skeletor&#x27;s henchmen Blade (Anthony De Longis), Saurod (Pons Maar), and Karg (Robert Towers) were also introduced, in place of other more familiar villains from the established continuity, such as Tri-Klops, Mer-Man, and Trap Jaw.

In the film, Skeletor has finally conquered Eternia after stealing the Cosmic Key from the locksmith Gwildor, allowing him to gain entry into Castle Grayskull and imprison the Sorceress. The heroes He-Man, Man-At-Arms, and Teela are joined by Gwildor and escape to the planet Earth using Gwildor&#x27;s prototype Cosmic Key. Stranded on Earth, they are faced with the task of retrieving their Cosmic Key (which has fallen into the hands of the unwitting humans Julie Winston and Kevin Corrigan) and returning to Eternia, before Skeletor can gain the full power of Castle Grayskull. Skeletor sends his minions to Earth with the mission of recovering the Cosmic Key prototype, as the war between good and evil is transferred to Earth, before returning to Eternia for a final battle between He-Man and a golden-clad godlike Skeletor in the film&#x27;s climax.

Numerous parts of the previously accepted history of the series are omitted in the film, including all references to Prince Adam, Battle Cat, Orko, King Randor, and Queen Marlena. Many reviews of the motion picture criticized its departures from the cartoon, although the movie was produced as an adaptation of the toys only, with Filmation having no involvement in the film. It is also implied that Castle Grayskull itself is the ruling point of Eternia rather than any royal city. The story concentrates more on the science-fiction elements of the franchise rather than the fantasy and the majority of the story takes place on Earth rather than on the world of Eternia. Also departing from all other depictions, He-Man uses a gun in some scenes, instead of his Power Sword, and he is rarely shown displaying his superhuman strength in the film. Although He-Man twice utters his catchphrase &quot;I have the power!&quot; while holding the sword aloft in the iconic manner, he does omit the prefacing clause &quot;By the power of Grayskull.&quot;

The film was a critical and commercial failure, and received generally negative reviews from critics.

Although Mattel had hoped that the movie would boost sales of the toy line, it instead had little effect on the line&#x27;s falling sales, and the MOTU toy line was finally discontinued in early 1988 under mounting financial difficulties. A sequel to the film was written, but by 1989 Cannon Films was in such severe financial troubles that it could no longer afford to pay the license fees to Mattel. Due to film&#x27;s poor reception, thus the script was transformed into the action film &quot;Cyborg&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

===&quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; (1990–1991)===

In 1990, a couple of years after the ending of the original Masters of the Universe product line, a second He-Man animated series titled &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; was created by Jetlag Productions to promote Mattel&#x27;s short-lived attempt to revive the MOTU brand with a new toy line, simply titled &quot;He-Man&quot;. The new series is radically different from the original fantasy-oriented milieu, shifting to an almost purely science-fiction setting that sees He-Man transported to the futuristic planet of Primus. He-Man (with a new, more slender appearance and sporting a ponytail; voiced by Doug Parker) leads the heroic Galactic Guardians; while Skeletor (also with a completely new look; voiced by Campbell Lane), bases himself on the mutant world of Denebria, forming an alliance with Flogg and his band of Evil Mutants, who are hellbent on conquering Primus for themselves. The series contains continuity links to the original &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; and was intended as a continuation of the existing mythology, although some fans see it as a separate canon from the original series due to the differences in style and character portrayal.

Other than He-Man and Skeletor, the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull is the only character from the original series to make regular appearances in the new series, acting as a spiritual guide to He-Man from afar. Other established characters featured in the pilot episode, &quot;A New Beginning,&quot; include King Randor and Queen Marlena, who finally learn of the dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man. Teela also makes a later appearance in the series in the episode &quot;Once Upon a Time,&quot; although she bears little resemblance to her former Filmation counterpart.

Main characters introduced in this series are He-Man&#x27;s new allies: the wise sage Master Sebrian, his assistant Mara, and the lead Galactic Guardians Captain Hydron and Flipshot. Other frequently appearing heroic characters include the young shepherd girl Drissi, her little brother Caz, the scientists (Alcon, Gepple, Krex, and Meldoc), the robots Gleep and UR, Grot the gardener, councilman Werban, the cyclops Meliac, and the remaining Galactic Guardians: Sagitar, Tuskador, Spinwit, and Artilla; with the final members Kayo, Vizor, and Nocturna rarely featuring in the show (although they did appear in the comics and series intro). Skeletor&#x27;s allies in Flogg&#x27;s band of Evil Mutants consist mainly of Flogg&#x27;s incompetent second-in-command Slush-Head, Skeletor&#x27;s new love interest Crita, and other mutants such as Quakke, Staghorn, B.H., Hoove, Karatti, Optik, and Lizorr.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;New Adventures of He-Man&quot; cartoon series first aired September 17, 1990, lasting 65 episodes, until the episode &quot;The Final Invasion,&quot; which aired on December 14, 1990, and, unlike Filmation, did provide some closure to the series. The majority of the cartoon episodes were written by Jack Olesker, resulting in a somewhat tighter continuity than the prior series. The &quot;He-Man&quot; toy line, debuting in 1989, a year earlier than the animated series, featured four waves of action figures (produced in slightly smaller scale to the previous line); totaling 28 distinct figures in all, with seven vehicles, two playsets, and two accessory items. Neither &quot;The New Adventures&quot; animated series or toy line proved nearly as popular as the originals, and the line ended with little fanfare in 1992.

&quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; series was also featured in its own series of four mini comics and in a monthly comic magazine entitled &quot;He-Man Adventure&quot;, which ran for about six issues, before returning to adventures on Eternia and was published by Egmont&#x27;s London Editions Magazines in the UK; World I.P. also produced a &quot;New Adventures&quot;–themed annual in 1990. These publications differed somewhat from the animated series with the addition of the character Darius (who did not appear in the cartoon series) in a major role as leader of the Galactic Council; the transition of the &quot;Power of Castle Grayskull&quot; into the Starship Eternia; and several of the figures sporting alternate names in some media and toy-line releases, such as Flipshot as Icarius, Flogg as Brakk, and Slush-Head as Kalamarr.

===Hiatus – Proposed series, pop culture, and commemorative releases (1992–2001)===
The Masters of the Universe franchise would not produce any new media for over a decade, although a new series was pitched by Lou Scheimer to DIC Entertainment in 1996. The series was to feature He-Ro (alter-ego Dare), now the son of He-Man, as a sequel to the original animated series, but remained unproduced.

During this hiatus, Masters of the Universe also began a following on the early days of the internet, with sites developed by Kevin Herbert (one of the first), Adam Tyner (with the Scrolls of Grayskull newsletter), Busta-Toons (with focus on the Filmation animated series), and many others; eventually ending up with the expansive He-Man.org site being created. Various popular internet memes were also created, with Masters of the Universe being reviewed by popular YouTube channels and parodies such as Unemployed Skeletor or Wil Wheaton&#x27;s &quot;Skeletor Reads Angry Tweets&quot; segment. Masters of the Universe would also appear many times on the Adult Swim stop-motion comedy series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (which introduced comedic character Mo-Larr). Both He-Man and Skeletor are often mentioned in pop culture, as seen on the long-running animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on a few occasions.

In 2000, however, Mattel did act on the growing nostalgia for the 1980s action figures by rereleasing replicas of many of the figures, under the banner of the Masters of the Universe Commemorative line. BCI Eclipse LLC (and later Mill Creek Entertainment) would expand on this, later releasing all episodes of the Filmation &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2005/2006; followed by &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; and JetLag&#x27;s &quot;New Adventures of He-Man&quot; series. Each volume contained an extensive array of special features, including original documentaries produced for the DVD set that featured interviews from many series creators and writers such as Lou Scheimer, Larry DiTillio, Paul Dini, and others.

===Early 2000s &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; franchise relaunch (2002–2004)===

====200X Masters of the Universe toy line====
In 2002, Mattel launched a new Masters of the Universe toy line with sculpts designed by the Four Horsemen. The new toy line was made surprisingly faithful to the original line, with the characters gently &quot;reimagined&quot; and updated in terms of sculpting detail rather than radically reinterpreted. Sixty action figures were released in all, with 10 creature figures, seven vehicles, and three playsets (eight smaller-scale figures were also produced in a McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal promotion).

One point of contention for many fans of the original Masters toy line was the redesign of He-Man&#x27;s Power Sword. According to Four Horsemen, this was due to their original re-sculpts being intended for a continuation of the original storyline in which Skeletor had obtained both halves of the Power Sword (hence the new Skeletor figure&#x27;s dual blades with clear &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; hilt designs), necessitating a new sword to be built by Man-At-Arms and endowed with the properties of the original by the Sorceress. However, Mattel decided to reboot the continuity for a new generation of children, and thus the &quot;new&quot; Power Sword design became the &quot;original&quot; version for the new continuity. Another issue was the overreliance on releasing alternate versions of He-Man (13 in total), Skeletor (10), Man-At-Arms (5), and a few other main characters, rather than further classic, reimagined, and original characters from the accompanying animated series (such as Randor, The Sorceress, Clawful, or Chief Carnivus, to name a few); making many of the non-He-Man or Skeletor figures hard to come by for both collectors and children. These factors likely contributed to the cancelation of the line in 2004 and ultimately not achieving the success of its 1980s counterpart.

The line&#x27;s faithfulness to the original series made it very popular with collectors, however, suggesting it would have been better served as a collector-based line, akin to DC Direct. This theory was borne out in the wake of the discontinuation of the mass-market toy line, with NECA taking the rather unprecedented step of continuing the toy line through action-figure-size mini-statues scaled and sculpted to be aesthetically compatible for display alongside the Mattel toys. NECA would produce 22 &quot;staction figures&quot; in total, allowing fans to fill in their collections with other Four Horsemen redesigned characters that had yet to be produced as figures when the toy line was canceled. According to a December 8, 2005, interview with a Mattel representative on he-man.org, NECA offered to produce fully articulated action figures for Mattel without taking any credit, but permission was denied. Instead, NECA was only permitted to produce non-articulated statues, which they did from 2005 to 2007.

====2002 animated series – Mike Young Productions====
A new animated series was produced to accompany the toy line, made by Mike Young Productions and lasting for 39 episodes, with the series making its premiere on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami on August 16, 2002, and airing its final episode on January 10, 2004. This series involved much tighter continuity and a somewhat greater depth of characterization than its Filmation predecessor. A similar but slightly modified premise to the original Filmation series, this version of He-Man (voiced by Cam Clarke, with Prince Adam portrayed as physically younger and smaller than He-Man) was part of an ensemble of Eternian heroes/protectors known officially as &quot;The Masters of the Universe&quot;. Under the leadership of Man-At-Arms (voiced by Garry Chalk), this team originally consisted of He-Man/Adam (with his pet Cringer/Battle Cat, no longer able to speak), Teela, Orko, Stratos, Ram-Man, Mekaneck, and Man-E-Faces, and later joined by Buzz-Off, Roboto, and Sy-Klone. King Randor was now a general (rather than king, from an Eternian royal lineage), pronounced ruler of Eternia by the Elders of the Hall of Wisdom, which have gone into hiding inside the depths of Castle Grayskull. Skeletor (voiced by Brian Dobson), now confirmed as Randor&#x27;s brother Keldor, finally breaks through the great barrier wall (after decades of trying) and attacks The Masters with his evil forces, mainly consisting of Evil-Lynn, Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw (now a cybernetically repaired henchman, formerly known as Kronis), Tri-Klops (now an inventor/scientist, somewhat akin to an evil Man-At-Arms), Claw-ful (now a very large and extremely dim-witted thug), and Whiplash (now also of larger size and of the subterranean Caligar race). Backstories of occasional characters such as Fisto, Moss-Man, Webstor, Zodak (regarded a different character as opposed to the earlier Zodac), Two-Bad (portrayed as two bounty hunters known as Tuvar and Baddhra, magically combined into one being by Skeletor&#x27;s magic), and Stinkor (finally making an appearance in cartoon continuity as the mutated form of Odiphus) are all expanded upon. On-and-off villains Count Marzo and Evilseed return, while new characters such as Dekker, Carnivus, Ceratus, Lord Dactys, Prahvus, the Faceless One, and the giants Chadzar, Belzar, and Azdar are also introduced in this series.

The series was originally title &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; like the original 1983 series, being retitled &quot;Masters of the Universe vs. the Snake-Men&quot; towards the end of the first season, in addition sidelining Skeletor as chief villain in favor of King Hiss, leader of the reptilian Snake Men (Kobra-Kahn, General Rattlor, Tung-Lashor, Snake-Face, and Sssqueeze), with He-Man and many of the characters now bearing a new &quot;Snake-Armor&quot; look. He-Man&#x27;s ancestor King Grayskull and his Sorceress wife Veena also debuted in this season against his nemesis Hordak (now an ancient sorcerer). Hordak and the Evil Horde were to be the main antagonists for the third season if the show had continued, but it was not renewed. The 40th and final episode was produced as a comic-book &quot;special feature&quot; on the last DVD set of the series, which was part of a three-volume release, originally by BCI Eclipse in 2008 (and later in a collected release by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2009 and 2012).

====Video games (2002–2005)====
A game based on the second &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; series, titled &quot;He-Man: Power of Grayskull&quot;, was developed by Taniko and published by TDK Mediactive in October 2002 for the Game Boy Advance, which also featured an introductory mini comic. A follow-up developed by Savage Entertainment and published by Midas Interactive Entertainment, &quot;He-Man: Defender of Grayskull&quot;, was released for PlayStation 2 in February 2005.

====Comic series by MVC and Image Comics====
From 2002 to 2005, Image Comics and MVCreations published several series of comics and one-shots that mirrored tales of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;; the comic series elaborated and added to the mythos by introducing characters that never appeared in the 39 episodes of the television series. The first issues were seen in the summer of 2002 in the form of special promotional/preview issues, with three miniseries continuing on after: &quot;The Shards of Darkness&quot; in fall 2002, followed by &quot;Dark Reflections&quot; and &quot;Rise of the Snake Men&quot; in 2003. After delving into the backstories of Skeletor&#x27;s henchmen Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw, and Tri-Klops in a four-issue &quot;Icons of Evil&quot; series, a short-lived ongoing series, solely produced by MVC, continued on for eight issues in 2004. Along with these, a handful of special or &quot;pack-in&quot; one-shots and trade paperback collected volumes were also produced.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; Classics, Super7 &amp; DC Comics (2008–2020)===

====MOTU Classics (2008–2020)====
In 2007, a new incarnation of Masters of the Universe was announced, with the first action figure, King Grayskull, released at San Diego Comic-Con in 2008. Based on the look of the original 1980s MOTU toys, this new toy line was aimed primarily at the adult toy collector market with a 6&quot; scale, and were often available only through subscriptions (from MattyCollector). Sculpted by the Four Horsemen, these toys were updated versions of previous figures, as well as characters that never before had an action figure made of them, such as Filmation&#x27;s Queen Marlena, Fang-Man, Lizard-Man, Count Marzo, Granamyr, and many others. The toy line featured many redesigned and updated action figures from the original action-figure line from the 1980s, but it also included characters from &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; (Adora, Madame Razz, Scorpia, Shadow Weaver, and others), &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; (Mara, Crita, and more), and the Mike Young Productions series from 2002 (Faceless One, Chief Carnivus, King Chooblah, Ceratus, and others). As the line progressed, characters from all versions of MOTU lore were included, from such things as prototypes and concept art (He-Ro, Eldor, Demo-Man, Gygor, Vykor, and others), box art from vehicles and model kits (Sky High and the Fighting Foe Men), mini comics (the Goddess, Geldor, and Procrustus), and other books, comics, and media (Despara, Strobo, Goat-Man, and more). There were also newly created figures, exclusive to the Classics toy line, such as Draego-Man, Cy-Chop, Castle Grayskullman, and others. Figures were also released in two-packs with corresponding Superheroes and villains from the DC Comics Universe.

Masters of the Universe Classics surpassed the original 1980s toy line in terms of length, running continuously for seven years with more than 150 different figures produced following its launch in August 2008. In 2016, Mattel ended production on the MOTU Classics and MattyCollector.com&#x27;s Club Grayskull series, with the production company Super7 taking over the Masters of the Universe license; though Super7 would continue the series.

====Super7 (2016–2020)====
Super7 produced several 3¾&quot; figures (in the style of the classic Kenner Star Wars action figures from the late 1970s to early 1980s) and many figures in the style of the small pink M.U.S.C.L.E./Kinkeshi toylines also from the 1980s. Super7&#x27;s releases included figures from their animation special &quot;The Curse of the Three Terrors&quot;, followed by the Masters of the Universe &quot;Ultimates&quot; line (which consisted of &quot;deluxe&quot; re-releases of Classics figures) and a continuation of the prior Classics and Club Grayskull lines. Super7 also produced retro figures in the form of the original 1980&#x27;s line in 5½-inch scale; which included many &#x27;Filmation&#x27; styled versions of the vintage figures, along with unreleased figures such as He-Ro and Eldor. Super7&#x27;s final addition to the MOTU Classics toyline was a &#x27;made to order&#x27; exclusive Snake Mountain playset in 2020.

====Dark Horse &amp; DC mini-comics (2012–2015)====
In addition to the toylines, starting in 2012, Dark Horse Comics produced mini comics included in Mattel&#x27;s Masters of the Universe Classics line of toys, continuing the series of mini comics first introduced in the original MOTU toys of the 1980s. The initial three mini comics were written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Wellinton Alves, with covers by Eric Powell. The Dark Horse mini comics create a new story set in the &quot;Classics&quot; timeline, but base the first issue on &quot;The Powers of Grayskull&quot; minicomic from the 80s, re-telling it to some degree, before venturing into the new Classics stories not related to original vintage concept. In these issues, He-Man goes back in time to battle King Hiss, finally bringing He-Ro, Eldor, Tytus, and Megator into the storylines and introducing newly created Classics characters such as Sir Laser-Lot and the Mighty Spector. Seeley stated that these comics were intended to blend the different He-Man continuities and select the best stories and ideas from MOTU history.

DC took over the Masters of the Universe Classics mini comics from Dark Horse in 2013, publishing five more mini comics, with stories from Scott Neitlich and artwork by Wellinton Alves and Axel Giménez. These mini comics provide an origin story of Keldor (Skeletor), and then proceed to join into the later &quot;New Adventures of He-Man&quot; continuity. The &quot;Fall of Eternia&quot; saga in the final issues incorporates the proposed Dare, son of He-Man (He-Ro II) series from the 1990s, along with Gorpo (the Unnamed One) and many &quot;Create-a-character&quot; contest finalist designs from the 1980s &quot;Masters of the Universe Magazine&quot;. Many of these stories are meant to be read in conjunction with the altered continuity presented in the character biographies on the cardbacks of the Masters of the Universes Classic&#x27;s line action figure packaging, and thus do not provide a detailed flowing narrative in the mini comics themselves. The 8th and final mini comic of this series was published in 2015.

====DC Comics (2012–2020)====
A Masters of the Universe comic book series was relaunched by DC Comics in 2012, first appearing as a series of digital comics. This was quickly followed by a six-issue mini-series and all new revised origin issues for He-Man, Skeletor and Hordak. After a crossover mini-series with superheroes from the DC Comics universe in 2013, an ongoing series ran for 19 issues through 2014, before being replaced by the &quot;He-Man The Eternity War&quot; 15-issue series in 2015/2016. This introduced a new back-story for He-man&#x27;s sister She-Ra (as Despara), Skeletor (as the half-Gar son of King Miro), Hordak, and the Snakemen; moving the storyline further along, with a new Horde invasion of Eternia and He-Man taking the Eternian throne, amongst other new developments. Fans have later referred to the overall 2012-2016 comic saga with the &quot;Eternity War&quot; moniker since it was all part of the same story.

Crossover Specials

Later DC/Mattel produced He-Man/ThunderCats, a crossover with another heroic 1980s action figure line, ThunderCats, was also produced for six issues in 2016–2017 and a six-part crossover series with DC Comics&#x27; was released in 2018. These two crossovers were not part of the earlier 2012-2016 DC Comics MOTU canon.

The final DC Comics MOTU property was &#x27;He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse&#x27;, which began in November 2019, with a six issue limited series, written by Tim Seeley. This used elements from various sources in MOTU lore, vintage minicomics, &#x27;87 movie, filmation, 2002 series as well as references to &quot;Eternity War&quot; storyarc.

==Current &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; properties==

===&quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; (2018–2020)===
On December 12, 2017, DreamWorks Animation SKG and Netflix announced a new reboot series based on &quot;She-Ra Princess of Power&quot; series from the 1980s. The series was executive produced by award-winning author, ND Stevenson (creator of &quot;Nimona&quot; and &quot;Lumberjanes&quot;). The series&#x27; first season of thirteen episodes was released on Netflix November 13, 2018. The DreamWorks series features a new animation style and alternate backstories for many of the characters, many of whom are presented as younger in age and with a more diverse makeup than in the previous 1980s Filmation series. Adora/She-Ra is again presented as a former member of the Horde, befriended by re-imagined versions of Glimmer and Bow (with new voice actors Aimee Carrero, Karen Fukuhara and Marcus Scribner, respectively). Under the direction of Glimmer&#x27;s mother Queen Angella of Bright Moon, the three embark upon re-uniting the Princesses of Etheria, which include Perfuma, Mermista, Entrapta and Frosta, each with re-imagined characters as well. Also appearing in the series are Swift Wind (without the alter ego of Spirit and with a completely different take on the character&#x27;s personality), Light Hope (as a female hologram generated by the &quot;First Ones&quot;), Sea Hawk (now presented as a more comical glory-seeking associate of Mermista), Castaspella (as the sister of Angella&#x27;s husband King Micah), Madame Razz (as an older and confused forest dweller with knowledge of Mara, a prior &quot;She-Ra&quot;), Netossa and Spinnerella.

The evil Horde returns as the villainous overlords of Etheria, and although Hordak remains leader of the Horde, Catra is often presented as the primary antagonist (now voiced by AJ Michalka), with a much stronger relationship established between her and Adora. Shadow Weaver (Lorraine Toussaint) and Scorpia (Lauren Ash) also play prominent roles within the series, and cadets Lonnie, Rogelio and Kyle are introduced (possibly inspired by previous Filmation characters). Overarching galactic villain Horde Prime and a re-imagined shape-shifting Double Trouble enter the series in later seasons, and other previously established villains appearing in lesser roles are Admiral Scurvy, Tung Lashor, Grizzlor, Imp and Octavia. Although no longer directly linked to He-Man or the Masters of the Universe, Eternia, Castle Grayskull and Adora&#x27;s kidnapping as a child are referenced.

===2026 reboot film===

Since 2007, a reboot of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; has been in the works but has gone through development hell with various studios, directors and writers connected to the project. &quot;Variety&quot; reported in 2007 that &quot;Grayskull: Masters of the Universe&quot; would be produced by Joel Silver, and written by Justin Marks, and employing visual special effects to a large degree, as was done with the 2007 war film &quot;300&quot;.

With that deal to reboot the film going nowhere, Warner Bros. announced that John Stevenson, director of &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, was slated to direct the upcoming feature. On May 12, 2009, it was announced that the scripting duties had been handed to newcomer Evan Daugherty, with John Stevenson still attached to direct.

In September 2009, Sony took over the rights from Warner Bros. to produce the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; live-action film after Mattel and Silver couldn&#x27;t agree on creative direction for the film. Sony and Escape Artists&#x27; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch were now developing the project from scratch for Columbia. In April 2010, Sony hired screenwriters Mike Finch and Alex Litvak to draft a new script. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Jon M. Chu was in talks to direct the film. Original He-Man actor Dolph Lundgren did an interview with IGN about possibly appearing in the film as King Randor.

On October 12, 2012, Richard Wenk was hired to rewrite the script for the film. On March 28, 2013, Chu said that the film was still early in its development and that it would not be campy, but rather a dramatic origin story.

On October 7, 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Terry Rossio would write the film; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Steve Tisch were assigned to produce it. The film would be set on Eternia. The site also reported that Chu would not direct the film. On February 26, 2014, it was reported that directors Jeff Wadlow, Mike Cahill, Harald Zwart, and Chris McKay were on the short list to direct the film.

On April 9, 2014, Schmoes Know reported that Wadlow would direct the film, but &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that he was merely rewriting the script. Columbia Pictures Senior Vice President DeVon Franklin tweeted that Jeff Wadlow had completed the script. Franklin later tweeted a photo on his Twitter page of Battle Cat.

On August 19, 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Christopher Yost would rewrite the script. Mike O&#x27;Hearn announced on his Instagram account that he was in training to star as He-Man. However, he then quashed the rumor, saying he only wanted to do the part and was not cast for the live-action movie.

On January 22, 2016, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that McG would direct the film and also oversee a rewrite of the latest script by Alex Litvak and Mike Finch, while Escape Artists&#x27; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch and as well as DeVon Franklin were now on board as producers. On June 24, 2016, Kellan Lutz tweeted on his Twitter page that he had a meeting with both McG and Mary Viola about taking the role of He-Man. McG told IGN that the role of He-Man had not been cast yet, but that Lutz was being looked at very closely for the part. This draft of the script would be set on Eternia, but not exclusively there. In addition, pre-production had moved on to doing makeup testing. McG commented on the film saying, &quot;I think we want to honor the fan base, first and foremost, We also need to be cognizant of the incredible resonance of what Kevin Feige is doing with Marvel, and the balance of full-bodied entertainment. That it&#x27;s both credible and emotional, action-packed, and the story of a hero&#x27;s journey. It&#x27;s the genesis of He-Man, it&#x27;s the becoming of He-Man. We want it to be clicking on all cylinders in that regard. We&#x27;re not going to stop until we get it right.&quot; On April 26, 2017, Sony confirmed that the film would finally be released on December 18, 2019.

Along with the release date confirmation it was announced that McG was no longer directing the film. During the search for his replacement, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that David S. Goyer had been brought in to write the script. In December 2017, further reports said that Goyer was in talks to direct the film; however, in February 2018 &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Goyer had decided to step away as director to focus on other projects, but stated he would remain on board as an executive producer and screenwriter, and that the studio was said to be very happy with the script he turned in and was currently meeting with potential replacements. In April 2018, another &quot;Variety&quot; report stated that Aaron and Adam Nee were set to direct the film.

On January 11, 2019, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Art Marcum and Matt Holloway would rewrite a new draft for the film. Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin on July 15, 2019, and wrap on October 18, 2019, with Prague as one of the shooting locations. On February 13, 2019, it was reported that principal photography on the film would begin in mid-July 2019 in Prague. On March 20, 2019, it was reported that Noah Centineo was in talks to play He-Man. On April 29, 2019, Centineo, in an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, confirmed that he would be playing He-Man in the upcoming film. On May 16, 2019, Sony announced that the film&#x27;s release date was changed to March 5, 2021. In October 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; had reported a rumor that Sony would sell the movie to Netflix. On January 24, 2020, the film has been taken off its release schedule with the film adaptation of &quot;Uncharted&quot;, which also got its release date changed, taking its place before that film changed its release date again. On April 29, 2021, a representative for Centineo announced that he would no longer play He-Man in the film.

On January 28, 2022, it was announced that Netflix had officially acquired the film from Sony and that Kyle Allen would now play He-Man. It was also revealed that David Callaham had written a new draft of the screenplay along with the Nee Brothers, while production was set to begin in 2023. On July 18, 2023, it was announced that Netflix has canceled the film but Mattel was looking for a new studio to buy the project. On November 13, 2023, it was announced that Amazon MGM Studios was in talks to acquire the film. 

On February 13, 2024, it was reported that Travis Knight was in final talks to direct the film. On May 1, 2024, it was officially confirmed that Knight would direct the film for Amazon MGM Studios and Mattel Films. A theatrical release of June 5, 2026 was also revealed. &quot;ParaNorman&quot; director Chris Butler would be writing the screenplay, following initial drafts written by Callaham and the Nee brothers. Mattel Films&#x27; Robbie Brenner, Escape Artists&#x27; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch are producing the film. The film will depict a ten-year-old Prince Adam as he crashes on Earth, separating him from his Power Sword; he would eventually retrieve the sword and take on the mantle of He-Man two decades later as he battles for his home planet, Eternia, against the evil forces of Skeletor. On May 29, 2024, it was announced that Nicholas Galitzine was cast as He-Man. On August 15, 2024, Camila Mendes was cast as Teela. On September 4, 2024, Alison Brie was cast as Evil-Lyn.

The series will be a new, standalone story with no connections with Netflix&#x27;s original animated series &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;. It was announced that Nicole Kassell will direct the series and Heidi Schreck will serve as both a writer and executive producer.

====&quot;Masters of the Universe Origins&quot; (2019–present)====
Mattel began producing Masters of the Universe action figures once again, debuting the Origins line at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019 with a Prince Adam and He-Man two-pack.

<doc id="595944" wikidata="Q715877" url="?curid=595944" title="Carl Gustaf von Rosen">
<text>Count Carl Gustaf Ericsson von Rosen (19 August 1909 – 13 July 1977) was a Swedish pioneer aviator, humanitarian, and mercenary pilot. He flew relief missions in a number of conflicts as well as combat missions for Finland (whose first military aircraft his father had donated in 1918) and Biafra. His flights for the Biafran Air Force were notable for using the small Malmö MFI-9 in a ground attack role.

==Early life and family==
Von Rosen was born in Helgesta, Flen Municipality, Södermanland, Sweden and grew up in Rockelstad Castle. He was the son of the explorer Count Eric von Rosen (1879–1948), co-founder of the National Socialist Bloc, and baroness Mary Fock (1886–1967). He was nephew of Carin Göring, wife of Hermann Göring. Throughout his upbringing, Carl Gustaf appeared to have had serious differences in opinion with his family, with one author referring to him as the &quot;black sheep of his family.&quot; His brother, Björn (1905–1989), was a writer, graphic artist and painter, and his sister, Birgitta Wolf (1913–2009), was a writer and human rights activist. From an early age, Carl Gustaf was interested in mechanics; his subsequent fascination with flying machines was likely influenced by his uncle, who was a fighter ace during World War I (and later head of the German Luftwaffe).

He was a student at Lundsbergs boarding school from 1920 to 1926 and at AB Aeromateriel&#x27;s flight school in 1929 and took the pilot&#x27;s license test the same year. Von Rosen took the airline pilot exam in 1934. Von Rosen himself started his flying career as a mechanic before becoming an aerobatic stunt pilot in a travelling circus.

==Second Italo-Ethiopian War==
When the Kingdom of Italy invaded the independent state of Ethiopia in 1935, von Rosen joined the Swedish Red Cross ambulance mission. He also repeatedly flew casualties out from the battlefield under extremely dangerous conditions. This activity resulted in him receiving mustard gas burns due to the use of the gas by the Italian Air Force.

After his return from the war in Ethiopia, he went to the Netherlands to join the KLM, the first public airline in the world, and became one of their foremost pilots.

==Second World War==
Von Rosen&#x27;s happiness with his second wife, Hanny, ended with the outbreak of World War II. She joined the resistance, was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau in Germany. After the war, she committed suicide in 1949.

When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939 in the Winter War, von Rosen quit his job to fly bombing missions for the Finns. He purchased a KLM Douglas DC-2, had it converted to a bomber in Sweden, and made one operational mission in March 1940 against the Soviet Union with it. Later the same year, as the Germans attacked the Netherlands, von Rosen with a Dutch KLM-crew flew a DC-3 with Dutch government documents to England and applied for service with the RAF but was turned down, on account of his family relation to Hermann Göring. von Rosen went on flying for the Swedish airline AB Aerotransport (ABA) from August 1940 until the end of the war.

==Post-war==
Between 1945 and 1956 von Rosen worked in Ethiopia as the chief instructor for the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force. Afterwards von Rosen was employed by the Swedish charter airline Transair. The company was engaged by the UN during the Congo Crisis 1960. Von Rosen also served as the pilot for the second Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld. However, von Rosen was grounded by illness when Hammarskjöld was killed in an air crash while mediating in the Congo Crisis.

==Biafran War==

Von Rosen&#x27;s involvement in Africa did not end with the Congo Crisis. He gained international fame seven years later when he flew relief missions for aid organisations into war-torn Biafra, a breakaway republic of Nigeria. These flights included flying a DC-7 from São Tomé to Uli at only a little above sea level in August 1968.

Disgusted at the suffering the Nigerian government inflicted on the Biafrans and the continuous harassment of international relief flights by the Nigerian Air Force, he hatched a plan in collaboration with the French secret service to strike back at Nigerian air power. He imported five small civilian single engine MFI-9 planes produced by Malmö Flygindustri, at that time owned by SAAB, which he knew could also be used for a ground attack role in warfare. He had the planes painted in camouflage colours and fitted with license manufactured 68 mm SNEB type rockets, and proceeded with a crew of two Swedes and two Biafrans to form a squadron called &#x27;Biafra Babies&#x27; to strike the air fields from which the federal Nigerian Air Force launched their attacks against the civilian population in Biafra. On 22 May 1969, and over the next few days, von Rosen and his five aircraft launched attacks against Nigerian air fields at Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin and other small airports. The Nigerians were taken by surprise and a number of expensive jets, including a few MiG-17 fighters and three out of Nigeria&#x27;s six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, were destroyed on the ground. The Igbo intellectual Fola Oyewole who fought for Biafra recalled of all the Westerners who served with the Biafrans that Rosen was the most idealistic and the one who cared about the Igbos as a people the most. 

Despite his controversial methods, Count von Rosen would later be remembered for his efforts to modernize relief efforts to remote conflict zones. One of the notable figures assisting Count von Rosen was Lynn Garrison, an ex-RCAF fighter pilot. He introduced the Count to a Canadian method of dropping bagged supplies to remote areas in Canada without losing the contents: a sack of food was placed inside a larger sack before the supply drop. When the package hit the ground, the inner sack would rupture, but the outer one kept the contents intact. With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation. Later models of the Malmö Flygindustri MFI-9 became the SAAB MFI-15 Safari, with official modifications, developed from the Biafran concept, to facilitate the dropping of food supplies from underwing hard points. Von Rosen was utilizing this type in Ogaden when he was killed during a rebel ground assault.

==Return to Ethiopia==
From 1974 to 1977 he flew aid for famine and drought victims in Ethiopia.

The last action Count von Rosen saw was again in Africa in 1977, during the Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia. Again flying famine relief for refugees, he was killed on the ground on 13 July 1977, during a sudden Somali army attack in Gode at the outbreak of the war.

He was buried in Gulale cemetery, Addis Ababa.

==Personal life==
Von Rosen was married 1932–1936 to Stina Maria Theresia (Mille) Wijkmark (1911–1994) and 1938–1943 to Johanna (Hanny) Francina Krijgsman (1912-1949). In 1943 he married Gunvor Lilian Martin (1917– 2009), daughter of the artist Seth Martin and baroness Lily Fock. Von Rosen was the father of Nils Gustaf (born 1932), Margaretha (born 1938), Yvonne (born 1940), Astrid (born 1945), Eric (born 1950) and Carl (born 1953).

<text>The crowned hornbill (Lophoceros alboterminatus) is an African hornbill.

== Description ==
It is a medium-sized bird, in length, and is characterized by its white belly and black back and wings. The tips of the long tail feathers are white. The eyes are yellow; the beak is red and presents a stocky casque on the upper mandible. In females, the casque is smaller. The crowned hornbill can be distinguished from the similar Bradfield&#x27;s hornbill by its shorter beak.

== Habitat ==
The crowned hornbill is a common resident of the coastal and riverine forests of southern (only the eastern coast) to northeastern Africa.

== Diet ==
It forages mainly in trees, where it feeds on insects (often caught in flight), small rodents, small reptiles, eggs, seeds and fruits. This hornbill species can be seen in flocks, usually in the dry season. Four to five white eggs are incubated for 25 to 30 days; the juveniles remain with both parents for about 8 weeks.

<doc id="595948" wikidata="Q754511" url="?curid=595948" title="Southern yellow-billed hornbill">
<text>The southern yellow-billed hornbill (Tockus leucomelas) is a hornbill found in southern Africa. Yellow-billed hornbills feed mainly on the ground, where they forage for seeds, small insects, spiders and scorpions. This hornbill species is a common and widespread resident of dry thornveldt and broad-leafed woodlands. They can often be seen along roads and water courses.

== Description ==

It is a medium-sized bird, in length, in weight and is characterized by a long yellow and down-curved beak. This beak is huge in comparison to its body and can account for up 1/6th of the entire body length. Male beaks are on average 90 mm long while female beaks are an average of 74 mm. Males are generally bigger than females but there is overlap between the sexes. The size difference of the beak is a fairly reliable way of differentiating sex in wild hornbills.

The casque that characterizes all hornbills is of a very modest size in the southern yellow-billed hornbill. It is small, but it covers almost the entire length of the beak in males (less so in females), and may give the impression that they do not actually have a casque. As in all hornbills, the size of the beak actually intrudes on the frontal vision of the bird and the first two neck vertebrae are fused together.

Also, like most other hornbills, they possess a long tail, long eyelashes, stubby legs and stubby toes. The front three toes are fused together near the base.

They have white belly, grey neck, and black back plumage with abundant white spots and stripes. The neck has gray spots and the chest is lightly striated with black. Southern yellow-billed hornbills have no plumage pigmentation save for melanin, which can only produce shades of black and white. The eyes are usually yellow, though brown has also been seen. The skin around the eyes and in the malar stripe is pinkish. The related eastern yellow-billed hornbill from north-eastern Africa has blackish skin around the eyes.

== Distribution and habitat ==
These birds are near endemic to the dry savannas of southern Africa, where they can be found across all longitudes, from Angola and Namibia in the west to Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal in the east, including Botswana, Zimbabwe and northern South Africa.

The southern yellow-billed hornbill lives mostly in the dry, open savannas, but they are also very partial to woodlands when they can find them. When in woodlands, they seem to prefer acacia and broadleaved woodlands. The highest reported concentration of southern yellow-billed hornbill is in open mopane scrub.

== Behaviour ==
The southern yellow-billed hornbill is active during morning, day and evening. At night, it will sleep high in a tree so it won&#x27;t be preyed on. They can be found alone, in couples or in small groups. They generally tend to be loners unless it is breeding season, nesting season or if there is local migration during dry season.

The southern yellow-billed hornbill is often seen searching for food on the ground or in shrubs. It will not dig the ground, but it will overturn debris to find insects. It can also be seen pursuing insects by hopping heavily after it.

They are generally sedentary and they will defend their territories with elaborate displays. However, during the dry season, they will sometimes range widely in order to find food. Couples are usually monogamous and have a clear division of labour between males and females.

They have been known to live for up to 20 years in captivity, though their longevity in the wild remains unknown.

== Flight ==
The southern yellow-billed hornbill flies powerfully. It alternates short gliding periods with heavy wing beats. The southern yellow-billed hornbill lacks the underwing coverts which enhances the flow of air when it flies.

== Vocalization ==
Southern yellow-billed hornbills have a piercing cry. However it has a wide variety of sounds it can make such as, whistling, grunting and caqueting. They will use their loud calls to either delimit their territory or for long-distance communication. Like other &quot;Tockus&quot;, they will often accompany their calls with conspicuous physical displays.

== Diet ==
Southern yellow-billed hornbill eats mostly arthropods, particularly termites, beetles, larvae (beetles and termites), grasshoppers and caterpillars. It has also been seen eating centipedes and scorpions. They will occasionally eat small mammals when they can. To complete the diet, they will regularly eat berries, fruits, nuts and eggs from other species.

Southern yellow-billed hornbill use their beaks as a pair of forceps. They will grasp their food between the tips and then toss it back in their throat where the short, stubby tongue will assist in swallowing the food. The inner cutting edges of the beak are serrated to facilitate the crushing and fragmentation of food. Most of the food is picked from the ground or from low vegetation. Their diet has some overlap with that of the southern ground hornbill .

== Reproduction ==
Breeding season starts when the first autumn rain falls. The breeding season goes from September to march with the egg-laying peak between October and December. Eggs are laid during the wet season so different areas will have different peaks according to the local rainy season. For example, the peak generally occurs from November to February in the eastern regions and from December to March in the northwest regions of the southern yellow-billed hornbill&#x27;s range. These peaks coincide with the peak rainfall of the year.

Young birds become sexually mature when they are one year old. However, before the actual breeding is done, there is the courtship feeding of females, mutual preening, copulation and prospecting of nests sites that must be done.

Once the male southern yellow-billed hornbill has mated, it will stay with his mate and establish a territory that it will defend. The nests are in natural cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks between 1 and 12 meters from the ground. The male then proceeds to bring bark, leaves and grass which will be put on the bottom of the nest. During this time, the female will seal herself inside the nest by blocking the entry with a wall made from her droppings and food remains. The male will help by bringing mud for her to work with.

The only opening left is a vertical slit from the top to the bottom. The male passes the food through the slit with his beak. The female and chick droppings are forcibly expelled through the slit as well. The vertical slit provides good air circulation through convection and when coupled with the wooden walls, it provides a good insulation.

Nests usually contain 2-6 eggs and take about 24 days to hatch. The eggs are white, oval and have finely pitted shells. The chicks are born naked and with pink skin. They and the female are fed by the male who brings back food and drops it through the slit. Most nests will also have a long escape tunnel in case a predator breaks in the nest to eat them.

Taking advantage of the fact that she is imprisoned; the female will shed all of her flight and tail feathers simultaneously and regrow them during the time she stays with the chicks. Once the chicks are half-grown, the female will break out of the nest in order to help the male. The chicks will rebuild the wall themselves and continue to be fed through the slits by the parents. Once the chicks are fully grown, they will break out of the nest and start flying.

== Interactions with humans ==
Hornbills have a unique look, so many cultures give them an important place in their beliefs. Some indigenous tribes revere hornbills as sacred beings that must not be harmed. Others will hunt them for food, to use them in the confection of traditional medicine or to use them in rituals.

<text>Sara Coleridge (23 December 1802 – 3 May 1852) was an English author and translator. She was the third child and only daughter of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his wife Sara Fricker.

Her first works were translations from Latin and medieval French. She then married and had several children for whom she wrote instructive verses. These were published as &quot;Pretty Lessons in Verse for Good Children&quot; in 1834 which included popular poems like &quot;The Months&quot;: &quot;January brings the snow, makes our feet and fingers glow.&quot; In 1837, she published her longest original work – &quot;Phantasmion, A Fairy Tale –&quot; which also started as a story for her son Herbert.

==Early life==

Coleridge was born at Greta Hall, Keswick.
Here, after 1803, the Coleridges, Robert Southey and his wife (Mrs. Coleridge&#x27;s sister), and Mrs. Lovell (another sister), widow of Robert Lovell, the Quaker poet, all lived together; but Coleridge was often away from home; and Uncle Southey was a paterfamilias.
The Wordsworths at Grasmere were their neighbours.

Wordsworth, in his poem, &quot;The Triad&quot;, has left us a description, or poetical glorification, as Sara Coleridge calls it, of the three girls: his own daughter Dora, Edith Southey and Sara Coleridge, the last of the three, though eldest born.
Greta Hall was Sara Coleridge&#x27;s home until her marriage; and the little Lake colony seems to have been her only school. Guided by Southey, and with his ample library at her command, she read by herself the chief Greek and Latin classics, and before she was twenty-five had learnt in addition French, German, Italian and Spanish.

==Career==

In 1822, Sara Coleridge published &quot;Account of the Abipones&quot;, a translation in three large volumes of Martin Dobrizhoffer, undertaken in connection with Southey&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Paraguay&quot;, which had been suggested to him by Dobrizhoffer&#x27;s volumes; and Southey alludes to his niece, the translator (canto, iii, stanza 16), where he speaks of the pleasure the old missionary would have felt if 

In less grandiloquent terms, Charles Lamb, writing about the &quot;Tale of Paraguay&quot; to Southey in 1825, says, &quot;How she Dobrizhoffered it all out, puzzles my slender Latinity to conjecture.&quot; In 1825, her second work appeared, a translation from the medieval French of the &quot;Loyal Serviteur, The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the Feats, Jests, and Prowesses of the Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach: By the Loyal Servant&quot;.

In September 1829, at Crosthwaite Parish Church, Keswick, after an engagement of seven years duration, Sara Coleridge was married to her cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge (1798–1843), younger son of Captain James Coleridge.
He was then a chancery barrister in London.

The first eight years of her married life were spent in a little cottage in Hampstead. There four of her children were born, of whom two survived. 
In 1834, Mrs Coleridge published her &quot;Pretty Lessons in Verse for Good Children; with some Lessons in Latin in Easy Rhyme&quot;. These were originally written for the instruction of her own children, and became very popular.

In 1837, the Coleridges moved to Chester Place, Regent&#x27;s Park; and in the same year appeared &quot;Phantasmion, a Fairy Tale&quot;, Sara Coleridge&#x27;s longest original work, described by critic Mike Ashley as &quot;the first fairytale novel written in English&quot;.

The literary historian Dennis Butts describes &quot;Phantasmion&quot; as a &quot;remarkable pioneering fantasy&quot; and &quot;an extraordinary monument to her talent&quot;. The songs in &quot;Phantasmion&quot; were much admired in their time by Leigh Hunt and other critics. Some, such as &quot;Sylvan Stag&quot; and &quot;One Face Alone&quot;, are notably graceful and musical and the whole fairy tale has beauty of story and richness of language. Some scholars of the fantasy genre call &quot;Phantasmion&quot; a possible influence on George MacDonald.

==Later life==
In 1843, Henry Coleridge died, leaving to his widow the unfinished task of editing her father&#x27;s works. To these she added some compositions of her own, among which are the essay &quot;On Rationalism, with a special application to the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration&quot; appended to Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Aids to Reflection&quot;, the preface added to &quot;Essays on his Own Times, by S. T. Coleridge&quot;, and the introduction to &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;.

In 1850, Coleridge discovered a lump in her breast. Her physician decided not to operate, prescribing cod liver oil and opium. Knowing there was no cure, she waited for the disease to take its course. &quot;I live in constant fear&quot;, Coleridge wrote, &quot;like the Ancient Mariner with the Albatross hung about his neck, I have a weight always upon me.&quot;

Shortly before she died she amused herself by writing a little autobiography for her daughter.
This, which reaches only to her ninth year, was completed by her daughter, and published in 1873, together with some of her letters, under the title &quot;Memoirs and Letters of Sara Coleridge&quot;.
The letters show a cultured and highly speculative mind.
They contain many apt criticisms of known people and books, and are specially interesting for their allusions to Wordsworth and the Lake Poets.
Sara Coleridge died of breast cancer in London on 3 May 1852.

==Family==
Coleridge suffered a number of miscarriages and only two of her children, Herbert and Edith, survived to adulthood. Two of Coleridge&#x27;s children died in infancy.

Her son, Herbert Coleridge (1830–1861), won a double first class in classics and mathematics at Oxford in 1852. 
He was secretary to a committee appointed by the Philological Society to consider the project of a standard English dictionary, a scheme of which the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot;, published by the Clarendon Press, was the ultimate outcome.
His personal researches into the subject were contained in his &quot;Glossarial Index to the Printed English Literature of the Thirteenth Century&quot; (1859).

Her daughter, Edith Coleridge, edited a biography of Sara, &quot;The Memoir and Letters of Sara Coleridge&quot; (1873), which helped to preserve her mother&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Megophryidae, commonly known as goose frogs, is a large family of frogs native to the warm southeast of Asia, from the Himalayan foothills eastwards, south to Indonesia and the Greater Sunda Islands in Maritime Southeast Asia, and extending to the Philippines. Fossil remains are also known from North America. it encompasses 246 species of frogs divided between five genera. For lack of a better vernacular name, they are commonly called megophryids.

==Morphology==
The megophryids are notable for their camouflage, especially those that live in forests, which often look like dead leaves. The camouflage is accurate to the point of some having skin folds that look like leaf veins, and at least one species, the long-nosed horned frog (&quot;Megophrys montana&quot;) has sharp projections extending past the eye and nose, which disguise the frog shape.

Megophryids range in size from in length. The adults&#x27; tongues are noticeably paddle-shaped. Their tadpoles can be found in a variety of waters, but especially ponds and streams. The tadpoles are extremely diverse in form because of the variety of habitats they inhabit.

==Genera==
The following genera are recognised in the family Megophryidae; &quot;Amphibian Species of the World&quot; and AmphibiaWeb differ on the number of species per genera, leading to the variability in numbers:
* Subfamily Leptobrachiinae (pseudomoustache toads; 216 species)
** &quot;Leptobrachella&quot; (Borneo frogs; 85-93 species)
** &quot;Leptobrachium&quot; (eastern spadefoot toads; 38 species)
**&quot;Leptolalax&quot; (50 species)
** &quot;Oreolalax&quot; (19 species)
** &quot;Scutiger&quot; (cat-eyed toads; 24 species)
*Subfamily Megophryinae (124 species) 
** &quot;Atympanophrys&quot; (hidden-tympanum horned toads; 3-4 species)
** &quot;Boulenophrys&quot; (Chinese horned toads; 65 species)
**&quot;Brachytarsophrys&quot; (Karin Hills frogs; 8 species)
**&quot;Grillitschia&quot; (2 species)
**&quot;Jingophrys&quot; (diminutive horned toads; 6 species)
**&quot;Megophrys&quot; (Indonesian horned toads; 5-8 species)
**&quot;Ophryophryne&quot; (narrow-mouth horned toads; 6 species)
**&quot;Pelobatrachus&quot; (clay horned toads; 7 species)
**&quot;Sarawakiphrys&quot; (Sarawak horned toads; 1 species)
**&quot;Xenophrys&quot; (strange-horned toads; 28-31 species)

==Evolution==
The origin of this group of frogs was largely unknown, due to the lack of members of this family in the fossil record. While the family was originally considered to have originated in the early-mid Cretaceous (100-126 mya) via fossils of related frog groups, a study in early 2017 revealed that this was likely an overestimation. Using DNA sequencing, the study indicated the group more likely originated much later during the Cretaceous period, around 77 mya. The study also indicated that there are likely many more new species in the family that are currently unknown to science.

While the family is currently restricted to Asia, fossils indicate that it once had a much wider distribution extending to North America. The earliest known fossils of this family are from the Eocene of Wyoming in the United States.

<text>Thomas Girtin (18 February 17759 November 1802) was an English watercolourist and etcher. A friend and rival of J. M. W. Turner, Girtin played a key role in establishing watercolour as a reputable art form.

==Life==

Thomas Girtin was born in Southwark, London, the son of a wealthy brushmaker of Huguenot descent. His father died while he was a child, and his mother then married a Mr Vaughan, a pattern-draughtsman. Girtin learnt drawing as a boy (attending classes with Thomas Malton), and was apprenticed to the topographical watercolourist Edward Dayes. Girtin is believed to have served out his seven-year term, although there are unconfirmed reports of clashes between master and apprentice, and even that Dayes had Girtin imprisoned as a refractory apprentice. Dayes did not appreciate his pupil&#x27;s talent, and he was to write dismissively of Girtin after his death.

While a teenager, Girtin became friends with the young J. M. W. Turner. The boys were employed to colour prints with watercolours. Girtin exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1794. His architectural and topographical sketches and drawings established his reputation, his use of watercolour for landscapes being such as to give him the credit of having created Romantic watercolour painting. He went on sketching tours, visiting the north of England, North Wales and the West Country. By 1799, he had acquired influential patrons such as Lady Sutherland and the art collector Sir George Beaumont. Girtin was the dominant member of the Brothers, a sketching society of professional artists and talented amateurs.

In 1800, Girtin married Mary Ann Borrett, the 16-year-old daughter of a wealthy City goldsmith, and set up home in St George&#x27;s Row, Hyde Park, next door to the painter Paul Sandby. By 1801, by this time suffering from deteriorating health, he was a welcome houseguest at his patrons&#x27; country houses such as Harewood House and Mulgrave Castle, and able to charge 20 guineas for a painting. 

In late 1801 to early 1802, Girtin spent five and a half months in Paris, where he painted watercolours. He made a series the pencil sketches that he engraved on his return to London, and which were posthumously published as &quot;Twenty Views in Paris and its Environs&quot;. In 1802, Girtin produced a panorama of London, the &quot;Eidometropolis&quot;, high and in circumference, which was exhibited that year. It was noted for its naturalistic treatment of urban light and atmosphere. In November 1802, Girtin died in his painting room; the cause was variously reported as asthma, consumption, or &quot;ossification of the heart.&quot; He was buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden in London.

==Style and technique==

Girtin&#x27;s early landscapes are akin to 18th-century topographical sketches, but in later years he developed a bolder, more spacious, romantic style, which had a lasting influence on English painting. The scenery of the north encouraged him to create a new watercolour palette of warm browns, slate greys, indigo and purple. He abandoned the practice of undershadowing in grey wash and then adding pastel patches of colour, in favour of broad washes of strong colour, and experimented with the use of pen, brown ink and varnish to add richer tones. Girtin&#x27;s early death reportedly caused Turner to remark, &quot;Had Tom Girtin lived I should have starved.&quot; His most celebrated work, much admired by Turner, was &quot;The White House at Chelsea&quot; (1800).

===Exhibitions and retrospectives===
The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum have collections of Girtin&#x27;s works. The British Museum was given watercolours by the collector Chambers Hall. In July 2002 Tate Britain organised an exhibition, &quot;Thomas Girtin: The Art of Watercolour&quot; which aimed to &quot;reveal his technical genius&quot;. An online catalogue raisonné of the artist, edited by Greg Smith, was published by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in 2022.

<text>At Home with the Snails is a surrealist BBC Radio 4 comedy, written by Gerard Foster, about a dysfunctional British family. The cast includes Geoffrey Palmer as George Fisher, Angela Thorne as Beverly Fisher, Gerard Foster as Alex, Miranda Hart as Rose, and Debra Stephenson as Hosanna. It was produced by Jane Berthoud.

&quot;At Home with the Snails&quot; is often repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

The story features Alex&#x27;s obsession with snails, killing them, collecting them, having sexual desires for them and by season two, even attempting to turn into one. In the second season his mother and father (George and Beverly) decide to fake their own deaths and spy on their son in order to write a book about his descent into madness.

George is a pompous academic who puts his obscure, pretentious and pointless pontificating above all else including his family. He encourages Alex&#x27;s snail obsession to get material for his books. Beverly, his sexually frustrated wife makes &quot;nice things&quot;, such as a &quot;family mug tree&quot;. In one episode she develops racial dysphoria, and starts painting her face with boot polish, believing that she is a black person trapped in a white body. Their daughter Rose has her heart in the wrong place - jammed under her armpit. She runs a confectionery shop selling &quot;chocolate excretions&quot; and &quot;jelly war babies&quot;.

<doc id="595962" wikidata="Q188657" url="?curid=595962" title="Striped hyena">
<text>The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) is a species of hyena native to North and East Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. It is the only extant species in the genus Hyaena. It is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, as the global population is estimated to be under 10,000 mature individuals which continues to experience deliberate and incidental persecution along with a decrease in its prey base such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations.

It is the smallest of the bone-cracking hyenas and retains many primitive viverrid-like characteristics lost in larger species, having a smaller and less specialised skull. Though primarily a scavenger, large specimens have been known to kill their own prey, and attacks on humans have occurred in rare instances. The striped hyena is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs. A nocturnal animal, the striped hyena typically only emerges in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise. Although it has a habit of feigning death when attacked, it has been known to stand its ground against larger predators in disputes over food.

The striped hyena features prominently in Middle Eastern and Asian folklore. In some areas, its body parts are considered magical, and are used as charms or talismans. It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it is referred to as &quot;tzebua&quot; or &quot;zevoa&quot;, though it is absent in some Bible translations into English. Ancient Greeks knew it as &quot;γλάνος&quot; (glános) and &quot;ύαινα&quot; (húaina) and were familiar with it from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor. The striped hyena is the national animal of Lebanon.

== Evolution ==
The species may have evolved from &quot;Hyaenictitherium namaquensis&quot; of Pliocene Africa. Striped hyena fossils are common in Africa, with records going back as far as the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the Mediterranean region, it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extirpation of spotted hyenas from Asia at the end of the last glacial period. The striped hyena occurred for some time in Europe during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in France and Germany. It also occurred in Montmaurin, Hollabrunn in Austria, the Furninha Cave in Portugal, and the Genista Caves in Gibraltar. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the brown hyena.

== Description ==
===Build===
The striped hyena has a fairly massive, but short torso set on long legs. The hind legs are significantly shorter than the forelimbs, thus causing the back to slope downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the carpal region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region. The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws. The tail is short and the terminal hairs do not descend below the achilles tendon. The female striped hyena&#x27;s genitalia are transiently masculinized, although it lacks the enlarged clitoris and false scrotal sack noted in the female genitalia of the spotted hyena. The female has 3 pairs of nipples. Adult weight can range from , averaging at about . Body length can range from , not counting a tail of , and shoulder height is between . The male has a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands open into it from above the anus. Several sebaceous glands are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them. The anus can be everted up to a length of 5 cm, and is everted during social interaction and mating. When attacked, the striped hyena everts its rectum and sprays a pungent smelling liquid from its anal glands. Its sense of smell is acute, though its eyesight and sense of hearing are weak.

The skull is entirely typical of the genus, having a very high sagittal crest, a shortened facial region and an inflated frontal bone. The skull of the striped hyena differs from that of the brown and spotted hyena by its smaller size and slightly less massive build. It is nonetheless still powerfully structured and well adapted to anchoring exceptionally strong jaw muscles which give it enough bite-force to splinter a camel&#x27;s thigh bone. Although the dentition is overall smaller than that of the spotted hyena, the upper molar of the striped hyena is far larger. The dental formula is .

=== Fur ===
The winter coat is unusually long and uniform for an animal its size, with a luxuriant mane of tough, long hairs along the back from the occiput to the base of the tail. The coat is generally coarse and bristly, though this varies according to season. In winter, the coat is fairly dense, soft, and has well-developed underfur. The guard hairs are 50–75 mm long on the flanks, 150–225 mm long on the mane and 150 mm on the tail. In summer, the coat is much shorter and coarser, and lacks underfur, though the mane remains large.

In winter, the coat is usually of a dirty-brownish grey or dirty grey colour. The hairs of the mane are light grey or white at the base, and black or dark brown at the tips. The muzzle is dark, greyish brown, brownish-grey or black, while the top of the head and cheeks are more lightly coloured. The ears are almost black. A large black spot is present on the front of the neck, and is separated from the chin by a light zone. A dark field ascends from the flanks ascending to the rear of the cheeks. The inner and outer surface of the forelegs are covered with small dark spots and transverse stripes. The flanks have four indistinct dark vertical stripes and rows of diffused spots. The outer surface of the thighs has 3–4 distinct vertical or oblique dark bands which merge into transverse stripes in the lower portion of the legs. The tip of the tail is black with white underfur.

=== Geographic variation ===
, no subspecies are recognised. The striped hyena is nonetheless a geographically varied animal. Hyenas in the Arabian peninsula have an accentuated blackish dorsal mane, with mid-dorsal hairs reaching 20 cm in length. The base colour of Arabian hyenas is grey to whitish grey, with dusky grey muzzles and buff yellow below the eyes. Hyenas in Israel have a dorsal crest which is mixed grey and black in colour, rather than being predominantly black. The largest striped hyenas come from the Middle East, Asia Minor, Central and the Indian subcontinent, while those of East Africa and the Arabian peninsula are smaller.

== Behaviour ==

=== Social and territorial behaviours ===
The striped hyena is a primarily nocturnal animal, which typically only leaves its den at the onset of total darkness, returning before sunrise. Striped hyenas typically live alone or in pairs, though groups of up to seven animals are known in Libya. They are generally not territorial animals, with home ranges of different groups often overlapping each other. Home ranges in the Serengeti have been recorded to be -, while one in the Negev was calculated at . When marking their territory, striped hyenas use the paste of their anal pouch (hyena butter) to scent mark grass, stalks, stones, tree trunks, and other objects. In aggressive encounters, the black patch near the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is erected. When fighting, striped hyenas will bite at the throat and legs, but avoid the mane, which serves as a signalling device. When greeting each other, they lick the mid-back region, sniff each other&#x27;s noses, extrude their anal pouch, or paw each other&#x27;s throats. The species is not as vocal as the spotted hyena, its vocalisations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling.
=== Reproduction and development ===
The striped hyena is monogamous, with the male establishing the den with the female, helping her raise and feed when cubs are born. The mating season varies according to location; in Transcaucasia, striped hyenas breed in January–February, while those in southeast Turkmenia breed in October–November. In captivity, breeding is non-seasonal. Mating can occur at any time of the day, during which the male grips the skin of the female&#x27;s neck.

The gestation period lasts 90–91 days. Striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings, closed eyes, and small ears. This is in marked contrast to newborn spotted hyena cubs which are born almost fully developed, though with black, unmarked coats. Their eyes open after 7–8 days, and the cubs leave their dens after one month. Cubs are weaned at the age of 2 months, and are then fed by both parents. By autumn, the cubs are half the size of their parents. In the wild, striped hyenas can live for 12 years, while in captivity they have been known to reach 23.

=== Burrowing behaviours ===
The striped hyena may dig its own dens, but it also establishes its lairs in caves, rock fissures, erosion channels, and burrows formerly occupied by porcupines, wolves, warthogs, and aardvarks. Hyena dens can be identified by the presence of bones at their entrances. The striped hyena hides in caves, niches, pits, dense thickets, reeds, and plume grass during the day to shelter from predators, heat, or winter cold. The size and elaboration of striped hyena dens varies according to location; dens in the Karakum have entrances 0.67–0.72 m wide and are extended over a distance of 4.15–5 m, with no lateral extensions or special chambers. In contrast, hyena dens in Israel are much more elaborate and large, exceeding 27 m in length.

=== Diet ===

The striped hyena is primarily a scavenger which feeds mainly on ungulate carcasses in different stages of decomposition, fresh bones, cartilages, ligaments, and bone marrow. It crushes long bones into fine particles and swallows them, though sometimes entire bones are eaten whole. The striped hyena is not a fussy eater, though it has an aversion to vulture flesh. It will occasionally attack and kill any animal it can overcome. It hunts prey by running it down, grabbing its flanks or groin and inflicting mortal wounds by tearing out the viscera. In Turkmenistan, the species is recorded to feed on wild boar, kulan, porcupines, and tortoises. A seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits is an important food source in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, while in the Caucasus, it is grasshoppers. In Israel, the striped hyena feeds on garbage, carrion, and fruits. In eastern Jordan, its main sources of food are feral horse and water buffalo carcasses and village refuse. It has been suggested that only the large hyenas of the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent attack large prey, with no evidence of their smaller Arabian and east African cousins doing so. Because of its scavenging diet, the striped hyena requires more water to survive than most other carnivores. When eating, the striped hyena gorges itself until satisfied, though hyenas with cubs will transport food to their dens. Because of the high content of calcium in its diet, the feces of the striped hyena becomes white very rapidly, and can be visible from long distances.

=== Relationships with other predators ===

The striped hyena competes with the grey wolf in the Middle East and central Asia. In the latter area, a great portion of the hyena&#x27;s diet stems from wolf-killed carcasses. In Israel the striped hyena is dominant over the wolf on a one-to-one basis, though wolves in packs can displace single hyenas from carcasses. Both species have been known to share dens on occasion. On rare occasions, striped hyenas are also known to travel with and live amongst wolf packs, with each doing the other no harm. Both predators may benefit from this unusual alliance, as the hyenas have better senses of smell and greater strength, and the wolves may be better at tracking large prey.

Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter&#x27;s stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh which is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena&#x27;s attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed.

The species frequently scavenges from the kills of felids such as tigers, leopards, cheetahs, and caracals. A caracal can drive a subadult hyena from a carcass. The hyena usually wins in one-to-one disputes over carcasses with leopards, cheetahs, and tiger cubs, but is dominated by adult tigers. In addition, the hyena is sympatric with the Asiatic lion in Gir Forest National Park, and the sloth bear in Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary, in the Indian State of Gujarat.

== Distribution and habitat==

The striped hyena&#x27;s historical range encompassed Africa north of and including the Sahel zone, eastern Africa south into Tanzania, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East up to the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey, Iraq, the Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia), Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan (excluding the higher areas of Hindukush), and the Indian Subcontinent. Today the species&#x27; distribution is patchy in most ranges, thus indicating that it occurs in many isolated populations, particularly in most of west Africa, most of the Sahara, parts of the Middle East, the Caucasus, and central Asia. It does however have a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Its modern distribution in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan is unknown with some sizable large number in India in open areas of Deccan Plateau.
== In culture ==
=== In folklore, religion, and mythology ===

Striped hyenas are frequently referenced in Middle Eastern literature and folklore, typically as symbols of treachery and stupidity. In the Near and Middle East, striped hyenas are generally regarded as physical incarnations of jinns. Zakariya al-Qazwini (1204–1283) wrote in Arabic of a tribe of people called &quot;Hyena People&quot;. In his book &quot;Marvels of Creatures and the Strange Things Existing&quot; (), he wrote that should one of this tribe be in a group of 1,000 people, a hyena could pick him out and eat him. A Persian medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure cannibalistic people known as &quot;kaftar&quot; who are said to be &quot;half-man, half-hyena&quot;. Al-Doumairy in his writings in &quot;Hawayan Al-Koubra&quot; (1406) wrote that striped hyenas were vampiric creatures that attacked people at night and sucked the blood from their necks. He also wrote that hyenas only attacked brave people. Arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones. Until the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the bodies of werewolves, if not destroyed, would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas which drank the blood of dying soldiers. The image of striped hyenas in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Palestine is more varied. Though feared, striped hyenas were also symbolic of love and fertility, leading to numerous varieties of love medicine derived from hyena body parts. Among the Baloch people, witches or magicians are said to ride striped hyenas at night.

The Arabic word for striped hyenas is alluded in a valley in Israel known as Shaqq al-Diba (meaning &quot;cleft of the hyenas&quot;) and Wadi Abu Diba (meaning &quot;valley of the hyenas&quot;). Both places have been interpreted by some scholars as being the Biblical Valley of Zeboim mentioned in 1 Samuel 13:18. The Hebrew word for hyena is &quot;tsavoa&quot;, which literally means &quot;colored creature&quot; (compare &quot;litzboa&quot; &quot;to color, to paint, to dye&quot;). Though the King James Version of the Bible interprets this word (which appears in the Book of Jeremiah 12:9) as referring to a &quot;speckled bird&quot;, Henry Baker Tristram argued that it was most likely a hyena being mentioned.

In Gnosticism, the Archon Astaphaios is depicted with a hyænid face.

=== Predation on livestock and crops ===

The striped hyena is sometimes implicated in the killing of livestock, particularly goats, sheep, dogs and poultry. Larger stock is sometimes reportedly taken, though it is possible that these are cases of scavenging mistaken for actual predation. Although most attacks occur at low densities, a substantial number reputedly occur in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, and possibly Morocco.

In Turkmenistan, striped hyenas kill dogs, while they also kill sheep and other small animals in the Caucasus, and were even reported to have killed horses and donkeys in Iraq during the mid-twentieth century. Sheep, dogs, horses, and goats are also preyed upon in North Africa, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, and India.

Striped hyenas also cause damage on occasion to melon fields and to date palms in date plantations in Israel and Egypt, and to plantations of watermelons and plantations of honey melons in Turkmenistan.

=== Attacks on humans and grave desecration ===

In ordinary circumstances, striped hyenas are extremely timid around humans, though they may show bold behaviours toward people at night. On rare occasions, striped hyenas have preyed on humans. In the 1880s, a hyena was reported to have attacked humans, especially sleeping children, over a three-year period in the Erivan Governorate, with 25 children and 3 adults being wounded in one year. The attacks provoked local authorities into announcing a reward of 100 rubles for every hyena killed. Further attacks were reported later in some parts of Transcaucasia, particularly in 1908. Instances are known in Azerbaijan of striped hyenas killing children sleeping in courtyards during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942, a guard sleeping in his hut was mauled by a hyena in Golyndzhakh. Cases of children being taken by hyenas by night are known in southeast Turkmenia&#x27;s Bathyz Nature Reserve. A further attack on a child was reported around Serakhs in 1948. Several attacks have occurred in India; in 1962, nine children were thought to have been taken by hyenas in the town of Bhagalpur in the Bihar State in a six-week period and 19 children up to the age of four were killed by hyenas in Karnataka and Bihar in 1974. A census on wild animal attacks during a five-year period in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh showed that hyenas had only attacked three people, the lowest figure when compared to deaths caused by wolves, gaur, boar, elephants, tigers, leopards, and sloth bears.

Though attacks on live humans are rare, striped hyenas will scavenge on human corpses. In Turkey, stones are placed on graves to stop hyenas digging the bodies out. In World War I, the Turks imposed conscription (&quot;safar barlek&quot;) on mount Lebanon; people escaping from the conscription fled north, where many died and were subsequently eaten by hyenas.

=== Hunting ===

Striped hyenas were hunted by Ancient Egyptian peasants for duty and amusement along with other animals that were a threat to crops and livestock. Algerian hunters historically considered the killing of striped hyenas as beneath their dignity, due to the animal&#x27;s reputation for cowardice. A similar attitude was held by British sportsmen in British India. Although striped hyenas are capable of quickly killing a dog with a single bite, they usually feign death when escape from hunting dogs is impossible, and will remain in this state for long periods, even when badly bitten. On some rare occasions, hyenas were ridden down and speared by men on horseback. Although hyenas were generally not fast enough to outrun horses, they had the habit of doubling and turning frequently during chases, thus ensuring long pursuits. Generally though, hyenas were hunted more as pests than sporting quarries; their scavenging damages skulls, skins and other articles from hunter&#x27;s camps, which made them unpopular among sportsmen. In the Soviet Union, hyena hunting was not specially organised. Most hyenas were caught incidentally in traps meant for other animals. Some hunters in southern Punjab, Kandahar, and Quetta, catch striped hyenas to use them in hyena-baiting. The hyenas are pitted against specially trained dogs, and are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary. In Kandahar, hunters locally called &quot;payloch&quot; (naked foot) hunt striped hyenas by entering their dens naked with a noose in hand. When the hyena is cornered at the end of its lair, the hunter murmurs the magic formula &quot;turn into dust, turn into stone,&quot; which causes the animal to enter a hypnotic state of total submission, by which point the hunter can slip a noose over its forelegs and, finally, drag it out of the cave. A similar method was once practised by Mesopotamian Arab hunters, who would enter hyena dens and &quot;flatter&quot; the animal, which they believed could understand Arabic. The hunter would murmur &quot;You are very nice and pretty and quite like a lion; indeed, you are a lion&quot;. The hyena would then allow the hunter to place a noose around its neck and pose no resistance on being dragged out of its lair.

The fur is coarse and sparse, with the few skins sold by hunters often being marketed as poor quality dog or wolf fur. Hyena skins were however once used in preparing chamois leather. The selling price of hyena pelts in the Soviet Union ranged from 45 kopeks to 1 ruble, 80 kopeks.

=== Striped hyenas as food ===

A mural depicted on Mereruka&#x27;s tomb in Sakkara indicates that Old Kingdom Egyptians forcefed hyenas in order to fatten them up for food, though archaeologist Burchard Brentjes argued that the depicted animals represent an extinct population of Egyptian aardwolves. European writers in the 19th and early 20th centuries recorded that striped hyenas were eaten by some Egyptian peasants, Arabian Bedouins, Palestinian laborers, Sinai Bedouins, Tuaregs, and in Somalia. Among some Bedouins of Arabia at the beginning of the 20th century, hyena meat was generally considered medicine, rather than food.

=== Striped hyenas in folk magic ===
The Ancient Greeks and Romans believed the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, skin, and fat, as well as the ash of different parts of the striped hyena&#x27;s body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena &quot;would hold a couple peaceably together&quot; and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently play an important role in love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk&#x27;s &quot;baraka&quot;. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man&#x27;s genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (&quot;kus&quot;) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva at the woman of his desire, he will invariably get hold of her. This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of &quot;kus-e kaftar bay&quot;, as well as in Pashto of &quot;kus-e kaftar&quot; which literally mean &quot;it happens as smoothly as if you would look through the vulva of a female striped hyena&quot;. In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression &quot;to possess the anus of a [striped] hyena&quot; which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena&#x27;s penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons.

=== Tameability ===

The striped hyena is easily tamed and can be fully trained, particularly when they are young. Although the Ancient Egyptians did not consider striped hyenas sacred, they did supposedly tame them for use in hunting. When they are raised with a firm hand, they may eventually become affectionate and as amenable as well-trained dogs, though they emit a strong odour which no amount of bathing will cover. Although they kill dogs in the wild, striped hyenas raised in captivity can form bonds with them.

<doc id="595974" wikidata="Q28157482" url="?curid=595974" title="Brown hyena">
<text>The brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea), also called strandwolf, is a species of hyena found in Namibia, Botswana, western and southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique and South Africa. It is the only extant species in the genus Parahyaena. It is currently the rarest species of hyena. The largest remaining brown hyena population is located in the southern Kalahari Desert and coastal areas in Southwest Africa. The global population of brown hyena is estimated by IUCN at a number between 4,000 and 10,000 and its conservation status is marked as near threatened in the IUCN Red List.

==Description==

Brown hyenas are distinguished from other species by their long shaggy dark brown coat, pointed ears, and short tail. Their legs are striped brown and white, and adults have a distinct cream-colored fur ruff around their necks. Erectile hairs up to in length cover the neck and back and bristles during agonistic behavior. Body length is on average with a range of . Shoulder height is and the tail is long. Unlike the larger spotted hyena, there are no sizable differences between the sexes, although males may be slightly larger than females. An average adult male weighs , while an average female weighs . Brown hyenas have powerful jaws, and young animals can crack the leg bones of springboks in five minutes, though this ability deteriorates with age and dental wear. The skulls of brown hyenas are larger than those of the closely related striped hyena, and their dentition is more robust, indicating a less generalized dietary adaptation.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The brown hyena inhabits desert areas, semi-desert, and open woodland savannahs in Southern Africa. It can survive close to urban areas by scavenging. The brown hyena is not dependent on the ready availability of water sources for frequent drinking and favors rocky, mountainous areas, as these provide shade. It has home ranges of in size.

==Fossil record==
Today, the brown hyena only inhabits Southern Africa, but in the past it lived also in the Iberian Peninsula and perhaps in other parts of Europe, indicated by fossils found in the area of Granada from the Upper Pliocene. Early Pleistocene brown hyenas are known to have fed on hominins, though whether this constituted scavenging or active predation is unclear. During the Middle Pleistocene, it inhabited what is now Kenya. Latrines made by brown hyenas have been discovered in South Africa dating back to the Middle Pleistocene. There is the possibility that &quot;Parahyaena&quot; may be synonymous with the extinct &quot;Pachycrocuta&quot;, making the brown hyena the only extant member of this genus.

==Ecology and behavior==
In the Kalahari, 80% of a brown hyena&#x27;s activity time is spent at night, searching for food in an area on spanning on average, with territories of having been recorded. They may cache excess food in shrubs or holes and recover it within 24 hours.

===Social behavior===
Brown hyenas have a social hierarchy comparable to that of wolves, with a mated pair and their offspring. They live in clans composed of extended families of four to six individuals. Clans defend their territory, and all members cooperate in raising cubs. Territories are marked by &#x27;pasting&#x27;, during which the hyena deposits secretions from its large anal gland, which is located below the base of the tail and produces a black and white paste, on vegetation and boulders. Brown hyenas maintain a stable clan hierarchy through ritualized aggressive displays and mock fights. A brown hyena male can move up in rank by killing a higher ranking male in confrontation, while the alpha female is usually just the oldest female in the clan. Emigration is common in brown hyena clans, particularly among young males, which will join other groups upon reaching adulthood.

===Diet===
Brown hyenas are primarily scavengers the bulk of whose diet consists of carcasses killed by larger predators, but they may supplement their diet with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit and fungi (the desert truffle &quot;Kalaharituber pfeilii&quot;). As they are poor hunters, live prey makes up only a small proportion of their diet: in the southern Kalahari, species such as springhare, springbok lambs, bat-eared foxes and korhaans constitute only 4.2% of their overall diet, while on the Namib coast, cape fur seal pups compose 2.9% of their food. They have an exceptional sense of smell and can locate carcasses kilometers away. They are aggressive kleptoparasites, frequently appropriating the kills of black-backed jackals, cheetahs and leopards. Single brown hyenas may charge at leopards with their jaws held wide open and can tree adult male leopards; they have been observed treeing leopards even when no kill was in contention. In the Kalahari Desert, they are often the dominant mammalian carnivores present because of this behavior and the relative scarcity of lions, spotted hyenas, and packs of African wild dogs. In areas where their territories overlap, brown hyenas may, on rare occasions, be killed by spotted hyenas and lions. Brown hyena cubs are also susceptible to being killed by wild dogs and jackals.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

The brown hyena does not have a mating season. Female brown hyenas are polyestrous and typically produce their first litter when they are two years old. They mate primarily from May to August. Males and females in the same clan usually do not mate with each other, rather females will mate with nomadic males. Clan males display no resistance to this behavior, and will assist the females in raising their cubs. Females give birth in dens, which are hidden in remote sand dunes far from the territories of spotted hyenas and lions. The gestation period is around 3 months. Mothers generally produce one litter every 20 months. Usually, only the dominant female breeds, but if two litters are born in the same clan, the mothers will nurse each other&#x27;s cubs, though favoring their own. Litters usually consist of 1–5 cubs, which weigh at birth. Unlike spotted hyenas, brown hyenas are born with their eyes closed, and open them after eight days. Cubs are weaned at 12 months and leave their dens after 18 months. Also unlike spotted hyenas, all adult members of the clan will carry food back to the cubs. They are not fully weaned and do not leave the vicinity of their den until they reach 14 months of age. Brown hyenas reach full size at an age of around 30 months and have a life span of about 12 to 15 years.

== Threats and conservation status ==
The global brown hyena population is estimated to comprise 4,000 to 10,000 individuals. It is listed as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. The major threat to the brown hyena is human persecution, based on the mistaken belief that it is harmful to livestock. Farmers find brown hyenas scavenging on livestock carcasses and wrongly assume that they have killed their property. Brown hyena body parts are also occasionally used for traditional medicines and rituals. The brown hyena is not in high demand for trophy hunting.

There are several conservation areas that are home to the brown hyena, including the Etosha National Park in Namibia, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. The maintenance of these protected areas aids in the conservation of these animals. Educational campaigns are being utilized to promote awareness about hyenas and dispel prevailing myths, while problem individuals are removed from farmlands and urbanized areas.

<text>Rob Kutner is an American comedy writer-producer.

==Career==
As a writer for &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;, he was nominated for a 2003 Writers&#x27; Guild of America Award. After &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot; left the air, Kutner went on to write for &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, where he has won five Emmies to date. Additionally, he has won a Peabody Award and an award from the Television Critics&#x27; Association, and a Grammy for contributing to the bestselling book/audiobook &quot;America (The Book)&quot;. He was a writer for &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; until January 22, 2010 and has stayed on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s writing staff for the TBS television program, &quot;Conan&quot;. Since then, he has written for animated shows including &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, &quot;Ben 10&quot;, and &quot;Angry Birds: Summer Madness&quot;, and developed animated shows for the Syfy network and Warner Brothers Animation. He also co-created the topical sketch comedy show &quot;Gander&quot;,] and is currently Head Writer of &quot;God&#x27;s Gang&quot;, an independently produced action-comedy animated series featuring a team of interfaith heroes, that has garnered over 2 million subscribers online. 

In 2003, Kutner wrote the short film &quot;Pie Chi&quot;, which has been seen at numerous festivals and was broadcast on Showtime Television. His humor pieces have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. In 2016, he created the scripted podcast miniseries &quot;Runaway Brains&quot;, starring &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and Ken Jennings.

His book &quot;Apocalypse How&quot; (Running Press/Perseus), a humorous guide on how to &quot;make the end times the best of times,&quot; was released in May 2008 and was a national bestseller. His Kindle Single, &quot;The Future According to Me,&quot; was released in July 2011. &quot;The Future According to Me&quot; was released as an Audible audiobook in June 2015, featuring voice performances by Emo Phillips, Kurt Andersen, Cecil Baldwin, and Eddie Pepitone. Kutner was also a co-creator of the comedy-music album &quot;2776&quot;, which features numerous celebrities and benefits the charity OneKid OneWorld.

He is the creator of the sci-fi comedy comic book &quot;Shrinkage&quot; for Farrago Comics.

In 2024, Kutner came out with &quot;Snot Goblins &amp; Other Tasteless Tales&quot; (First Second/MacMillan), a middle-grade &quot;horror-comedy grossout&quot; graphic novel anthology, illustrated by &quot;Mad&quot; artist David DeGrand, with positive testimonials by R. L. Stine and Felicia Day. He also ghostwrote &quot;Look Out for the Little Guy&quot;, (Disney Hyperion) the fictional memoir of Scott Lang, aka &quot;Ant-Man&quot; as depicted in the 2024 Marvel film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;. In the book&#x27;s acknowledgments, &quot;Lang&quot; credits Kutner as his writing coach, which technically makes him part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Kutner has shown an interest in melding the worlds of neurodivergence and entertainment. He co-produced &quot;Let it Out,&quot; the first-ever standup comedy show tailored for a neurodivergent audience, and headlined by Kevin Nealon at Los Angeles&#x27; Laugh Factory. Recently, he hosted a new podcast called &quot;Genius Revisited&quot; produced by Jett Road Studios, where Kutner and guests explored whether filmmaker Stanley Kubrick might have been considered neurodivergent.

His newest book, &quot;The Jews: 5,000 Years and Counting&quot; (Point Hill Press/Simon &amp; Schuster) comes out on March 11, 2025. The book is a comedic survey of all of Jewish history, &quot;from Adam &amp; Eve to Zabar&#x27;s&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kutner was born to a Jewish family and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended The Westminster Schools. Comic actors Ed Helms and Brian Baumgartner attended Westminster at the same time. He studied at Princeton University, achieving an AB in anthropology in 1994. At Princeton he was the editor of the school&#x27;s humor magazine, &quot;The Tiger&quot; and was a member of the improv comedy troupe &quot;Quipfire&quot;. He was also a member and the announcer for the Princeton University Band.

He currently resides in Los Angeles with his wife, writer Sheryl Zohn. He is an observant Jew.

<text>The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), also known as the laughing hyena, is a hyena species, currently classed as the sole extant member of the genus &quot;Crocuta&quot;, native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN due to its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. Populations of &quot;Crocuta&quot;, usually considered a subspecies of &quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;, known as cave hyenas, roamed across Eurasia for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest extant member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, rounded ears, less prominent mane, spotted pelt, more dual-purposed dentition, fewer nipples, and pseudo-penis. It is the only placental mammalian species where females have a pseudo-penis and lack an external vaginal opening.

The spotted hyena is the most social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social organisation is unlike that of any other carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.

The spotted hyena is a highly successful animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success is due in part to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to .

The spotted hyena has a long history of interaction with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgmental form. Explicit, negative judgments occur in the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave-robber. The IUCN&#x27;s hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena&#x27;s negative reputation as detrimental to the species&#x27; continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.

==Etymology and naming==
The spotted hyena&#x27;s scientific name &quot;Crocuta&quot; was once widely thought to be derived from the Latin loanword , which translates as &#x27;saffron-coloured one&#x27;, in reference to the animal&#x27;s fur colour. This was proven to be incorrect, as the correct spelling of the loanword would have been &quot;Crocāta&quot;, and the word was never used in that sense by Graeco-Roman sources. &quot;Crocuta&quot; actually comes from the Ancient Greek word (), which is derived from the Sanskrit , which in turn originates from (both of which were originally meant to signify the golden jackal). The earliest recorded mention of Κροκόττας is from Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;, where the animal is described as a mix of wolf and dog native to Ethiopia.

From Classical antiquity until the Renaissance, the spotted and striped hyena were either assumed to be the same species, or distinguished purely on geographical, rather than physical, grounds. Hiob Ludolf, in his , was the first to clearly distinguish the &quot;Crocuta&quot; from &quot;Hyaena&quot; on account of physical and geographical grounds, though he never had any first hand experience of the species, having gotten his accounts from an Ethiopian intermediary. Confusion still persisted over the exact taxonomic nature of the hyena family in general, with most European travelers in Ethiopia referring to hyenas as &quot;wolves&quot;. This partly stems from the Amharic word for hyena, (), which is linked to the Arabic word () &#x27;wolf&#x27;.

The first detailed first-hand descriptions of the spotted hyena by Europeans come from Willem Bosman and Peter Kolbe. Bosman, a Dutch tradesman who worked for the Dutch West India Company at the Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana) from 1688 to 1701, wrote of (jackals or woodland dogs) whose physical descriptions match the spotted hyena. Kolben, a German mathematician and astronomer who worked for the Dutch East India Company in the Cape of Good Hope from 1705 to 1713, described the spotted hyena in great detail, but referred to it as a &quot;tigerwolf&quot;, because the settlers in southern Africa did not know of hyenas, and thus labelled them as &quot;wolves&quot;.

Bosman and Kolben&#x27;s descriptions went largely unnoticed until 1771, when the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant used the descriptions and his personal experience with a captive specimen as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped in his &quot;Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot;. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his by simply translating Pennant&#x27;s text into Latin. &quot;Crocuta&quot; was finally recognised as a separate genus from &quot;Hyaena&quot; in 1828.

==Taxonomy, origins and evolution==

Unlike the striped hyena, for which a number of subspecies were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised that all of this variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann&#x27;s Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with &quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus &quot;Crocuta&quot; still lacking.

The ancestors of the genus &quot;Crocuta&quot; diverged from &quot;Hyaena&quot; (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The ancestors of the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, as is the case for brown and striped hyenas, and thus they became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan&#x27;s land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females.

Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg promoted an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed his arguments on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon &quot;Crocuta sivalensis&quot; from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed the possibility of an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena&#x27;s presence from African deposits dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian &quot;C. sivalensis&quot;. Modern scholarship supports an African origin for the genus, with the earliest fossils of the genus &quot;Crocuta&quot; dating to the early Pliocene of Africa, around 3.63 to 3.85 million years ago.

The earliest known fossil record of &quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot; in Africa is from the Cradle of Humankind, specifically from the Sterkfontein Member 4 which is dated approximately in minimum, and it is also common in deposits dated between . Analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of Eurasian &quot;Crocuta&quot; (cave hyena) specimens shows no clear separation from African lineages. It also suggests that modern spotted hyena populations descend from a widely ranging Afro-Eurasian population that was only recently reduced in range to Africa exclusively. However, analysis of the full nuclear genome suggests that Late Pleistocene African and Eurasian &quot;Crocuta&quot; populations were largely separate, having estimated to have diverged from each other around , closely corresponding to the age of the earliest &quot;Crocuta&quot; specimens in Eurasia, which are around from China. The nuclear genome results also suggest that the European and Asian populations were distinct from each other, but were more closely related to each other overall than to African &quot;Crocuta&quot; populations. Analysis of the nuclear genome suggests that there had been interbreeding between African and Eurasian populations for some time after the split, which likely explains the discordance between the nuclear and mitochondrial genome results, with the mitochondrial genomes of African and European &quot;Crocuta&quot; more closely related to each other than to Asian &quot;Crocuta,&quot; suggesting gene flow between the two groups after the split between the Asian and European populations.

Its appearance in Europe and China coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of &quot;Pachycrocuta brevirostris&quot;, the giant short-faced hyena. As there is no evidence of environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.

==Description==
===Anatomy===
The spotted hyena has a strong and well-developed neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting a firm grip on it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and have short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion&#x27;s heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.

The skull of the spotted hyena differs from that of the striped hyena by its much greater size and narrower sagittal crest. For its size, the spotted hyena has one of the most powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third premolars are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80 kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in²), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate. The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the brown bear in bone-crushing ability, and free ranging hyenas have been observed to crack open the long bones of giraffes measuring 7 cm in diameter. A spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocene. One individual in a study was found to exert a bite force of 4,500 newtons on the measuring instruments.

===Dimensions===
The spotted hyena is the largest extant member of the Hyaenidae. Adults measure in body length, and have a shoulder height of . Adult male spotted hyenas in the Serengeti weigh , while females weigh . Spotted hyenas in Zambia tend to be heavier, with males weighing on average , and females . Exceptionally large weights of and are known. It has been estimated that adult members of the now extinct Eurasian populations weighed .

===Fur===
Fur colour varies greatly and changes with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, that of the spotted hyena consists of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed on the back and hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. Some research groups (such as Ngorongoro Crater Hyena Project and MSU Hyena Project) often use the spot patterns to help identify individual hyenas. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present on the back of the neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring ) and long, stout bristle hairs (). European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.

===Female genitalia===
The genitalia of the female closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, a pseudo-penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males&#x27; genitalia by its somewhat shorter length, greater thickness, and more rounded glans. In both males and females, the base of the glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. When flaccid, the pseudo-penis is retracted into the abdomen, and only the prepuce is visible. After giving birth, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.

==Behaviour==

===Social behaviour===
Spotted hyenas are social animals that live in large communities (referred to as &quot;clans&quot;) which can consist of at most 80 individuals. Group-size varies geographically; in the Serengeti, where prey is migratory, clans are smaller than those in the Ngorongoro Crater, where prey is sedentary. Spotted hyena clans are more compact and unified than wolf packs, but are not as closely knit as those of African wild dogs.

Females usually dominate males, including in cases where low-ranking females generally dominate over high-ranking males, but they will also occasionally co-dominate with a male. There have also been cases in which a clan has been led by a male rather than a female. Cubs take the rank directly below their mothers at birth. So when the matriarch passes away (or, in rare instances, disperses into another clan), their youngest female cub will take over as matriarch. It is typical for females to remain with their natal clan, thus large clans usually contain several matrilines, whereas males typically disperse from their natal clan at the age of 2½ years. Höner et al. say that when a male co-dominates with a female or is otherwise able to lead, this is because the male was born to the matriarch of the clan and has taken the rank directly below his mother.
The clan is a fission–fusion society, in which clan-members do not often remain together, but may forage in small groups. High-ranking hyenas maintain their position through aggression directed against lower-ranking clan-members. Spotted hyena hierarchy is nepotistic; the offspring of dominant females automatically outrank adult females subordinate to their mother. However, rank in spotted hyena cubs is greatly dependent on the presence of the mother; low-ranking adults may act aggressively toward higher-ranking cubs when the mother is absent. Although individual spotted hyenas only care for their own young, and males take no part in raising their young, cubs are able to identify relatives as distantly related as great-aunts. Also, males associate more closely with their own daughters rather than unrelated cubs, and the latter favor their fathers by acting less aggressively toward them.

Spotted hyena societies are more complex than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably similar to those of cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena societies are not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences. Higher ranking adult spotted hyenas tend to have higher telomere length and higher levels of some immune defense proteins in their blood serum.

Territory size is highly variable, ranging from less than 40 km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000 km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and boundary patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Spotted hyenas use scent gland secretions to distinguish between members of their own clan and members of neighboring clans. Within the same clan, differences in scent gland compositions can help individuals differentiate the reproductive states and sex of their members. One study analyzed the scent gland secretions of several hyenas belonging to three different clans and discovered a high degree of similarity in fatty acid composition among members of the same clans, while hyenas of different clans had more dissimilar scent gland secretions. Further studies have proposed a symbiotic relationship between spotted hyenas and their scent gland bacteria, where the differences in fatty acids can be attributed to fermentation by different microbes. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan&#x27;s range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males are more likely to enter another clan&#x27;s territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan&#x27;s home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after a long period of time if it persists in wandering into the clan&#x27;s territory, dens or kills.

===Mating, reproduction, and development===

The spotted hyena is a non-seasonal breeder, though a birth peak does occur during the wet season. Females are polyestrous, with an estrus period lasting two weeks. Like many feliform species, the spotted hyena is promiscuous, and no enduring pair bonds are formed. Members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over the course of several years. Males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat, even if the male outweighs his partner. Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born. Older females show a similar preference, with the addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships. Passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones. Copulation in spotted hyenas is a relatively short affair, lasting 4–12 minutes, and typically only occurs at night with no other hyenas present. The mating process is complicated, as the male&#x27;s penis enters and exits the female&#x27;s reproductive tract through her pseudo-penis rather than directly through the vagina, which is blocked by the false scrotum and testes. These unusual traits make mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, and also make forced copulation physically impossible. The female retracts her clitoris before the male&#x27;s penis enters it by sliding beneath it, an operation facilitated by the penis&#x27;s upward angle. The hyenas then adopt a typical mammalian mating posture and usually lick their genitals for several minutes after mating. Copulation may be repeated multiple times during a period of several hours.
The length of the gestation period tends to vary greatly, but the average length is 110 days. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers&#x27; weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.

Cubs are born with soft, dark brown hair, and weigh 1.5 kg on average. Unique among carnivorous mammals, spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6–7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors. Also, cubs will attack each other shortly after birth. This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters, and can result in the death of the weaker cub. This neonatal siblicide kills an estimated 25% of all hyenas in their first month. Male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance, while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan. Lactating females can carry of milk in their udders. Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore. Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12–16 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months. Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young. Females are protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them. Spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours early in life; cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before the age of one month. Within ten days of birth, they are able to move at considerable speed. Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2–3 months. They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months, and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year. Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years. The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years, with a maximum of 25 years.

===Denning behaviour===

The clan&#x27;s social life revolves around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens within a year or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an entrance width of ½–1 metre (1.6–7.7 ft) to as small as . In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large bare patches around their entrances, where hyenas move or lie down on. Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and it is not uncommon to see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den.

===Intelligence===
Compared to other hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater relative amount of frontal cortex which is involved in the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to engage in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. One of the signs of social intelligence is the ability to have a keen olfactory sense or nasal recognition. Spotted hyenas have unique scent signatures that help them distinguish themselves from other clans and/or individuals (i.e., males or females conspecific), which enables them to mark their territories with secretions from their scent glands. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls when attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.

=== Responses to stress ===
Spotted hyenas are a good subject for studying the causes and consequences of stress because of the behavioral plasticity they exhibit to respond to their variable and unpredictable environment. The hormonal and behavioral responses of spotted hyenas to a variety of stressful stimuli can shed light on how they will adapt in the future and how other gregarious, group-living species may respond to similar stressors.

Stress responses are often measured using corticosteroid levels non-invasively in hyenas, through the analysis of fecal or salivary glucocorticoid samples. While corticosteroids typically fluctuate in predictable patterns across life-history states, spotted hyenas exhibit hormonal and corresponding behavioral responses to unpredictable social, environmental, and anthropogenic stressors.

Social stress

Aggression, social stability, and social connectedness play an important role in reinforcing hierarchies in spotted hyena clans, and social interactions can modulate stress levels. In particular, being the target of aggression or experiencing social instability impose stress on spotted hyenas. Exhibiting aggression, or experiencing social connectedness as juveniles can both immediately decrease stress, and reduce stress during later-life stages.

Environmental stress

Reductions in food and available foraging environments cause significant stress in wild spotted hyenas. These challenges are exasperated by the increased unpredictability of migratory patterns in hyena prey resulting from climate related changes in the lengths of wet and dry seasons. Spotted hyenas are responding by foraging over longer distances, which increases energy expenditure, and consequently the stress associated with lactation for nursing females. Increased foraging range also invokes social stress from encroaching on other hyena clans&#x27; territories in search of prey. 

Anthropogenic stress

While spotted hyenas typically show a range of innovative behavior, such as hiding in vegetative cover to avoid cattle herders, that help them cope with unpredictable environments, innovation is less common in urban swelling hyenas. The consequences of this reduction in innovative behavior are not clear, though innovative behavior can modulate fitness trade-offs, like increased reproductive success with decreased offspring survival, in spotted hyenas.

==Ecology==

===Diet===
The spotted hyena is the most carnivorous member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted hyena is primarily a predator; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by wildlife ecologist Hans Kruuk, and he showed through a 7-year study of hyena populations in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, with later studies showing this tendency in many other areas of Africa. There are however large differences between populations, depending on their habitat, available prey species and the presence of other predators. Thus the estimated contribution from hunting to their diet ranges from at least half up to 98%, the remainder being from scavenging.

Wildebeest are the most commonly taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles, coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked due to differences in habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, plains zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena&#x27;s most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia&#x27;s Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, common eland, lechwe, waterbuck, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena&#x27;s primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya&#x27;s Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena&#x27;s prey consists of topi and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant&#x27;s gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya.

Unlike other large African carnivores, spotted hyenas do not preferentially prey on any species, and only African buffalo and giraffe are significantly avoided. Spotted hyenas prefer prey with a body mass range of , with a mode of . When hunting medium to large sized prey, spotted hyenas tend to select certain categories of animal; young animals are frequently targeted, as are old ones, though the latter category is not so significant when hunting zebras, due to their aggressive anti-predator behaviours. Small prey is killed by being shaken in the mouth, while large prey is eaten alive.

===Enemies and competitors===
====Lions====

Where spotted hyenas and lions occupy the same geographic area, the two species occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can be as high as 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around, and lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas. In the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played.

When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1.

The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.

====Other felids====
Although cheetahs and leopards preferentially prey on smaller animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills when the opportunity presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; there is at least one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a sepsis infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena.

====Canids====

Spotted hyenas will follow packs of African wild dogs to appropriate their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off with a piece of meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog&#x27;s greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, the relationship between the two species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.

Medium-sized canids like Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African wolves will feed alongside hyenas, though they will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when there is no food or young at stake.

====Other competitors====
Spotted hyenas dominate other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, where the brown outnumber the spotted. The two species typically encounter each other on carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually has the effect of seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.

Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, spotted hyenas will avoid crocodile-inhabited waters, and usually keep a safe distance from Nile crocodiles. Recent observations shows that African rock pythons can hunt adult spotted hyenas.

==Communication==

===Body language===
Spotted hyenas have a complex set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often combined with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other&#x27;s anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.

===Vocalisations===
The spotted hyena has an extensive vocal range, with sounds ranging from whoops, fast whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, soft grunt-laughs, loud grunt-laughs, whines and soft squeals. The loud &quot;&quot; call, along with the maniacal laughter, are among the most recognisable sounds of Africa. Typically, high-pitched calls indicate fear or submission, while loud, lower-pitched calls express aggression. The pitch of the laugh indicates the hyena&#x27;s age, while variations in the frequency of notes used when hyenas make noises convey information about the animal&#x27;s social rank.

Dr. Hans Kruuk compiled the following table on spotted hyena calls in 1972:

==Diseases and parasites==
Spotted hyenas may contract brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They are vulnerable to &quot;Trypanosoma congolense&quot;, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucellosis, canine parvovirus, feline calicivirus, leptospirosis, bovine brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were more closely related to each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of &quot;Dipetalonema dracuneuloides&quot; have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus &quot;Taenia&quot;, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus &quot;Hepatozoon&quot; in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; &quot;Taenia hyaenae&quot; and &quot;T. olnogojinae&quot; occur in hyenas in their adult phase. &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot; are found as cysts in hyena muscles.

==Range, habitat and population==
The spotted hyena&#x27;s distribution once ranged in Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the Urals, where it remained for at least one million years. Remains have also been found in the Russian Far East, and it has been theorised that the presence of hyenas there may have delayed the colonisation of North America. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the spotted hyena also roamed Southeast Asia. The causes of the species&#x27; extirpation in Eurasia are still largely unknown. In Western Europe at least, the spotted hyena&#x27;s extinction coincided with a decline in grasslands 12,500 years ago. Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans which were as much at home in forests as in open lands, and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 14 and 11,000 years ago, and earlier in some areas.

Historically, the spotted hyena was widespread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It is present in all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests and the top of alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.

The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000 m in altitude. It is scarce or absent in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, it occurs in riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.

==Relationships with humans==
===Cultural depictions===
In Africa, the spotted hyena is usually portrayed as an abnormal and ambivalent animal, considered to be sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessiveness, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It is often difficult to know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.

Spotted hyenas feature prominently in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal the end of the ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus everted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city&#x27;s inhabitants, who believe the hyenas&#x27; presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.

Traditional Western beliefs about the spotted hyena can be traced back to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Historia Animalium&quot;, which described the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In &quot;On the Generation of Animals&quot;, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle&#x27;s depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.

Natural historians of the 18th and 19th centuries rejected stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised the differences between the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species&#x27; scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, hyena biologists protested against the animal&#x27;s portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators&#x27; visit to the University of California&#x27;s Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.

===Livestock predation===
When targeting livestock, the spotted hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas in the southern parts of Tigray Region of Ethiopia preferentially target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The rate at which the species targets livestock may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa&#x27;s eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where livestock is corralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.

===Attacks on humans and grave desecration===
Like most mammalian predators, the spotted hyena is typically shy in the presence of humans, and has the highest flight distance (up to 300 metres) among African carnivores. However, this distance is reduced during the night, when hyenas are known to follow people closely. Although spotted hyenas do prey on humans in modern times, such incidents are rare. However, attacks on humans by spotted hyenas are likely to be underreported. Man-eating spotted hyenas tend to be large specimens; a pair of man-eating hyenas, responsible for killing 27 people in Mlanje, Malawi, in 1962, were weighed at after being shot. Victims of spotted hyenas tend to be women, children and sick or infirm men, and there are numerous cases of biologists in Africa being forced up trees to escape them. Attacks occur most commonly in September, when many people sleep outdoors, and bush fires make the hunting of wild game difficult for hyenas.

In 1903, Hector Duff wrote of how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba district of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people&#x27;s huts and attack them when they opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, where they have been known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi&#x27;s Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20 km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.

Although attacks against living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the tradition of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore it is not uncommon for bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.

===Urban hyenas===
In some parts of Africa, spotted hyenas have begun to frequent metropolitan areas, where groups or &quot;clans&quot; of the animals have become a menace. The Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa is estimated to have up to a thousand resident hyenas which survive by scavenging rubbish tips and preying on feral dogs and cats. There have also been attacks on homeless people. In 2013, a baby boy was killed by hyenas after being snatched from his mother as she camped near the Hilton Hotel. Some 40 of the animals were reportedly seen alongside a fence bordering the British Embassy compound. In December 2013, a cull was organised and marksmen killed ten hyenas which had occupied wasteland near the city centre.

===Hunting and use in traditional medicine===
The spotted hyena has been hunted for its body parts for use in traditional medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.

Several authors during the Scramble for Africa attested that, despite its physical strength, the spotted hyena poses no danger to hunters when captured or cornered. It was often the case that native skinners refused to even touch hyena carcasses, though this was not usually a problem, as hyena skins were not considered attractive.

In Burkina Faso, the hyena&#x27;s tail is used for medicinal and magical purposes. In Cameroon, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Senegal, the animals&#x27; whole body is harvested for bushmeat and medicine. In Malawi and Tanzania, the genitalia, nose tips and tails are used for traditional medicine. In Mozambique, traditional healers use various spotted hyena body parts, particularly the paws. Oromo hunters typically go through ritual purification after killing hyenas. Kujamaat hunters traditionally treat the spotted hyenas they kill with the same respect due to deceased tribal elders, to avoid retribution from hyena spirits acting on behalf of the dead animal.

During the early years of Dutch colonisation in southern Africa, hyenas (referred to as &quot;wolves&quot; by the colonists) were especially susceptible to trapping, as their predilection for eating carrion, and lack of caution about enclosed spaces, worked against them. A feature of many frontier farms was the &quot;wolwehok&quot; (hyena trap), which was roughly constructed from stone or wood and baited with meat. The trap featured a trap-door, which was designed to shut once the bait was disturbed. In the Cape Colony, spotted hyenas were often hunted by tracking them to their dens and shooting them as they escaped. Another hunting method was to trap them in their dens and dazzle them with torchlight, before stabbing them in the heart with a long knife.

When chased by hunting dogs, spotted hyenas often attack back, unless the dogs are of exceptionally large, powerful breeds. James Stevenson-Hamilton wrote that wounded spotted hyenas could be dangerous adversaries for hunting dogs, recording an incident in which a hyena managed to kill a dog with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin. Further difficulties in killing spotted hyenas with dogs include the species&#x27; thick skin, which prevents dogs from inflicting serious damage to the animal&#x27;s muscles.

===Spotted hyenas in captivity and as pets===
From a husbandry point of view, hyenas are easily kept, as they have few disease problems and it is not uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. One study of the hyena immune system showed that captive hyenas had lower levels for immune defenses than hyenas from the wild population that was used to establish the captive population. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained to fill empty cages until more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits.

In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.

During the 19th century, the species was frequently displayed in travelling circuses as oddities. Alfred Brehm wrote that the spotted hyena is harder to tame than the striped hyena, and that performing specimens in circuses were not up to standard. Sir John Barrow described how spotted hyenas in Sneeuberge were trained to hunt game, writing that they were &quot;as faithful and diligent as any of the common domestic dogs&quot;.

In Tanzania, spotted hyena cubs may be taken from a communal den by witchdoctors to increase their social status. An April 2004 BBC article described how a shepherd living in the small town of Qabri Bayah about 50 kilometres from Jigjiga, Ethiopia managed to use a male spotted hyena as a livestock guardian dog, suppressing its urge to leave and find a mate by feeding it special herbs. If not raised with adult members of their kind, captive spotted hyenas will exhibit scent marking behaviours much later in life than wild specimens.

Although easily tamed, spotted hyenas are exceedingly difficult to house train, and can be destructive; a captive, otherwise perfectly tame, specimen in the Tower of London managed to tear an long plank nailed to its recently repaired enclosure floor with no apparent effort. During the research leading to the composition of his monograph &quot;The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior,&quot; Hans Kruuk kept a tame hyena he named Solomon. Kruuk found Solomon&#x27;s company so congenial, he would have kept him, but Solomon had an insatiable taste for &quot;cheese in the bar of the tourist lounge and bacon off the Chief Park Warden&#x27;s breakfast table&quot;, and no door could hold him back, so Solomon was obliged to live out his days in the Edinburgh Zoo.

<text>Eric Emerson (June 23, 1945 – May 28, 1975) was an American musician, dancer, and actor. Emerson is best known as a Warhol superstar and as a member of the seminal glam punk group the Magic Tramps.

==Career==
Growing up in New Jersey, Emerson trained as a classic ballet dancer. It was this talent that caught the eye of artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol. After seeing Emerson dancing at The Dom in April 1966, Warhol asked Emerson to be in one of his underground films. Emerson made his film debut in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, and soon became a Factory regular. Emerson starred in other Warhol films, most notably &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot;, &quot;San Diego Surf&quot;, and &quot;Heat&quot;. &quot;Heat&quot; would be Emerson&#x27;s last film.

Emerson began his musical career with The Magic Tramps. The band, which began in Hollywood in 1969, relocated to New York City in 1971 after Emerson joined as lead vocalist. The Magic Tramps played under various names, including Messiah and Star Theater, and played gigs at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, a favorite hangout among Factory regulars. They were one of the early bands to play at CBGB. Later that year, Emerson appeared in Jackie Curtis&#x27; play &quot;Vain Victory: Vicissitudes of the Damned&quot;, with Ondine, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling, and music by the Magic Tramps and Lou Reed.

===Album cover lawsuit===
When the debut album of &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; was first issued, the main back cover photo (taken at an Exploding Plastic Inevitable performance) featured an image of Emerson projected upside-down on the wall behind the band. Emerson threatened to sue over this unauthorized use of his image unless he was paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 1/3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than complying, MGM recalled copies of the album and halted its distribution until Emerson&#x27;s image could be airbrushed from the photo on subsequent pressings. Copies that had been printed were sold with a large black sticker covering the actor&#x27;s image. The image was restored for the 1996 CD reissue.

==Personal life==
Emerson&#x27;s bisexuality was well known within Warhol&#x27;s circle and he had relationships with many of the Factory regulars. It was known at the Factory that Billy Smith, Warhol&#x27;s social publicist, was very close to Emerson. When Emerson&#x27;s father accused his son of being &quot;a little sweet&quot;, Emerson responded by saying, &quot;What he don&#x27;t understand is that my generation can swing both ways&quot;. On July 21, 1969, Emerson agreed to marry Warhol superstar, Jackie Curtis in a mock wedding. When Emerson failed to show up, Curtis married a wedding guest. The wedding, which was a publicity stunt arranged by Curtis, was covered by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Emerson had three children from prior relationships. He had a daughter Erica in 1967, a son, Branch Emerson, with Stilettos singer Elda Gentile. In 1971, Emerson and fellow Warhol superstar Jane Forth had a son, Emerson Forth. At the time of his death, Emerson was living with Barbara Winter, ex-wife of musician Edgar Winter.

==Death==
On May 28, 1975, Emerson&#x27;s body was found next to his bicycle, near the West Side Highway in Manhattan. Emerson&#x27;s death is listed officially as a hit and run. He was 29 years old. To date, no one has been arrested or charged in connection with his death. Following a weekend-long wake hosted by Max&#x27;s Kansas City owner Mickey Ruskin, Emerson was buried in Wharton, New Jersey.

After Emerson&#x27;s death, various reports surfaced that he was not killed in a hit and run accident, but overdosed on heroin in a different location, and was dumped as a staged hit and run. These reports have never been substantiated, and Emerson&#x27;s official cause of death never has been changed.

In the book &quot;Making Tracks&quot;, Debbie Harry provided an account of the circumstances surrounding Emerson&#x27;s death:

One night we were over at Eric&#x27;s apartment working on a tape of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; on his Teac four-track tape recorder, when he suddenly staggered out of the kitchen looking ashen. He looked even more distraught and sad when we left. Being satisfied drove him crazy in the end, because he had everything so he didn&#x27;t care about anything anymore. He used to go out jogging every day, and did feats of physical endurance like strapping twenty-pound weights to each ankle and then bicycling up to the Factory. The next day we were sitting around the house just after we woke up when Barbara called with the bad news. &quot;Oh, Eric got hit by a truck.&quot; He had been a good friend and inspiration to so many people. We didn&#x27;t quite understand what had happened, but we went up to a party/wake held for him and saw a lot of people from the earlier glitter days. Eric&#x27;s death definitely marked an end to the glitter period. We still miss him.

<doc id="595999" wikidata="Q4886486" url="?curid=595999" title="Cell envelope">
<text>The cell envelope comprises the inner cell membrane and the cell wall of a bacterium. In Gram-negative bacteria an outer membrane is also included. This envelope is not present in the Mollicutes where the cell wall is absent.

Bacterial cell envelopes fall into two major categories: a Gram-positive type which stains purple during Gram staining and a Gram-negative type which stains pink during Gram staining. Either type may have an enclosing capsule of polysaccharides for extra protection. As a group these are known as polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria.

==Function==
As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan (poly-&quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine and &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid), which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. intracellular parasites such as &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. This is notably expressed through the classification into Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

==Types==

===The Gram-positive cell wall===

The Gram-positive cell wall is characterized by the presence of a very thick peptidoglycan layer, which is responsible for the retention of the crystal violet dyes during the Gram staining procedure. It is found exclusively in organisms belonging to the Actinomycetota (or high %G+C Gram-positive organisms) and the Bacillota (or low %G+C Gram-positive organisms). Bacteria within the Deinococcota group may also exhibit Gram-positive staining behavior but contain some cell wall structures typical of Gram-negative organisms. Imbedded in the Gram-positive cell wall are polyalcohols called teichoic acids, some of which are lipid-linked to form lipoteichoic acids. Because lipoteichoic acids are covalently linked to lipids within the cytoplasmic membrane they are responsible for linking the peptidoglycan to the cytoplasmic membrane. Teichoic acids give the gram-positive cell wall an overall negative charge due to the presence of phosphodiester bonds between teichoic acid monomers.

Outside the cell wall, many Gram-positive bacteria have an S-layer of &quot;tiled&quot; proteins. The S-layer assists attachment and biofilm formation. Outside the S-layer, there is often a capsule of polysaccharides. The capsule helps the bacterium evade host phagocytosis. In laboratory culture, the S-layer and capsule are often lost by reductive evolution (the loss of a trait in absence of positive selection).

===The Gram-negative cell wall===

The Gram-negative cell wall contains a thinner peptidoglycan layer adjacent to the cytoplasmic membrane than the Gram-positive wall, which is responsible for the cell wall&#x27;s inability to retain the crystal violet stain upon decolourisation with ethanol during Gram staining. In addition to the peptidoglycan layer the Gram-negative cell wall also contains an additional outer membrane composed by phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides which face into the external environment. The highly charged nature of lipopolysaccharides confer an overall negative charge to the Gram -negative cell wall. The chemical structure of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides is often unique to specific bacterial strains (i.e. sub-species) and is responsible for many of the antigenic properties of these strains.

As a phospholipid bilayer, the lipid portion of the outer membrane is largely impermeable to all charged molecules. However, channels called porins are present in the outer membrane that allow for passive transport of many ions, sugars and amino acids across the outer membrane. These molecules are therefore present in the periplasm, the region between the plasma membrane and outer membrane. The periplasm contains the peptidoglycan layer and many proteins responsible for substrate binding or hydrolysis and reception of extracellular signals. The periplasm is thought to exist as a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and peptidoglycan found within it. Because of its location between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, signals received and substrates bound are available to be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using transport and signaling proteins imbedded there.

In nature, many uncultivated Gram-negative bacteria also have an S-layer and a capsule. These structures are often lost during laboratory cultivation.

===Mycobacteria===
The &quot;Mycobacteria&quot; (acid-fast bacteria) have a cell envelope which is not typical of Gram-positives or Gram-negatives. The mycobacterial cell envelope does not consist of the outer membrane characteristic of Gram-negatives, but has a significant peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-mycolic acid wall structure which provides an external permeability barrier. Therefore, there is thought to be a distinct &#x27;pseudoperiplasm&#x27; compartment between the cytoplasmic membrane and this outer barrier. The nature of this compartment is not well understood. Acid-fast bacteria, like &quot;Mycobacteria&quot;, are resistant to decolorization by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of &quot;Mycobacteria&quot;, is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl–Neelsen stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid fast bacilli are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background.

===Bacteria lacking a peptidoglycan cell wall===
The obligate intracellular bacteria in the family Chlamydiaceae are unique in their morphology as they do not contain detectable amounts of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of their infectious forms. Instead, the extracellular forms of these Gram-negative bacteria maintain their structural integrity by relying on a layer of disulfide bond cross-linked cysteine-rich proteins, which is located between cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane in a manner analogous to the peptidoglycan layer in other Gram-negative bacteria. In the intracellular forms of the bacterium the disulfide cross linkage is not found, which confers this form more mechanically fragile.

The cell envelopes of the bacterial class of mollicutes do not have a cell wall. The main pathogenic bacteria in this class are mycoplasma and ureaplasma.

L-form bacteria are strains bacteria that lack cell walls derived from bacteria that normally possess cell walls.

<text>Ralph Knott (3 May 1878 – 25 January 1929) was a British architect. He was responsible for building the massive six-storey &quot;Edwardian Baroque&quot; style County Hall building for the London County Council.

== Biography ==

Ralph Knott was born in Chelsea, London, on 3 May 1878, the youngest son of Samuel Knott, a tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; White), from Dorset. After attending the City of London School he was articled to Woodd and Ainslie, architects. He was taught etching by Frank Brangwyn at the Architectural Association and when his articles were finished, joined Sir Aston Webb, in whose office he remained for eight years. Webb was a keen participant in architectural competitions and Knott&#x27;s etching skill was valued in winning them. He drew the etchings which enabled Webb to win the competition for the Queen Victoria memorial outside Buckingham Palace, also working on the designs of Admiralty Arch and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In 1908 Knott and E. Stone Collins set up their own practice as Knott and Collins, architects. The first substantial commission they applied for was for offices for the London County Council. Despite many very well known names entering, Knott won at the age of 29. Designs for the construction were brought to life by the architect and perspectivist Alick Horsnell. His design was altered significantly before construction began, including the familiar semicircular terrace being moved from the land to the river-side of the building. Construction was held up by the First World War, during which Knott worked on designs for Royal Air Force bases, and partially completed in 1922 (except for the northern third). In June 1921 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

In the years before World War I Knott&#x27;s work included the design and erection of mansions in the Westminster and Chelsea districts of London. In 1917 Knott was the designer of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; £200 cottage, a distinct departure from the more elaborate architecture for which he was known.

After the opening of the London County Hall, at the southern end of Westminster Bridge, Knott built other notable buildings, including two departmental office blocks at Stormont near Belfast. In 1925 he designed the pavilion at the City of London School&#x27;s new athletics grounds in Grove Park. The building was a memorial to the alumni of the school who had perished in the First World War, and he donated his services free of charge. He had begun the work on the last part of County Hall in 1928 but it remained uncompleted at his death.

In 1919 Knott married Ada (&quot;née&quot; Brown), widow of Sidney James Longden. They had no children. He died suddenly at his Mortlake home in January 1929, aged 50. A bronze plaque to his memory at County Hall was unveiled by the Chairman of the London County Council in June 1932.

<text>Benalmádena () is a town in Andalusia in southern Spain, 12 km west of Málaga, on the Costa del Sol between Torremolinos and Fuengirola.

Benalmádena is rich in attractive beaches and interesting places like the Colomares Castle, the 33-metre-tall Buddhist Benalmádena Stupa, the largest Buddhist stupa in Europe, the Benalmádena Marina and the Benalmádena Cable Car.

Benalmádena covers an area of just over 27 km2 that extends from the summits of the Sierra de Mijas to the sea, falling in some places as a cliff. The territory is crossed from east to west on Highway A-7, which connects with the provincial capital and other centres of the Mediterranean coast.

With 61,383 inhabitants according to the INE census of 2010, Benalmádena is the eighth most populous municipality in the province and the third largest metropolitan area, behind Málaga and Torremolinos. The population is concentrated in three main centers: Benalmádena Pueblo, Arroyo de la Miel and Benalmádena Costa, although the high urban growth and demographic tends to unify the three cores.

Benalmádena has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Benalmádena experienced a remarkable development during the period of Muslim domination. Its development was paralyzed after joining the Crown of Castile in 1485 due to various natural disasters and the intensity of the activity of privateers in the area. The paper industry and vineyard cultivation reactivated the local economy during the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the early 21st century Benalmádena is one of the main tourist destinations on the Costa del Sol, with leisure facilities including an amusement park, two aquariums, a casino, a cable car and one of the largest marinas of Andalusia.

== History ==
Historically the region has been occupied and settled by many cultures dating back to the Bronze Age, including the ancient Phoenicians and Romans, and has also been considerably influenced by the Moorish settlement of the southern Iberian Peninsula. Two Almenara towers on the coastline date back to the 15th century, originally built to guard the coast and its population from the frequent incursions of Barbary pirates in the years following the &quot;reconquista&quot; (reconquest) of the region by Henry IV of Castile.

In contemporary times, along with the rest of the Costa del Sol area it has become an important tourist destination. The municipality has been subject to an unprecedented urban expansion in recent years with many new buildings and homes built, sometimes causing environmental degradation.

Benalmádena has both a traditional Spanish village and a modern, coastal, tourist area.

===Etymology===

Many authors give theories about the origin of the name of the town, but none has been proven. The first documents which contain references to Benalmádena from the 15th century in the context of the struggle to win back the Crown of Castile against the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. The assumption on which most historians agree is the Arabic toponym of &quot;Ibn al-ma&#x27; din&quot; &quot;son of the mines&quot; for the iron and ochre bed found in the area. Another theory, also related to the Arabic word Bina al-ma&#x27;din, whose translation would be &quot;the construction or building of the mine&quot;.

There are others theories such as the Arabic for &quot;people between springs&quot;, Bena-A La Ena. Another suggestion is that name derives from Bina al-Madina, &quot;the state of the al-Madina&#x27;s family&quot;; according to historical data they were a rich family of Muslim Málaga and could have owned the area. It has also been suggested that the name of the municipality referred to a lineage of the Madana, Ben al-Madana.

===Before Roman Empire===
The first human settlements in the area are from the Upper Palaeolithic, 20,000 years ago according to the finding of some caves located in the area: &quot;Cueva del Toro&quot;, &quot;Cueva del Botijo&quot; and &quot;Cueva de la Zorrera&quot;. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Phoenicians, were interested of the mining of the zone. the Phoenicians founded several colonies all along the Spanish coast. Romans replaced Phoenicians as traders and started to use the wealth of the Mediterranean. Among the Roman remains are the ruins of Benal-Roma, a salting factory located on the coast, the site of Torremuelle, and enamelware and other items preserved in the Museum of Benalmádena. The wine culture had great importance during the period of Roman domination.

===Middle Ages===
In the following centuries the area became depopulated. People sought refuge within Málaga&#x27;s city walls from attacks and looting from the sea. The municipality was included in the Roman province of Baetica. It was later taken by Visigoths and Byzantines. After the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the area was greatly developed. In the 11th century, the population were concentrated into a walled town and a fortress, both located in &quot;Benalmádena Pueblo&quot;. Muslims developed the agriculture and introduced sugar cane, figs, grapes and mulberry (used in the textile industry) from the East. Ibn al-Baitar, one of the most important botanists and pharmacologists of the Middle Ages, was born here in 1197.

===Before French revolution===
In 1456 the fort and the town were destroyed by Christian armies under the command of King Enrique IV of Castilla. The villagers took refuge in Mijas to rebuild their homes, which were destroyed again in 1485 by King Ferdinand the Catholic in his final conquest. Over the next six years the town was deserted. In 1491 the king ordered Alonso Palmero to colonise the area with thirty old Christians and Palmero as mayor, but an earthquake and the constant pirate attacks made it impossible to inhabit the town. It was in these times that the Arabic name became Castilianized and the town became Benalmaina.

===Modern age===

In 1784 the Italian Félix Solesio purchased the farm &quot;Arroyo de la Miel&quot; to build six paper factories to supply the Royal Factory of Playing Cards of Macharaviaya. The destination for most production was the American market. This would mean the birth of the nucleus of Arroyo de la Miel around the new business and the factories built at what is now &quot;Plaza de España&quot;, containing the &quot;Portal de San Carlos&quot; (San Carlos gate) with the arms of Solesio and the &quot;La Tribuna&quot; building. A monument to the founder of this complex was erected in the square. In the 19th century the city grew through the exploitation of muscatel grapes for the wine production, but the vine plague of phylloxera ruined crops across the province. Epidemics of malaria, typhoid and cholera also undermined the population. The municipality&#x27;s population boom began in the 1950s with the birth and development of mass tourism on the Spanish coast. Many established hotels, restaurants and businesses opened in this period, such as the Hotel Triton (1961), Tivoli World amusement park (1973), Torrequebrada casino and hotel (1979), Selwo Aquarium, Sea Life Aquarium, Chollocasa, Cable car, Irentinsapain, Hotel Alay. Many more were constructed in the early 21st century.

== Geography ==
The municipality has three main urban areas:

*Benalmádena Pueblo, the original village, which lies about three kilometres inland at an elevation of approximately 200 m above mean sea level. Its core consists of a typical white-fronted Andalusian village, although including numerous recent buildings in modern architectural styles. The town of Benalmádena also has an archaeological museum with locally derived artefacts dating back to the Bronze Age.
*Benalmádena Costa, an urban agglomeration on the coast. Here there are discos, hotels, beaches, shopping centers and an extensively-equipped marina. Tourist attractions include SeaLife aquarium and Selwo Marina, a theme park with dolphins, penguins and seals among other species. The Parque Paloma is a more recent addition to the attractions, a landscaped park containing a large lake and animals running wild.
*Arroyo de la Miel (Honey Stream), originally a separate village, is in the interior between the other two areas. It has become the main residential area, and is also the most commercially active. Buildings, many of them apartment blocks. are tightly packed. It has attractions such as the Tivoli World amusement park, and a &quot;teleferico&quot; (cable car) running to the summit of the 769-metre Calamorro mountain, which provides panoramic views of the Sierra Nevada, Gibraltar and, on clear days, the Moroccan coastline. The Friday market is a popular attraction.

===Climate===
The climate is typically Mediterranean, with mild temperatures throughout the year, no frost in the colder months, and an average temperature of . Its privileged climate and location in the southern coastal Europe are two important factors so that the tourism industry is the main economic sector of the municipality. The town has a nudist beach, Playa Nudista Benalnatura.

===Flora and fauna===
Benalmádena is a highly urbanised municipality except for the higher areas of the mountains, with few non-urban areas. In the mountains there are typical Mediterranean species such as the white deadnettle, rock rose, thyme, rosemary and marjoram lily like the turpentine tree, juniper and pine trees like pine, carob tree and wild olive.

Fauna includes mountain goat, genet, reptiles of various species, eagles, kestrels and owls. Whales and other marine life have been sighted along the coast.

== Main sights ==
The township of Benalmádena has the largest example of a Buddhist stupa in the Western world, Benalmádena Stupa, constructed in 2003.

In Arroyo de la Miel, Avenida Garcia Lorca has the Costa del Sol&#x27;s only real ice skating rink.

== Public transport ==
Benalmádena Council is integrated into the Málaga Metropolitan Transport Consortium. There is a single ticket for metropolitan and urban buses Cercanías Málaga and Metro de Málaga.

The town is on the C1 line of the Cercanías Málaga urban railway that runs from Málaga via Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport to Fuengirola, with trains every 20 minutes. The main station is Arroyo de la Miel and the secondary one is Torremuelle.

<text>Catchgate is a former mining village in County Durham, England. It has a population of approximately 3,000 people. The nearest town is Stanley, also a former coal mining community. The town of Consett, once famous for its steel works, is away.

==Geography==
Catchgate is bordered by the villages of Greencroft to the west, Annfield Plain to the south, Harelaw to the north (the B6168 runs through it from Annfield Plain to Harelaw), and West Kyo (also known as &quot;Old Kyo&quot;) to the east. To the west of Catchgate was Pontop village, now no more than a few bungalows, dominated by the enormous Pontop Pike television and radio transmitter. Carrmyers Pond and Carrmyers Burn form the northern boundary of Catchgate, beyond which is Harelaw.

==Facilities==
Catchgate is home to the Annfield Plain library, on the boundary with Annfield Plain, and also the Crown and Thistle pub, known locally as Bob Bell&#x27;s after a former owner who is rumoured to haunt the pub. A small police station is situated at the north end of the village, though it is only partially staffed. Another pub, the Smiths Arms, now derelict, is situated on Catchgate crossroads. A number of working men&#x27;s clubs used to exist, notably the Excelsior, the RAOB and the Buffs. The last of these has now been converted and split into three premises, a retail shop, a boxing club and a currently vacant premises.

A fish shop is located just to the east of Catchgate crossroads. Opposite this is the former Bethany Chapel, which was temporarily home to an employment agency after closure. A second retail shop and two hair dressers complete the more permanent businesses in Catchgate.

==Education==
Catchgate Primary School is situated west of Catchgate Crossroads on the road to Greencroft. The school was moved ( to the west in the 2000s when the old infant and junior school were demolished and replaced by a housing estate.

<doc id="596023" wikidata="Q154438" url="?curid=596023" title="Franz Grillparzer">
<text>Franz Seraphicus Grillparzer (15 January 1791 – 21 January 1872) was an Austrian writer who was considered to be the leading Austrian dramatist of the 19th century. His plays were and are frequently performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna. He also wrote the oration for Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s funeral, as well as the epitaph for his friend Franz Schubert.

While writing during the period of Romanticism, Grillparzer&#x27;s poetic language owes far more to the period of Classicism which reigned during his formative years. Committed to the classical ideals of aesthetic beauty and morality, his plots shy away from the realism which developed during his time, preferring instead to use the theater to address spiritual values, which in the words of the dying queen of his Libussa, would only come after the period of Materialism had passed. Due to the identity-creating use of his works, especially after World War II, he was named as the national poet of Austria.

==Life and career==

Franz Grillparzer was born in Vienna, Austria. His father, the unsuccessful lawyer E. J. Grillparzer, whose fortunes were ruined by Napoleon&#x27;s invasion, was a severe pedant and a staunch upholder of the liberal traditions of the reign of Joseph II. His mother, Anna Franziska, was a nervous, highly-strung woman, daughter of Christoph Sonnleithner, sister to Joseph and Ignaz, aunt to Leopold.

Franz&#x27;s father wished him to become a lawyer, and he entered the University of Vienna in 1807 as a student of jurisprudence. Two years later his father died, leaving the family in difficult circumstances. After obtaining his degree from the university in 1811, Franz became a private tutor for a noble family; then in 1813, he entered the civil service as a clerk at the Imperial &quot;Hofkammer&quot; (Exchequer) in Austria. In 1821, he unsuccessfully applied to the position of scribe at the Imperial Library, and later that same year, he was relocated to the Ministry of Finance. In 1832, he became director of the archives at the Imperial &quot;Hofkammer&quot;, a position he held until his retirement in 1856. Grillparzer had little capacity for an official career and regarded his position merely as a means of independence.

From early youth, Grillparzer displayed a strong literary impulse. He devoted especial attention to the Spanish drama, and many of his works show the influence of Pedro Calderón de la Barca. In 1853, he wrote an autobiography of his life and times from birth to 1836. Among his posthumous writings are many fragments of literary, philosophic, and political criticism, all of them indicating a strong and independent spirit, not invariably just, but distinct, penetrating, and suggestive.

It is characteristic of him that he expresses extreme dislike of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy on the ground that its terms are unintelligible. On the other hand, he gives evidence of careful and sympathetic study of Immanuel Kant. Of modern literary critics, Gervinus was most repugnant to him, mainly because of the tendency of this writer to attribute moral aims to authors who created solely for art&#x27;s sake. He rather maliciously says that Gervinus had one advantage and one disadvantage in writing his history of German literature – the advantage of common sense, the disadvantage of knowing nothing of his subject.

Of a quiet contemplative nature, Grillparzer shunned general society. He never married. He could seem cold and distant to strangers, but in conversation with people he liked, his real disposition revealed itself; his manner became animated, his eyes brightened, and a sarcastic but not ill-natured smile would play upon his lips. He often said that the art of writing poetry can neither be taught nor learned, but he also held that inspiration will not visit a poet who neglects to make himself master of his subject. Hence before writing a play he worked hard, striving to comprehend the spirit of the age he wished to represent. He was exceedingly fond of travel, and at different times visited all the leading European countries.

After 1840, when his only comedy was rejected by the public, he almost passed from the memory of his contemporaries. Fortunately for him, his admirer Heinrich Laube became artistic director of Vienna&#x27;s court theater in 1849. Laube staged productions of Grillparzer&#x27;s forgotten works, and their success was immediate and profound. To his own surprise, Grillparzer became the most popular author of the day; he was ranked with Goethe and Schiller, and lauded as the national poet of Austria. On his eightieth birthday, all classes from the court downwards united to do him honour; never, probably, did Vienna exert herself so much to prove her respect for a private citizen.

He was buried in 1872 with an amount of ceremony that surpassed even the pomp displayed at the funeral of poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock in 1803. He was originally buried in the Währinger Cemetery in Vienna, now known as Schubertpark. He now lies at Hietzing Cemetery.

==Early works up to &quot;Das goldene Vlies&quot;==
From 1807 to 1809, Grillparzer wrote a long tragedy in iambics, &quot;Blanca von Castilien&quot;, modeled on Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. He also produced the dramatic fragments &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Alfred der Grosse&quot; (1809).

When Grillparzer began to write, the German stage was dominated by the wild plays of Zacharias Werner, Adolf Müllner, and other authors of so-called &quot;fate-tragedies.&quot; Grillparzer&#x27;s play &quot;The Ancestress&quot; (), published in 1816, reflected this trend. It is a gruesome fate-tragedy in the trochaic measure of the Spanish drama, already made popular by Müllner&#x27;s &quot;Schuld&quot;. The ghost of a lady who was killed by her husband for infidelity is doomed to walk the earth until her family line dies out, and this happens in the play amid scenes of violence and horror. Its general character is similar to that of Werner&#x27;s dramas; it only differs from them in containing individual passages of much force and beauty. It reveals an instinct for dramatic as opposed to merely theatrical effect, which distinguishes it from other fate-dramas of the day. Its success led to the poet being classed for the best part of his life with playwrights like Müllner and Christoph Ernst von Houwald. In 1817, the first performances of &quot;The Ancestress&quot; made Grillparzer famous.

Grillparzer followed this gothic drama with &quot;Sappho&quot; (1818), a drama of a very different type. Similar to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, Grillparzer dramatized the tragedy of poetic genius, showing how a poet must renounce earthly happiness to fulfill a higher mission. After reading an Italian translation of this play, Lord Byron expressed his conviction that Grillparzer would be held in reverence by posterity. Grillparzer&#x27;s conceptions are not so clearly defined as Goethe&#x27;s, nor is his diction so varied and harmonious; but the play has the stamp of genius, and ranks as one of the best works that attempt to combine the passion and sentiment of modern life with the simplicity and grace of ancient masterpieces.

In 1821, Grillparzer completed his &quot;&quot; trilogy, a project that had been interrupted in 1819 when his depressed mother committed suicide, and by Grillparzer&#x27;s subsequent visit to Italy. The trilogy opens with a one-act prelude, &quot;Der Gastfreund,&quot; then depicts, in &quot;The Argonauts&quot; (&quot;Die Argonauten&quot;) Jason&#x27;s adventures in his quest for the Fleece. &quot;Medea&quot;, a tragedy of classic proportions, contains the culminating events of the story of Medea, which had been so often dramatized before. Similarly to &quot;Sappho&quot; but on a larger scale, this trilogy is a tragedy of the heart&#x27;s desire, the conflict of the simple happy life with that sinister power, be it genius or ambition, which upsets the equilibrium of life. There is delicate art in the delineation of the mingled fascination and repulsion which Medea and Jason feel for each other, and when at last repulsion becomes the dominant force, Grillparzer gives splendid utterance to Medea&#x27;s rage. At the end, Medea bears the fatal Fleece back to Delphi, while Jason is left to realize the futility of human striving and earthly happiness. The end is bitter disillusionment; the only consolation renunciation. Some critics consider &quot;Medea&quot; Grillparzer&#x27;s highest achievement.

==Historical tragedies==
For his historical tragedy &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Fortune and End&quot; (, written 1823, but owing to difficulties with the censor, not performed until February 19, 1825), Grillparzer dramatized the conflict of Ottokar II of Bohemia with Rudolph I of Germany. It appealed strongly to the patriotic sympathies of the Viennese, because it depicted one of the proudest periods of Austrian history, the founding of the House of Habsburg. With an almost modern realism Grillparzer reproduced the medieval era, at the same time not losing sight of the needs of the theatre. It cannot be said that the materials of the play are welded into a compact whole, but the characters are vigorously conceived, and there is a fine dramatic contrast between the brilliant, restless, and unscrupulous Ottokar and the calm, upright, and ultimately triumphant Rudolph. Because Ottokar is defeated, critics argue that this play represents another work in which Grillparzer preaches the futility of endeavour and the vanity of worldly greatness.

A second historical tragedy, &quot;A faithful Servant of his Lord&quot; (&quot;&quot;), 1826, performed 1828), attempted to illustrate a more heroic theme; but the subject of the superhuman self-effacement of Bancbanus before his lord Duke Otto of Meran proved too uncompromising an illustration of Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative of duty to be palatable in the theatre. Liberal critics accused Grillparzer of promoting servility. At the same time, the play displeased the court, and its presentation was stopped. It hardly deserved to be made the subject of so much contention, for it is one of the least powerful of Grillparzer&#x27;s later dramas.

With these historical tragedies began the darkest decade of Grillparzer&#x27;s life. They brought him into conflict with the Austrian censor – a conflict that grated on Grillparzer&#x27;s sensitive soul, and was aggravated by his own position as a servant of the state. In 1826, he paid a visit to Goethe in Saxe-Weimar, and was able to compare the enlightened conditions of Weimar with the censorship of Vienna.

To these troubles were added personal worries. In the winter of 1820/1821, Grillparzer had met and fallen in love with Katharina Fröhlich (1801–1879), but whether owing to a presentiment of mutual incompatibility, or merely owing to Grillparzer&#x27;s conviction that life had no happiness in store for him, he shrank from marriage. Nevertheless, he was plunged into an abyss of misery and despair to which his diary bears heart-rending witness; his sufferings found poetic expression in the cycle of poems called &quot;Tristia ex Ponto&quot; (1835).

==More masterpieces and a setback==
Still, during this time, Grillparzer completed two of his greatest dramas, &quot;Waves of the Sea and of Love&quot; (, 1831) and &quot;The Dream, a Life&quot; (, 1834). &quot;Waves of the Sea and of Love&quot; dramatizes the story of Hero and Leander, as a poetic love-tragedy with an insight into character motivation that predates the psychological dramas of Ibsen. The work again is formed on classic models, but in this instance his feeling is so distinctly modern that it does not find adequate expression in Grillparzer&#x27;s carefully measured verse. The subject has never been more happily treated than in some passages, which, however, are marked rather by lyrical than dramatic qualities. The poetic influence of Lope de Vega and Pedro Calderón de la Barca is also evident.

&quot;The Dream, a Life&quot;, Grillparzer&#x27;s technical masterpiece, is in form perhaps even more influenced by Spanish drama; it is also more of what Goethe called a confession. The aspirations of Rustan, an ambitious young peasant, are reflected in the hero&#x27;s dream, which takes up nearly three acts of the play. Ultimately Rustan awakens from his nightmare to realize the truth of Grillparzer&#x27;s own pessimistic belief that all earthly ambitions and aspirations are vanity; the only true happiness is contentment with one&#x27;s lot and inner peace. It was the first of Grillparzer&#x27;s dramas that did not end tragically. Grillparzer provided the text for Schubert&#x27;s &#x27;Mirjams Siegesgesang&#x27; (Miriam&#x27;s Song of Triumph), Op. 136/D. 942.

In 1838 Grillparzer produced his only comedy, &quot;Woe to him who lies&quot; (). But &quot;Woe to him who lies&quot;, in spite of its humour of situation, its sparkling dialogue and its original premise — a hero who wins by invariably telling the truth, where his enemies invariably expect him to lie – was too strange to meet with approval in its day. Its premiere on 6 March 1838 was a failure. This was a severe blow to the poet, who turned his back forever on the German theatre.

==Later life and final masterpieces==
In 1836, Grillparzer paid a visit to Paris and London, in 1843 to Athens and Constantinople. Then came the Revolution which struck off the intellectual fetters under which Grillparzer and his contemporaries had groaned in Austria, but the liberation came too late for him. Honours were heaped upon him; he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences; Heinrich Laube, as director of the Burgtheater, reinstated his plays into the repertory; in 1861, he was elected to the Austrian Herrenhaus; his eightieth birthday was a national festival, and when he died in Vienna, on 21 January 1872, the mourning of the Austrian people was universal.

With the exception of a beautiful fragment, &quot;Esther&quot; (1861), Grillparzer published no more dramatic poetry after the fiasco of &quot;Weh dem, der lügt&quot;, but at his death three completed tragedies were found among his papers. Of these, &quot;The Jewess of Toledo&quot; (&quot;Die Jüdin von Toledo&quot;, written in 1851), an admirable adaptation from the Spanish, has won a permanent place in the German classical repertory; &quot;Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg&quot; is a powerful historical tragedy and &quot;Libussa&quot; is perhaps the most mature, as it is certainly the deepest, of all Grillparzer&#x27;s dramas; the latter two plays prove how much was lost by the poet&#x27;s divorce from the theatre.

==Assessment==

Grillparzer was an important figure in the Viennese theater of the 1840s when his greatest dramatic works were produced. Together with Christian Friedrich Hebbel, he rates as the most influential dramatist of the mid-nineteenth century. While most of his best plays originate in the age of Romanticism, his works could not be classified as Romantic. His language and characters reflect the earlier sensibilities of neo-classicism, exhibited in plays like Sappho and Das goldene Vlies which treats the subject matter of Jason bringing Medea back to Greece. In these plays he deals with classical themes as well as subject matter. One important characteristic of the age is that aesthetic beauty and virtue are seen as interrelated. In his historical plays like &quot;König Ottokars Glück und Ende&quot;, he expresses the Enlightenment optimism that humankind can put its affairs in order and realize an age of peace an harmony. This is a common theme in Austrian thought from this period. Some have suggested that this is a reflection of their multi-ethnic Austrian state. Ottkar, the thirteenth century Bohemian king, wants to subjugate his neighbors, a thinly veiled reference to the recently defeated Napoleon. However, the play ends on an upbeat note.

Although Grillparzer was essentially a dramatist, his lyric poetry is in the intensity of its personal note hardly inferior to Lenau&#x27;s; and the bitterness of his later years found vent in biting and stinging epigrams that spared few of his greater contemporaries. As a prose writer, he has left one powerful short story, &quot;Der arme Spielmann&quot; (1848), and a volume of critical studies on the Spanish drama, which shows how completely he had succeeded in identifying himself with the Spanish point of view.

Grillparzer&#x27;s brooding, unbalanced temperament, his lack of will-power, his pessimistic renunciation and the bitterness which his self-imposed martyrdom produced in him, made him peculiarly adapted to express the mood of Austria in the epoch of intellectual thraldom that lay between the Napoleonic wars and the Revolution of 1848.

==Legacy and cultural references==

*He is honoured in Austria with a pastry, the Grillparzer Torte.
*Outside Austria, the modern American reader is perhaps most familiar with Grillparzer via disparaging references to him in the popular John Irving novel &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;. The book features a story within a story entitled &quot;The Pension Grillparzer&quot;. Grillparzer is also referenced in Irving&#x27;s novel A Son of the Circus&quot;,&quot; in which the protagonist had studied in Vienna.
*He is mentioned in the W. G. Sebald novel &quot;Vertigo&quot;.
*In the tenth of the German language film series, &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; by Edgar Reitz, Reinhard and Esther read from a Grillparzer poem comparing the half moon to an incomplete, ambiguous life.
*In Vienna&#x27;s Inner City, was named after him in 1873. There is also a Grillparzerstraße in several other cities, including Graz, Linz, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Berlin, Dresden, Freiburg / Br., Hamburg, Mannheim and Munich. Double designations in Vienna resulting from incorporations were withdrawn.
*After his death, a monument was erected in the Volksgarten in Vienna; also by Leopold Schrödl in Baden.
*His portrait adorned the 100 Schilling banknote from 1954. The Mint Austria minted a 25 Schilling commemorative coin (bust picture) in 1964 and a 20 Schilling course coin (bust picture and Burgtheater ) in 1991 .
*The Austrian Post issued four occasions (1931, 1947, 1972 and 1991) special stamps with portraits of the writer.
*The Grillparzer Prize and the Grillparzer Ring were named after him.
*The asteroid 30933 was named Grillparzer in his honor.
*In Linz and in St. Pölten, elementary schools are named after him.

<text>COREPER, from French &quot;Comité des représentants permanents&quot;, is the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, made up of the head or deputy head of mission from the EU member states in Brussels.

COREPER&#x27;s defined role is to prepare the agenda for the ministerial Council of the European Union meetings; it may also take some procedural decisions. It oversees and coordinates the work of some 250 committees and working parties made up of civil servants from the member states who work on issues at the technical level to be discussed later by COREPER and the Council.

The COREPER is chaired by the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

==Organisations and Tasks==

Article 240 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union lays down the legal basis of COREPER.

There are in fact two committees within the COREPER: 
*COREPER I consists of deputy heads of mission and deals largely with social and economic issues; 
*COREPER II consists of heads of mission (Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary) and deals largely with political, financial and foreign policy issues.

Coreper I, comprising the Deputy Permanent Representatives, prepares the ground for the following Council configurations: 
* Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs;
* Competitiveness (internal market, industry, research, space and tourism);
* Transport, Telecommunications and Energy;
* Agriculture and Fisheries;
* Environment;
* Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (including audiovisual);
Coreper II, comprising the Permanent Representatives, prepares for the other configurations:
* General Affairs
* Foreign Affairs (including European security and defence policy and development cooperation);
* Economic and Financial Affairs (including the budget);
* Justice and Home Affairs (including civil protection).
Representatives of the Council Secretariat from the relevant Directorates and from the Legal Directorate are also present.

Both Coreper I and Coreper II are, in turn, prepared by two other groups of high ranking diplomats. Coreper I is prepared by the Mertens Group, while Coreper II is prepared by the Antici Group.

Weekly meetings are held in private; the agenda of the meeting is divided into
* a part &quot;I&quot; (I points, items scheduled without debate) and
* a part &quot;II&quot; (II points, items scheduled for debate).
They divide the ministerial agenda into three categories:
*&quot;I points&quot; which are for information and no ministerial decision is needed;
*&quot;A points&quot; where the decision can be made without debate (but it has to be put off the agenda of this meeting if any national delegation opposes it being decided) and is often on a subject outside the detailed responsibility of the particular group of ministers;
*&quot;B points&quot; where debate is needed and the decision may not be known in advance.
An item may be described internally as a &quot;false B point&quot; - this is to give the public impression as a &quot;B point&quot; that ministers are actively debating it because of its importance when in fact it could have been treated as an &quot;A point&quot; because negotiation and compromise has already taken place in COREPER. Relatively few decisions are taken by ministers on true &quot;B points&quot;: they are usually sent back to COREPER until they can be returned as an &quot;A point&quot; or a &quot;false B point&quot;.

The deliberations and decisions of the Council itself under the co-decision procedure are, unlike all other Council meetings, including COREPER and Council working group meetings, public.

<text>William James Sidis (; April 1, 1898 – July 17, 1944) was an American child prodigy with mathematical and linguistic skills. He was active as a mathematician, linguist, historian, and author. He wrote the book &quot;The Animate and the Inanimate&quot;, published in 1925, in which he speculated about the origin of life in the context of thermodynamics. His works were published under various pseudonyms, as he never used his real name as an author.

His father, the psychiatrist Boris Sidis, raised his son according to certain principles with the desire for his son to be gifted. Sidis became famous first for his precocity and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms. He entered Harvard University at age 11 and, as an adult, was claimed by family members to have an IQ between 250 and 300, and to be conversant in about 25 languages and dialects. These statements have not been verified, but many of his contemporaries, including Norbert Wiener and Daniel Frost Comstock, agreed that he was extremely intelligent.

==Biography==
===Parents and upbringing (1898–1908)===
Sidis was born to Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire (now Ukraine), on April 1, 1898, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Boris Sidis, had emigrated in 1887 to escape political and antisemitic persecution. His mother, Sarah (Mandelbaum) Sidis, and her family had fled the pogroms in the late 1880s. She attended Boston University and graduated from its School of Medicine in 1897. William was named after his godfather, Boris&#x27;s friend and colleague, the American philosopher William James. Boris was a psychiatrist and published many books and articles, performing pioneering work in abnormal psychology. Boris was also a polyglot.

Sidis&#x27; parents believed in nurturing precocious and fearless love of knowledge, although their methods of parenting were criticized in the media and retrospectively. Sidis could read the &quot;New York Times&quot; at 18 months. By age eight, he had reportedly taught himself eight languages (Latin, Greek, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Turkish, and Armenian) and invented another, which he called &quot;Vendergood&quot;.

===Harvard University (1909–1914)===
Although the university had previously refused to let his father enroll him at age 9 because he was still a child, in 1909, at age 11, Sidis set a record by becoming the youngest person to enroll at Harvard University. In early 1910, Sidis&#x27; mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard Mathematical Club on four-dimensional bodies, attracting nationwide attention. Notable child prodigy and cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener, who attended Harvard at the time and knew Sidis, wrote in his book &quot;Ex-Prodigy&quot;: &quot;The talk would have done credit to a first or second-year graduate student of any age...talk represented the triumph of the unaided efforts of a very brilliant child.&quot; MIT physics professor Daniel F. Comstock was full of praises: &quot;Karl Friedrich Gauss is the only example in history, of all prodigies, whom Sidis resembles. I predict that young Sidis will be a great astronomical mathematician. He will evolve new theories and invent new ways of calculating astronomical phenomena. I believe he will be a great mathematician, the leader in that science in the future.&quot; Sidis began taking a full-time course load in 1910 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree, &quot;cum laude&quot;, on June 18, 1914, at age 16, earning a mixture of A, B and C grades.

Shortly after graduation, Sidis told reporters: &quot;I want to live the perfect life. The only way to live the perfect life is to live it in seclusion&quot;. He granted an interview to a reporter from the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. The paper reported Sidis&#x27; vows to remain celibate and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for Martha Foley, and enrolled at Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

===Teaching at Rice University and Harvard Law School (1915–1919)===
After a group of Harvard students physically threatened Sidis, his parents secured him a job at the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, as a mathematics teaching assistant. He arrived at Rice in December 1915 at age 17. He was a graduate fellow working toward his doctorate.

Sidis taught three classes: Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and freshman math (he wrote a textbook for the Euclidean geometry course in Greek). After less than a year, frustrated with the department, his teaching requirements, and his treatment by students older than himself, he left his position and returned to New England. When a friend later asked him why he had left, he replied, &quot;I never knew why they gave me the job in the first place—I&#x27;m not much of a teacher. I didn&#x27;t leave: I was asked to go.&quot; Sidis abandoned his pursuit of a graduate degree in mathematics and enrolled at Harvard Law School in September 1916, but withdrew in good standing in his final year in March 1919.

===Politics and arrest (1919–1921)===
In 1919, shortly after his withdrawal from law school, Sidis was arrested for participating in a socialist May Day parade in Boston that turned violent. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison under the Sedition Act of 1918 by Roxbury Municipal Court Judge Albert F. Hayden. Sidis&#x27; arrest was featured prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status. During the trial, Sidis said he had been a conscientious objector to the World War I draft, was a socialist, and did not believe in a god like the &quot;big boss of the Christians&quot;, but rather in something that is in a way apart from a human being. He later developed his own libertarian philosophy based on individual rights and &quot;the American social continuity&quot;. His father arranged with the district attorney to keep Sidis out of prison before his appeal came to trial; instead, his parents held him in their sanatorium in New Hampshire for a year. They took him to California, where he spent another year. At the sanatorium, his parents set about &quot;reforming&quot; him and threatened him with transfer to an insane asylum.

===Later life (1921–1944)===
After returning to the East Coast in 1921, Sidis was determined to live an independent and private life. He only took work running adding machines or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in New York City and became estranged from his parents. It took years before he was legally cleared to return to Massachusetts, and he was concerned for years about his risk of arrest. He obsessively collected streetcar transfers, wrote self-published periodicals, and taught small circles of interested friends his version of American history. In 1933, Sidis passed a Civil Service exam in New York, but scored a low ranking of 254. In a private letter, Sidis wrote that this was &quot;not so encouraging&quot;. In 1935, he wrote an unpublished manuscript, &quot;The Tribes and the States&quot;, which traces Native American contributions to American democracy.

In 1937, in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; titled &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot;, James Thurber pseudonymously described Sidis&#x27; life as lonely, in a &quot;hall bedroom in Boston&#x27;s shabby South End&quot;. In response, Sidis sued, alleging it contained many false statements. Lower courts had dismissed Sidis as a public figure with no right to challenge personal publicity. He lost an appeal on the invasion of privacy lawsuit at the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1940. Judge Charles Edward Clark expressed sympathy for Sidis, who claimed that the publication had exposed him to &quot;public scorn, ridicule, and contempt&quot; and caused him &quot;grievous mental anguish [and] humiliation&quot;, but found that the court was not disposed to &quot;afford to all the intimate details of private life an absolute immunity from the prying of the press&quot;.

The libel portion of the lawsuit however was allowed to continue, and Sidis eventually settled with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for $3,000. 

Sidis died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1944 in Boston at age 46.

==Writing and research==
Sidis&#x27;s writing covered a broad range of subjects. He wrote about cosmology, Native American history, and rail transportation, and invented a language called Vendergood. In &quot;The Animate and the Inanimate&quot; (1925), Sidis predicted the existence of regions of space where the second law of thermodynamics operates in the reverse temporal direction of our local area. &quot;The Tribes and the States&quot; () purports to give a history of the settlement of the Americas from prehistoric times to 1828. 

Sidis was a &quot;peridromophile&quot;, a term he coined for people fascinated with transportation research and streetcar systems. He wrote a treatise on streetcar transfers, &quot;Notes on the Collection of Transfers&quot;, that identified means of increasing public transport usage. In 1930, Sidis received a patent for a rotary perpetual calendar that took into account leap years.

For this work, he was invited to speak at the inaugural &quot;genius meeting&quot; in 1926, hosted by Winifred Sackville Stoner&#x27;s League for Fostering Genius in Tuckahoe, New York.

===&quot;The Animate and the Inanimate&quot;===
Sidis wrote The Animate and the Inanimate to elaborate his thoughts on the origin of life, cosmology, and the potential reversibility of the second law of thermodynamics through Maxwell&#x27;s demon, among other things. It was published in 1925, but it has been suggested that Sidis was working on the theory as early as 1916. One motivation for the theory appears to be to explain psychologist and philosopher William James&#x27;s &quot;reserve energy&quot; theory, which proposed that people subjected to extreme conditions could use &quot;reserve energy&quot;. Sidis&#x27; own &quot;forced prodigy&quot; upbringing was a result of testing the theory. The work is one of the few that Sidis did not write under a pseudonym.

In &quot;The Animate and the Inanimate&quot;, Sidis writes that the universe is infinite and contains sections of &quot;negative tendencies&quot; where the laws of physics are reversed, juxtaposed with &quot;positive tendencies&quot;, which swap over epochs of time. He writes that there was no &quot;origin of life&quot;: life has always existed and has only changed through evolution. Sidis adopted Eduard Pflüger&#x27;s cyanogen-based life theory, and cites &quot;organic&quot; things such as almonds that have cyanogen that does not kill. Because cyanogen is normally highly toxic, almonds are a strange anomaly. Sidis describes his theory as a fusion of the mechanistic model of life and the vitalist model, as well as entertaining the notion that life came to Earth from asteroids (as advanced by Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz). Sidis also writes that functionally speaking, stars are &quot;alive&quot; and undergo an eternally repeating light-dark cycle, reversing the second law in the dark portion of the cycle.

Sidis&#x27; theory was ignored upon release, only to be found in an attic in 1979. Upon this discovery, Buckminster Fuller (who was a classmate of Sidis) wrote in a letter to Gerard Piel:

===&quot;The Tribes and the States&quot;===
The Tribes and the States was written around 1935 but never completed, and remained unpublished at the time of Sidis&#x27; death. It is Sidis&#x27; history of Native Americans, focusing on the Northeastern tribes and continuing to the mid-19th century. He wrote it under the pseudonym &quot;John W. Shattuck&quot;. Much of the history was taken from wampum belts; Sidis explained, &quot;The weaving of wampum belts is a sort of writing by means of belts of colored beads, in which the various designs of beads denoted different ideas according to a definitely accepted system, which could be read by anyone acquainted with wampum language, irrespective of what the spoken language is. Records and treaties are kept in this manner, and individuals could write letters to one another in this way.&quot; Much of the book is centered on Native Americans&#x27; influence on migrating Europeans and the formation of the United States. It describes the origin of the federations that were important to the Founding Fathers. Sidis suggests that &quot;there were red men at one time in Europe as well as in America&quot;.

===Vendergood language===
Sidis created a constructed language called Vendergood in his second book, the &quot;Book of Vendergood&quot;, which he wrote at age 7. While biographer Amy Wallace briefly described the language and manuscript, the whole work is not publicly available. The language was mostly based on Latin and Greek, but also drew on German and French and other Romance languages. It distinguished between eight moods: indicative, potential, imperative absolute, subjunctive, imperative, infinitive, optative, and Sidis&#x27; own &quot;&quot;. One of its chapters is titled &quot;Imperfect and Future Indicative Active&quot;. Other parts explain the origin of Roman numerals. It uses base 12 instead of base 10:

* – &#x27;one&#x27;
* – &#x27;two&#x27;
* – &#x27;three&#x27;
* – &#x27;four&#x27;
* – &#x27;five&#x27;
* – &#x27;six&#x27;
* – &#x27;seven&#x27;
* () – &#x27;eight&#x27;
* – &#x27;nine&#x27;
* – &#x27;ten&#x27;
* – &#x27;eleven&#x27;
* – &#x27;twelve&#x27;
* () – &#x27;thirteen&#x27;

Most of the examples are presented in the form of tests:

# &#x27;The bowman obscures.&#x27; = 
# &#x27;I am learning Vendergood.&#x27; = 
# &#x27;What do you learn?&#x27; (sing.). = 
# &#x27;I obscure ten farmers.&#x27; = 

==Legacy==
After his death, Sidis&#x27; sister Helena said that he had an IQ &quot;the very highest that had ever been obtained&quot;, as reported in Abraham Sperling&#x27;s 1946 book &quot;Psychology for the Millions&quot;. Sperling wrote:

It has been acknowledged that Helena and William&#x27;s mother Sarah had a reputation for exaggerated statements about her family. Helena may have falsely stated that the Civil Service exam William took in 1933 was an IQ test and that his ranking of 254 was an IQ score of 254. It is speculated that the number &quot;254&quot; was actually William&#x27;s placement on the list after he passed the Civil Service exam, as he wrote in a letter to his family. Helena also said: &quot;Billy knew all the languages in the world, while my father only knew 27. I wonder if there were any Billy didn&#x27;t know.&quot; This statement was not backed by any source outside the Sidis family, and Sarah Sidis also made the improbable statement in her 1950 book &quot;The Sidis Story&quot; that William could learn a language in just one day. 

Sidis&#x27; life and work, particularly his ideas about Native Americans, are extensively discussed in Robert M. Pirsig&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; (1991). Sidis is also discussed in Wiener&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Ex-Prodigy&quot;.

In fiction, the Danish author novel &quot;The Perfect Life of William Sidis&quot; (2011) is based on Sidis&#x27; life. Another novel based on Sidis&#x27; life was written by the German author in 2017.

===In education discussions===
Sidis&#x27; upbringing emphasized intellectual pursuits at the expense of other qualities. In 1909, &quot;The New York Times&quot; derisively portrayed Sidis as &quot;a wonderfully successful result of a scientific forcing experiment&quot;. 

Criticism of his father&#x27;s child-rearing methods occurred within a larger discourse about the best way to educate children. Most educators of the day believed that schools should expose children to common experiences to create good citizens. Most psychologists thought intelligence was hereditary, a position that precluded early childhood education at home.

The difficulties Sidis encountered in dealing with the social structure of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing such children to rapidly advance through higher education in his day. Research indicates that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional difficulties gifted children commonly experience.

<doc id="596056" wikidata="Q3141916" url="?curid=596056" title="The Typing of the Dead">
<text>is an arcade game that was developed by WOW Entertainment and published by Sega for the NAOMI hardware. The game was released in Japanese arcades in 1999 and was ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit. A Microsoft Windows version was released in 2000 and a PlayStation 2 port followed in 2004.

&quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; is a modification of Sega&#x27;s 1998 light gun arcade game &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot; in which the gun is replaced by a computer keyboard. The player takes the role of a secret agent in a zombie-infested Venice and must quickly type letters, words and phrases in order to kill fast-advancing enemies.

Despite falling under the criteria of &quot;edutainment&quot;, the game was lauded by mainstream game critics for its humor, difficulty and originality. The PC version of &quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; sold 120,000 units in 2003.

A PlayStation 2 port was called &quot;The Typing of the Dead: Zombie Panic&quot;. This version was released in Japan in late December 2004 and was packaged with a USB keyboard. The game was mostly unchanged, although the Dreamcast backpacks were replaced with PlayStation 2 backpacks and new minigames were incorporated into the main story. Two sequels, &quot;The Typing of the Dead 2&quot; (based on &quot;The House of the Dead 3&quot;) and &quot;The Typing of the Dead: Overkill&quot; (based on &quot;The House of the Dead: Overkill&quot;), were released for PC in 2007 and 2013 respectively. &quot;English of the Dead&quot;, another revision of &quot;House of the Dead 2&quot;, was released as a language-learning game for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008. In 2012, an iOS remake was released entitled Flick of the Dead. 

== Gameplay ==

&quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; has been described variously as a remake or as a mod of the original &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot;. It retains the original&#x27;s first-person rail shooter style, but instead of shooting zombies and other enemies the player must type out words or phrases to kill them. The required word, sentence or phrase is displayed in a box that appears with the enemy. The phrases&#x27; length and complexity increase as the game progresses. Other features retained include the rescue challenges that alter the path the game takes to its final destination and the secrets and bonus items hidden throughout the game.

All levels contain specific challenge areas in which the player is required to kill a certain number of zombies in a limited time. These end with a boss battle that uses some altered form of usual gameplay, such as a long phrase or a question whose answer must be correctly typed. The console ports have &quot;Original&quot; and &quot;Arcade&quot; modes for the main storyline and &quot;Tutorial,&quot; &quot;Drill,&quot; and &quot;Boss&quot; modes for additional typing training. Most other changes are superficial, such as replacement of the weapons wielded by zombies with harmless items and equipping the AMS agents with keyboards attached to backpack Sega Dreamcasts with oversized batteries.

== Plot ==
The plot of the game closely follows that of &quot;House of the Dead 2&quot;. The story begins on February 26, 2000, when several AMS agents have been dispatched to investigate a zombie outbreak in Venice, Italy. The player can control two characters, James and Gary, who are sent to find the original game&#x27;s &quot;G&quot; and then tasked with restoring order. Responsibility for the outbreaks is soon traced to &quot;Goldman,&quot; a banking tycoon and scientist who attempts to end human control of the earth. Much of the game revolves around destroying Goldman&#x27;s creations, concluding with the final boss of &quot;the Emperor.&quot; One of three possible humorous ending sequences occurs, depending on the answers given to the questions asked to defeat the Emperor.

=== Endings ===

There are three possible endings:
* Explosion ending: The character defeats the Emperor, then sees Goldman committing suicide by falling off the building. An explosion is seen as Goldman hits the ground. This ending is achieved by typing honest answers to questions asked in the boss fight.
* Bungee ending: This is similar to the first, but a bungee cord can be seen attached to Goldman&#x27;s leg. Goldman returns to where he was and belches. This ending is achieved by typing a combination of honest and untruthful or strange answers to questions asked in the boss fight.
* Superman ending: Also similar to the first, but as Goldman bids farewell to the player, he raises his hands and rises into the sky. This ending is achieved by typing untruthful answers to questions asked in the boss fight.

== Releases ==
&quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; was originally released for arcades in Japan in 1999 with a special cabinet equipped with dual QWERTY keyboards. The game was one of the first developments by Smilebit, a team of Sega developers that had recently spun off as a new company.

The first home console release was for the Japanese Sega Dreamcast market on March 30, 2000. The North American release took place the following January. A PC port was produced by Empire Interactive and released in September 2001. A second PC release, &quot;Typing of the Dead 2003&quot;, featuring support for higher resolution and a &quot;Kid&#x27;s mode&quot; featuring a new character with Japanese voice acting, was released in Japan only; several other Japanese-exclusive PC versions followed. The original PC version was made available on GameTap in October 2007.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; on their March 15, 2000 issue as being the fourth most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month.

&quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; was regarded overall by critics as an enjoyable game, receiving &quot;favorable&quot; reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Most Innovative&quot; prize among console games, which went to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;.

In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the Dreamcast version a score of 35 out of 40. Reviewers appreciated the absurdist humor of the game&#x27;s format, especially in the unusual phrases the game generates during later levels. The sub-par voice acting of the original &quot;House of the Dead 2&quot; was considered to enhance this aspect of the game.

The quality of the graphics was criticized to varying degrees, as they had not been updated from the original &quot;House of the Dead 2&quot; arcade version. &quot;PC World&quot; was so unimpressed with the game&#x27;s premise that they listed it as a runner up on a &quot;Top Ten Worst Games&quot; list.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; has named the game the weirdest of all time.

<text>Day One Christian Ministries, formerly known as the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society (LDOS), is a Christian organisation based in the United Kingdom that lobbies for no work on Sunday, the day that many Christians celebrate as the Sabbath, a day of rest. This position is based on the fourth (by the Hebrew reckoning) of the Ten Commandments. Day One incorporates Day One Publications (its publishing arm) and the Daylight Christian Prison Trust. 

&quot;The Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society&quot; was founded by Joseph Wilson and Daniel Wilson in 1831. It became the most powerful sabbatarian organisation in England, opposed to Sunday newspapers, train travel, and mail delivery. According to Stephen Miller, their &quot;clamor for change provoked a backlash&quot;, and there was conflict in Victorian England over this issue for the rest of the nineteenth century. In a 1953 speech to Parliament, John Parker described it as &quot;one of the strongest pressure groups in this country.&quot;

LDOS later united with other sabbatarian organisations, including the Working Men&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Day Rest Association (1920), the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Association of Scotland (1953), and the Imperial Alliance for the Defence of Sunday (1965).

<doc id="596061" wikidata="Q121060" url="?curid=596061" title="Matthew Gregory Lewis">
<text>Matthew Gregory Lewis (9 July 1775 – 14 or 16 May 1818) was an English novelist and dramatist, whose writings are often classified as &quot;Gothic horror&quot;. He was frequently referred to as &quot;Monk&quot;Lewis, because of the success of his 1796 Gothic novel &quot;The Monk&quot;. He also worked as a diplomat, politician and an estate owner in Jamaica.

==Biography==
===Family===
Lewis was the first-born child of Matthew and Frances Maria Sewell Lewis. His father, Matthew Lewis, was the son of William Lewis and Jane Gregory and was born in England in 1750. He attended Westminster School before proceeding to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1769 and his master&#x27;s in 1772. During his time at Westminster, Lewis&#x27;s parents separated. Mrs Lewis moved to France in this period; while there, she was in continuous correspondence with Matthew. The correspondence between Matthew and his mother consisted of discussion regarding the poor state of his mother&#x27;s welfare and estate.

That same year, Lewis was appointed Chief Clerk in the War Office. The following year, he married Frances Maria Sewell, a young woman who was very popular at court. She was the third daughter of the senior judge Sir Thomas Sewell and was one of eight children born in his first marriage to Catherine Heath. Her family, like Lewis&#x27;s, had connections with Jamaica. As a child, she spent her time in Ottershaw. In December 1775, in addition to his War Office post, Lewis became the Deputy Secretary at War. With one exception, he was the first to hold both positions and receive both salaries contemporaneously. Lewis owned considerable property in Jamaica, within four miles of Savanna-la-Mer, or Savanna-la-Mar, which was hit by a devastating earthquake and hurricane in 1779. His son would later inherit this property.

In addition to Matthew Gregory Lewis, Matthew and Frances had three other children: Maria, Barrington, and Sophia Elizabeth. On 23 July 1781, when Matthew was six and his youngest sister one-and-a-half years old, Frances left her husband, taking the music master, Samuel Harrison, as her lover. During their estrangement, Frances lived under a different name, Langley, in order to hide her location from her husband, although he still learned of her whereabouts. On 3 July 1782, Frances gave birth to a child. That same day, hearing of the birth, her estranged husband returned. Afterwards, he began to arrange a legal separation from his wife. After formally accusing his wife of adultery through the Consistory Court of the Bishop of London on 27 February 1783, he petitioned the House of Lords for permission to bring about a bill of divorce. However, these bills were rarely granted and it was rejected when brought to a vote. Consequently, Matthew and Frances remained married until his death in 1812. Frances, though withdrawing from society and temporarily moving to France, was always supported financially by her husband and then later, her son. She later returned to London and then finished her life at Leatherhead, rejoining society and even becoming a lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Wales. Frances and her son remained quite close, with her taking on the responsibility of helping him with his literary career. She even became a published author, much to her son&#x27;s dislike.

Lewis had a tumultuous relationship with the mistresses his father took on, always siding with his exiled mother in family disputes. His rudeness to such women brought him to the perpetual verge of disinheritance, a threat commonly held over his head and sometimes acted on throughout his lifetime.

Lewis&#x27;s sisters (especially Lady Lushington) often suggested edits for Lewis&#x27;s work aimed at making them more acceptable to the public, and went so far as to compose their own drafts of his plays. He rejected all such suggestions.

Lewis was also in a long term relationship with William Kelly, brother of Attorney General for England and Wales Fitzroy Kelly.

===Education===
Lewis began his education at a preparatory school called Marylebone Seminary under the Rev. Dr John Fountayne, Dean of York. Fountayne was a friend of both the Lewis and Sewell families. There Lewis learned Latin, Greek, French, writing, arithmetic, drawing, dancing, and fencing. He and his classmates were permitted to converse only in French throughout the day. Like many of his classmates, Lewis used the Marylebone Seminary as a stepping stone, proceeding from there to Westminster School, like his father, at the age of eight. There he acted in the Town Boys&#x27; Play as Falconbridge in &quot;King John&quot; and then My Lord Duke in James Townley&#x27;s farce, &quot;High Life Below Stairs&quot;.

Again like his father, he entered Christ Church, Oxford on 27 April 1790 at the age of 15. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1794 and earned a master&#x27;s degree from the same college in 1797. Lewis frequently complained about the obligation to learn classical languages at Oxford, and spent much of the actual time of his degree abroad in Germany working as a German diplomat. It was during this period he became acquainted with Goethe.

===Professional life===
Intended for a diplomatic career like his father, Lewis spent most of his school vacations abroad, studying modern languages. His travels sent him to London, Chatham, Scotland, and the continent at least twice, including Paris in 1791 and Weimar, Germany in 1792–1793. During these travels, he enjoyed spending time in society, a trait that he retained throughout his life. In the same period, he began translating existing works and writing his own plays.

In 1791, he sent his mother a copy of a farce that he had written named &quot;The Epistolary Intrigue&quot;. Though he intended the play to be performed at London&#x27;s Drury Lane, it was rejected there and then later by the neighbouring Covent Garden. He supposedly completed a two-volume novel in the same period. This survives only in fragments in the posthumously published &quot;The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis&quot;. In March 1792, Lewis translated the French opera &quot;Felix&quot; and sent it to Drury Lane, hoping to earn money for his mother. While he tried to write a novel like Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, he mainly adhered to theatre, writing &quot;The East Indian&quot;. However, it would be seven years before this appeared on stage at Drury Lane. In Germany, he even translated Wieland&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot;, a difficult work of poetry which earned him the respect of his acquaintance Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

While Lewis pursued these literary ambitions, mainly to earn money for his mother, he gained through his father&#x27;s influence a position as an attaché to the British embassy in The Hague. He arrived on 15 May 1794 and remained until December of the same year. He found at local bars (his favourite being Madame de Matignon&#x27;s Salon) friends among visiting French aristocracy fleeing revolutionary France, but nonetheless, Lewis saw The Hague as a place of boredom and disliked its Dutch citizens. 

There Lewis produced in ten weeks his romance &quot;Ambrosio&quot; or &quot;The Monk&quot;, which was published anonymously in the summer of the following year and immediately gained him celebrity. However, some passages were such that about a year after its appearance an injunction to restrain its sale was obtained. In the second edition, Lewis cited himself as the author and as a Member of Parliament (for Hindon in Wiltshire), and removed what he assumed were the objectionable passages, but the work retained much of its horrific character. Lord Byron in &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot; wrote of &quot;Wonder-working Lewis, Monk or Bard / Who fain wouldst make Parnassus a churchyard; / Even Satan&#x27;s self with thee might dread to dwell, / And in thy skull discern a deeper hell.&quot; The Marquis de Sade also praised Lewis in his essay &quot;Reflections on the Novel&quot;.
On 22 March 1802 Harriett Litchfield appeared in a Gothic monodrama at The Haymarket called &quot;The Captive&quot; by Lewis. This recounts the story of a wife imprisoned by her husband. The stage directions included details designed to improve the Gothic situation. Litchfield was complimented for her delivery &quot;in the most perfect manner&quot;, but she plays a woman denied any human contact and kept in a modern dungeon. She is not mad but realises that she will soon be a maniac. The play is thought to have been suggested by one of Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s books. It was said that even the staff of the theatre left in horror. The play was staged only once.

Lewis held two estates in Jamaica: Cornwall estate in Westmoreland Parish and Hordley estate in Saint Thomas Parish. According to the slave registers, Hordley was co-owned with George Scott and Matthew Henry Scott and their shares were purchased by Lewis in 1817, thus making him sole owner of more than 500 slaves.

Lewis visited Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley in Geneva, Switzerland, in the summer of 1816 and recounted five ghost stories, which Shelley recorded in his &quot;Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories) and on return to England, 1816&quot;, beginning with the entry for 18 August, which was published posthumously.

Lewis visited his estates in Jamaica in 1818. During his visit, he saw William Adamson&#x27;s production of &quot;Adelgitha&quot;, and complained about the performance of John Castello, the &quot;West Indian Roscius&quot; who played the role of Lothair. He died of yellow fever on board ship whilst sailing back and was buried at sea.

&quot;The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis&quot;, in two volumes, was published in 1839. &quot;The Effusions of Sensibility&quot;, his first novel, was never completed.

==Reception of his work==

As a writer, Lewis is typically classified as writing in the Gothic horror genre, along with the authors Charles Maturin and Mary Shelley. Lewis was most assuredly influenced by Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; and William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Caleb Williams&quot;. In fact, Lewis actually wrote a letter to his mother a few months before he began writing &quot;The Monk&quot;, stating that he saw a resemblance between the villain Montoni from &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; and himself.

Lewis took Radcliffe&#x27;s obsession with the supernatural and Godwin&#x27;s narrative drive and interest in crime and punishment, but Lewis differed with his literary approach. Whereas Radcliffe would allude to the imagined horrors under the genre of terror-Gothic, Lewis defined himself by disclosing the details of the gruesome scenes, earning him the title of a Gothic horror novelist. 

Lewis was often criticized for a lack of originality. Though much of his career was spent translating the texts of others, these criticisms more often refer to his novel &quot;The Monk&quot; and his play &quot;The Castle Spectre&quot;. Beginning with &quot;The Monk&quot;, Lewis starts the novel with an advertisement:
The first idea of this Romance was suggested by the story of the Santon Barsisa, related in The Guardian. – The Bleeding Nun is a tradition still credited in many parts of Germany; and I have been told, that the ruins of the Castle of Lauenstein, which She is supposed to haunt, may yet be seen upon the borders of Thuringia. – The Water-King, from the third to twelfth stanza, is the fragment of an original Danish Ballad – And Belerma and Durandarte is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of old Spanish poetry, which contains also the popular song of Gayferos and Melesindra, mentioned in Don Quixote. – I have now made a full avowal of all the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself; but I doubt not, many more may be found, of which I am at present totally unconscious.

While some critics, like those of &quot;The Monthly Review&quot;, saw combinations of previous works as a new invention, others, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, have argued that by revealing where he found inspiration, Lewis surrendered part of his authorship. This bothered Lewis so much that in addition to a note in the fourth edition of &quot;The Monk&quot;, he included notes to the text when he published &quot;The Castle Spectre&quot; as a way to counteract any accusations of plagiarism. The success of the tactic is debatable.

Lewis&#x27;s monodrama &quot;The Captive&quot; tells of a woman consigned to a mental asylum by her husband against her will, who gradually drives herself mad through the terrible spectacles she witnesses there. It is a short script of only a few pages, but one that was performed over a few hours, giving the impression that much of the work must have taken place in slow recreation of physical violence within the asylum. The performance was shut down halfway through, on account of ladies in the audience fainting. &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s review suggests &quot;the tears of an audience have generally been accounted the highest species of applause... [but] a poet must have an odd taste who would be rewarded with hysteric fits.&quot; This suggests that Lewis himself took the attitude of enjoying throwing audiences into &quot;fits&quot; and being &quot;rewarded&quot; by it.

Lewis provided many epilogues and introductions for other performances put on in the Drury Lane Theatre, most often for Thomas Holcroft. Lewis would insert ghosts into otherwise non-supernatural plays. These ghosts would complain about the lack of ghosts in said non-supernatural plays. &quot;I see not one Ghost through the whole of the part / Cannot once find a place for a Tragedy start&quot; (from Holcroft&#x27;s &quot;Knave or Not?&quot;, 1798). This may represent purposeful self-mockery.

Lewis wrote in 1801 a satire on the reception of his work under the pseudonym &quot;Maritius Moonshine&quot;, in which he slanders his own writings as &quot;loathesome [sic] spectacles&quot; and insults himself for being a poor MP (&quot;thy brighter parts are lost, / And the state&#x27;s welfare by a Goblin croft&quot;). In the preface to &quot;Alfonso, King of Castile&quot;, Lewis writes &quot;that this play is stupid, let it be said&quot;. Lewis consistently indicates that he is fully aware of the public opinion of his works as poor and sensational, embraced these definitions, and did not care about them. Almost every one of his works is prefaced by admissions and lists of &quot;minor plagiarisms&quot;.

<doc id="596065" wikidata="Q7757952" url="?curid=596065" title="The Power of Myth">
<text>The Power of Myth is a book based on the 1988 PBS documentary Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth. The documentary was originally broadcast as six one-hour conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) and journalist Bill Moyers. It remains one of the most popular series in the history of American public television.

==Overview==
The interviews in the first five episodes were filmed at George Lucas&#x27;s Skywalker Ranch in California, with the sixth interview conducted at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, during the final two summers of Campbell&#x27;s life. (The series was broadcast on television the year following his death.) In these discussions Campbell presents his ideas about comparative mythology and the ongoing role of myth in human society. These talks include excerpts from Campbell&#x27;s seminal work &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;

==Companion book==

The companion book for the series, &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; (Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, and editor Betty Sue Flowers), was released in 1988 at the same time the series aired on PBS. In the editor&#x27;s note to &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, Flowers credits Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, as &quot;the Doubleday editor, whose interest in the ideas of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book.&quot; The book follows the format of the documentary and provides additional discussions not included in the original six-hour release. Chapters:

# Myth and the Modern World
# The Journey Inward
# The First Storytellers
# Sacrifice and Bliss
# The Hero&#x27;s Adventure
# The Gift of the Goddess
# Tales of Love and Marriage
# Masks of Eternity
# The Tale of Buddha

&quot;The Power of Myth&quot; is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that were the basis for the acclaimed television series. It deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. Campbell blends accounts of his own upbringing and experience with stories from many cultures and civilizations to present the reader with his most compelling thesis that modern society is going through a transition from the old mythologies and traditions to a new way of thinking where a global mythology will emerge.

Some of the material in the first chapter comes from Campbell&#x27;s previously published books, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and &quot;The Masks of God&quot;. The main theme of the book is the universality of myths—what Campbell calls &quot;mankind&#x27;s one great story&quot;— that occur throughout the history of mankind, no matter which epoch or whichever culture or society is considered. Myths are the body of stories and legends that a people perceive as being an integral part of their culture. Before the invention of writing, these stories and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions. The reappearance of certain themes, time and again, in different mythologies, leads to the realization that these themes portray universal and eternal truths about mankind.

Campbell defines the function of a mythology as the provision of a cultural framework for a society or people to educate their young, and to provide them with a means of coping with their passage through the different stages of life from birth to death. In a general sense myths include religion as well and the development of religion is an intrinsic part of a society&#x27;s culture. A mythology is inevitably bound to the society and time in which it occurs and cannot be divorced from this culture and environment. This is true even though Western society previously learnt from, and was informed by, the mythology of other cultures by including the study of Greek and Roman writings as part of its heritage.

The record of the history of the development of a culture and society is embodied in its mythology. For example, the Bible describes the evolution of the Judeo-Christian concept of God from the time when the Jews were in Babylon and the god they worshiped corresponded to a local tribal god, to when the concept became that of a world savior as a result of the Hebrews becoming a major force in the East Mediterranean region. The geographic context of a specific mythology also plays a role in its evolution. The physical scope of Biblical mythology was limited to the general area of the Middle East but in other parts of the world, Chinese and Aztec religions and cultures emerged as separate and distinct belief systems. When different cultures expand their spheres of influence they eventually come into contact with each other, and the outcome of the collision, be it conquest, subjugation, or amalgamation, will be evident in the resultant mythology.

The form and function of mythology in the modern world is the main topic of this chapter and to illustrate his ideas, Campbell recounts aspects of his own earlier life. Without specifically stating it, the assumption is made that the modern world under consideration is that of Campbell&#x27;s world—the Christian-based, urbanized culture of North America, the so-called Modern Western Society.

Campbell describes his own upbringing as a Roman Catholic and his early fascination with the myths and stories of the American Indians. He recalls the excitement he felt when he realized that the motifs of creation, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, which the nuns were teaching him at his school, also occurred in American Indian myths. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest in comparative mythology. Later on in life he found the same universal themes in Hinduism and in the medieval Arthurian legends.

The discussion considers the role of myth and ritual in contemporary society. Contemporary rituals are carried out to mark special events in private lives, such as an individual&#x27;s marriage or enlistment in a branch of the armed forces and on public occasions such as the inauguration of civil and national leaders. In the Introduction to the book, Moyers recalls Campbell&#x27;s description of the solemn state funeral after the assassination of John F. Kennedy as an &quot;illustration of the high service of ritual to a society,&quot; and where Campbell identifies the ritualized occasion as fulfilling a great social necessity.

In general, however, Campbell and Moyers reach the conclusion that there is a lack of effective mythology and ritual in modern American society. They find nothing that compares with the powerful puberty rituals of primitive societies. They claim that the exclusion of classical studies from the modern educational syllabus has led to a lack of awareness of the mythological foundations of western society&#x27;s heritage. This, combined with an increased materialism and emphasis on technology, has led to modern youth in New York becoming alienated from the mainstream of society and inventing their own morality, initiations and gangs.

Marriage, as an example of a paramount modern social institution, becomes the next subject of discussion. Campbell differentiates between marriage and love affairs and imparts some very lofty ideals to marriage, in contrast to love affairs, that he categorically states inevitably end in disappointment. True marriage, in Campbell&#x27;s opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. Campbell and Moyers agree that the main objective of marriage is not the birth of children and the raising of families. They discard the concept of perpetuation of the human species as being the primary function of marriage and relegate this to a first stage. This first stage is followed by a second one where the offspring have departed into the world and only the couple is left. Campbell invokes the image of marriage as being an ordeal in which the ego is sacrificed to a relationship in which two have become one. This, he states, is a mythological image that embodies the sacrifice of the visible for a transcendent good. Campbell labels this stage of marriage as the alchemical stage. On the subject of the ritual of marriage, Campbell and Moyers complain that it has lost its force and has become a mere remnant of the original; they contend that the ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form.

The interviews between Campbell and Moyers are recorded at George Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch. Campbell and Lucas became friends when Lucas publicly acknowledged the influence Campbell&#x27;s writings had on the development of his hugely successful film &quot;Star Wars.&quot; Campbell expresses great enthusiasm for this film, a film that he says conforms to classical mythological legends. So it is not surprising that there are many references to the characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot; throughout the book. In a similar fashion, John Wayne is identified as a modern myth and Campbell recalls Douglas Fairbanks as having been a boyhood hero.

At the beginning of this chapter, and in other parts of the book, Campbell states that modern society lacks the stability it previously derived from being educated in the mythology and legends of the Greek and Roman classics. Campbell and Moyers agree that there is no effective mythology in modern society by which individuals can relate to their role in the world. An analysis of the national symbols of the United States is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. More recently, when the image of the Earth, taken from the lunar landings, was published, it led to the universal realization that human beings must identify with the entire planet. This concept of the emergence of a new mythology based on global aspects of life is reiterated several times by Campbell.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot;==
In the first episode of the series, &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, and the fifth chapter of the book, &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Adventure,&quot; Moyers and Campbell discuss George Lucas&#x27; report that Campbell&#x27;s work directly influenced the creation of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.
Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999, modeled after &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;. It was called the &quot;Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas &amp; Bill Moyers&quot; and further discussed the impact of Campbell&#x27;s work on Lucas&#x27; films.

==Errata==
The words attributed to Chief Seattle, read by Campbell in the fourth episode of the series, were actually written by Ted Perry for a 1972 ecology film called &quot;Home&quot;.

<text>Shapingba () is a district of Chongqing, People&#x27;s Republic of China, formerly known as Shaci District () during the Sino-Japanese War. It is one of the central parts of Chongqing and covers around 396 square kilometers, with 13 subdistricts and 11 towns. Shapingba is one of the most populated areas in Chongqing with a population of around one million.

==Location and geography==

Shapingba is one of Chongqing&#x27;s main districts. It borders Jiulongpo to the south, Bishan to the west and Beibei to the north. The district itself is on the west bank of the Jialing River.

==History==
Before Shapingba District became a part of Chongqing, it was part of Baxian (now Banan District). In the early 1930s, Shapingba District belonged to Baxian First District, and the government was located at Ciqikou (Longyin Town), in the ancient section of town. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist government moved its capital to Chongqing, and a large number of schools, factories and medical institutions settled in Shapingba.
On February 6, 1938, the Chongqing University, the Sichuan College of Education, the Chongqing Nankai Middle School, the Chongqing Electrical Steel Works and several institutions relocated to Shapingba from Beijing, Shanghai or Nanjing such as the National Central University, China Radio International, and the Academia Sinica.

==Administrative divisions==
===Colleges and universities===
*Chongqing University (重庆大学) (founded in 1929)
*Chongqing University of Science and Technology (重庆科技学院)
*Army Medical University (陆军军医大学)

==Transport==
Transport connections to and from Shapingba has improved over the years. There are buses that run directly to most other districts including Jiangbei, Yuzhong and Jiulongpo. Three highways, Chengdu-Chongqing, Chongqing-Changshou and Shangqiao-Jieshi come across here. Within only half an hour, it is possible to reach the Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport. Chongqing&#x27;s West Railway Station is located in Shapingba. Though departures and arrivals are somewhat limited at this station, it is quite useful for trips to nearby destations such as Guiyang or Dazhou.

<doc id="596067" wikidata="Q2565240" url="?curid=596067" title="Naval battles of the American Revolutionary War">
<text>The American Revolutionary War saw a series of battles involving naval forces of the British Royal Navy and the Continental Navy from 1775, and of the French Navy from 1778 onwards. Although the British enjoyed more numerical victories, these battles culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis, an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From the start of the hostilities, the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids against patriot communities. Colonial forces could do little to stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777, colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships, which they took into French and Spanish ports, although both were officially neutral. Seeking to challenge Britain, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French invasion forced the British to concentrate its forces in the English Channel, leaving its forces in North America vulnerable to attacks.

France officially entered the war on 17 June 1778, and the French ships sent to the Western Hemisphere spent most of the year in the West Indies, and only sailed to the Thirteen Colonies from July until November. In the first Franco-American campaign, a French fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d&#x27;Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor coordination and bad weather, d&#x27;Estaing and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British turned their attention to the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces, however failing leading the British victors to remain in control till late 1782.

In 1780, another fleet and 6,000 troops commanded by Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, landed at Newport, and shortly afterwards was blockaded by the British. In early 1781, General George Washington and the comte de Rochambeau planned an attack against the British in the Chesapeake Bay area coordinated with the arrival of a large fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse from the West Indies. British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney, who had been tracking de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter&#x27;s departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral&#x27;s destination. Believing that de Grasse would return a portion of his fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood and 15 ships of the line with orders to find de Grasse&#x27;s destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe with the rest of his fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.

British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain, and, after much indecision by British naval commanders, the French fleet gained control over Chesapeake Bay, landing forces near Yorktown. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this control in the key Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September but Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated. Protected from the sea by French ships, Franco-American forces surrounded, besieged and forced the surrender of British forces commanded by General Cornwallis, concluding major operations in North America. When the news reached London, the government of Lord Frederick North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognised the independence of the United States of America.

==Early actions, 1775–1778==
===First skirmishes===
The Battle of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775 drew thousands of militia forces from throughout New England to the towns surrounding Boston. These men remained in the area and their numbers grew, placing the British forces in Boston under siege when they blocked all land access to the peninsula. The British were still able to sail in supplies from Nova Scotia, Providence, and other places because the harbour remained under British naval control. Colonial forces could do nothing to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet and the complete absence of any sort of rebel armed vessels in the spring of 1775. Nevertheless, while the British were able to resupply the city by sea, the inhabitants and the British forces were on short rations, and prices rose quickly Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves commanded the Royal Navy around occupied Boston under overall leadership of Governor General Thomas Gage. Graves had hired storage on Noddle&#x27;s Island for a variety of important naval supplies, hay and livestock, which he felt were important to preserve, owing to the &quot;almost impossibility of replacing them at this Juncture&quot;.

During the siege, with the supplies in the city running shorter by the day, British troops were sent to the Boston Harbour to raid farms for supplies. Graves, apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle&#x27;s Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree as to whether or not any regulars or marines were stationed &quot;on&quot; Noddle&#x27;s Island to protect the naval supplies. In response, the Colonials began clearing Noddle&#x27;s Island and Hog Island of anything useful to the British. Graves on his flagship , taking notice of this, signalled for the guard marines to land on Noddle&#x27;s island and ordered the armed schooner , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to cut off the colonists&#x27; route. This contested action resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the capture and burning of &quot;Diana&quot;. This setback prompted Graves to move , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved manoeuvrability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle&#x27;s Island; the colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.

The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Polly&quot; from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner &quot;Margaretta&quot; under the command of James Moore, a midshipman from Graves&#x27; flagship &quot;Preston&quot;. Moore also carried orders to recover what he could from the wreck of , which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775. After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels with breastwork, armed her with the guns and swivels taken from &quot;Margaretta&quot; and changed her name to &quot;Machias Liberty&quot;. In July 1775, Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, &quot;Diligent&quot; and &quot;Tatamagouche&quot;, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour. In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both &quot;Machias Liberty&quot; and &quot;Diligent&quot; into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien as their commander. The community would be a base for privateering until the war&#x27;s end.

Their resistance, and that of other coastal communities, led Graves to authorise a reprisal expedition in October whose sole significant act was the Burning of Falmouth. On 30 August, Royal Naval Captain James Wallace, commanding fired into the town of Stonington, after the townspeople there prevented &quot;Rose&quot;″s tender from capturing a vessel it had chased into the harbour. Wallace also fired on the town of Bristol, in October, after its townspeople refused to deliver livestock to him. The outrage in the colonies over these action contributed to the passing of legislation by the Second Continental Congress that established the Continental Navy. The US Navy recognises 13 October 1775, as the date of its official establishment — the Second Continental Congress had established the Continental Navy in late 1775. On this day, Congress authorised the purchase of two armed vessels for a cruise against British merchant ships; these ships became and . The first ship in commission was purchased on 4 November and commissioned on 3 December by Captain Dudley Saltonstall. John Adams drafted its first governing regulations, adopted by Congress on 28 November 1775, which remained in effect throughout the Revolution. The Rhode Island resolution, reconsidered by the Continental Congress, passed on 13 December 1775, authorising the building of thirteen frigates within the next three months, five ships of 32 guns, five with 28 guns and three with 24 guns.

===Foundation of the Continental Navy===

The desperate shortage of gunpowder available to the Continental Army had led the Congress to organise a naval expedition, one of whose goals was the seizure of the military supplies at Nassau. While the orders issued by the Congress to Esek Hopkins, the fleet captain selected to lead the expedition, included only instructions for patrolling and raiding British naval targets on the Virginia and Carolina coastline, additional instructions may have been given to Hopkins in secret meetings of the Congress&#x27; Naval Committee. The instructions that Hopkins issued to his fleet&#x27;s captains before it sailed from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, included instructions to rendezvous at Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. The fleet that Hopkins launched consisted of: &quot;Alfred&quot;, , , , &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot;, , and &quot;Columbus&quot;. In addition to ships&#x27; crews, it carried 200 marines under the command of Samuel Nicholas. In early March, the fleet (reduced by one due to tangled rigging en route) landed marines on the island of New Providence and captured the town of Nassau in the Bahamas. After loading the fleet&#x27;s ships, (enlarged to include two captured prize ships), with military stores, the fleet sailed north on 17 March, with one ship dispatched to Philadelphia, while the rest of the fleet sailed for the Block Island channel, with Governor Browne and other officials as prisoners. Outbreaks of a variety of diseases, including fevers and smallpox, resulting in significant reductions in crew effectiveness, marked the fleet&#x27;s cruise.

The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters off Long Island. On 4 April, the fleet encountered and captured a prize, &quot;Hawk&quot;, which was laden with supplies. The next day brought a second prize &quot;Bolton&quot;, which was also laden with stores that included more armaments and powder. Hoping to catch more easy prizes, Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night, forming the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns. The need to man the prizes further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet&#x27;s ships. The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the &quot;Glasgow&quot;, a heavily armed sixth-rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered &quot;Glasgow&quot; managed to escape capture, severely damaging the &quot;Cabot&quot; in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins&#x27; son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others. &quot;Andrew Doria&quot;&#x27;s Captain Nicholas Biddle described the battle as &quot;helter-skelter&quot;. They reached New London on 8 April.

Although Continental Congress President John Hancock praised Hopkins for the fleet&#x27;s performance, its failure to capture &quot;Glasgow&quot; gave opponents of the Navy in and out of Congress opportunities for criticism. Nicholas Biddle wrote of the action, &quot;A more imprudent, ill-conducted affair never happened&quot;. Abraham Whipple, captain of &quot;Columbus&quot;, endured rumours and accusations of cowardice for a time, but eventually asked for a court-martial to clear his name. Held on 6 May by a panel consisting of officers who had been on the cruise, he was cleared of cowardice, although he was criticised for errors of judgment. John Hazard, captain of &quot;Providence&quot;, was not so fortunate. Charged by his subordinate officers with a variety of offences, including neglect of duty during the &quot;Glasgow&quot; action, he was convicted by court-martial and forced to surrender his commission.

Commodore Hopkins came under scrutiny from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, and he had distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet&#x27;s failure to sail again (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were not strong enough to dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.

On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold supervised the construction of 12 vessels to protect access into Hudson River&#x27;s uppermost navigable reaches from advancing British forces. A British fleet destroyed Arnold&#x27;s in the Battle of Valcour Island, but the fleet&#x27;s presence on the lake managed to slow down the British progression enough until winter came before they were able capture Fort Ticonderoga. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.

Privateers had some success with 1,697 letters of marque being issued by Congress. Individual states and American agents in Europe and in the Caribbean also issued commissions. Taking duplications into account, various authorities issued more than 2,000 commissions. Lloyd&#x27;s of London estimated that Yankee privateers captured 2,208 British ships, amounting to almost $66 million, a significant sum at the time.

==France enters the war, 1778–1780==
===French movements===

For its first major attempt at co-operation with the Americans, France sent Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d&#x27;Estaing, with a fleet of 12 ships of the line and some French Army troops to North America in April 1778, with orders to blockade the British North American fleet in the Delaware River. Although British leaders had early intelligence that d&#x27;Estaing was likely headed for North America, political and military differences within the government and navy delayed the British response, allowing him to sail unopposed through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was not until early June that a fleet of 13 ships of the line under the command of Vice-Admiral John Byron left European waters in pursuit. D&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s Atlantic crossing took three months, but Byron (who was called &quot;Foul-weather Jack&quot; due to his repeated bad luck with the weather) was also delayed by bad weather and did not reach New York until mid-August.

The British evacuated Philadelphia to New York City before d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s arrival, and their North American fleet was no longer in the river when his fleet arrived at Delaware Bay in early July. D&#x27;Estaing decided to sail for New York, but its well-defended harbour presented a daunting challenge to the French fleet. Since the French and their American pilots believed his largest ships were unable to cross the sandbar into New York harbour, their leaders decided to deploy their forces against British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. While d&#x27;Estaing was outside the harbour, British Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe dispatched a fleet of transports carrying 2,000 troops to reinforce Newport via Long Island Sound; these reached their destination on 15 July, raising the size of Major General Sir Robert Pigot&#x27;s garrison to over 6,700 men.

===French arrival at Newport===

On 22 July, when the British judged the tide high enough for the French ships to cross the sandbar, d&#x27;Estaing sailed instead from his position outside New York harbour. He sailed south initially before turning northeast toward Newport. The British fleet in New York, eight ships of the line under the command of Lord Richard Howe, sailed out after him once they discovered his destination was Newport. D&#x27;Estaing arrived off Point Judith on 29 July, and immediately met with Major Generals Nathanael Greene and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, to develop a plan of attack. Major General John Sullivan&#x27;s proposal was that the Americans would cross over to Aquidneck Island&#x27;s (Rhode Island) eastern shore from Tiverton, while French troops using Conanicut Island as a staging ground, would cross from the west, cutting off a detachment of British soldiers at Butts Hill on the northern part of the island. The next day, d&#x27;Estaing sent frigates into the Sakonnet River (the channel to the east of Aquidneck) and into the main channel leading to Newport.

As allied intentions became clear, General Pigot decided to redeploy his forces in a defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked their way up the channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport&#x27;s harbour. On 8 August d&#x27;Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.

On 9 August d&#x27;Estaing began disembarking some of his 4,000 troops onto nearby Conanicut Island. The same day, General Sullivan learned that Pigot had abandoned Butts Hill. Contrary to the agreement with d&#x27;Estaing, Sullivan then crossed troops over to seize that high ground, concerned that the British might reoccupy it in strength. Although d&#x27;Estaing later approved of the action, his initial reaction, and that of some of his officers, was one of disapproval. John Laurens wrote that the action &quot;gave much umbrage to the French officers&quot;. Sullivan was en route to a meeting with d&#x27;Estaing when the latter learned that Admiral Howe&#x27;s fleet had arrived.

===Storm damage===

Lord Howe&#x27;s fleet was delayed departing New York by contrary winds, and he arrived off Point Judith on 9 August. Since d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet outnumbered Howe&#x27;s, the French admiral, fearful that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, reboarded the French troops, and sailed out to do battle with Howe on 10 August. As the two fleets prepared to battle and manoeuvreered for position, the weather deteriorated, and a major storm broke out. Raging for two days, the storm scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship. It also frustrated plans by Sullivan to attack Newport without French support on 11 August. While Sullivan awaited the return of the French fleet, he began siege operations, moving closer to the British lines on 15 August and opening trenches to the northeast of the fortified British line north of Newport the next day.

As the two fleets sought to regroup, individual ships encountered enemy ships, and there were several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships (including d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s flagship), already suffering storm damage, were badly mauled in these encounters. The French fleet regrouped off Delaware, and returned to Newport on 20 August, while the British fleet regrouped at New York.

Despite pressure from his captains to sail immediately for Boston to make repairs, Admiral d&#x27;Estaing instead sailed for Newport to inform the Americans he would be unable to assist them. Upon his arrival on 20 August he informed Sullivan, and rejected entreaties that the British could be compelled to surrender in just one or two days with their help. Of the decision, d&#x27;Estaing wrote: &quot;It was [...] difficult to persuade oneself that about six thousand men well entrenched and with a fort before which they had dug trenches could be taken either in twenty-four hours or in two days&quot;. Any thought of the French fleet remaining at Newport was also opposed by d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s captains, with whom he had a difficult relationship because of his arrival in the navy at a high rank after service in the French army. D&#x27;Estaing sailed for Boston on 22 August.

===D&#x27;Estaing reaches Boston===
The French decision brought on a wave of anger in the American ranks and its commanders. Although General Greene penned a complaint that John Laurens termed &quot;sensible and spirited&quot;, General Sullivan was less diplomatic. In a missive containing much inflammatory language, he called d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s decision &quot;derogatory to the honor of France&quot;, and included further complaints in orders of the day that were later suppressed when cooler heads prevailed. American writers from the ranks called the French decision a &quot;desertion&quot;, and noted that they &quot;left us in a most Rascally manner&quot;.

The French departure prompted a mass exodus of the American militia, significantly shrinking the American force. On 24 August, Sullivan was alerted by General George Washington that Clinton was assembling a relief force in New York. That evening his council made the decision to withdraw to positions on the northern part of the island. Sullivan continued to seek French assistance, dispatching Lafayette to Boston to negotiate further with d&#x27;Estaing.

In the meantime, the British in New York had not been idle. Lord Howe, concerned about the French fleet and further reinforced by the arrival of ships from Byron&#x27;s storm-tossed squadron, sailed out to catch d&#x27;Estaing before he reached Boston. General Clinton organised a force of 4,000 men under Major General Charles Grey, and sailed with it on 26 August, destined for Newport.

The inflammatory writings of General Sullivan arrived before the French fleet reached Boston; Admiral d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s initial reaction was reported to be a dignified silence. Under pressure from Washington and the Continental Congress, politicians worked to smooth over the incident while d&#x27;Estaing was in good spirits when Lafayette arrived in Boston. D&#x27;Estaing even offered to march troops overland to support the Americans: &quot;I offered to become a colonel of infantry, under the command of one who three years ago was a lawyer, and who certainly must have been an uncomfortable man for his clients&quot;.

General Pigot was harshly criticized by Clinton for failing to await the relief force, which might have successfully entrapped the Americans on the island. He left Newport for England not long after. Newport was abandoned by the British in October 1779 with economy ruined by the war.

===Other actions===

The relief force of Clinton and Grey arrived at Newport on 1 September. Given that the threat was over, Clinton instead ordered Grey to raid several communities on the Massachusetts coast. Admiral Howe was unsuccessful in his bid to catch up with d&#x27;Estaing, who held a strong position at the Nantasket Roads when Howe arrived there on 30 August. Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe as head of the New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d&#x27;Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d&#x27;Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies.

The British Navy in New York had not been inactive. Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from Chesapeake Bay to Connecticut, and probed at American defences in the Hudson River valley. Coming up the river in force, he supported the key outpost capture of Stony Point, but advanced no further. When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organised a counterstrike. Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but their morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when their failure to co-operate with the French led to an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the British from Savannah. Control of Georgia was formally returned to its royal governor, James Wright, in July 1779, but the backcountry would not come under British control until after the 1780 Siege of Charleston. Patriot forces recovered Augusta by siege in 1781, but Savannah remained in British hands until 1782. The damage sustained at Savannah forced &quot;Marseillois&quot;, &quot;Zélé&quot;, &quot;Sagittaire&quot;, &quot;Protecteur&quot; and &quot;Experiment&quot; to return to Toulon for repairs.

John Paul Jones in April 1778 led a raid on the western English town of Whitehaven, representing the first engagement by American forces outside of North America.

==Yorktown Campaign==
===French and American planning for 1781===
French military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more active participation in North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations against Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.

As the French fleet was preparing to depart Brest, France in March 1781, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Rear-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap-Français (present-day Cap-Haïtien, Haiti) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Because of a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte Jacques-Melchior de Barras Saint-Laurent. He was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington&#x27;s army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Français. The French Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse &quot;might&quot; be able to assist, without making any commitment (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north).

===Opening moves===

In December 1780, General Clinton sent Brigadier General Benedict Arnold (who had changed sides the previous September) with about 1,700 troops to Virginia to carry out raiding and to fortify Portsmouth. Washington responded by sending the Marquis de Lafayette south with a small army to oppose Arnold. Seeking to trap Arnold between Lafayette&#x27;s army and a French naval detachment, Washington sought the Admiral Chevalier Destouches, the commander of the French fleet at Newport for help. Destouches was restrained by the larger British North American fleet anchored at Gardiner&#x27;s Bay off the eastern end of Long Island, and was unable to help.

In early February, after receiving reports of British ships damaged by a storm, Destouches decided to send a naval expedition from his base in Newport. On 9 February, Captain Arnaud de Gardeur de Tilley sailed from Newport with three ships (ship of the line &quot;Eveille&quot; and frigates &quot;Surveillante&quot; and &quot;Gentile&quot;). When de Tilley arrived off Portsmouth four days later, Arnold retreated his ships, which had shallower drafts, up the Elizabeth River, where the larger French ships could not follow. Unable to attack Arnold&#x27;s position, de Tilley could only return to Newport. On the way back, the French captured HMS &quot;Romulus&quot;, a 44-gun frigate sent to investigate their movements. This success and the pleas of General Washington, permitted Destouches to launch a full-scale operation. On 8 March, Washington was in Newport when Destouches sailed with his entire fleet, carrying 1,200 troops for use in land operations when they arrived in the Chesapeake.

Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, the British fleet commander in North America, was aware that Destouches was planning something, but did not learn of Destouches&#x27; sailing until 10 March, and immediately led his fleet out of Gardiner Bay in pursuit. He had the advantage of favourable winds, and reached Cape Henry on 16 March, slightly ahead of Destouches. Although suffering a tactical defeat, Arbuthnot was able to pull into Chesapeake Bay, thus frustrating the original intent of Destouches&#x27; mission, forcing the French fleet to return to Newport. After transports delivered 2,000 men to reinforce Arnold, Arbuthnot returned to New York. He resigned his post as station chief in July and left for England, ending a stormy, difficult, and unproductive relationship with General Clinton.

===Arrival of the fleets===

The French fleet sailed from Brest on 22 March. The British fleet was busy with preparations to resupply Gibraltar, and did not attempt to oppose the departure. After the French fleet sailed, the packet ship &quot;Concorde&quot; sailed for Newport, carrying the comte de Barras, Rochambeau&#x27;s orders, and credits for the six million livres. In a separate dispatch sent later, Admiral de Grasse also made two important requests. The first was that he be notified at Cap-Français of the situation in North America so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there, and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters.

On 21 May Generals George Washington and the comte de Rochambeau, respectively the commanders of the American and French armies in North America, met to discuss potential operations against the British. They considered either an assault or siege on the principal British base at New York City, or operations against the British forces in Virginia. Since either of these options would require the assistance of the French fleet then in the West Indies, a ship was dispatched to meet with de Grasse who was expected at Cap-Français, outlining the possibilities and requesting his assistance. Rochambeau, in a private note to de Grasse, indicated that his preference was for an operation against Virginia. The two generals then moved their forces to White Plains, New York to study New York&#x27;s defences and await news from de Grasse.

De Grasse arrived at Cap-Français on 15 August. He immediately dispatched his response, which was that he would make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, he sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 30 August and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse&#x27;s arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse&#x27;s fleet until it was too late.

British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney had been warned that de Grasse was planning to take at least part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse&#x27;s destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.

Sailing more directly than de Grasse, Hood&#x27;s fleet arrived off the entrance to the Chesapeake on 25 August. Finding no French ships there, he then sailed on to New York to meet with Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the North American station following Arbuthnot&#x27;s departure, whom had spent several weeks trying to intercept a convoy organised by John Laurens to bring much-needed supplies and hard currency from France to Boston. When Hood arrived at New York, he found that Graves was in port (having failed to intercept the convoy), but had only five ships of the line that were ready for battle.

De Grasse had notified his counterpart in Newport, the comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. De Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route to minimise the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilise assistance for Cornwallis.

News of de Barras&#x27; departure led the British to realise that the Chesapeake was the probable target of the French fleets. By 31 August Graves had moved his ships over the bar at New York harbour. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; &quot;Europe&quot; in particular had difficulty manoeuvring. The squadrons&#x27; clash started with &quot;Marseillois&quot; exchanging shots with the 64-gun HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, under Captain Anthony Molloy.

==Aftermath==
The British retreat in disarray set off a flurry of panic among the Loyalist population. The news of the defeat was also not received well in London. King George III wrote (well before learning of Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender) that &quot;after the knowledge of the defeat of our fleet [...] I nearly think the empire ruined&quot;.

The French success at completely encircling Cornwallis left them firmly in control of Chesapeake Bay. In addition to capturing a number of smaller British vessels, de Grasse and de Barras assigned their smaller vessels to assist in the transport of Washington&#x27;s and Rochambeau&#x27;s forces from Head of Elk, Maryland to Yorktown.

It was not until 23 September that Graves and Clinton learned that the French fleet in the Chesapeake numbered 36 ships. This news came from a dispatch sneaked out by Cornwallis on the 17th, accompanied by a plea for help: &quot;If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must be prepared to hear the worst&quot;. After effecting repairs in New York, Admiral Graves sailed from New York on 19 October with 25 ships of the line and transports carrying 7,000 troops to relieve Cornwallis. It was two days after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. General Washington acknowledge to de Grasse the importance of his role in the victory: &quot;You will have observed that, whatever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest&quot;. The eventual surrender of Cornwallis led to peace two years later and British recognition of the independent United States of America.

Admiral de Grasse returned with his fleet to the West Indies. In a major engagement that suspended Franco-Spanish plans for the capture of Jamaica in 1782, he was defeated and taken prisoner by Rodney in the Battle of the Saintes. His flagship &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; was lost at sea in a storm while being conducted back to England as part of a fleet commanded by Admiral Graves. Despite the controversy over his conduct in this battle, Graves continued to serve, rising to full admiral and receiving an Irish peerage.

==Career==

Macdonald&#x27;s career began while she was working as a barmaid in Glasgow. She saw a leaflet advertising an open casting session for &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and decided to audition, winning the part of Diane, the underage seductress to Ewan McGregor&#x27;s Renton. Other roles include Mary O&#x27;Neary in &quot;Two Family House&quot;, and an actress playing Peter Pan in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;. She had major roles in Robert Altman&#x27;s British period piece &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, where she played an aristocrat&#x27;s maid, and in &quot;Intermission&quot; (2003), as Deirdre.

On radio, she portrayed Mary in the 1999 BBC radio drama &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, based on Pete Townshend&#x27;s abandoned rock opera, some of the songs for which were released on The Who&#x27;s album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. On television, her highest profile roles have been in two BBC dramas, the Paul Abbott serial &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003), and the one-off Richard Curtis piece &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot; (2005). Both of these were directed by David Yates, and both also starred Bill Nighy. For her performance in &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot;, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film in 2006, and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.

Macdonald had a supporting role in the Coen brothers&#x27; Academy Award-winning film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007), for which she was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. It was reported that she had to fight her agent to be considered for the role, but Macdonald later denied the story.

Other films where she had supporting roles include &quot;Choke&quot; (2008), adapted by Clark Gregg from the 2001 Chuck Palahniuk novel, as Paige Marshall; &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot; (2009) (based on James Lee Burke&#x27;s &quot;In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead&quot; (1993), as Kelly Drummond, alongside Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman; and &quot;Skellig&quot; (2009), as Louise. She played the lead in &quot;The Merry Gentleman&quot; (2008).

In 2011, she played the &quot;Grey Lady&quot; (revealed to be Helena Ravenclaw) in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, the final instalment of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film franchise. She replaced Nina Young, who originally played the role. In 2012, she provided the voice of Merida, the heroine of the Disney/Pixar film &quot;Brave&quot;, and played Dolly in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. She starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;The Decoy Bride&quot;, which was released in 2012.

From 2010 until its ending in 2014, she starred in the HBO crime drama &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; as Margaret Thompson, the wife of Prohibition-era Atlantic City crime boss Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi). She appeared in all five seasons of the series.

In 2016, she starred in Ricky Gervais&#x27; &quot;Special Correspondents&quot; as Claire Maddox, and &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; as Mrs. Walker. In 2016, she played the lead role in &quot;Hated in the Nation&quot;, an episode of the anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot; for which she received critical acclaim. On 3 November 2016 Macdonald was featured in the trailer for Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; confirming she would reprise her role as Diane from the original film, which she did. In 2017, she co-starred opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC film &quot;The Child in Time&quot;.

<doc id="596074" wikidata="Q2888486" url="?curid=596074" title="Battle of Eutaw Springs">
<text>The Battle of Eutaw Springs was a battle of the American Revolutionary War, and was the last major engagement of the war in the Carolinas. Both sides claimed a victory.

==Background==
In early 1781, Major General Nathanael Greene, commander of the Southern army in the Continental Army, began a campaign to end British control over the South Carolina backcountry. His first major objective was the capture of the British-controlled village of Ninety Six. On May 22, 1781, Greene laid siege to the fortified village. After nearly a month Greene became aware that reinforcements under Lord Rawdon were approaching from Charleston. Forces under Greene&#x27;s command assaulted Ninety Six on June 18, but were repelled. To avoid facing the force commanded by Rawdon, Greene retreated toward Charlotte, North Carolina. Rawdon pursued Greene for several days but abandoned the pursuit because his men were exhausted by days of forced marching and he lacked sufficient supplies to continue. In spite of the fact that Ninety Six was the only remaining inland British outpost after the fall of Augusta, Georgia, Rawdon decided to burn and abandon it, and withdrew the garrison to Charleston. In poor health, Rawdon sailed for England in late August, leaving Charleston under the command of Colonel Alexander Stewart.

On 16 July, Greene moved his army, exhausted by many days of marching and combat, to a campsite on the High Hills of Santee, allowing his main force to rest while awaiting reinforcements. Marion and Sumter continued to harass the British in a &quot;war of posts&quot;. On August 23, his force moved towards Camden to cross the Wateree River, and then Howell&#x27;s Ferry to cross the Congaree River. By 4 Sept., they were camped at Fort Motte, then Stoudenmyer&#x27;s Plantation on 5–6 Sept.

By 13 Aug., Colonel Stewart had led a force of 2,000–2,300 men from Orangeburg to Thompson&#x27;s Plantation, south of the Congaree River. He then fell back to Eutaw Springs on 27 Aug., about 2 miles east of present-day Eutawville, then in Charleston District (but both now in Orangeburg County).

==Organization==
At 4:00 am on 8 September 1781, Greene&#x27;s army began marching from Burdell&#x27;s Plantation in the direction of Eutaw Springs, which was distant. In the van were Lieutenant Colonel Henry Lee&#x27;s Legion plus 73 infantry and 72 cavalry of South Carolina State troops under Lieutenant Colonel John Henderson and Captain Wade Hampton, respectively. Next in the marching column came 40 cavalry and 200 infantry under Brigadier General Francis Marion, followed by 150 North Carolina militia under Colonel Francis marquis de Malmedy and 307 South Carolina militia led by Brigadier General Andrew Pickens. Continental Army troops formed the center and rear of Greene&#x27;s column. These were led by three green North Carolina battalions under Brigadier General Jethro Sumner. Major John Armstrong led a mounted contingent while Lieutenant Colonel John Baptista Ashe and Major Reading Blount directed the foot soldiers. Ashe and Blount served with the 1st North Carolina Regiment, while Armstrong belonged to the 4th North Carolina Regiment.

Lieutenant Colonel Richard Campbell&#x27;s two Virginia battalions under Major Smith Snead and Captain Thomas Edmonds were trailed by Colonel Otho Holland Williams&#x27; two Maryland battalions under Lieutenant Colonel John Eager Howard and Major Henry Hardman. Lieutenant Colonel William Washington&#x27;s mounted men and Captain Robert Kirkwood&#x27;s Delaware infantry companies formed the tail of the column. Greene&#x27;s force had two 3-pound grasshopper guns under Captain-Lieutenant William Gaines and two 6-pound cannons directed by Captain William Brown. All told, Greene had 1,256 Continental infantry and 300 cavalry, the horsemen mostly divided between Lee and Washington. Lee&#x27;s cavalry were led by Major Joseph Egleston and his infantry by Captain Rudolph. Greene&#x27;s army numbered 2,400 men of whom 200 were left behind to guard the baggage train.

Stewart had between 1,800 and 2,000 troops on hand. His British regulars were the 3rd Foot, 63rd Foot, 64th Foot, and John Marjoribanks&#x27; 300-man flank battalion. The last-named unit was made up of the converged flank companies of the 3rd, 19th, and 30th Foot. The regulars were supported by two American loyalist contingents. These units were John Harris Cruger&#x27;s regular battalion of DeLancey&#x27;s Brigade and John Coffin&#x27;s South Carolina Tories, which consisted of about 150 regular infantry and 50 militia cavalry. Stewart&#x27;s artillery consisted of two 6-pound, one 4-pound, and one 3-pound cannons plus a swivel gun.

==Battle==
In order to make up for a shortage of bread in his supplies, Stewart had been sending out foraging parties each morning to dig up yams, unarmed except for a small guard detail. At around 8 am on September 8, Captain John Coffin and a detachment of his South Carolina Loyalist cavalry were reconnoitring ahead of Stewart&#x27;s main force when he encountered a mounted American scouting party under Major John Armstrong. Coffin pursued Armstrong, who led him into an ambush. Attacked by Henry Lee&#x27;s 2nd Partisan Corps, Coffin escaped but left 4 or 5 of his men killed and 40 more captured. The Americans then came across Stewart&#x27;s foragers and captured about 400 of them.

Greene&#x27;s force, with around 2,200 men, now approached Stewart&#x27;s camp while Stewart, warned by Coffin, deployed his force. When the Americans realized they were approaching the British force, they formed three lines, with the militia in front with 2 3-pounders, followed by the Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina Continentals with 2 6-pounders, with the Delaware Regiment and Washington in reserve. The Americans started the attack at 9 am with artillery and an advance by the militia. This line consisted of, left to right, Hampton, Henderson, Pickens, de Malmedy, Polk, Marion, Lee&#x27;s infantry and then Lee&#x27;s Cavalry. They were opposed by the British Line consisting of, left to right, Coffin, 64th, 63rd, New Jersey Volunteers, New York Volunteers, 84th, De Lancey&#x27;s, 3rd, and Marjoribanks. Hand-to-hand combat ensued when the Militia closed with the British Line. Some militia panicked while some held firm, able to fire 17 times, before ordered back and replaced by the North Carolina Continentals in a &#x27;passage of lines&quot;.

The North Carolina Continentals halted the British advance but were forced back by a British bayonet charge, only to reform and halt the British a second time. Greene then ordered the Maryland and Virginia Continentals forward in another passage of lines, forcing the British back towards their camp. However, two areas of British resistance remained, one under Maj. Henry Sheridan at the Brick House, which included a swivel gun, and another under Maj. Marjoribanks on the northern flank. Washington&#x27;s cavalry tried to dislodge Marjoribanks, but Washington was unhorsed, wounded and taken prisoner, sitting out the remainder of the war. Marjoribanks then retreated towards the Brick House.

The Brick House now became the focal point of the battle, and when an American artillery assault failed, the house gave the British a focal point to regroup, rally and reenter the battle. Maj. Marjoribanks then attacked the American flank in the clearing before the house before he was mortally wounded. According to Stewart, the Americans &quot;gave way in all quarters, leaving behind them two brass six pounders and upwards of two hundred killed on the field of action, and sixty prisoners, amongst whom was Colonel Washington, and from every information, about eight hundred wounded...&quot;

According to Otho Williams, some plundering of the British camp occurred, while an attack on the British left by Lee&#x27;s cavalry failed. At this point, Greene ordered a retreat with all of the wounded. Greene&#x27;s army was then able to march back to Burdell&#x27;s Plantation in column formation, with a cavalry picket covering the orderly retreat. According to Greene, &quot;Nothing but the brick house and their strong position at Eutaw&#x27;s, hindered the remains of the British army from falling into our hands.&quot;

==Casualties==
The British casualty return stated the loss as 85 killed, 351 wounded and 257 missing. However, Greene reported that he had captured 500 prisoners, including 70 wounded. When Stewart moved camp on September 9, he left 54 of his wounded behind with a surgeon to attend them. These men were included in Stewart&#x27;s casualty report under the category &quot;wounded&quot; but the remaining 16 wounded captured by Greene would have been returned as &quot;missing&quot;. The disparity between Stewart&#x27;s report of 257 missing and Greene&#x27;s figure of 500 prisoners may be due to Stewart regarding the capture of his foraging party as a separate engagement and not included in the British losses in his casualty return for the battle. Including the loss of the foraging party, and counting the 54 wounded men whom Stewart decided to leave behind on September 9 in the &quot;wounded prisoners&quot; category instead of as &quot;wounded&quot;, this gives total British casualties of 85 killed, 297 wounded, 70 wounded prisoners and 430 other prisoners.

There were three successive versions of the American casualty return. The first, compiled soon after the battle, gave 251 killed, 367 wounded and 74 missing. The second, compiled somewhat later and published by the Continental Congress, reduced the losses to 138 killed, 375 wounded and 41 missing. The third and final revision, compiled on September 25, 1781, arrived at figures of 119 killed, 382 wounded and 78 missing. The British took 60 prisoners, including the wounded Colonel William Washington, and two artillery pieces.

==Aftermath==

Rain prevented a continuation of battle the next day. Instead, Stewart buried his dead, destroyed supplies, including 1000 muskets, and retreated towards Moncks Corner, leaving behind 70 wounded. Greene pursued Stewart as far as Martin&#x27;s Tavern near Ferguson&#x27;s Swamp. At this point, 11 Sept., Stewart was within range of support from the British garrison in Charleston.

Stewart&#x27;s letter to Cornwallis on 11 Sept. 1781 states,

With particular satisfaction I have the honour to inform your lordship, that on the 8th instant I was attacked by the rebel General Greene, with all the force he could collect in this province and North Carolina, and after an obstinate engagement, which lasted near two hours, I totally defeated him, and took two six pounders.&quot;

The British were forced to retreat to Charleston

Greene&#x27;s letter to Washington on 17 Sept. 1781 states,

Be far the most obstinate fight I ever saw. Victory was ours, and had it not been for one of those little incidents which frequently happen in the progress of war, we should have taken the whole British Army.&quot;

The claim of several historians that the British won the battle is challenged by Christine Swager in her book &quot;The Valiant Died: The Battle of Eutaw Springs September 8, 1781&quot;. The book argues that, first, at the end of the battle, the British held the majority, but not the entirety, of the field where the main battle took place. Greene held part of the field where the initial skirmish spilled out of the woods into the clearings. Swager also argues that Greene meant to re-engage the enemy on the following day, but was prevented from doing so because the excessively wet weather conditions negated much of his firepower.

Neither army left the vicinity for at least a full day following the battle. When Greene withdrew, he left a strong picket to oppose a possible British advance, while Stewart withdrew the remnants of his force towards Charleston. His rear was apparently under constant fire at least until meeting with reinforcements near Moncks Corner.
Despite winning a tactical victory, the British lost strategically. Their inability to stop Greene&#x27;s continuing operations forced them to abandon most of their conquests in the South, leaving them in control of a small number of isolated enclaves at Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. The British attempt to pacify the South with Loyalist support had failed even before Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown.

Lord Edward Fitzgerald, later to become famous as a United Irish rebel, served as a British officer at the battle and was badly wounded.

The Continental Congress awarded Greene a gold medal.

The State Song of South Carolina contains the line &quot;Point to Eutaw&#x27;s Battle Bed&quot; in reference to this battle.

The Eutaw Springs Battleground Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved more than of the battlefield.

<text>Joseph Edward Collins (born Joseph Edward Kollonige; December 3, 1922 – August 30, 1989) was an American Major League Baseball player born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

On September 25, he began his major league career playing for the New York Yankees. He played in 10 Major League seasons and seven World Series, all for the Yankees. At 6&#x27;0&quot; tall and 185 pounds, he batted left and threw left, which made him unavailable to play most infield positions, where he was a first baseman in 715 games regular-season games. He also played 114 games as an outfielder, while his peak number of games played in a season was 130 in 1954. Collins often platooned with Moose Skowron. Collins hit 86 regular-season home runs, but more importantly, four in the World Series with powerful Yankee teams. He was a teammate of both Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle.

His last Major League game was on September 29, 1957. His entire major league career was spent with the Yankees. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies at the start of the 1958 season, but he chose to retire rather than join the Phillies, thus cancelling the trade.

In 908 games over 10 seasons, Collins posted a .256 batting average (596-for-2329) with 404 runs, 79 doubles, 24 triples, 86 home runs, 329 RBI, 338 bases on balls, .350 on-base percentage and .421 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman but also played at all three outfield positions. In 36 postseason games, he made his hits count. He hit only .163 (15-for-92) with 15 runs, 3 doubles, 4 home runs, 10 RBI and 14 walks.

He died in Union Township, Union County, New Jersey in 1989, and there is a small park there named in his honor. The park is located off of Liberty Avenue and also has a memorial plaque honoring him.

<doc id="596078" wikidata="Q1660806" url="?curid=596078" title="Good Boy!">
<text>Good Boy! is a 2003 American science fiction comedy film directed by John Hoffman, based on the book &quot;Dogs from Outer Space&quot; by Zeke Richardson; Hoffman and Richardson collaborated on the screen story, while Hoffman wrote the screenplay. The film stars Liam Aiken as Owen Baker, as well as the voices of Matthew Broderick, Delta Burke, Donald Faison, Brittany Murphy, Carl Reiner, Vanessa Redgrave, and Cheech Marin as the abundant dog characters in the film.

==Plot==
Owen Baker is a 12-year-old who has been working as the neighborhood dog-walker so he can earn the privilege of getting a dog of his own. Owen&#x27;s hard work pays off when his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Baker, let Owen adopt a scruffy Border Terrier that he names Hubble. Owen has little time to make lasting friends, due to his parents&#x27; renovation and reselling of houses, so he hopes Hubble will be his best friend.

Owen does have a friend named Connie Flemming, a girl his age who lives in the neighborhood, but he is also bullied by two boys named Frankie and Fred. Soon after the adoption of Hubble, Owen finds out that his new abnormally intelligent dog actually came from outer space. Owen wakes up the next morning to discover that he can now understand every word Hubble says—including the ominous phrase: &quot;Take me to your leaders.&quot;

Owen learns that dogs came to Earth thousands of years ago to colonize and dominate the planet. Hubble, who is really named Canid 3942, has been sent by the powerful Greater Dane on a mission from the Dog Star Sirius 7 to make sure dogs have fulfilled this destiny.

The dogs Owen walks include pampered Poodle Barbara Ann, rambunctious Boxer Wilson, nervous Italian Greyhound Nelly and Connie&#x27;s gassy Bernese Mountain Dog Shep.

Despite the best efforts of Owen and this rag-tag group of neighborhood dogs to convince Hubble that everything is fine with Earth&#x27;s dogs, Hubble soon discovers the awful truth about Earth dogs: &quot;You&#x27;re all pets!&quot; Things get worse when Hubble learns that the Greater Dane is headed for Earth to do her own inspection. If things don&#x27;t look right, all dogs on Earth will be recalled to Sirius.

Owen and Hubble have to work together to prepare the neighborhood dogs for a visit from the Greater Dane and her Chinese Crested Dog henchman. Owen, Hubble, Connie, and their canine pals set out to whip the other dogs into shape so that they can pass muster.

Owen&#x27;s efforts fail and the Greater Dane recalls all dogs from Earth. Upset, Owen repairs Hubble&#x27;s communicator and sends him a message declaring how much he loves him. The Greater Dane hears the message and is left curious by it so she approaches Hubble for his opinion on why the dogs on Earth are subservient to humanity when they should be ruling it. Hubble believes that the dogs and humans have formed a bond of love and loyalty. When asked where his own loyalty lies, Hubble asks the Greater Dane to refer to him as Hubble rather than Canid 3942, showing his bond with Owen. As a result, the Greater Dane sends the Earth dogs back and declares them a different breed. Hubble is allowed to return as well, but on the condition that he removes Owen&#x27;s ability to communicate with dogs. Owen&#x27;s parents choose to remain in town for once and Hubble starts to fit in as an Earth dog.

==Production==
In June 2002, it was announced Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had greenlit &quot;Good Boy&quot;, a co-production with The Jim Henson Company about an alien dog coming to Earth from Sirius, the Dog Star, to investigate interstellar reports that his fellow canines have abandoned their original plan to take over the planet. During the announcement, both MGM and Henson representatives expressed intentions for the film to serve as a franchise with similar expansion to series such as &quot;Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Air Bud&quot;, and &quot;Balto&quot;.
===Special effects===
The bulk of the digital effects in &quot;Good Boy!&quot; involved digitally altering the facial features of the dogs so that in the film, they appear to be talking or expressing a different emotion (sometimes called CG muzzle replacement). These effects were produced by Rainmaker Studios.

==Reception==
The film&#x27;s domestic total gross was around $37 million, with a worldwide gross of around $45 million. &quot;Good Boy!&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 44% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 87 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Good Boy!&quot; should appeal to kids. Adults, however, might consider it a dog.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s special effects, saying &quot;Sometimes it works to show their lips moving (it certainly did in &quot;Babe&quot;), but in &quot;Good Boy!&quot; the jaw movements are so mechanical it doesn&#x27;t look like speech, it looks like a film loop. Look at &quot;Babe&quot; again and you&#x27;ll appreciate the superior way in which the head movements and body language of the animals supplement their speech.&quot;

A stop-motion short film animated by the BBC, &quot;Hamilton Mattress&quot;, accompanied the film&#x27;s theatrical release.

===Home media===
&quot;Good Boy!&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on March 2, 2004.
