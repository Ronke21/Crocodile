<text>Human rights in Cuba are under the scrutiny of human rights organizations, which accuse the Cuban government of committing systematic human rights abuses against the Cuban people, including arbitrary imprisonment and unfair trials. International human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have drawn attention to the actions of the human rights movement and designated members of it as prisoners of conscience, such as Óscar Elías Biscet. In addition, the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba led by former statesmen Václav Havel of the Czech Republic, José María Aznar of Spain and Patricio Aylwin of Chile was created to support the Cuban dissident movement.

==Overview==
Concerns have been expressed about the operation of due process. According to Human Rights Watch, even though Cuba, officially atheist until 1992, now &quot;permits greater opportunities for religious expression than it did in past years, and has allowed several religious-run humanitarian groups to operate, the government still maintains tight control on religious institutions, affiliated groups, and individual believers&quot;. Censorship in Cuba has also been at the center of complaints. According to the report of Human Rights Watch from 2017 the government continues to rely on arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate critics, independent activists, political opponents, and others. This report added that the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, an independent human rights group that lacks official authorization and is therefore considered illegal by the government, received more than 7,900 reports of arbitrary detentions from January through August 2016. This represents the highest monthly average of detentions in the past six years.

Amnesty International&#x27;s 2017-2018 Annual Report also noted more arbitrary detentions, discriminatory layoffs by state agencies and harassments in self-employment with the aim of making them silent in criticism. Regarding any progress in education, Amnesty International reported that advances in education were undermined by ongoing online and offline censorship. Cuba remained mostly closed to independent human rights monitors.

With regard to arbitrary arrests and detentions, the report added that human rights activists and political activists continued to be harassed, intimidated and arbitrarily detained in high numbers. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a Cuban NGO which is not officially recognized by the state, recorded 5,155 arbitrary detentions in 2017, in contrast to 9,940 in 2016.

Cuba is a regional leader in women&#x27;s rights issues.

== History ==

During Spanish colonization, the oppression of the indigenous populations was chronicled at length by clergyman Bartolomé de las Casas. The subsequent transportation of African slaves to the island, which lasted over 300 years, led to British military intervention and a determination &quot;to put a stop to these abuses&quot;. Since Cuba achieved independence in 1902, successive Cuban governments have been criticised and condemned by various groups, both within Cuba and internationally, for human rights violations on the island. During the latter part of the Spanish colonial era in Cuba, human rights on the island became a particular international concern. After a visit to the region in 1898, U.S. Senator Redfield Proctor estimated that up to 200,000 Cubans had died from starvation and disease within &quot;Spanish forts&quot;, essentially concentration camps. The concern was a contributory factor in garnering support for the Spanish–American War in the U.S.

After independence, and following a sustained period of instability, the 1924–33 capitalist government of Gerardo Machado proved to be authoritarian. Machado extended his rule until Fulgencio Batista led an uprising called the Revolt of the Sergeants, as part of a coup which deposed Machado in 1933. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was himself elected president in 1940. According to Hugh Thomas, the post-Machado period was marked by violent reprisals, mass lynchings and a deterioration towards corruption and &quot;gansterismo&quot; throughout the island.

From 1940, Cuba had a multiparty electoral system until Fulgencio Batista (President from 1940 to 1944) staged a coup with military backing on March 10, 1952.

To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions. These murders mounted in 1957, as socialist ideas became more influential. Many people were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to about 20,000 people killed.

On October 6, 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy, in the midst of his campaign for the U.S. presidency, decried Batista&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. government and criticized the Eisenhower administration for supporting him:Fulgencio Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in seven years ... and he turned Democratic Cuba into a complete police state—destroying every individual liberty. Yet our aid to his regime, and the ineptness of our policies, enabled Batista to invoke the name of the United States in support of his reign of terror. Administration spokesmen publicly praised Batista—hailed him as a staunch ally and a good friend—at a time when Batista was murdering thousands, destroying the last vestiges of freedom, and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the Cuban people, and we failed to press for free elections.In 1958, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Cuba&#x27;s fanatic, poorly armed rebels last week tried to smash President Fulgencio Batista with the ultimate weapon of civilian revolutions: the general strike. ... Fulgencio Batista got ready for the strike by offering immunity to anyone who killed a striker and by threatening to jail any employer who closed shop.&quot; During the strike, militants and youths stole guns, and threw bombs (one of which may have set up a gas-mains fire), after which some people were killed in clashes.&quot;

According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;The strike was short-lived: &quot;With the upper hand, Batista drove boldly around the city while his cops proceeded to make their supremacy complete. When a patrol car radioed that it had clashed with rebels and had &#x27;a dead man and a prisoner&#x27;, the dispatcher ordered: &#x27;Shoot him.&#x27; At midafternoon, cops burst into a boardinghouse, grabbed three young men who were leaders of Cuba&#x27;s lay Catholic Action movement, which sympathizes with Castro. Two hours later their stripped, tortured and bullet-torn bodies were turned over to relatives. Total dead: 43.&quot;

In 1959, Fidel Castro and his forces succeeded in displacing Batista from power. At that time there were fundamental changes in the judicial and political process. During this transitional period there were some concerns voiced about due process.

The &quot;Cuban National Reconciliation movement&quot;, a U.S.-based organisation that claims to act as a forum for discussing Cuban society, has detailed what it believes are complex variables when analysing human rights immediately after the revolution. In the 1960s, violent confrontations known as the Escambray Rebellion between the Cuban government and armed opposition were ongoing, but had declined by the early 1970s. The group asserts that by the time international human rights movements flourished in the 1970s, the most severe period of repression was over, making non-partisan retrospective assessments of the period difficult. The reconciliation movement also cite the difficulties in assessing accounts of abuses that are commonly split upon partisan lines. According to the group, Cuban exiles who were often the first to denounce the Cuban government, largely shared an anti-Communist ideology and overlooked violations committed by other regimes, whilst many left leaning observers did not give the claims of Cuban victims due consideration.

After coming to power in 1959, Fidel Castro&#x27;s government built a highly effective machinery of repression, according to Human Rights Watch.

As early as September 1959, Vadim Kotchergin (or Kochergin), a KGB agent, was seen in Cuba. Jorge Luis Vasquez, a Cuban who was imprisoned in East Germany, states that the East German secret police Stasi trained the personnel of the Cuban Interior Ministry (MININT).

=== Political executions ===
Various estimates have been made in order to ascertain the number of political executions which have been carried out on behalf of the Cuban government since the revolution. During the first two months of 1959, Castro&#x27;s government executed more than 300 Batista officials, with Latin American historian Thomas E. Skidmore says that there had been 550 executions in the first six months of 1959. In an April 1961 UPI story, the agency stated that about &quot;700 have died before Castro&#x27;s firing squads&quot; between 1959 and 1961. &quot;The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators&quot; ascertained that there had been 2,113 political executions between the years 1958–67, while British historian Hugh Thomas, stated in his study &quot;Cuba or the pursuit of freedom&quot; that &quot;perhaps&quot; 5,000 executions had taken place by 1970.

The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians and informers for the Batista regime who were accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions enjoyed widespread popular support among the Cuban population. Most scholars agree that those executed were most likely guilty as charged, but their trials did not follow due process. The Cuban Government justified such measures on the grounds that in Cuba, the application of capital punishment against war criminals and others followed the same procedure which had previously been followed by the Allies during the Nuremberg trials. Some Cuban scholars maintain that if the government had not imposed severe legislation against the torturers, terrorists, and other criminals who had been employed by the Batista regime, the people themselves would have taken justice into their own hands.

=== Alleged forced labor camps and abuse of prisoners ===
In 1987, a &quot;Tribunal on Cuba&quot; was held in Paris in order to present testimonies by former prisoners of Cuba&#x27;s penal system to the international media. The gathering was sponsored by a US-funded anti-communist group which was named Resistance International and &quot;The Coalition of Committees for the Rights of Man in Cuba&quot;. The testimonies which were presented at the tribunal, before an international panel, alleged that a pattern of torture existed in Cuba&#x27;s prisons and &quot;hard labor camps&quot;. The torture consisted of beatings, biological experiments which included dietary restrictions, violent interrogations and extremely unsanitary living conditions. The jury concurred with allegations of arbitrary arrest; sentencing by court martial with no public audience or defender; periods of time which prisoners spent in hard labour camps without sufficient food, clothing or medical care; and the arrest of children who were over nine years old.

=== Political abuse of psychiatry ===
Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after its prime minister Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the political abuse of psychiatry in that country emerged before the late 1980s. Americas Watch and Amnesty International published reports which alluded to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners. These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in Santiago de Cuba in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in Havana. In 1977, a report on the alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba was published in the United States and it presented cases of ill-treatment in Cuban mental hospitals which dated back to the early 1970s. It presents grave allegations which claim that prisoners who end up in the forensic wards of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana are subjected to methods of ill-treatment which include electroconvulsive therapy without the use of muscle relaxants or anaesthesia. The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner—in some cases the prisoners do not seem to have been diagnosed at all. Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and they are apparently in striking contrast to the conditions in the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern.

In August 1981, the Marxist historian Ariel Hidalgo was apprehended and accused of &quot;incitement against the social order, international solidarity and the Socialist State&quot; and sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment. In September 1981, he was transported from State Security Headquarters to the Carbó-Serviá (forensic) ward of the Havana Psychiatric Hospital and stayed there for several weeks.

== Contemporary Cuba ==

=== Political repression ===
A 2009 report by Human Rights Watch concluded that &quot;Raúl Castro has kept Cuba&#x27;s repressive machinery firmly in place...since being handed power by his brother Fidel Castro.&quot; The report found that &quot;[s]cores of political prisoners arrested under Fidel continue to languish in prison, and Raúl has used draconian laws and sham trials to incarcerate scores more who have dared to exercise their fundamental rights.&quot;

US government-funded Freedom House classifies Cuba as being &quot;Not Free&quot;, and notes that &quot;Cuba is the only country in the Americas that consistently makes Freedom House&#x27;s list of the Worst of the Worst: the World&#x27;s Most Repressive Societies for widespread abuses of political rights and civil liberties.&quot; The 2017 World Report by Human Rights Watch writes that independent journalists who publish information considered critical of the government are subject to smear campaigns and arbitrary arrests, as are artists and academics who demand greater freedoms.
A 1999 Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry&#x27;s principal responsibility is to monitor the Cuban population for signs of dissent. In 1991 two new mechanisms for internal surveillance and control emerged. Communist Party leaders organized the Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protección, SUVP). Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acción Rapida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta Rápida) observe and control dissidents. The government also &quot;maintains academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) for each citizen, in which officials record actions or statements that may bear on the person&#x27;s loyalty to the revolution. Before advancing to a new school or position, the individual&#x27;s record must first be deemed acceptable&quot;.

The opposition movement in Cuba is a widespread collection of individuals and nongovernmental organizations, most of whom are working for the respect of individual rights on the island. Some of the best known Cuban members of the opposition include the Ladies in White (recipients of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought), Human Rights Center and Cuban community leader Jesús Permuy, Marta Beatriz Roque, and Nobel Peace Prize nominee and Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo Payá, as well as Óscar Elías Biscet, and Jorge Luis García Pérez &quot;Antúnez.&quot;

On October 18, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that the United States will impose new sanctions against Cuba following its poor human rights records and its support of the Venezuelan government. In particular, José Daniel Ferrer&#x27;s continued detention was brought into notice in a different statement which was issued by the U.S. State Department. Ferrer, who heads the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), has been kept in detention by the Cuban government and his whereabouts have not been revealed.

=== Censorship ===
Cuba officially adopted the civil and political rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. One of the key principles in the declaration was the insistence on Freedom of expression and opinion. According to the 1992 Cuban constitution, free speech was allowed &quot;in keeping with the objectives of socialist society&quot; and that artistic creation was allowed &quot;as long as its content is not contrary to the Revolution&quot;. The 2019 Cuban constitution removed the language.

Cuba&#x27;s ranking was on the bottom of the Press Freedom Index 2008 compiled by the Reporters Without Borders (RWB). Cuba was named one of the ten most censored countries in the world by the Committee to Protect Journalists.

According to American group Committee to Protect Journalists, the media in Cuba are operated under the supervision of the Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Department of Revolutionary Orientation&quot;, which &quot;develops and coordinates propaganda strategies&quot;.

Human rights groups and international organizations believe that these articles subordinate the exercise of freedom of expression to the state. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights assess that: &quot;It is evident that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression under this article of the Constitution is governed by two fundamental determinants: on the one hand, the preservation and strengthening of the communist State; on the other, the need to muzzle any criticism of the group in power.&quot; Human rights group Amnesty International assert that the universal state ownership of the media means that freedom of expression is restricted. Thus the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is restricted by the lack of means of mass communication falling outside state control. Human Rights Watch states: &quot;Refusing to recognize human rights monitoring as a legitimate activity, the government denies legal status to local human rights groups. Individuals who belong to these groups face systematic harassment, with the government putting up obstacles to impede them from documenting human rights conditions. In addition, international human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are barred from sending fact-finding missions to Cuba. It remains one of the few countries in the world to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons.&quot;
Yet, activists&#x27; networks like Eye on Cuba and Cubalog.eu have continued working with the intention to raise awareness about the true situation concerning human and civil rights on the &quot;island of freedom&quot; and appeal to Europe Union and its members to apply responsible approach to Cuba in their foreign policy. Financial support and legal representation is provided by foreign NGOs as part of the EU Cuba Network.

A formal structure and system of reporting news not approved by the government was first attempted in 1993. The effort for an independent, uncensored news agency was spearheaded by Cuban human rights activist and then-President of Christian Democratic Movement Jesús Permuy. It formally began in May of that year as Members of Civic Democratic Action, an umbrella group of nearly twenty Castro opposition organizations, formed an alliance with the Independent Cuban Journalists Association. The effort ultimately failed.

A Reporters Without Borders report as of October 2006 finds that Internet use is very restricted and under tight surveillance. Access is only possible with government permission and equipment is rationed. E-mail is monitored.

Foreign journalists are systematically expelled from Cuba, e.g. notable journalists of Gazeta Wyborcza, Anna Bikont and Seweryn Blumsztahn, were expelled in 2005.

=== Restrictions on assembly ===
As of 2005, Human Rights Watch stated that &quot;freedom of assembly is severely restricted in Cuba, and political dissidents are generally prohibited from meeting in large groups.&quot; In 2006, Amnesty stated that &quot;All human rights, civil and professional associations and unions that exist today in Cuba outside the officialdom of the state apparatus and mass organizations controlled by the government are barred from having legal status. This often puts at risk the individuals who belong to these associations of facing harassment, intimidation or criminal charges for activities which constitute the legitimate exercise of the fundamental freedoms of expression, association and assembly.&quot;

The Cuban authorities only recognize a single national trade union centre, the Central de Trabajadores de Cuba (CTC). The government explicitly prohibits independent trade unions, there is systematic harassment and detention of labor activists, and the leaders of attempted independent unions have been imprisoned. The right to strike is not recognized in law.

=== Society ===
In 2001 an attempt was made by Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas and others from the Christian Liberation Movement, operating as the Varela Project, to have a national plebiscite using provisions in the Constitution of Cuba which provided for citizen initiative. If accepted by the government and approved by public vote, the amendments would have established such things as freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of press, as well as starting private businesses. The petition was refused by the National Assembly and in response a referendum was held in support of socialism being a permanent fixture of the constitution, for which the government claimed 99% voter approval.

Another important project is the establishment of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba is a coalition of 365 independent civil society groups with the stated aims of &quot;forming a democratic culture&quot;, &quot;developing a social movement&quot;, strengthening the Assembly&#x27;s organization, communicating among groups to promote the civil society, using all available means to combat poverty and seeking the betterment of the community&#x27;s life conditions, developing a true knowledge of Cuba&#x27;s history, in all its dimensions: economic, social and political, undertaking activities and projects aimed at the protection and conservation of natural resources and the ecosystem, and promoting a true culture on labor rights. The Assembly had its first meeting in May 2005.

=== Capital punishment ===

Cuba placed a moratorium on the use of capital punishment in 1999. However, an exception was made when, in 2003, three members of a gang of ten were executed for a ferry hijacking. The hijackers were attempting to reach Florida, but ran out of fuel only halfway to their destination. After a two-day stand-off, the ferry was escorted by coast guard patrol boats back to a Cuban port, ostensibly to refuel; when hostages began jumping over the sides of the ship, however, the authorities subdued the hijackers and regained control. Four other men were given life sentences, and the remaining three women involved received 1–5 years in prison.

=== Acts of repudiation ===

Human rights groups including Amnesty International have long been critical of what the Cuban authorities have termed &quot;Acts of repudiation&quot; (&quot;actos de repudio&quot;). These acts occur when large groups of citizens verbally abuse, intimidate and sometimes physically assault and throw stones and other objects at the homes of Cubans who are considered counter-revolutionaries. Human rights groups suspect that these acts are often carried out in collusion with the security forces and sometimes involve the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution or the Rapid Response Brigades.

=== Notable prisoners of conscience ===

* In 1960, Armando Valladares was convicted on a charge of placing bombs in public places and was sentenced to thirty years in prison. He and his supporters contend that he was never part of the Batista police as alleged by Castro supporters, and that his imprisonment was the result of his vocal opposition to the Castro government. Valladares claims to have been tortured and humiliated while he was on a hunger strike in order to protest against prison abuses; he claims the guards denied him water until he became delirious, and they proceeded to urinate in his mouth and on his face. Furthermore, he claimed to require the use of a wheelchair following his longest hunger strike. The Cuban government denied both claims, and provided video evidence to Regis Debray of Valladares standing and walking. Valladares was released from prison after serving twenty-two years of his sentence, due in part to the intercession of France&#x27;s President François Mitterrand. Conservative author David Horowitz has since called Valladares a &quot;Human Rights Hero.&quot;
* In 1973, gay writer Reinaldo Arenas was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of &#x27;ideological deviation&#x27; and for publishing abroad to evade censorship in Cuba. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was re-arrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious El Morro Castle alongside murderers and rapists. After finally escaping from Cuba in the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, Arenas described the horrors he endured under the Cuban government in his autobiography &quot;Antes que anochezca&quot; (1992), English translation &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (1993).
* On August 28, 1998, a Havana court sentenced Reynaldo Alfaro García, a member of the Democratic Solidarity Party, to three years in prison for &quot;spreading enemy propaganda&quot; and &quot;rumour-mongering&quot;.
* Desi Mendoza, a Cuban doctor, was imprisoned for making statements criticizing Cuba&#x27;s response to an epidemic of dengue fever in Santiago de Cuba which he alleged had caused several deaths. Dr. Mendoza had previously been fired from his job in a Cuban hospital three years earlier for establishing an independent medical association. He was later released due to ill-health, subject to his leaving the country.
* Óscar Elías Biscet, a medical doctor, has been sentenced to prison for 25 years for his non-violent, but vocal opposition to Castro.
* In early 2003, dozens of persons, including independent journalists, librarians and other opponents of the Castro government were jailed after summary show trials, with some sentences in excess of 20 years, on the charge of receiving money from the United States in order to carry out anti-government activities.
* An Amnesty International report, CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack, calls for the &quot;Cuban authorities to release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally&quot; and to &quot;revoke all legislation that restricts freedom of expression, assembly and association, and to put a halt to all actions to harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists, and human rights defenders&quot;.
* Jorge Luis García Pérez was reported to have been released from prison in April 2007 after serving his full sentence of 17 years and 34 days for having, at the age of 25, shouted slogans against Fidel Castro. García Antúnez was convicted of sabotage after authorities accused him of setting fire to sugar cane fields, sabotage, spreading &quot;enemy propaganda&quot;, and being in illegal possession of a weapon.
* Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola, whom Amnesty International had declared &quot;a prisoner of conscience&quot; and demanded that he be released &quot;immediately and without conditions&quot;.
* On September 2, 2020, Article 19, Institute for War and Peace Reporting and Amnesty International urged the Cuban government to immediately release prisoner of conscience and independent journalist, Roberto Quiñones Haces. Following the trial in August 2019 and he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment for resistance and disobedience concerning his work as an independent journalist.

=== Travel and emigration ===

As of January 14, 2013, all Cuban government-imposed travel restrictions and controls have been abolished. Since that date, any Cuban citizen, with a valid passport, can leave the country subject to administrative restrictions imposed by the government. Students need the permission to travel from their school, workers from their employer. Both are controlled by the government. Visa requirements for Cuban citizens are more than the administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Cuba often incorporating (in violation of human rights) these requirement of proof of authorization to travel (Schengen countries EU).
Some of the requirements of third countries like financial self sufficiency and financial ties to the country (property, income) can not be met by Cubans due to the site economic situation. Few Cubans have the (proven ) income to show they can pay for travel and stay. Most need a sponsor.
In 2014, Cuban citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 61 countries and territories, ranking the Cuban passport 69th in the world. Persons holding dual Spanish and Cuban citizenships are now allowed to travel freely, using their Spanish passport in lieu of a visa for countries normally requiring a visa for the Cuban passport. Moreover, ever since that date, the Cuban government extended the allowable time abroad from 11 to 24 months, allowing Cubans who return within the 24-month time frame to retain their status and benefits of &quot;Cuban Resident of the Interior&quot;. Should the citizen remain out of Cuba for more than 24 months, then his status would change to &quot;Cuban Resident of the Exterior&quot; and he would lose his privileges within. By this change, there is no longer such a thing as &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;unauthorized&quot; travel, and therefore persons who leave Cuba via unconventional means (boats etc.) are no longer violating Cuban law, and therefore not subject to detention or imprisonment.

Prior to January 13, 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied. Unauthorized travel abroad had sometimes resulted in criminal prosecution. It was common, in those days, that certain citizens who were authorized travel (primarily medical personnel and other professionals deemed essential to the country) were not permitted to take their children with them overseas. In the event that Cuban doctors defect to the United States when they are sent to a &quot;mission&quot; out of Cuba to any foreign country, any children left behind would not be allowed to join their defector parent for a minimum of ten years, even if they had received a foreign visa, and regardless of their age. Castro opposition leader Oswaldo Payá has been allowed to travel abroad to receive his Sakharov Prize, but Ladies in White was not.

From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States, often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. In the early years, a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for Spain. Over time a number of Cuban Jews were allowed to emigrate to Israel after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 have left. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Cubans now reside in a diverse number of countries, some ending up in countries of the European Union. A large number of Cubans live in Mexico and Canada.

At times the exodus was tolerated by the Cuban government as a &quot;release valve&quot;; at other times the government has impeded it. Some Cubans left for economic reasons and some for political ones. Others emigrated by way of the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, which is blocked on the Cuban (land) side by barbed-wired fences and land mines.

In 1995 the US government entered into an agreement with the Cuban government to resolve the emigration crisis that created the Mariel Boatlift of 1980, when Castro opened the docks to anyone who wanted to leave. The result of the negotiations was an agreement under which the United States was required to issue 20,000 visas annually to Cuban emigrants. This quota is rarely filled; the Bush administration refused to comply with the act, issuing only 505 visas to Cubans in the first six months of 2003. It also blocked some Cubans who have visas.

On July 13, 1994, 72 Cubans attempted to leave the Island on a World War II era tugboat named the &quot;13 de Marzo&quot;. In an attempt by the Cuban Navy to stop the tugboat, patrol boats were sent out to intercept the tug. Crewmen and survivors reported that the Cuban interception vessels rammed the tugboat and sprayed its passengers with high-pressure fire hoses, sweeping many overboard.

The US Coast Guard reported that the interceptions in high seas have been characterized as violent confrontations with authorities and by the deaths of immigrants. According to the same authorities, the Cubans are taken to the US on speed boats by a network of criminals specialized in human trafficking, former drug traffickers, based in southern Florida which now find contraband of humans more lucrative than drugs. These criminals charge 8 to 12 thousand dollars per person, overcrowding the small vessels. The majority of those that attempt to emigrate are individuals that have relatives in the United States, others who do not qualify to be considered as legal immigrants in the US, or those who do not want to wait their turn in the annual quota, assigned under the migratory treaties for legal immigrants 

Since November 1966, the Cuban Adjustment Act provides automatic permanent residency for almost all Cubans arriving legally or illegally after one year and one day in the US. No immigrant from any other nation has this privilege. Controversy over this policy centers around the loss of Cuba&#x27;s scientists, professionals, technicians and other skilled individuals, but it has also prompted concerns of a migratory crisis.

At the end of the 2005 fiscal year which ended September 30, the US Coast Guard Service reported having intercepted 2,712 Cubans at sea, more than double the 1,225 reported in 2004 The figure for 2005 is the third highest of Cubans intercepted in the Florida straights during the last 12 years. The highest had been reported in 1993 with 3,656 and 1994 when over 30,000 Cubans emigrated illegally due to the so-called migratory crisis between the two countries.

The 1994 and 1995 migratory accords signed between Havana and Washington, and which emerged due to the crisis in August 1994, are still in effect. These accords force the US to return all those intercepted at sea by US authorities to Cuba, except the cases in which political persecution can be proven to justify exile in the United States.

The accords were designed to discourage those who would consider emigrating illegally by sea but the Bush administration has not complied with Washington&#x27;s part of the agreements. Although the Coast Guard says that only 2.5 percent of the Cubans intercepted are granted political asylum, the public understanding, the public perception in Cuba and among the Cuban community in Miami, is not the same. And since that is not the perception, more and more people continue to illegally leave the island by sea causing fatal consequences. According to studies carried out by Cuban experts on the island, it is estimated that at least 15 percent of those that attempt to cross the sea die before reaching the US.

However, figures of those fleeing other Latin American or Caribbean countries of origin compare similarly with those of Cuba. During the 2005 fiscal year, 3,612 Dominicans were picked up at high seas attempting to illegally reach the US (900 more than Cubans intercepted) and in 2004, 3,229 Haitians were also picked up (2,000 more than the 1,225 Cubans that fiscal year). The Brazilian daily &quot;O Globo&quot; published an article on illegal immigrants in the US, quoting official sources, pointing out that during the first semester of 2005, 27,396 Brazilians were stopped from illegally crossing US borders, an average of 4,556 per month and 152 a day. In 2004, a total of 1,160,000 foreigners, were stopped when attempting to illegally enter the US, 93 percent of them (close to 1,080,000) were Mexicans.

=== Education ===

Education in Cuba is free at all levels and led by the Ministry for Education. In 1961 the government nationalized all private educational institutions and introduced a state-directed education system.

=== Healthcare ===

The Cuban government operates on national health system and assumes full fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of its citizens. The government prohibits any private alternatives to the national health system. In 1976, Cuba&#x27;s healthcare program was enshrined in Article 50 of the revised constitution which states, &quot;Everyone has the right to health protection and care&quot;. Healthcare in Cuba is also free, although challenges include low salaries for doctors, poor facilities, poor provision of equipment, and the frequent absence of essential drugs.

However, there is no right to privacy, or a patient&#x27;s informed consent, or the right to protest or sue a doctor or clinic for malpractice. Many Cubans complain about politics in medical treatment and health care decision-making.

After spending nine months in Cuban clinics, anthropologist Katherine Hirschfeld wrote &quot;My increased awareness of Cuba&#x27;s criminalization of dissent raised a very provocative question: to what extent is the favorable international image of the Cuban health care system maintained by the state&#x27;s practice of suppressing dissent and covertly intimidating or imprisoning would-be critics?&quot;

Family doctors are expected to keep records of their patients&#x27; &quot;political integration.&quot; Epidemiological surveillance has become juxtaposed with political surveillance.

=== Religious freedom ===

In the years following the Cuban Revolution, the activities of the Roman Catholic Church were severely limited and in 1961 all property held by religious organizations was confiscated without compensation. Hundreds of members of the clergy, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation. The Cuban leadership was officially atheist until 1992 when the Communist Party agreed to allow religious followers to join the party. In 1998, Pope John Paul II visited the island and was allowed to conduct large outdoor masses and
visas were issued for nineteen foreign priests taking up residence in the country. In addition, other religious groups in Cuba such as the Jewish community are now permitted to hold public services and to import religious materials and kosher food for Passover, as well as to receive rabbis and other religious visitors from abroad. In October 2008, Cuba marked the opening of a Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Havana in a ceremony attended by Raúl Castro, Vice President Esteban Lazo, Parliament leader Ricardo Alarcón, and other figures. The Cuban press noted that the cathedral was the first of its kind in Latin America.

In 2022, Freedom House rated Cuba&#x27;s religious freedom as 3 out of 4, noting that religious freedom has improved over the past decade.

A 2023 report found that documented Freedom of Religion violations more than doubled from 272 in 2021 to 657 in 2022.

=== Rights of women ===

Cuba is a regional front-runner in women&#x27;s rights. With respect to reproductive rights, Cuban women have up to two years of maternity leave and free access to abortion.

Women head almost 50% of households in Cuba. Sixty percent of Cuban professionals are women. Cuban women also have high representation in the country, with women holding 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the Cuban National Assembly.

=== Torture ===
In 2005 a group of culture personalities, including several Nobel Prize laureates, have signed an appeal on &quot;The Guardian&quot; in defense of Cuba, claiming that &quot;the government of the US has no moral authority to elect itself as the judge over human rights in Cuba, where there has not been a single case of disappearance, torture or extrajudicial execution since 1959, and where despite the economic blockade, there are levels of health, education and culture that are internationally recognised.&quot; The appeal is signed, for example, by Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, José Saramago, Claudio Abbado, Manu Chao, Walter Salles, Nadine Gordimer, Harold Pinter, Tariq Ali, Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover, Ernesto Cardenal, Alice Walker, Ramsey Clark and Danielle Mitterrand.

== Race relations ==

Esteban Morales Dominguez has pointed to institutionalized racism in his book &quot;The Challenges of the Racial Problem in Cuba&quot; (). &quot;Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba&quot; discusses the racial politics prevalent in communist Cuba.

Enrique Patterson, writing in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, describes race as a &quot;social bomb&quot; and he says, &quot;If the Cuban government were to permit black Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall&quot;. Carlos Moore, who has authored extensively on the issue, says that &quot;There is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore, the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead&quot;. He says that a new generation of black Cubans are looking at politics in another way.

Jorge Luis García Pérez, a well-known Afro-Cuban human rights and democracy activist who was imprisoned for 17 years, in an interview with the Florida-based &quot;Directorio Democrático Cubano&quot; states &quot;The authorities in my country have never tolerated that a black person oppose the revolution. During the trial, the color of my skin aggravated the situation. Later when I was mistreated in prison by guards, they always referred to me as being black&quot;.

Despite these barriers however, Cuba has oftentimes been praised for advances of the Cuban Revolution in the areas of racial equality. During his leadership, Castro abolished segregation in businesses and public spaces while also ushering in egalitarian reforms in areas such as employment, wages, social security, and education. The proportion of high school graduates was actually higher among blacks than among whites in Cuba, whereas the opposite was true in both Brazil and the United States. In the area of life expectancy, The life expectancy of nonwhite Cubans was only one year lower
than that of whites; life expectancy was basically identical for all racial groups. A powerful indicator of social wellbeing, linked to access to health services (as reflected, particularly, in infant mortality), nutrition and education, the Cuban race gap in life expectancy was significantly lower than those found in more affluent multiracial societies such as Brazil (about 6.7 years) and the United States (about 6.3 years) during the same period. Because of these social reforms the Afro Cuban population is the healthiest longest living black population in the world. In the area of national leadership the vestiges of the pre revolutionary era are still visible when it comes to the question of colour, with Afro Cubans having yet to achieve parity when it comes to representation. Nevertheless, reforms have been introduced since in the 1970s when Castro &quot;worked to increase the number of Afro-Cuban political representatives, with the percentage of Black members on the Council of State expanding from 12.9% in 1976 to 25.8% by 2003&quot;.

== Black Spring ==

In March 2003, the government of Cuba arrested dozens of people (including self-identified journalists and human rights activists), and charged them with sedition due to their alleged cooperation with James Cason, head of the United States Interests Section in Havana. The accused were tried and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 28 years. In all, 75 people were given lengthy sentences averaging 17 years each. Among those sentenced were Raúl Rivero, Marta Beatriz Roque, and Oscar Elías Biscet. Amnesty International described the trials as &quot;hasty and manifestly unfair.&quot;

Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Pérez Roque denied these accusations and responded: &quot;Cuba has the right to defend itself and apply punishment just like other nations do, like the United States punishes those who cooperate with a foreign power to inflict damage on their people and territory.&quot;

During the trial, evidence was presented that the defendants had received funds from the U.S. Interests Section. Cuban officials claim that the goal of this funding was to undermine the Cuban state, disrupt internal order, and damage the Cuban economy. For his part, Cason denies offering funds to anyone in Cuba.

On November 29, 2004, the Cuban government released three of those arrested in March 2003: Oscar Espinosa Chepe, Marcelo López, and Margarito Broche. The action followed a meeting between the Spanish ambassador and Cuba&#x27;s foreign minister. In subsequent days four more dissidents were released: Raúl Rivero, Osvaldo Alfonso Valdés, Edel José García and Jorge Olivera. Seven other prisoners had previously been released for health reasons.

== LGBT rights in Cuba ==
The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in Cuba have evolved significantly over time, from widespread discrimination in most of the 20th century to what are now considered some of the most progressive LGBT policies in Latin America.

=== Discrimination ===
Thousands of homosexuals, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, conscientious objectors, and dissidents were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in the 1960s at UMAP camps, where they were subject to political &quot;reeducation&quot;. Military commanders brutalized the inmates. Carlos Alberto Montaner says &quot;Camps of forced labour were instituted with all speed to &quot;correct&quot; such deviations ... Verbal and physical mistreatment, shaved heads, work from dawn to dusk, hammocks, dirt floors, scarce food ... The camps became increasingly crowded as the methods of arrest became more expedient&quot;.

In the late 1960s, because of &quot;revolutionary social hygiene&quot;, the Castro government claimed to cleanse the arts of &quot;fraudulent sodomitic&quot; writers and &quot;sick effeminate&quot; dancers. Additionally, men with long hair were locked up and their hair was cut.

Castro is reported to once have asserted that, &quot;in the country[side], there are no homosexuals&quot;, before claiming in 1992 that homosexuality is a &quot;natural human tendency that must simply be respected&quot;. Another source reports Castro as having denounced &quot;maricones&quot; (&quot;faggots&quot;) as &quot;agents of imperialism&quot;. Castro had also reportedly asserted that &quot;homosexuals should not be allowed in positions where they are able to exert influence upon young people&quot;.

=== 21st century reforms ===
Cuba has made reforms in the 21st century, particularly via the successful 2022 Family Code referendum.

In 2003, Carlos Sanchez of the International Lesbian and Gay Association issued a report on the status of gay people in Cuba which claimed that the Cuban government no longer imposes any legal punishments on its gay citizens, that there is a greater level of tolerance among Cubans for gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and that the Cuban government was open to endorsing a gay and lesbian rights plank at the United Nations. Since 2005 sex reassignment surgeries for transgender individuals are free under law, and are paid for by the government. Also Havana now has a &quot;lively and vibrant&quot; gay and lesbian scene.

In a 2010 interview with Mexican newspaper &quot;La Jornada&quot;, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro, called the persecution of homosexuals whilst he was in power &quot;a great injustice, great injustice!&quot; Taking responsibility for the persecution, he said, &quot;If anyone is responsible, it&#x27;s me ... We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death. In those moments I was not able to deal with that matter [of homosexuals]. I found myself immersed, principally, in the Crisis of October, in the war, in policy questions.&quot; Castro personally believed that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country&#x27;s pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality.

Mariela Castro, daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Raúl Castro, has been pushing for lesbian rights with the pro-lesbian government sponsored Cuban National Center for Sex Education which she leads. Mariela has stated her father fully supports her initiatives, saying that her father has overcome his initial homophobia to support his daughter.

The passage of the 2022 Family Code referendum legalized same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex parents. Cuba now has one of the most progressive stances on LGBT rights of among Latin American countries.

== United Nations Human Rights Commission ==
Cuban human rights have been repeatedly discussed and debated in the United Nations Human Rights Commission since the Cuban Revolution. It would become a recurring flashpoint in the backdrop of international dynamic during the Cold War and into the years following.

The organized and sustained international effort launched by prominent Cuban dissident groups (e.g. Miami&#x27;s Center for Human Rights, UNIDAD Cubana, Christian Democratic Party of Cuba, and others) and affiliated NGOs (such as Human Rights Watch) made their way to the UNHRC and would become a growing presence in Geneva. These groups sometimes represented a spectrum of different Cuban interests, such as religious liberty (e.g. Christian-Democrat movements, parties, and organizations) and education (e.g. the International Association of Educators for World Peace), that coalesced around the issue of human rights. An influential force credited with crafting and spearheading the international Cuban human rights effort, particularly in the United Nations, was activist and Cuban community leader Jesús Permuy. The Miami Herald&#x27;s profile of the Cuban Christian Democrat Movement stated that Permuy spearheaded the international diplomatic strategy to call out the Castro regime&#x27;s human rights abuses and work with other Christian-Democratic governments to withhold international support until governmental changes were made to address human rights abuses. Though the coalition&#x27;s NGO-driven human rights effort for Cuba initially struggled to gain traction in the UNHRC, their influence gradually grew, especially as key groups secured Consultative Status which significantly expanded their resources and exposure there. A significant turning point in these efforts came in 1984 when Permuy&#x27;s Miami-based Center for Human Rights successfully lobbied to have Cuba&#x27;s diplomatic representative, Luis Sola Vila, removed from a key subcommittee of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and replaced with a representative from Ireland, a Christian-Democratic ally in opposition of the Castro government. Another key moment came in 1987 when US President Ronald Reagan appointed Armando Valladares, former Cuban political prisoner of 22 years, as the US Ambassador to the commission. By 1992, there had been a substantial change in Geneva as the UNHRC representatives had shifted from initial rejection, then indifference and towards embrace of the anti-Castro Cuban human rights movement&#x27;s diplomatic efforts.

Since 1990, the United States itself has presented various resolutions to the annual UN Human Rights Commission criticizing Cuba&#x27;s human rights record. The proposals and subsequent diplomatic disagreements have been described as a &quot;nearly annual ritual&quot;. Long-term consensus between Latin American nations has not emerged. The resolutions were passed 1990–1997, but were rejected in 1998. Subsequent efforts by the U.S. have succeeded by narrow voting margins. In the Americas, some governments back the criticism, others oppose it, seeing it as a cynical manipulation of a serious human rights issue in order to promote the isolation of the island and to justify the decades-old embargo. European Union nations have universally voted against Cuba since 1990, though requests that the resolution should contain references to the negative effects of the economic embargo have been made.

<text>Graham Colton (born November 6, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His most recent album, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, was released on August 14, 2020. Colton&#x27;s songs have been featured on numerous TV shows including &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, &quot;Kyle XY&quot;, &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Big Give&quot;, &quot;Newport Harbor&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Wildfire&quot;, &quot;October Road&quot; Fall promo, HBO Winter promo, Sundance promo, and many others.

He is an operating partner of The Jones Assembly, an acclaimed restaurant and 1700 capacity music venue located in downtown Oklahoma City. The Jones has hosted artists including Willie Nelson, Spoon, LANY, Ben Rector, Dwight Yoakam, Jenny Lewis and many more. He owns and operates Lunar Manor recording studio and collaborates regularly with Chad Copelin of Blackwatch Studios for various music projects. 

==Early life==
Colton graduated from Heritage Hall School, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. While there, he was the quarterback of the football team. Together with his childhood friend and teammate Wes Welker, former wide receiver and current Offensive Assistant for the Houston Texans, Colton led his team to a class 2A state championship in 1998 against the Tishomingo Indians. In the process, Colton and Welker set multiple state passing and receiving records, respectively.

==Career==

===Graham Colton Band===
After leaving his hometown of Oklahoma City to attend Southern Methodist University, Colton began writing and performing songs in Dallas pubs and coffee houses. During this time, Colton perceived an appreciable demand for his music. Colton began recording songs for a growing local fan base; his self-titled demo, &quot;Graham Colton&quot;, became a local favorite and a top seller on the popular music website Awarestore.com.

Soon after, Colton formed the Graham Colton Band alongside Brian &#x27;Turtle&#x27; Turton, Jordan Elder, Drew Nichols, &amp; Ryan Tallent. The band&#x27;s first trip outside of Texas included a tour stop at DC Sessions in Washington, DC. There, the band struck up a friendship with New Orleans band Better Than Ezra and frontman Kevin Griffin. They would perform with Better than Ezra off and on for the next 2 years and begin collaborating with Griffin on several songs.

Adam Duritz invited Colton to perform as a supporting act for the Counting Crows in their 2002 fall tour. Colton was invited for another tour in 2004.

The Graham Colton Band signed a record deal with Universal Records. The group started recording sessions with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien at the Southern Tracks studio in Atlanta, GA. 
The resulting album &quot;Drive&quot; was released in May 2004. To support the album, performance dates were arranged with various high-profile acts, including John Mayer, O.A.R., Maroon 5 and the Dave Matthews Band. Guitarist Aben Eubanks served as an unofficial member of the band.

After extensive touring through 2006, the band officially parted ways.

===&quot;Here Right Now&quot;===
After spending the majority of 2005 on the road with Kelly Clarkson, who he also dated, Colton began writing songs for what would become his solo follow up, &quot;Here Right Now&quot;, which was released in late October 2007. The album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Artist/Heatseeker chart, and No. 4 Pop Album/#11 Top Album charts on iTunes.

Upon release of the album, Graham returned to the road for a series of solo performances with Vanessa Carlton.

On March 10, 2008, Graham mentioned that a full tour would be announced in early 2008 for this album. He also performed to promote the album on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

The lead track, &quot;Best Days&quot;, was chosen as single of the week at iTunes and subsequently, Graham was named by its editors as a &#x27;Top New Pop Artist&#x27; of &#x27;07. In addition, the track landed coverage in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine with a &#x27;Singles Review&#x27; and was the subject of their &#x27;Breaking and Entering&#x27; feature.

The music video for the song was directed by highly acclaimed director Nigel Dick, and made its &quot;TRL&quot; debut on MTV shortly after it was filmed. MTV proceeded to use four songs from the album as part of their &#x27;Featured Artist Program&#x27; for the hit show, &quot;Newport Harbor&quot;.

That year, Colton performed at a number of concerts and radio events alongside Vanessa Carlton, Colbie Caillat, John Mellencamp, as well as a U.S headlining tour.

Colton officially parted ways with Universal/Republic records in 2008 and quickly began writing songs for what would later become the &quot;Twenty Something&quot; EP. As a newly independent artist, Colton enlisted touring bandmates Chad Copelin &amp; Jarod Evans to produce the EP at Blackwatch Studios in Norman, Oklahoma. Colton played several solo acoustic shows in support of the EP including a month of tour dates with longtime pals Needtobreathe.

===&quot;Pacific Coast Eyes&quot;===
Colton began recording songs with producer Tommy Walter in 2010 that would later become &quot;Pacific Coast Eyes&quot;. Officially released in April 2011, the album would be Colton&#x27;s first official full length independent release. The album was highly praised and reached the top of the iTunes singer songwriter chart. Colton enlisted David Green and Jon Cooper to direct/produce the music video for &quot;Pacific Coast Eyes&quot;. It was filmed in three days in Los Angeles. Colton would again embark on a US headlining tour as well as open for artists including Sheryl Crow, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Colin Hay, Mat Kearney, and Ben Rector. After writing a handful of new songs he chose to re-release the album in October 2011 as &quot;Pacific Coast Eyes Volume 2&quot; adding three new songs and three bonus tracks.

===Sooner The Sunset===
Colton collaborated with Lindsey Ray in the summer of 2011 under the name Sooner the Sunset and recorded a handful of songs for a self-titled EP released October 2, 2012. The band&#x27;s first single &quot;All Because of You&quot; was released on iTunes in March 2012.

===&quot;Lonely Ones&quot;===
Colton&#x27;s latest album &quot;Lonely Ones&quot;, produced by Chad Copelin and Jarod Evans at Blackwatch Studios, was released on January 21, 2014. &quot;Lonely Ones&quot; was inspired by Colton&#x27;s collaborations with Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips and features Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips on guitar.

&quot;Born To Raise Hell&quot;, the first music video from &quot;Lonely Ones,&quot; premiered on PopMatters on November 7, 2013. The song was inspired by a story told by Colton&#x27;s co-producer Chad Copelin about his father picking up a hitchhiker in the 70s who turned out to be serial killer Richard Speck.

Colton released a series of live in-studio performances from the album called &quot;The Lonely Sessions.&quot; In conjunction with the &quot;Lonely Ones&quot; Tour with Seattle indie band Cumulus, Colton released the &quot;Lonely Ones Tour EP&quot; on Noisetrade featuring two collaborations with The Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne: &quot;Don&#x27;t Take My Sunshine Away,&quot; made popular by the band Sparklehorse, and an alternate version of &quot;Another Night.&quot;

In August 2020, Colton released a digital album, &quot;Inside Out&quot;.

==Television performances==
Graham made his national television debut on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on Friday, February 2, 2008, with a full band performance of &quot;Best Days&quot; which included a three-piece string section. Shortly thereafter, he travelled to New York to perform on CBS&#x27; &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on March 13 and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; on the 14th, again with full band and strings. The next week, he performed on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on March 19, with a stripped down acoustic performance with strings. The week after, he travelled back to New York for a solo acoustic performance on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; on the 27th, making that the third consecutive week with a national television performance. On April 9, Graham returned to Los Angeles to perform on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

<text>&quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; ( ) is a song and single from the 1964 Disney musical film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. It was written by the Sherman Brothers, and sung by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. It also appears in the 2004 stage show version.
Because &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was a period piece set in 1910, songs that sounded similar to songs of the period were wanted. The movie version finished at #36 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

== Story context ==
The song occurs in the chalk-drawing outing animated sequence, just after Mary Poppins wins a horse race. Flush with her victory, she is immediately surrounded by reporters who pepper her with questions and suggest that she is at a loss for words. Mary disagrees, saying that at least one word is appropriate for the situation, and begins the song with this very word.

== Word meaning and general origin ==
The word is a compound word, and said by Richard Lederer in his book &quot;Crazy English&quot; to be made up of these words: super- &quot;above&quot;, cali- &quot;beauty&quot;, fragilistic- &quot;delicate&quot;, expiali- &quot;to atone&quot;, and -docious &quot;educable&quot;, with all of these parts combined meaning &quot;Atoning for being educable through delicate beauty.&quot;

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; first records the word (with a spelling of &quot;supercaliflawjalisticeexpialadoshus&quot;) in the column titled &quot;A-muse-ings&quot; by Helen Herman in the Syracuse University &quot;Daily Orange&quot;, dated March 10, 1931. In the column, Herman states that the word &quot;implies all that is grand, great, glorious, splendid, superb, wonderful&quot;.

The word was popularized in the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, in which it is used as the title of a song and defined as &quot;something to say when you don&#x27;t know what to say&quot;.

The Sherman Brothers, who wrote the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; song, have given several conflicting explanations for the word&#x27;s origin, in one instance claiming to have coined it themselves, based on their memories of having created double-talk words as children. In another instance, they wrote:
When we were little boys in the mid-1930s, we went to a summer camp in the Adirondack Mountains, where we were introduced to a very long word that had been passed down in many variations through many generations of kids. ... The word as we first heard it was super-cadja-flawjalistic-espealedojus.

Dictionary.com meanwhile says it is &quot;used as a nonsense word by children to express approval or to represent the longest word in English.&quot; The word contains 34 letters and 14 syllables.

== Legal action ==
In 1965, the song was the subject of an unsuccessful lawsuit by songwriters Gloria Parker and Barney Young against Wonderland Music, Disney&#x27;s music publishing subsidiary, and publisher of the song from the film. The plaintiffs alleged that it was a copyright infringement of their 1949 song &quot;Supercalafajalistickespeealadojus&quot;. Also known as &quot;The Super Song&quot;, it was recorded by Alan Holmes and His New Tones for Columbia Records, with vocal by Hal Marquess and the Holmes Men, and music and lyrics by Patricia Smith (a Gloria Parker pen name) and Don Fenton. Another recording of &quot;Supercalafajalistickespeealadojus&quot;, performed by The Arabian Knights and published by Gloro Records, was released in 1951. The Disney publishers won the lawsuit in part because they produced affidavits showing that &quot;variants of the word were known ... many years prior to 1949&quot;.

== Backwards version ==
During the song, Poppins says, &quot;You know, you can say it backwards, which is &#x27;dociousaliexpilistic-fragilcalirupus&#x27;, but that&#x27;s going a bit too far, don&#x27;t you think?&quot; (To which Dick Van Dyke replies, &quot;Indubitably.&quot;) Andrews&#x27; husband, Tony Walton, who also designed the sets and costumes, came up with the backwards version. 

Her claim was not about &quot;spelling&quot; it backwards, but rather &quot;saying&quot; it backwards; in other words, if one breaks the word into several sections or prosodic feet (&quot;super-cali-fragi-listic-expi-ali-docious&quot;) and recites them in reverse sequence, and also modifies &quot;super&quot; to &quot;rupus&quot;, it comes close to what Poppins said in the film. However, when the word is spelled backwards it actually becomes &quot;suoicodilaipxecitsiligarfilacrepus&quot;, which is different. In the stage musical, the word&#x27;s actual spelling reversal is used, while rapper Ghostface Killah said &quot;docious-ali-expi-listic-fragi-cali-super&quot;, which is the full prosody version, in his song &quot;Buck 50&quot; released on his album &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;.

==Chart history==
&quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; was released as a single, achieving a measure of commercial success on the U.S. music charts. It peaked at number 66 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It did much better on the Adult Contemporary chart, reaching number 14.

==Certifications==

== Stage musical ==
In the stage musical, Mary Poppins takes Jane and Michael Banks to visit Mrs Corry&#x27;s shop to buy &quot;an ounce of conversation&quot;, only to find that Mrs Corry has run out of conversation. She does, however have some letters, and Jane and Michael each pick out seven, with Mary choosing one also. As Bert, Mary and the rest of the ensemble struggle to create words out of the fifteen letters, Mary reminds them that they can always use the same letter more than once, and creates the word (and song) Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. In addition, the cast spells it out in a kind of gesture that was suggested by choreographer Stephen Mear, whose partner is deaf.

== Other references ==
The word was used on the US game show Password Plus, first as a clue to a puzzle, and later as the puzzle itself.

English yachtsman Rodney Pattisson won three Olympic medals in sailing during the Games of 1968 (gold), 1972 (gold) and 1976 (silver) in a Flying Dutchman called &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;Superdocious&quot;) written in large colorful waves on the hull.

Japanese rock band Boøwy included a song called &quot;SUPER-CALIFRAGILISTIC-EXPIARI-DOCIOUS&quot; that was written by their guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei on their 1986 number one album &quot;Beat Emotion&quot;.

In February 2000, Inverness Caledonian Thistle defeated Glasgow&#x27;s Celtic FC 3–1 in the third round of the Scottish Cup football competition. The result, one of the biggest ever upsets in Scottish football, led to the newspaper headline &quot;Super Caley go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious&quot; by &quot;The Sun&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated it as number 5 in six of the greatest football headlines.

One pun on the word jokes that Mahatma Gandhi was a &quot;super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis&quot;.

In 2011, a group of fans of the webcomic Homestuck produced an album of songs called &quot;Land of Fans and Music.&quot; One such track is a parody titled &quot;SadoMasoPedoRoboNecroBestiality&quot;. According to the vocalist, Goatmon, the lyrics were adapted from a post on the Something Awful forums.

In 2016, Randy Rainbow created a parody video of the song, in which he called (then-candidate) Donald Trump &quot;super callous fragile egocentric braggadocious&quot;, &quot;super careless fragile ego extra braggadocious&quot;, &quot;super sleazy fabricating sexist and obnoxious&quot;, &quot;superficial chauvinistic arrogant and thoughtless&quot;, and &quot;super calculated adolescent braggadocious&quot;.

In 2017, Dick Van Dyke was selected to receive an award for television excellence from BAFTA, at which time he said &quot;I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of Bafta for inflicting on them the most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema.&quot; A chief executive of Bafta responded, &quot;We look forward to his acceptance speech in whatever accent he chooses on the night. We have no doubt it will be supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.&quot;

In 2018, Girona manager Pablo Machín was asked to describe his club, using only one word. He responded &quot;Ok, I&#x27;ll use the longest word I know: &quot;supercalifragilisticoespialidoso&quot;&quot;.

In 2021, a cover was sung by Hololive&#x27;s virtual idols Momosuzu Nene and Pavolia Reine, with the latter singing the word during the rap part.

In 2021, the game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; introduced a Whammy animation spoofing the song, with &quot;Whammy Poppins&quot; singing &quot;Supercalifragilistic-give me all your money!&quot;

In September 2022, Japanese boyband JO1 pre-released the song &quot;SuperCali&quot; from their EP single, &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. The title is abbreviation of &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;, which was introduced as the word that &quot;makes infinite possibilities come true&quot; at their tour.

<doc id="596963" wikidata="Q410768" url="?curid=596963" title="Xanthan gum">
<text>Xanthan gum () is a polysaccharide with many industrial uses, including as a common food additive. It is an effective thickening agent and stabilizer that prevents ingredients from separating. It can be produced from simple sugars by fermentation and derives its name from the species of bacteria used, &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot;.

==History==
Xanthan gum was discovered by Allene Rosalind Jeanes and her research team at the United States Department of Agriculture, and brought into commercial production by CP Kelco under the trade name Kelzan in the early 1960s, remaining the only manufacuturer in the US. It was approved for use in foods in 1968 and is accepted as a safe food additive in the US, Canada, European countries, and many other countries, with E number E415, and CAS number 11138-66-2.

Xanthan gum derives its name from the species of bacteria used during the fermentation process, &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot;.

==Uses==
Addition of 1% of xanthan gum can produce a significant increase in the viscosity of a liquid.

In foods, xanthan gum is a common ingredient in salad dressings and sauces. It helps to prevent oil separation by stabilizing the emulsion, although it is not an emulsifier. Xanthan gum also helps suspend solid particles, such as spices. Xanthan gum helps create the desired texture in many ice creams. Toothpaste often contains xanthan gum as a binder to keep the product uniform. Xanthan gum also helps thicken commercial egg substitutes made from egg whites, to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in yolks. It is also a preferred method of thickening liquids for those with swallowing disorders, since it does not change the color or flavor of foods or beverages at typical use levels. In gluten-free baking, xanthan gum is used to give the dough or batter the stickiness that would otherwise be achieved with gluten. In most foods, it is used at concentrations of 0.5% or less. Xanthan gum is used in a wide range of food products, such as sauces, dressings, meat and poultry products, bakery products, confectionery products, beverages, dairy products, and others.

In the oil industry, xanthan gum is used in large quantities to thicken drilling mud. These fluids carry the solids cut by the drilling bit to the surface. Xanthan gum provides improved &quot;low end&quot; rheology. When circulation stops, the solids remain suspended in the drilling fluid. The widespread use of horizontal drilling and the demand for good control of drilled solids has led to its expanded use. It has been added to concrete poured underwater, to increase its viscosity and prevent washout.

In cosmetics, xanthan gum is used to prepare water gels. It is also used in oil-in-water emulsions to enhance droplet coalescence. Xanthan gum is under preliminary research for its potential uses in tissue engineering to construct hydrogels and scaffolds supporting three-dimensional tissue formation. Furthermore, thiolated xanthan gum (see thiomers) has shown potential for drug delivery, since by the covalent attachment of thiol groups to this polysaccharide high mucoadhesive and permeation enhancing properties can be introduced.

===Shear thinning===
The viscosity of xanthan gum solutions decreases with higher shear rates. This is called shear thinning or pseudoplasticity. This means that a product subjected to shear, whether from mixing, shaking or chewing, will thin. This is similar to the behaviour of tomato ketchup. When the shear forces are removed, the food will thicken again. In salad dressing, the addition of xanthan gum makes it thick enough at rest in the bottle to keep the mixture fairly homogeneous, but the shear forces generated by shaking and pouring thins it, so it can be easily poured. When it exits the bottle, the shear forces are removed and it thickens again, so it clings to the salad. The rheology of xanthan aqua solutions become visco-elastic at higher concentrations of xanthan gum in water.

=== Concentrations used ===
The greater the concentration of xanthan gum in a liquid, the thicker the liquid will become. An emulsion can be formed with as little as 0.1% (by weight). Increasing the concentration of gum gives a thicker, more stable emulsion up to 1% xanthan gum. A teaspoon of xanthan gum weighs about 2.5 grams and brings one cup (250ml) of water to a 1% concentration.

To make a foam, 0.2–0.8% xanthan gum is typically used. Larger amounts result in larger bubbles and denser foam. Egg white powder (0.2–2.0%) with 0.1–0.4% xanthan gum yields bubbles similar to soap bubbles.

==Safety==
According to a 2017 safety review by a scientific panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), xanthan gum (European food additive number E 415) is extensively digested during intestinal fermentation, and causes no adverse effects, even at high intake amounts. The EFSA panel found no concern about genotoxicity from long-term consumption. The EFSA concluded that there is no safety concern for the general population when xanthan gum is consumed as a food additive.

==Preparation==
Xanthan gum is produced by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose. The medium is well-aerated and stirred, and the xanthan polymer is produced extracellularly into the medium. After one to four days, the polymer is precipitated from the medium by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, and the precipitate is dried and milled to give a powder that is readily soluble in water or brine.

It is composed of pentasaccharide repeat units, comprising glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 2:2:1.

A strain of &quot;X. campestris&quot; that will grow on lactose has been developed – which allows it to be used to process whey, a waste product of cheese production. This can produce 30 g/L of xanthan gum for every 40 g/L of whey powder. Whey-derived xanthan gum is commonly used in many commercial products, such as shampoos and salad dressings.

===Detail of the biosynthesis===
Synthesis originates from glucose as substrate for synthesis of the sugar nucleotides precursors UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronate, and GDP-mannose that are required for building the pentasaccharide repeat unit. This links the synthesis of xanthan to carbohydrate metabolism. The repeat units are built up at undecaprenylphosphate lipid carriers that are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane.

Specific glycosyltransferases sequentially transfer the sugar moieties of the nucleotide sugar xanthan precursors to the lipid carriers. Acetyl and pyruvyl residues are added as non-carbohydrate decorations. Mature repeat units are polymerized and exported in a way resembling the Wzy-dependent polysaccharide synthesis mechanism of Enterobacteriaceae. Products of the gum gene cluster drive synthesis, polymerization, and export of the repeat unit.

<text>Albert Benjamin Chandler III (born September 12, 1959) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the United States representative for from 2004 to 2013. A Democrat, Chandler was first elected to Congress in a 2004 special election. He served until January 2013, having been defeated for re-election by Andy Barr in the 2012 elections.

==Early life, education and career==
Chandler was born in Versailles, Kentucky on September 12, 1959, the son of Lucie &quot;Toss&quot; (née Dunlap) and A. B. Ben Chandler Jr. His paternal grandfather, A. B. Happy Chandler., served as Governor of Kentucky, Commissioner of Baseball, and as a U.S. Senator.

Chandler graduated with distinction from the University of Kentucky with a BA in History and a J.D. from the University of Kentucky College of Law. Chandler became a private practice lawyer in Lexington, KY before starting his political career.

==Early political career==
Chandler started his political career as State Auditor (per the Constitution of the Commonwealth, officially called the &quot;Auditor of Public Accounts&quot;) from 1992 through 1995. In 1995, Chandler won the Attorney General of Kentucky race by a 20-point margin, making him the nation&#x27;s youngest attorney general at the time. In 1999, Chandler was elected to a second term as attorney general with no opposition.

As attorney general, Chandler championed Kentucky&#x27;s &quot;No Call&quot; list and collected thousands of dollars in fines to the state for companies that did not comply with the new law. Chandler also strengthened federal laws regarding the &quot;No Call&quot; registry.

Also during his time as attorney general, Chandler recovered $45 million in charitable assets from one of Kentucky&#x27;s largest insurance companies when it converted from non-profit to for-profit status. This $45 million provided the endowment for the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, which many years later Chandler headed.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Chandler represented the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives since a special election in 2004 until 2013. Although Chandler is a Democrat, the Sixth Congressional District strongly leans Republican, rated by Charlie Cook in his Cook Partisan Voting Index as &quot;R + 9,&quot; meaning a generic Republican running against a generic Democrat would win by 9 points more than he would nationally.

He is a moderate to conservative Democrat and in its 2010 vote rankings, National Journal rated Chandler as being the ideological center of the House of Representatives. Although Chandler is a Democrat and has supported many Democratic bills including supporting healthcare for children through the SCHIP law and the Recovery Act, he has also voted against some large pieces of Democratic-led legislation including the Wall Street Bailout and the Affordable Care Act.

Chandler was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a fiscally conservative Democratic caucus. This caucus is generally composed of Democrats serving Republican leaning congressional districts. He served as the chair of the national Blue Dog Task Force on Oversight and Regulatory Review. According to the website, this taskforce &quot;The Task Force on Oversight and Regulatory Review is responsible for taking a look at the nearly 8,000 regulations issued annually by the federal government and for analyzing these new rules to ensure Congressional intent is appropriately followed. Under the leadership of Chair Ben Chandler (KY-06) and Vice-Chair Tim Holden (PA-17), the Task Force monitors implementation efforts, identifies overly burdensome regulations and seeks to modify rules problematic to job creation.&quot;

Chandler has voted in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, against the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, against Cut, Cap and Balance Act and for funding the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program.

In 2010 Chandler was criticized for accepting campaign contributions from embattled Congressman Rep. Charles Rangel&#x27;s National Leadership PAC.

In September 2010, Kentucky.com reported that Chandler was one of several &quot;moderate Democrats facing tough re-election bids who are bucking the Obama administration and pushing to extend tax cuts at every income level.&quot;

In 2011, Chandler voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

;Taxes
Chandler is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

===Committee assignments===
Before being appointed to the Intelligence Committee, Chandler served on the Appropriations Committee. 
*Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia
*Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
**Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence

===Caucus memberships===
A full list of Chandler&#x27;s caucus memberships can be found here: Caucus Membership | Congressman Ben Chandler, Representing the 6th District of Kentucky
*Healthy Forests Caucus
*Horse Caucus (Co-chair)
*International Conservation Caucus (Co-chair)
*Public Broadcasting Caucus (Co-chair)
*Wildlife Refuge Caucus

Chandler was a Blue Dog Democrat as well as a member of the House New Democrat Coalition. His name had been rumored as a candidate for governor for the 2007 election and Senator in the 2008 election. Chandler, however, announced on November 30, 2006, that he would not seek the governorship in 2007, stating he could better serve the Commonwealth in Congress: &quot;With rising seniority and a Democratic majority, I have the opportunity to do so much more for my constituents and for the people of Kentucky.&quot; Chandler told &quot;Kentucky Newsmakers&quot; that he would not start holding so-called town hall meetings in 2009, citing a lack of &quot;civility&quot; at forums regarding health care. Chandler ultimately voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Chandler was the Democratic candidate for governor in the election of 2003. He was defeated in that election in the landslide by his Republican opponent, Congressman Ernie Fletcher. Fletcher resigned from Congress in order to become governor, and a special election was held for his seat in February 2004. Chandler became the Democratic candidate and won the election, defeating state Senator Alice Forgy Kerr by a 55% to 43% margin.

As a superdelegate in the 2008 United States presidential election, Chandler endorsed Barack Obama. Chandler&#x27;s 2008 Republican opponent in the race for Congress was attorney Jon Larson.

===2010===

Chandler was challenged by Republican nominee Andy Barr in the November 2010 election. Chandler was elected by a very narrow margin, as results showed him leading Barr by about 600 votes. The results were re-canvassed due to the closeness of the outcome, but Chandler was certified as the election winner on November 12, 2010.

In October 2011, Barr called their forthcoming contest &quot;a rematch of the third-closest Congressional race in America&quot; and said that Chandler was burdened with &quot;considerable dissatisfaction&quot; on the part of his constituents and the difficulty of running on the ticket with Obama. But Joshua Miller of Roll Call observed that &quot;if the bent of the GOP-leaning district grows more Democratic and Democrats who sat out 2010 come to the polls next November, Barr has a steep hill to climb.&quot;

===2012===

Chandler was again challenged by Barr. Randolph S. Vance ran as a write-in candidate. Barr defeated Chandler in the election, 50.6% to 46.7%.

==Post-congressional career==
Chandler did not run for Governor in 2015, though he has hinted that he might run for office again in the future.

From 2013 to 2016, Chandler served as executive director of the Kentucky Humanities Council. From 2016 to 2024, he was CEO of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky. He is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

<doc id="596967" wikidata="Q537905" url="?curid=596967" title="Martenitsa">
<text>A Martenitsa (, ; ; ; ; ; ) is a small piece of adornment, made of white and red yarn and usually in the form of two dolls, a white male and a red female. Martenitsi are worn from Baba Marta Day (March 1) until the wearer first sees a stork, swallow, or blossoming tree (or until the end of March (April 1)). The name of the holiday means &quot;Grandma March&quot; in Bulgarian and Macedonian, the holiday and the wearing of Martenitsi are a Bulgarian tradition related to welcoming the spring, which according to Bulgarian and Macedonian folklore begins in March. 

In Albania, it is worn on the March 14 (the old first day of March in the Julian calendar) to celebrate the Summer Fest (Dita e Verës). In Albania, the Summer Fest is dedicated to the ancient Goddess Diana.

Inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 

== Symbolism ==
A typical Martenitsa consists of two small wool dolls, Pizho and Penda (). Pizho, the male doll, is usually predominantly white; Penda, the female doll, is distinguished by her skirt and is usually predominantly red.

The red and white woven threads symbolize the wish for good health. They are the heralds of the coming of spring and of new life. While white as a color symbolizes purity, red is a symbol of life and passion, and so some ethnologists have proposed that, in its very origins, the custom might have reminded people of the constant cycle of life and death, the balance of good and evil, and the sorrow and happiness in human life. The Martenitsa is also a stylized symbol of Mother Nature, the white symbolizing the purity of the melting white snow and the red setting of the sun, which becomes more and more intense as spring progresses. These two natural resources are the source of life. They are also associated with the male and female beginnings, and in their balance, with the need for balance in life.

== Tradition ==

Tradition dictates that Martenitsi are always given as gifts, not bought for oneself. They are given to loved ones, friends, and those people to whom one feels close. Beginning on the first of March, one or more are worn pinned to clothing, or around the wrist or neck, until the wearer sees a stork or swallow returning from migration, or a blossoming tree, and then removes the Martenitsa.

In Bulgarian folklore and Macedonian Slavic mythology the name &quot;Baba Marta&quot; (, &quot;Grandma March&quot;) evokes a grumpy old lady whose mood swings very rapidly. The common belief is that by wearing the red and white colors of the Martenitsa, people ask Baba Marta for mercy. They hope that it will make winter pass faster and bring spring. The first returning stork or swallow is taken as a harbinger of spring and as evidence that Baba Marta is in a good mood and is about to retire.

The ritual of finally taking off the Martenitsa is different in different parts of Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Some people tie the Martenitsa on a branch of a fruit tree, thus giving the tree health and luck, which the person wearing the Martenitsa has enjoyed themselves while wearing it. Others put it under a stone with the idea that the kind of creature (usually an insect) closest to the token the next day will determine the person&#x27;s health for the rest of the year. If the creature is a larva or a worm, the coming year will be healthy and full of success. The same luck is associated with an ant, the difference being that the person will have to work hard to reach success. If the creature nearest the token is a spider, then the person is in trouble and may not enjoy luck, health, or personal success.

Wearing one or more Martenitsi is a very popular Bulgarian and Macedonian tradition. The time during which they are worn is meant to be a joyful holiday commemorating health and long life.

Modern Martenitsi take a wider variety of forms and often incorporate colored beads and other elaboration.

== Origin ==
This tradition is an important part of the Culture of Bulgaria and there is a similar tradition in North Macedonia, as well as in Greece, Albania (known as verorja), Romania and Moldova. The tradition is related to the ancient pagan history of the Balkan Peninsula and to all agricultural cults of nature. Some specific features of the ritual, especially tying the twisted white and red woolen threads, are a result of centuries-old tradition and suggest Thracian (paleo-Balkan) or possibly Hellenic or Roman origins.

Some ethnographers claim that the custom can be traced in the Eleusinian Mysteries. The ancient equivalent of the modern Greek &quot;martis&quot; is thought to be the &quot;kroke&quot; (κρόκη). The custom is mentioned in Photios&#x27; Lexicon. It is said that the priests [μύσται] wrap a red thread [κρόκη] around their right hand and foot. At that time red or otherwise colored threads were used to protect children and youths from evil spirits and witchcraft.

An early 20th-century Bulgarian story relates the first Martenitsi to the 7th-century Battle of Ongal between the Bulgar Khan Asparuh and the Byzantines, which resulted in a decisive Bulgar victory. After the battle, the Asparuch sent doves with white threads to announce the victory to his main camp. The threads turned bloody during the flight, thus creating the first Martenitsa.

<doc id="596970" wikidata="Q848212" url="?curid=596970" title="Boscastle">
<text>Boscastle () is a village and fishing port on the north coast of Cornwall, England, in the civil parish of Forrabury and Minster (where the 2011 Census population was included) . It is south of Bude and northeast of Tintagel. The harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville and is the only significant harbour for along the coast. The village extends up the valleys of the River Valency and River Jordan. Heavy rainfall on 16 August 2004 caused extensive damage to the village.

Boscastle lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The South West Coast Path passes through the village.

==History==
Boscastle was first inhabited by the Bottreaux family around 1080, and the name of the village comes from Bottreaux Castle (pronounced &quot;Botro&quot;), a 12th-century motte-and-bailey fortress, of which few remains survive. The castle, built sometime between 1154 and 1189 by Sir William des Bottreaux, was anciently in the possession of the de Botreaux family, which became under William de Botreaux (1337–91) the Barons Botreaux. It was to the father of William 1st Baron Botreaux, also William, that Edward II granted a charter in 1312 to hold a market at Boscastle, along with a fair on the Feast of Saint James.

The antiquary, John Leland in the mid 16th century described the village ″&quot;... it is a very filthy town and il kept.&quot;″ Boscastle harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville (of &quot;Revenge&quot;). It is the only significant harbour for along the coast. Boscastle was once a small port (similar to many others on the north coast of Cornwall), importing limestone and coal, and exporting slate and other local produce.

In the early 20th century Boscastle hosted a street dance similar to the Helston Furry Dance, but it is unclear how old the tradition is or when this ceased.

Boscastle was once a centre for slate quarrying which remained a viable industry until around the turn of the 20th century. The remains of four quarries scar the cliffs between Boscastle Harbour and Trevalga.

===Churches===
The Rector of Boscastle is responsible for seven churches in the district: Forrabury (St Symphorian), Minster (St Merthiana), St Juliot, Lesnewth (St Michael and All Angels), Trevalga (St Petroc), Otterham (St Denis) and Davidstow (St David). St Juliot is of particular interest to devotees of the works of Thomas Hardy since he acted as the architect for the church&#x27;s restoration in March 1870 and this is where he met his first wife, Emma Gifford, who was the Rector&#x27;s sister-in-law. Their love affair was the inspiration for his novel &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; and, later in life, some of his poetry.

;&quot;A Seaside Parish&quot;
In 2004 British television channel BBC 2 began broadcasting &quot;A Seaside Parish&quot;, a weekly series focusing on the life of the newly appointed Rector of Boscastle, Christine Musser.

=== Tourism===
The village, with its picturesque harbour, is a popular tourist destination. Among the attractions are the Museum of Witchcraft, Uncle Paul&#x27;s Emporium, the Boscastle pottery shop, and access to the South West Coast Path.

Much of the land in and around Boscastle is owned by the National Trust, including both sides of the harbour, Forrabury Stitches, high above the Boscastle and divided into ancient &quot;stitchmeal&quot; cultivation plots, and large areas of the Valency Valley, known for its connections to Thomas Hardy.

The former harbour stables (part of the National Trust estate) are now a youth hostel run by YHA, popular with walkers. The National Trust runs a shop at the harbour, and a visitor centre in the Old Smithy.

Charles III, then Prince of Wales, visited Boscastle on 15 July 2019 to commemorate the anniversary of the Cornwall AONB and to visit a local Cornish hedge restoration project.

The Boscastle Breakdown step dance, The Boscastle &amp; Tintagel Players concertinas, cello &amp; stepping is included in the Topic Records compilation &quot;The Voice of the People&quot;.

The Wellington Inn is a 16th-century coaching inn near the harbour; its furnishings include church lamps which were donated by the architect Thomas Hardy and stained glass windows installed in 1846.

===Boscastle floods===

;Flood of 2004
A flash flood on 16 August 2004 caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses, on roofs, in cars, and on the river&#x27;s banks, and the village&#x27;s visitor centre was washed away.
Two Royal Air Force Westland Sea King rescue helicopters from Chivenor, three Royal Navy Sea Kings from Culdrose, one RAF Sea King from St Mawgan and one Coastguard S61 helicopter from Portland searched for and assisted casualties in and around the village. The operation was coordinated by the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland in the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK. A total of 91 people were rescued, with no fatalities.

The cause of the flooding was over of rainfall (typically a month&#x27;s rainfall) falling in two hours due to thunderstorms developing on a convergence line. The ground was already saturated due to the previous two weeks of above average rainfall; the drainage basin has many steep slopes, and has areas of impermeable slate causing rapid surface run-off. Boscastle is at the confluence of two rivers, Valency and Jordan; a large quantity of water all arrived within a short space of time causing the rivers to overflow; the flooding coincided with a high tide, worsening the storm&#x27;s impact.

Around 50 cars were swept into the harbour and the bridge was washed away, roads were submerged under of water, making communication effectively impossible until flood-waters subsided. The sewerage system burst, so for a range of health and safety reasons Boscastle was declared temporarily inaccessible. Homes, businesses and cars belonging to more than 1,000 people were swept away; income from tourism was lost, which affected livelihoods and the local economy; there were vast numbers of subsequent insurance claims.

;Flood of 2007
Boscastle was flooded again on 21 June 2007 although the scale of destruction was not nearly as serious as in 2004.

==Sport==
Boscastle Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1907. The club continued until the mid-1920s.

Boscastle and Crackington Pilot Gig Club formed in 2004 and row from Boscastle harbour, Port Gaverne and Upper Tamar Lake. They have three gigs; &quot;Torrent&quot; (named after the 2004 floods). &quot;Rival&quot; and &quot;Golden Gear&quot;.

Cornish wrestling prize tournaments, were held in Boscastle in the 19th century.

<doc id="596971" wikidata="Q38635392" url="?curid=596971" title="Nokomis">
<text>Nokomis is the name of Nanabozho&#x27;s grandmother in the Ojibwe traditional stories and was the name of Hiawatha&#x27;s grandmother in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, which is a re-telling of the Nanabozho stories. Nokomis is an important character in the poem, mentioned in the familiar lines:

:By the shores of Gitche Gumee,
:By the shining Big-Seawater
:Stood the wigwam of Nokomis
:Daughter of the moon Nokomis.
:Dark behind it rose the forest
:Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees
:Rose the firs with cones upon them
:Bright before it beat the water
:Beat the clear and sunny water
:Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.

According to the poem, &quot;From the full moon fell Nokomis/Fell the beautiful Nokomis&quot;. She bears a daughter, Wenonah. Despite Nokomis&#x27; warnings, Wenonah allows herself to be seduced by the West-Wind, Mudjekeewis, &quot;Till she bore a son in sorrow/Bore a son of love and sorrow/Thus was born my Hiawatha&quot;.

Abandoned by the heartless Mudjekeewis, Wenonah dies in childbirth, leaving Hiawatha to be raised by Nokomis. &quot;The wrinkled old Nokomis/Nursed the little Hiawatha&quot; and educates him.

In the Ojibwe language, &quot;nookomis&quot; means &quot;my grandmother,&quot; thus portraying Nokomis of the poem and the &quot;aadizookaan&quot; (Ojibwe traditional stories) from a more personal point of view, akin to the traditional Ojibwa narrative styles.

<doc id="596983" wikidata="Q3243975" url="?curid=596983" title="Hurricane Georges">
<text>Hurricane Georges () was a powerful and long-lived tropical cyclone which caused severe destruction as it traversed the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in September 1998, making seven landfalls along its path. Georges was the seventh tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. It became the most destructive storm of the season, the costliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and remained the costliest until Hurricane Charley in 2004, and the deadliest since Hurricane Gordon in 1994. Georges killed 615 people, mainly on the island of Hispaniola, caused extensive damage resulting in just under $10 billion (US dollars in 1998) in damages and leaving nearly 500,000 people homeless in St. Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba.

The hurricane made landfall in at least six countries (Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and the United States), more than any other hurricane since Hurricane Inez of the 1966 season. Throughout its path of destruction, it caused extreme flooding and mudslides, as well as heavy crop damage. Thousands were left homeless as a result of the storm in the Lesser Antilles, and damage in those islands totaled about US$880 million. In the Greater Antilles, hundreds of deaths were confirmed, along with over $2.4 billion in damages. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless, due to catastrophic flooding, torrential rainfall, and high storm surge. Flooding was exacerbated heavily by coastal defenses being broken from high waves. Crops were heavily damaged, and thousands of houses were destroyed due to mudslides.

Damage from Georges was extensive in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as well. In Puerto Rico, the storm was the first hurricane to pass over the island since the 1932 San Ciprián hurricane. Storm surges high were recorded, along with damage across much of the country. Roads were rendered impassible, and beaches eroded due to heavy flooding. Some areas were left isolated. Crop damage was extreme, especially to the Banana plant. A total of 96 percent of the territory&#x27;s population was left without power due to nearly half of the island&#x27;s electrical lines being downed. A little under 73,000 houses had been damaged, with just over 28,000 others being destroyed. Due to no fully developed water systems being present, 75% water and sewage services had been lost. According to contemporary reports, Hurricane Georges caused $3.6 billion in damage in Puerto Rico. In September 2017, Governor Pedro Rosselló estimated the actual damage was around $7–8 billion.

In the United States, damage was widespread across multiple states. In Florida, a high storm surge caused flooding. All of Florida Keys were left without power. In Miami, over 200,000 had no power due to winds knocking down power lines. 17 tornadoes were confirmed throughout the state. Rainfall as high as was recorded, which caused devastating flooding. Thousands of homes were damaged throughout the state. In Louisiana, impacts were mostly minor. Evacuations were well-timed and led to zero deaths in the state. Three died indirectly, however: two men collapsed and died due to stress, and a house burned down because of a candle being tipped over, killing one. In Mississippi, rainfall as high as was recorded. Homes were flooded and people were forced to evacuate days after the storm had passed. Mobile homes were damaged and/or overturned. In Alabama, high waves were recorded. Homes, apartment buildings, and businesses were damaged. 20 tornadoes touched down, with one causing over $1.5 million. rainfall accumulation was recorded. Many bridges, highways, and roads were shut down due to flooding. The only direct death in the US was recorded in the state. In Georgia, damage was minor. Rainfall accumulating to about closed several roads across multiple counties. The name &quot;Georges&quot; was retired due to extreme damage caused by the storm.

== Meteorological history ==
A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September 13. Moving westward, the large system quickly developed a closed circulation and was classified Tropical Depression Seven on September 15. A strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest, where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on September 16. Georges&#x27;s circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized Central Dense Overcast, and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone, Georges attained hurricane status late on September 17.

Conditions became nearly ideal for continued development, including warm water temperatures, low-level inflow to the hurricane&#x27;s north, and good upper-level outflow. A banding eye developed, and Georges reached major hurricane strength on September 19 while 675 mi (1085 km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. By September 19, an upper-level anticyclone was well established over Georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly, as indicated by the cooling cloud tops, increased symmetry of the deep convection, and the warming and contracting of the well-defined wide eye as rapid intensification continued, and Georges peaked as a very dangerous and a high-end Category 4 storm with wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on September 19 and early September 20. At that time, Georges was the most intense, strongest storm since Hurricane Hugo, and along with Hurricane Luis, it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the South Atlantic with hurricane-force wind fields extending more than from the north and with a more than wide tropical storm force wind field. Shortly after peaking, upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on September 20 in the afternoon, as the central pressure had risen 26 mb as Georges approached the Leeward Islands.

On September 21, after weakening considerably, Category 3 Georges made landfall directly on Antigua and three hours later in St. Kitts, though its wide tropical storm force wind field affected all the Leeward Islands. After weakening to a Category 2 hurricane over the Caribbean, upper-level shear decreased, and Georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near Fajardo, Puerto Rico as a Category 3 hurricane early in the morning. Over the mountainous terrain of the island, the hurricane weakened again, but over the Mona Passage it again re-intensified to hit eastern Dominican Republic with winds of on September 22. Like in Puerto Rico, Georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain, and after crossing the Windward Passage, it struck east of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba on September 23. Well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized, and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island Georges retained minimal hurricane status.

Hurricane Georges reached the Straits of Florida on September 24, and as it had done earlier in its lifetime, quickly restrengthened to Category 2 status on September 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear. It continued to the west-northwest and struck Key West later on September 25 with winds of . Despite moving over warmer water, Georges only managed to peak at in the Gulf of Mexico, likely due to its disrupted inner core. A mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward, forcing Georges to make its seventh and final landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi on September 28. Within 24 hours, Georges had weakened to a tropical depression, and due to weak steering currents, the storm looped over southern Mississippi, then drifted to the east. The weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the Florida Panhandle and dissipated on October 1 near the Florida/Georgia border.

== Preparations ==
=== Lesser Antilles ===
Late on September 18, a hurricane watch was issued for Saint Lucia, Anguilla, Saba, and Sint Maarten; it was extended to include the British and United States Virgin Islands on the following day. Later on September 19, a hurricane warning was put into effect for islands between Dominica and Anguilla, as well as Saint Martin, but excluding Saint Barthélemy. Early on the following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for Saint Lucia and Martinique. About six hours later, the hurricane warning issued on September 19 was extended on September 20 to include islands north and west of Dominica until Puerto Rico. Simultaneously, the tropical storm warning in effect for Saint Lucia and Martinique was discontinued. By later on September 21, the hurricane warning was canceled for all islands east of the Virgin Islands including Antigua, Barbuda, St. Barthelemy, and St. Martin. At 0300 UTC on the following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include the British and United States Virgin Islands, though six hours later, it was also discontinued.

Several hundred people on the island of Montserrat went into twelve hurricane shelters as Georges passed by with winds of .
On September 18, the National Disaster Preparedness Committee in Dominica began meetings to prepare for possible impacts from Georges. Residents began stocking up on supplies by this time. For the following two days, the island was placed under a state of high alert, as direct impact from a Category 4 hurricane was anticipated. By the following morning, most businesses had boarded up their windows and roads were quiet. Officials declared that schools would be closed on September 21 and shelters across the island were opened.

=== Greater Antilles ===
Beginning at 21:00 UTC on September 21 with a hurricane watch for Puerto Rico, the NHC and national governments in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas issued a number of tropical cyclone watches and warnings in anticipation of the hurricane. As the storm progressed across the islands, the warnings were gradually canceled, until the Government of Cuba discontinued a hurricane watch at 03:00 UTC on September 26.

In the days prior to the hurricane&#x27;s arrival, thousands of citizens in the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico prepared for the major hurricane by boarding windows and purchasing supplies. Puerto Rican governor Pedro Rosselló activated the island&#x27;s National Guard, opened 416 shelters, and enacted a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales. More than 28,000 people across the island evacuated their homes to the shelters in the northern portion of the island. Both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross deployed workers there with supplies for a potentially deadly event.

Due to initial forecasts of the hurricane brushing the northern portion of the country, the Dominican Republic was caught off guard. Instead, like in Puerto Rico, Georges traversed the entire country, and passed close to Santo Domingo. Neighboring Haiti expected the worst, opening shelters and evacuating vulnerable people from low-lying coastal areas.

Prior to making landfall, more than 200,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in eastern Cuba. In the potentially impacted area, Cuba&#x27;s revolutionary army was sent to farm lands to harvest crops that could be destroyed during the storm. Members of the Cuban government travelled door-to-door to alert everyone of the hurricane. In addition to this, President Fidel Castro spoke live on national television to explain the country&#x27;s plans to withstand the hurricane, as well as ensuring a quick recovery effort by using all of the nation&#x27;s resources.

=== United States ===
Initial forecasts of a southeastern Florida landfall forced over 1.2 million to evacuate, including much of the Florida Keys. Despite the mandatory evacuation order, 20,000 people, including over 7,000 Key West citizens, refused to leave. Some of those who remained to ride out the storm were shrimpers, whose boats were their entire livelihood. Insurance companies refused to insure some of the older shrimp boats, leading shrimpers to ride it out with all they had left. Due to lack of law enforcement, those who stayed in Key West went through red lights, double-parked, and disobeyed traffic laws. Long-time Florida Keys citizens noted the solitude of the time and enjoyed the island for how it once was, rather than the large crowds of tourists.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, Georges was forecast to attain major hurricane status and make landfall in southeastern Louisiana. Because of this, portions of the state were evacuated, including New Orleans. There, the Louisiana Superdome was, for the first time in its history, used as a refuge of last resort for those unable to evacuate New Orleans. More than 14,000 citizens rode out the storm in the facility, causing difficulties to supply necessities. The building had no problems related to the weather, though evacuees looted the building, stole furniture, and damaged property. However, the damage was much less than in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many citizens in southern Mississippi were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation. Of those in the evacuation area, 60% actually left. Most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm. Of those who left, most went to a relative&#x27;s house in their own county. Prior to making landfall, Georges&#x27;s track was very uncertain. This forced for the mandatory evacuations of Alabama&#x27;s two coastal counties, Baldwin and Mobile Counties, with a combined population of over 500,000 people. Despite the order, only 67% of the area actually left to a safer place. Most of those who remained stayed because they believed their house would be able to withstand the hurricane. The majority of those who did leave went to a relative&#x27;s house in a safer portion of the state. In the days before making landfall, only 22% of the population in recommended evacuation areas along the Florida Panhandle actually left. However, most of them were prepared to leave if the situation became worse. Those who did leave were concerned about the severity of the storm, while those who stayed felt their home was safe enough for the hurricane&#x27;s effects. Floridians who evacuated typically left for a friend or relative&#x27;s house, and only went to another area of their county. 

== Impact ==

A large and long-lasting hurricane, Hurricane Georges brought torrential rainfall and mudslides along much of its path through the Greater Antilles. In all, the hurricane caused at least $9.37 billion in damage and 615 fatalities. In the two months after Georges&#x27;s final landfall, the American Red Cross spent $104 million on relief aid through Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, making Georges the costliest disaster aid in the program&#x27;s 125-year history.

=== Leeward Islands ===

Upon moving through the Leeward Islands, Georges brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, amounting to a maximum of at St. John.

==== Antigua ====
In Antigua, strong winds caused severe property damage, mostly caused to roofs. 10–20% of houses were greatly impacted, including three schools. High winds during the passage of the hurricane downed telephone and power lines, causing loss of communication and power across much of the island. 
An unofficial wind observation from Antigua reported winds at 94 mph with gusts to 116 mph.
Between Barbuda and Antigua, Georges killed 3 people, left 3,800 homeless and resulting at $60 million damage.

==== Guadeloupe ====
The weakening hurricane spared the island as it passed to the north, causing moderate damage (houses and roofs, uprooted trees, power lines and outages, beach erosion) especially in Grande-Terre.
In Basse-Terre, minor to moderate damage was common; the worst damage was to the banana crops, 85% to 100% devastated, with a cost of 100 million francs (22 million USD). The maximal rainfall was up to in the mountainous area.

The Met office in Desirade, east of Guadeloupe had a wind and a sustained gust.
In Raizet, they experienced a wind and a maximal gust near . The minimal pressure fell to 1000–1001 mb (29.54 IHg) for several hours.

Météo France forecast 24 hours before the impact a 65 mph sustained winds with max gust in the 90–100 mph and a minimal pressure in the 985–990 mb range in the main station in Raizet, meaning the worst has been avoid.

==== St. Kitts and Nevis ====
After passing through Antigua, Georges produced strong winds of up to while passing over St. Kitts, Georges caused catastrophic damage downing power lines, telephone lines, and trees across the island. Lack of electricity resulted in damage to water facilities, as well. Georges&#x27;s high winds caused extensive property damage, damaging 80–85% of the houses on the island, and destroying 20–25% of homes. Many schools, businesses, hospitals, and government buildings lost their roofs, while the airport experienced severe damage to its main terminal and control tower, limiting flights to the daytime. St. Kitts&#x27; economy was disrupted from severe agricultural losses, including the devastation of 50% of their sugar crop. In addition, damaged hotels and piers created a long-term impact through lack of tourism—an industry the island relies on. In all, Hurricane Georges caused 5 fatalities, left 3,000 homeless, and resulted in $458 million (1998 USD) in damage on the island.

In the other part of the country, Nevis fared better. Like on St. Kitts, high winds downed power and telephone lines, damaging the water system there. 35% of homes on the island were damaged, though none were destroyed. Rainfall and debris killed several hundred livestock and seriously damaged coconut trees, amounting to $2.5 million (1998 USD) in agricultural damage. There were no casualties reported on the island, and damaged amounted to $39 million (1998 USD).

Damage in St. Kitts totaled EC$1.2 billion (US$458 million). Total damage on Nevis amounted to $39 million. The total damage from the storm was nearly twice the country&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product of US$271 million.

==== British Virgin Islands ====
No major damage was reported to public buildings in the British Virgin Islands. Some of the islands&#x27; homes had roofs blown off. The environment suffered major damage. There were many reports of eroded soil in areas where construction was in progress. Some of the soils were planted on roads in mangrove farms and in the sea, which could have potentially killed sea life. National Parks around the islands suffered minor damage except for Queen Elizabeth Park, which had many fallen trees. None of the schools in the area suffered any damage and opened again four days after Georges had passed. There were no fatalities in the islands and one minor injury was reported. There was no major damage to the islands&#x27; medical buildings. Pipe damage was found in two areas, but there was no damage to the sewage systems.
The total damage in the British Virgin Islands was valued at US$9.404 million.

=== U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico ===
==== U.S. Virgin Islands ====

As Georges moved through the northern end of the Lesser Antilles, it produced significant rainfall and strong winds over the United States Virgin Islands. Maximum rainfalls reached at the airport in St. Croix and at St. Thomas Airport. The strongest sustained winds and gusts were recorded on St. Croix as well, measuring respectively. A total of 20 homes were destroyed and 50 others sustained damage. Most of the losses were confined to agriculture and livestock. Fifty-five boats were sunk across the islands. Several power lines were downed throughout St. Croix by high winds, leaving some residences without power. However, compared to the intensity of Georges during its passage of the islands, relatively few people, 15% of the island&#x27;s customers, lost power. This was due to the improved power grid set up across the island for this type of event. Total losses on the island were estimated at $2 million (1998 USD).

In other nearby islands, Georges impact was relatively minor to moderate. Power outages, flooding, and minor to moderate structural damage was common.

==== Puerto Rico ====
Georges was the first hurricane to cross the entire island of Puerto Rico since the San Ciprian hurricane in 1932. The hurricane brought storm surge peaking at an estimated in height in Fajardo, along with tides up to above normal. The hurricane spawned two F2 tornadoes on the island, though they caused little damage. Georges dropped immense precipitation in the mountain regions, peaking at in Jayuya with many other locations reporting at least of precipitation. Hurricane-force winds were observed throughout the island. Sustained winds and gusts reached , respectively, at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba. Unofficially, a sustained wind speed of and a gust of were observed in Isabela.

The mountain flooding drained off in the island&#x27;s rivers, causing every river to overflow its banks. Near the coast, the surfeit of water carved new channels from the record discharge rate. The storm&#x27;s strong winds caused beach erosion in many places along the coastline. Eroded beaches, flooding, and debris left many roads impassable or destroyed, isolating some areas on the western portion of the island. Georges&#x27;s deluge of rainfall caused significant damage to the agricultural industry, including the loss of 75% of its coffee crop, 95% of its banana or plantain crop, and 65% of its live poultry.
Its large circulation brought fierce winds to the entire island, damaging 72,605 houses and destroying 28,005 others. This left tens of thousands homeless after the storm&#x27;s passage. Over 22,000 people were sheltered in 139 shelters in cities throughout the island. All shelters experienced power outages, and after the storm passed through, lack of water and sewer systems became a serious problem. High winds downed nearly half of the island&#x27;s electric and telephone lines, leaving 96% of the population powerless and 8.4% of telephone customers without service. Lack of electricity greatly damaged the water system, resulting in the loss of water and sewer service for 75% of the island. In the nearby small island of Culebra, Georges destroyed 74 houses and damaged 89 others, although damage estimates are not available there.

In all, Georges caused $3.6 billion in damage and there were no direct casualties due to well-executed warnings. However, Georges indirectly caused eight deaths in Puerto Rico. Two deaths occurred due to carbon monoxide poisoning from operating a gasoline-powered generator indoors,
while two other people were hospitalized for the same issue. Four other fatalities occurred after a lit candle started a house fire. Additionally, there was one death each from head trauma and electrocution in the aftermath of the hurricane.

On September 24, 2017, nineteen years after the storm, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Governor Pedro Rosselló estimated that the damage was probably between $7 and $8 billion. Repairs had been made to the roofs, crops (plantains, poultry, coffee, and sugar cane), and transportation system. The damage done by the hurricane had a serious impact on the economy, as much of the main sources of production were destroyed and many of the island&#x27;s inhabitants had been forced to move from their homes. The lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans was also forced to change, as many of their farms were left damaged beyond repair. The recovery funds were used not only for restoration, but also for staff to aid the island. FEMA brought about temporary roofing for those whose roofs were torn apart. The U.S. Army also brought about one million blocks of ice and one million gallons of water, in order to compensate the effects of the loss of 95% of power across the island. In 2019, damage from Georges was still being repaired, as there was not enough money funded to repair all of the damage caused by the hurricane. Additionally, more money is needed to regrow the crops destroyed by the storm.

=== Greater Antilles ===
==== Hispaniola ====
Though there are no recorded amounts, satellite-derived rainfall estimates show up to of rain falling in the mountainous terrain of the countries. This heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides and flooding, killing a total of 589 people across the island and leaving more than 350,000 homeless.

===== Dominican Republic =====
In the Dominican Republic, Georges brought strong winds and very heavy rains, along with a storm surge. Nearly 10 hours of continuous rainfall resulted in mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country, damaging many cities along the southern coastline, including the capital. winds downed and uprooted trees across much of the country, littering streets with debris and mud. Thousands of houses were destroyed, while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds. The entire country was without electricity during the aftermath of the storm, damaging water and communication systems. Heavy wind damage and flooding caused extensive damage to the airport in Santo Domingo, restricting usage to military and non-commercial flights.

Most impacted by Hurricane Georges was the agricultural industry. The areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the country&#x27;s main crop-growing areas, including the provinces around Santo Domingo. After a severe drought in 1997, extreme rainfall damaged around of food crops, including various types of vegetables, fruits, and roots — some of the country&#x27;s main diet food. Substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations, the country&#x27;s most important export crop, were severely damaged. The extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry, an important economy in the area. The Dominican Republic had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the losses.

Death toll reports were slow in the wake of the storm, but a total of 380 people died from Hurricane Georges and leaving more than 185,000 homeless. Damage in the Dominican Republic amounted to $1.8 billion (1998 USD).

===== Haiti =====

Upon reaching Haiti, Georges was a weakened hurricane, but it still brought heavy rainfall across the entire country. The capital city of Port-au-Prince was largely unharmed, with the exception of flooding in low-lying coastal areas, damaging the main commercial port. The rest of the country, however, experienced a significant number of mudslides due to deforestation along the mountains. These mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses, leaving 167,332 homeless. Damage was greatest along the northern coastline from Cap-Haïtien to Gonaïves due to the flooding and mudslides. On the southern coast, the head of a U.S.-based medical team, stranded for several days by flooding in the remote town of Belle Anse, anticipated a rise in malnutrition, disease, homelessness and poverty. Lack of electricity led to a total disruption of Haiti&#x27;s water supply system, causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. In all, 209 people died in Haiti.

Like in the Dominican Republic, the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage. After a severe drought in 1997, Georges&#x27;s severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly. Most of the country&#x27;s significant crop land, including Artibonite Valley, suffered total losses. Up to 80% of banana plantations were lost, while vegetable, roots, tubers, and other food crops were ruined. In addition, thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost. Total agricultural losses amounted to $179 million (1998 USD, $250 million 2009 USD). The country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious losses.

==== Cuba ====

Upon making landfall, Hurricane Georges produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of at Limonar in the province of Guantánamo. Several other locations reported over a foot (300 mm) of precipitation as well. Storm surge of was expected along the eastern coastline, along with dangerous waves on top of the surge. Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of , along with stronger gusts in squalls.

The hurricane&#x27;s heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain. This, combined with strong winds, damaged 60,475 homes, of which 3,481 were completely destroyed. In the country, 100,000 were left homeless due to Hurricane Georges. High winds downed power lines, trees, and telephone poles, leaving many in eastern Cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm. Along the coast, severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges. Though eastern Cuba was the area most affected, the central and western portion of the island, including Havana, experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts. There, strong waves broke over the seawall, and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town&#x27;s old buildings.

Like in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, the severe drought during the El Niño of 1997 exacerbated the flood&#x27;s disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country&#x27;s diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country&#x27;s important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country&#x27;s food supply.

Well-executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305 million (1998 USD, $500 million 2009 USD).

=== Bahamas ===
Though Georges was forecast to move through the Bahamas, it passed to the south of the archipelago. It brought winds to Turks and Caicos Islands and South Andros, as well as precipitation in the storm&#x27;s outer bands. Though damage was minimal, one person died in the country.

=== United States ===

Throughout the mainland areas of the United States, Georges left approximately $2.5 billion in damage. The hurricane ranked as the country&#x27;s fifth costliest hurricane at the time of its occurrence. Due to extensive preparations, only one direct death was attributed to the storm. A tornado outbreak produced 47 tornadoes–20 in Alabama, 17 in Florida, and 10 in Georgia, leaving 36 injuries and about $9 million in damage.

==== Florida ====

In the Florida Keys, Georges brought a storm surge of up to in Tavernier. The islands, some only high and wide, flooded easily. Tides reaching about above normal inundated many parts of the Overseas Highway. Strong winds downed palm trees and power lines, leaving all of the Keys without power. Georges&#x27;s waves overturned two boats in Key West, damaged 1,536 houses, and destroyed 173 homes, many of which were mobile homes. Rainfall amounted to a maximum of in Tavernier, while other locations reported lesser amounts. Damage in the Florida Keys amounted to $200 million. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving 200,000 without power in the Miami area.

Georges produced a storm surge of up to in the Florida Panhandle. Some roads were completely washed away in Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach. The storm surge and waves flattened about of dunes. Between Panama City Beach and Perdido Key, most of the beach access stairs and walkways suffered damage. As the storm moved slowly through the northern Gulf Coast, it produced torrential rainfall amounting to a maximum of in Munson, causing extensive inland flooding. Several rivers and creeks in the western Florida Panhandle reached record or near-record levels, including the Blackwater River at Baker, the Yellow River at Milligan, and the Shoal River at Crestview. Hundreds of homes along these rivers were flooded, with at least 200 homes damaged in Santa Rosa County and at least 639 homes damaged and 7 others destroyed in Escambia County. The storm left about $100 million in damage in the Florida Panhandle.

Throughout the state, the storm spawned 17 tornadoes – the largest outbreak in the state since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The strongest tornado, rated F2 on the Fujita scale, touched-down in Suwannee County near Live Oak, destroying one mobile home, seven homes, and 12 cars, while five other structures suffered damage. Several residents were tossed out of their homes. Five people were injured and damage from the tornado reached over $1 million. Overall, damage in Florida totaled at least $340 million.

==== Louisiana ====
Upon making landfall in Mississippi, Georges brought a storm surge peaking at near Pointe a la Hache, along with higher waves on top of it, though the instrument failed shortly after the observation. The storm surge caused extensive beach erosion, with nearly of sand was lost, including sand dunes, leaving boardwalks formerly situated atop the dunes suspended near the water&#x27;s surface. The storm surge also inundated the Chandeleur Islands, the first line of protection for the coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi. The long island chain was reduced to a few banks of sand in the Gulf of Mexico. Grand Gosier, the home to a flock of brown pelicans, experienced severe flooding, destroying their habitats. Located on the weaker side of the storm, rainfall totals in Louisiana were low, with a maximum amount of in Bogalusa.

Sustained winds in the state reached and gusts peaked at . High winds downed power lines, leaving 160,000 without electricity across the state. At least 50 homes located outside the levee system were flooded by the storm surge, while 85 fishing camps on the banks of Lake Pontchartrain were destroyed. Overall, impact from the hurricane was fairly minor, with damages estimated at $30.1 million, but no direct deaths due to well-executed evacuations. However, there were three indirect fatalities in the state. Two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by the stress of the evacuation; the other death occurred as the result of a house fire ignited by an emergency candle that was tipped over.

==== Mississippi ====

Upon making landfall, Hurricane Georges brought a storm surge of up to in Biloxi. Beach erosion occurred along the coastline, resulting in some property damage on beach houses. However, around Biloxi, coastal casinos and the shipyards experienced little damage from the storm. While stalling over the southern portion of the state, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to in Pascagoula. The heavy rainfall contributed to significant river overflowing, including the Tchoutacabouffa River at D&#x27;Iberville, which set a record crest of . The overflown rivers in the southern portion of the state flooded homes and forced more to evacuate just days after the hurricane came through. Along the coast of Mississippi, more than 1,000 homes were flooded. One of the worst impacted areas inland was Stone County, where 54 homes had minor damage, 26 suffered major damage, and 5 were destroyed. In addition, squall lines spawned multiple tornadoes, damaging evacuation shelters in Pascagoula and Gautier.

One location observed hurricane-force winds, with a sustained wind speed of at Keesler Air Force Base. In Harrison County, winds downed power lines, signs, and traffic lights, while damaging some roofs. Impact was similar but more severe in Jackson County, with more considerable damage to the roofs of some buildings, while a few mobile homes were damaged or overturned. Throughout the state, winds left approximately 230,000 people without power. After the storm, over 6,800 people stayed in 49 shelters. One shelter in Forrest County was damaged, forcing the citizens to another camp. Overall, Hurricane Georges caused about $676.8 million in damage, though no deaths were reported.

==== Alabama ====

Upon making landfall, storm surge heights along the coast of Alabama were estimated to have ranged from , with a peak of in Fort Morgan, along with waves on top of it. Along the coastline, heavy rainfall and strong waves caused extensive property damage. In Gulf Shores, 251 houses, 16 apartment buildings, and 70 businesses experienced significant damage. On Dauphin Island, the hurricane damaged 80 houses and left around 40 uninhabitable. Many waterfront homes on the western side of the island were pushed into other homes or strewn into pieces across the sand. Some roads were completely washed away. In Orange Beach, two condominiums were heavily damaged, one by fire and the other by high waves. Extensive storm surge flooding also occurred along Mobile Bay. With storm surge of at Mobile Bay Causeway, a number of businesses near the bridge were damaged.

Sustained winds in Alabama reached at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, while gusts peaked at at an agricultural station in Fairhope. High winds downed power lines and trees, leaving 177,000 people without power after the storm. A total of 17 shelters housed 4,977 people in the aftermath of the storm. Wind damage to the buildings was minimal. The storm spawned 20 tornadoes throughout Alabama. The most devastating tornado touched-down in Enterprise, causing severe damage to Camp Wiregrass and a few homes, while many residences in the city were left without electricity after numerous power lines were downed. Damages from the tornado amounted to roughly $1.5 million.

While moving slowly through the state, it dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at in Bay Minette. Outer squalls spawned tornadoes in the southeast portion of the state, though damage from them was minimal. Several rivers in southern Alabama crested at record or near record heights at some locations, including the Conecuh River at Brewton, Fish River, Perdido River, and Styx River. Many homes situated near the banks of these rivers were destroyed or suffered extensive damage. Flooding shut down many bridges, highways, and secondary roads in Baldwin and Escambia counties, including Interstate 10 near the Alabama–Florida state line; U.S. Route 29 and Alabama State Route 113 in Flomaton; and US 31 in Brewton and Flomaton. Overall, damage in Alabama amounted to $125 million. Freshwater flooding in Mobile resulted in one death, the only direct death in the United States.

==== Georgia ====
In Georgia, several counties reported of rainfall, causing a number of roads to become impassable and generally leaving a small amount of damage, including up to $45,000 in damage in Quitman County. In addition to the flooding, some instances of thunderstorm wind impacts also occurred. In Appling County, an intense thunderstorm related to Georges damaged 12 mobile homes and a vehicle and downed some power lines and large trees, with damage totaling about $65,000. Another intense thunderstorm in Worth County impacted several residences, knocked a mobile home off its foundation, destroyed a barn, overturned a school bus, and downed a number of trees that fell onto power lines, leaving around $350,000 in damage. Thunderstorms also toppled a tree onto a car in Macon County and ripped off the porch of a mobile home in Schley County.

Numerous tornadoes touched down across the state of Georgia in relation to Georges and its remnants. The most damaging tornado occurred in Miller County, with a strong F1 destroying a doublewide trailer, seriously injuring two occupants, and deroofing several outbuilding, twisting sheet metal, and demolishing a grain bin. Damage totaled approximately $750,000. Three tornadoes impacted Sumter County, the first of which destroyed one home and seven mobile homes in De Soto and damaged several businesses, while more homes were struck by trees felled by the twister. The second tornado demolished one home and several mobile homes. A third tornado was spawned at a pecan grove near Andersonvile, although it may have been a continuation of the previous twister.

== Aftermath ==
== Retirement ==

Due to the extensive hurricane related damage and loss of life, the name &quot;Georges&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization following this storm, and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Gaston&quot; for the 2004 season.

<text>A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron, patented by Edwin McMillan in 1952, in which the frequency of the driving RF electric field is varied to compensate for relativistic effects as the particles&#x27; velocity begins to approach the speed of light. This is in contrast to the classical cyclotron, where this frequency is constant.

There are two major differences between the synchrocyclotron and the classical cyclotron. In the synchrocyclotron, only one &quot;dee&quot; (hollow D-shaped sheet metal electrode) retains its classical shape, while the other pole is open (see patent sketch). Furthermore, the frequency of oscillating electric field in a synchrocyclotron is decreasing continuously instead of kept constant so as to maintain cyclotron resonance for relativistic velocities. One terminal of the oscillating electric potential varying periodically is applied to the dee and the other terminal is on ground potential. The protons or deuterons to be accelerated are made to move in circles of increasing radius. The acceleration of particles takes place as they enter or leave the dee. At the outer edge, the ion beam can be removed with the aid of electrostatic deflector. The first synchrocyclotron produced 195 MeV deuterons and 390 MeV α-particles.

==Differences from the classical cyclotron==
In a classical cyclotron, the angular frequency of the electric field is given by 
:formula_1,
Where formula_2 is the angular frequency of the electric field, formula_3 is the charge on the particle, formula_4 is the magnetic field, and formula_5 is the mass of the particle. This makes the assumption that the particle is classical, and does not experience relativistic phenomena such as length contraction. These effects start to become significant when formula_6, the velocity of the particle greater than formula_7. To correct for this, the relativistic mass is used instead of the rest mass; thus, a factor of formula_8 multiplies the mass, such that
:formula_9,
where
:formula_10.
This is then the angular frequency of the field applied to the particles as they are accelerated around the synchrocyclotron.

==Advantages==

The chief advantage of the synchrocyclotron is that there is no need to restrict the number of revolutions executed by the ion before its exit. As such, the potential difference supplied between the dees can be much smaller.

The smaller potential difference needed across the gap has the following uses:

#There is no need for a narrow gap between the dees as in the case of conventional cyclotron, because strong electric fields for producing large acceleration are not required. Thus only one dee can be used instead of two, the other end of the oscillating voltage supply being connected to earth.
#The magnetic pole pieces can be brought closer, thus making it possible to increase greatly the magnetic flux density.
#The frequency valve oscillator is able to function with much greater efficiency.

==Disadvantages==
The main drawback of this device is that, as a result of the variation in the frequency of the oscillating voltage supply, only a very small fraction of the ions leaving the source are captured in phase-stable orbits of maximum radius and energy with the result that the output beam current has a low duty cycle, and the average beam current is only a small fraction of the instantaneous beam current. Thus the machine produces high energy ions, though with comparatively low intensity.

The next development step of the cyclotron concept, the isochronous cyclotron, maintains a constant RF driving frequency and compensates for relativistic effects by increasing the magnetic field with radius. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons. As a result, isochronous cyclotrons became more popular in the research field.

==History==

In 1945, Robert Lyster Thornton at Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory led the construction of the 730 MeV cyclotron. In 1946, he oversaw the conversion of the cyclotron to the new design made by McMillan which would become the first synchrocyclotron with could produce 195 MeV deuterons and 390 MeV α-particles.

After the first synchrocyclotron was operational, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded two synchrocyclotron construction initiatives. The first funding was in 1946 for Carnegie Institute of Technology to build a 435-MeV synchrocyclotron led by Edward Creutz and to start its nuclear physics research program. The second initiative was in 1947 for University of Chicago to build a 450-MeV synchrocyclotron under the direction of Enrico Fermi.

In 1948, University of Rochester completed the construction of its 240-MeV synchrocyclotron, followed by a completion of 380-MeV synchrocyclotron at Columbia University in 1950.

In 1950 the 435-MeV synchrocyclotron at Carnegie Institute of Technology was operational, followed by 450-MeV synchrocyclotron of University of Chicago in 1951.

The construction of the 400-Mev synchrocyclotron at the University of Liverpool was completed in 1952 and by April 1954 it was operational. The Liverpool synchrocyclotron first demonstrated the extraction of a particle beam from such a machine, removing the constraint of having to fit experiments inside the synchrocyclotron.

At a UNESCO meeting in Paris in December 1951, there was a discussion on finding a solution to have a medium-energy accelerator for the soon-to-be-formed European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The synchrocyclotron was proposed as a solution to bridge the gap before the 28-GeV Proton Synchrotron was completed. In 1952, Cornelis Bakker led the group to design and construct the synchrocyclotron named Synchro-Cyclotron (SC) at CERN. The design of the Synchro-Cyclotron with in circumference started in 1953. The construction started in 1954 and it achieved 600 MeV proton acceleration in August 1957, with the experimental program started in April 1958.

==Current developments==

Synchrocyclotrons are attractive for use in proton therapy because of the ability to make compact systems using high magnetic fields. Medical physics companies Ion Beam Applications and Mevion Medical Systems have developed superconducting synchrocyclotrons that can fit comfortably into hospitals.

<text>Yegor Timurovich Gaidar (; ; 19 March 1956 – 16 December 2009) was a Soviet and Russian economist, politician, and author, and was the Acting Prime Minister of Russia from 15 June 1992 to 14 December 1992.

He was the architect of the controversial shock therapy reforms administered in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which brought him both praise and harsh criticism. He participated in the preparation of the Belovezha Accords. Many Russians held him responsible for the economic hardships that plagued the country in the 1990s that resulted in mass poverty and hyperinflation among other things, although liberals praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse. Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University&#x27;s Earth Institute, who advised the Russian government in the early 1990s, called Gaidar &quot;the intellectual leader of many of Russia&#x27;s political and economic reforms&quot; and &quot;one of the few pivotal actors&quot; of the period.

Gaidar died of pulmonary edema, provoked by myocardial ischemia on 16 December 2009.

==Personal life==
Gaidar was born in 1956 in Moscow, RSFSR, Soviet Union, the son of Ariadna Bazhova and &quot;Pravda&quot; military correspondent Timur Gaidar, who fought in the Bay of Pigs Invasion and was a friend of Raúl Castro. His paternal grandfather was Soviet writer Arkady Gaidar and his maternal grandfather was writer Pavel Bazhov. Despite the Turkic-sounding surname, Gaidar was Russian; his grandfather, originally called &quot;Golikov&quot;, adopted the name &quot;Gaidar&quot; from the Khakas language as a &quot;nom-de-plume&quot;.
Gaidar married the daughter of writer Arkady Strugatsky during his time at the university. His daughter, Maria Gaidar, was one of the leaders of the Russian democratic opposition. From July 2009 until June 2011 she was Deputy Chair of the Government of Kirov oblast. In 2015 and 2016 she was vice-governor of Odesa Oblast in Ukraine.

==Career==
Gaidar graduated with honors from the Moscow State University, Faculty of Economics, in 1978 and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes. A long-time member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and an editor of the CPSU ideological journal &quot;Communist&quot; during the perestroika, he joined Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s camp during Perestroika. In 1991 he quit the Communist Party and was promoted to Yeltsin&#x27;s government.

While in government, Gaidar advocated free market economic reforms according to the principle of shock therapy. His best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state, which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a market economy in Russia. He also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies, and reduced the budget deficit. Gaidar was the First Vice-Premier of the Russian Government and Minister of Economics from 1991 until 1992, and Minister of Finance from February 1992 until April 1992.

He was appointed Acting Prime Minister under President Boris Yeltsin in 1992 from 15 June until 14 December, when the anti-Yeltsin Russian Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies refused to confirm Gaidar in this position and Viktor Chernomyrdin was eventually chosen as a compromise figure. Gaidar continued to advise the new government. On 18 September 1993, he was again appointed the First Vice-Premier under Chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition. He played an active role in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993.

On 3 October, he famously spoke live on Russian television, then broadcasting from an emergency station near Moscow, as there was fighting going on in the Ostankino complex, calling on Muscovites to gather to defend Yeltsin&#x27;s government so that Russia would not be &quot;turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades&quot;.

In the 1993 Duma elections, in the aftermath of the crisis, Gaidar led the pro-government bloc Russia&#x27;s Choice and was seen by some as a possible future Prime Minister. However, due to the bloc&#x27;s failure to win the plurality of votes in the election, Gaidar&#x27;s role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on 20 January 1994.

During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia Yegor Gaidar, Boris Nemtsov and Boris Fyodorov were in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a mediation mission.

===Reforms controversy===

Gaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in 1992 with little care for their social impact; however, the country back then was in a desperate state of economy and was on the brink of a famine. Russia had no currency for buying import goods, at the same time, no-one gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt. The collapse of the Soviet social system led to serious deterioration in living standards. Millions of Russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive hyperinflation. Moreover, the privatization and break-up of state assets left over from the Soviet Union, which he played a big part in, led to much of the country&#x27;s wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives, later known as the Russian oligarchs, for much less than what they were worth. The voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, these oligarchs were dubbed &quot;kleptocrats.&quot; As society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms, Gaidar was often held by Russians as one of the men most responsible. On the other hand, the ubiquitous goods deficit of the Soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the shops. Per capita calorie consumption under Gaidar diminished by 3.5% from 2526.88 kCal to 2438.17 kCal.

According to Franklin Foer writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, however, &quot;when Yegor Gaidar ... asked the United States for help hunting down the billions that the KGB had carted away, the White House refused.&quot;

One of Gaidar&#x27;s most outspoken critics was the Yabloko economist and MP Grigory Yavlinsky, who had proposed since 1990 a 500 Days programme for the transition of the whole USSR to market economic, which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of Nikolai Ryzhkov. Yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and Gaidar&#x27;s reforms program, such as the sequencing of privatization vs. liberalization of prices and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union.

Gaidar&#x27;s supporters contend that although many mistakes were made, he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation. According to the BBC&#x27;s Andrei Ostalski, &quot;There were only two solutions—either introduce martial law and severe rationing, or radically liberalize the economy. The first option meant going all the way back to the Stalinist system of mass repression. The second meant a colossal change, a journey—or, rather, a race—through uncharted waters with an unpredictable outcome.&quot;

=== Poisoning case ===
In November 2006 Gaidar went to Dublin, Ireland, to present his book &quot;Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia&quot; at an academic conference. Shortly after breakfast, a fruit salad and a cup of tea, Gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel. He was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech, which Gaidar later recalled as a call that saved his life, as he would surely have died if he had been in his room unattended. After Gaidar had tried to deliver his speech he collapsed in the university hallway and was rushed to a local hospital. His colleague Ekaterina Genieva recalled that &quot;He was lying on the floor unconscious. There was blood coming from his nose; he was vomiting blood. This went on for more than half an hour&quot;. Next day he moved from the hospital to the Russian embassy&#x27;s premises and arranged a transfer to Moscow where doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looked like he was &#x27;poisoned&#x27;.

In an interview published in the Financial Times, Gaidar claimed that it had been an attempted political murder, where &quot;most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the Russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event, those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between Russia and the west&quot;.

Anatoly Chubais, another Russian reformist official and a former colleague of Gaidar, rejected the possibility of Kremlin involvement in this case, commenting that &quot;Yegor Gaidar was on the verge of death on 24 November. The deadly triangle – Politkovskaya, Litvinenko and Gaidar – would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and forceful change of power in Russia.&quot;

Irish police opened an official investigation of the case. One of the versions voiced by the Russian opposition leaders and Kremlin supporters suggested that Boris Berezovsky, then a Russian oligarch in exile, may have been behind it. Andrey Illarionov, a former Putin adviser now living in the US, commented that the whole case was staged, and the reason for taking Gaidar to hospital must have been hyperthensia, stress or alcohol. Though Gaidar knew Berezovsky well, that fact is described in the book &quot;The age of Berezovsky&quot;, written by Petr Aven.

==Death==
Gaidar died at the age of 53 in Odintsovo raion, Moscow Oblast, Russia. Gaidar&#x27;s aide Valery Natarov stated that Gaidar died unexpectedly, early on 16 December 2009, at his Moscow Oblast home while he was working on a book for children.
Gaidar died of pulmonary edema, provoked by myocardial ischemia.
He is survived by his wife, three sons and daughter.

Gaidar was regarded as an object of loathing among ordinary Russians who lost everything during the shock therapy economic reforms.

Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and convicted fraudster Platon Lebedev expressed their condolences and stated that &quot;He laid the foundation of our economy&quot;.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has expressed condolences to relatives and friends of Yegor Gaidar. &quot;The death of Gaidar is a heavy loss for Russia,&quot; says Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Medvedev called Gaidar a &quot;daring, honest and decisive&quot; economist who &quot;evoked respect among his supporters and opponents&quot;. &quot;We have lost a genuine citizen and patriot, a strong spirited person, a talented scientist, writer and expert... He didn&#x27;t dodge responsibility and &#x27;took the punch&#x27; in the most challenging situations with honor and courage,&quot; the statement said.

The White House offered condolences over Gaidar&#x27;s death. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said that, although controversial, Gaidar&#x27;s legacy formed the foundation of a dynamic market-based economy.

===Gaidar forum===
In honor of Yegor Gaidar, each year in mid-January the Russian Presidency holds the Gaidar forum that attracts the Russian political and business elite, with top European politicians also attending. The forum is organized the week before the World Economic Forum in Davos and thus also serves to formulate the Russian positions on a variety of topics.

<doc id="596998" wikidata="Q845073" url="?curid=596998" title="Open front unrounded vowel">
<text>The open front unrounded vowel, or low front unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. It is one of the eight primary cardinal vowels, not directly intended to correspond to a vowel sound of a specific language but rather to serve as a fundamental reference point in a phonetic measuring system.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) that represents this sound is , a double-story lowercase a. In the IPA vowel chart it is positioned at the lower-left corner. However, the accuracy of the quadrilateral vowel chart is disputed, and the sound has been analyzed acoustically as extra-open at a position where the front/back distinction has lost its significance. There are also differing interpretations of the exact quality of the vowel: the classic sound recording of by Daniel Jones is slightly more front but not quite as open as that by John Wells.

In practice, the symbol is often used to represent an open &quot;central&quot; unrounded vowel. This is the usual practice, for example, in the historical study of the English language. The loss of separate symbols for open and near-open front vowels is usually considered unproblematic, because the perceptual difference between the two is quite small, and very few languages contrast the two. If there is a need to specify the backness of the vowel as fully front one can use the symbol , which denotes a lowered near-open front unrounded vowel, or with the IPA &quot;advanced&quot; diacritic.

==Features==

 This subsumes central open (central low) vowels because the tongue does not have as much flexibility in positioning as it does in the mid and close (high) vowels; the difference between an open front vowel and an open back vowel is similar to the difference between a close front and a close central vowel, or a close central and a close back vowel.
==Occurrence==
Many languages have some form of an unrounded open vowel. For languages that have only a single open vowel, the symbol for this vowel may be used because it is the only open vowel whose symbol is part of the basic Latin alphabet. Whenever marked as such, the vowel is closer to a central than to a front . However, there may not actually be much of a difference. (See Vowel#Acoustics.)

<text>The [[vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] (formally known as The Right Worshipful the Vice-Chancellor) is the main administrative and academic officer of the university, and is elected by the Regent House for a term of up to seven years. Since July 2023, the vice-chancellor has been Deborah Prentice.

Prior to 1992, the position was part-time, the post-holder having other college and faculty duties. In fact, between 1587 and 1992 all holders were concurrently Masters of one of the university&#x27;s colleges. Until the late nineteenth century, the term was generally one year, though this was extended to two years until the post became full-time in 1992.

Since 2003, the vice-chancellor has been assisted by five pro-vice-chancellors. For the year 2007–08, Alison Richard was paid &quot;£227,000 in salary and perks.&quot; In 2017–18, Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope earned a basic salary of £431,000, a significant increase from his predecessor&#x27;s salary of £343,000.

<doc id="597013" wikidata="Q7067480" url="?curid=597013" title="Noël Coward Theatre">
<text>The Noël Coward Theatre, formerly known as the Albery Theatre, is a West End theatre in St. Martin&#x27;s Lane in the City of Westminster, London. It opened on 12 March 1903 as the New Theatre and was built by Sir Charles Wyndham behind Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by the architect W. G. R. Sprague with an exterior in the classical style and an interior in the Rococo style.

In 1973, it was renamed the Albery Theatre in tribute to Sir Bronson Albery who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in 2006 and was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre when it re-opened on 1 June 2006. The building is a Grade II Listed structure.

==History==
===Early years, 1903–1919===
The New was the second of the three theatres in St Martin&#x27;s Lane. The Trafalgar Square (now the Duke of York&#x27;s) opened in 1892 and the London Coliseum in 1904. The actor-manager Charles Wyndham, who had been based at the Criterion Theatre for more than twenty years, moved in 1899 to the larger Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre which he commissioned in Charing Cross Road. To build Wyndham&#x27;s, he had been obliged to buy a larger parcel of land than he required, and in 1901 he was in negotiations to sell the area he did not need. When negotiations fell through, he decided to build another theatre on the vacant site. This plot fronting on St Martin&#x27;s Lane is bounded on one side by St Martin&#x27;s Court, which also runs behind the theatre. While the theatre was in planning and then under construction it was referred to simply as &quot;the new theatre&quot;, and the name stuck. The street adjacent to it is called New Row.

The theatre, like Wyndham&#x27;s, was designed by the architect W.G.R. Sprague, and was the thirtieth theatre he designed. A contemporary report described the front elevation as &quot;of the free classic order … at once dignified and effective&quot;. As at Wyndhams, the auditorium is constructed on the cantilever principle, rendering columns unnecessary and ensuring unimpeded views. The internal decoration was based on French designs from the 18th century. Over the Proscenium there is a gilt trophy emblematic of peace and music.

The New Theatre opened on 12 March 1903 with a brief season consisting of a revival of &quot;Rosemary&quot; – a play by Louis N. Parker and Murray Carson, starring Wyndham and his partner (later wife) Mary Moore – and a special matinée of Wyndham&#x27;s best-known production, &quot;David Garrick&quot;. The following month Johnston Forbes-Robertson transferred his production of &quot;The Light that Failed&quot; from the Lyric, after which there were seasons featuring Mrs Patrick Campbell and then Cyril Maude. Fred Terry and Julia Neilson played an annual season of about six months at the New from 1905 to 1913, including many revivals of their great success, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Between these seasons, productions at the New Theatre included &quot;Amasis&quot;, a comic opera by Frederick Fenn and Philip Michael Faraday (1906), with Ruth Vincent, and &quot;Count Hannibal&quot; (1910). In 1911, Terry presented &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to introduce his daughter Phyllis to the stage. Between then and the First World War, the theatre featured comedies and musical comedies.

Dion Boucicault Jr., became manager in December 1915 and opened with a revival of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, revived each Christmas season until 1919. He produced a series of successes including new plays by Somerset Maugham, J. M. Barrie, Arthur Wing Pinero and A.A. Milne. Leon M. Lion presented a season in 1918–19 in which Katharine Cornell made her only appearance on the London stage, playing Jo in a dramatisation of &quot;Little Women&quot;.

===1920s===
&quot;I&#x27;ll Leave It to You&quot;, in 1920, was Noël Coward&#x27;s first staged play, and ran at the New for 37 performances. Matheson Lang was associated with the New for several years, presenting and playing in Shakespeare and modern dramas. The London premiere of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;St. Joan&quot; starring Sybil Thorndike followed in 1924.

In July 1925, Robert Atkins took over management of the New, presenting Israel Zangwill&#x27;s &quot;We Moderns&quot;. The following year and for most of 1927 the New was home to a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;, which ran for 587 performances, starring first Coward and then the young John Gielgud as Lewis Dodd. Towards the end of the decade, two comedies by P. G. Wodehouse and Ian Hay – &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1928), and &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (1929) ran for 234 and 115 performances respectively.

===1930s===
In February 1933, Gielgud began a period of management at the theatre. He produced and starred in Gordon Daviot&#x27;s, &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot;, which ran for 472 performances. He followed this in June 1934 with the same author&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Scots&quot; starring Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, which ran for 106 performances. In November 1934, he presented &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which ran for 155 performances. After works by Hugh Walpole and Andre Obey, Gielgud presented a revival of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; which had the longest run on record for that play: 186 performances. Peggy Ashcroft played Juliet and Edith Evans was the Nurse; Laurence Olivier played Romeo, and Gielgud Mercutio for the first part of the run and then exchanged roles. Gielgud concluded with Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;, directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky, a production that, according to &quot;The Times&quot; showed the play as &quot;among the supreme masterpieces of the theatre&quot;. After Gielgud&#x27;s tenure, there was more Shakespeare at the New: &quot;As You Like&quot; with Edith Evans and Michael Redgrave; &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; with Evans and Leslie Banks; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Olivier and Judith Anderson (all 1937).

===1940s===
During the Second World War, The Old Vic was badly damaged by German bombs, and Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre was requisitioned as a refuge for those made homeless by air-raids. The drama company of the former and the opera and ballet companies of the latter toured nationally throughout the war, and Bronson Albery, stepson of Charles Wyndham through Mary Moore, managing director of the New Theatre, made it available to all three companies as a London base, although in practice the Old Vic company occupied the theatre more than the Sadler&#x27;s Wells companies. The theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson single out productions of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, &quot;King John&quot;. &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (with Robert Helpmann in the title role). In 1944, with the end of the war in sight, a reconstituted Old Vic company took possession of the New, starring Ralph Richardson, Olivier and Thorndike. The repertory that year comprised Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; and Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Between Old Vic seasons, Robert Morley and Wendy Hiller starred in a Regency drama, &quot;The First Gentleman&quot;, which ran for 654 performances. The 1945 Old Vic company season added &quot;Henry IV, Parts I and II&quot; and a celebrated double bill of &quot;Oedipus&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;. In September 1946, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; were staged. Under a different management, Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Gioconda Smile&quot; was a success in 1948–49, running for 655 performances.

===1950s and 1960s===
In 1950, &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; by T.S. Eliot began a run of 325 performances. From later in the decade, Mander and Mitchenson single out Vivian Ellis&#x27;s musical version of J. B. Fagan&#x27;s &quot;And So to Bed&quot; (1951, 323 performances); &quot;The Young Elizabeth&quot; (1952, 498 performances); Katharine Hepburn in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1952); Yvonne Arnaud in &quot;Dear Charles&quot; (1952, 466 performances); Dorothy Tutin in &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1954, 343 performances); a comedy about bigamy, &quot;The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker&quot; (1955, 421 performances); Leslie Caron in Colette&#x27;s &quot;Gigi&quot; (1956); &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1956, 250 performances); &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; (1957); Charles Laughton in &quot;The Party&quot; (1958); &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1959); Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; (1959); and the Theatre Royal Stratford East&#x27;s &quot;Make Me an Offer&quot; (1959).

In June 1960, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, the Lionel Bart musical based on &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, was first produced, and ran until September 1966, a total of 2,618 performances. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that its run had broken the previous West End records – &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (2,282) and &quot;Salad Days&quot; (2,283). The last years of the decade brought shorter runs to the New. They included &quot;Jorrocks&quot;, a musical (1967, 181 performances); Gwen Watford and Gemma Jones in &quot;Howards End&quot; (1967, 137); Roy Dotrice playing multiple roles in the comedy &quot;World War 2&quot; (1967, 166); the Prospect Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Couple&quot;; &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot;; Paul Scofield in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Hotel in Amsterdam&quot;; the controversial &quot;Soldiers&quot; by Rolf Hochhuth in December 1968, and in April 1969 &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, a new musical with Polly James in the lead.

===1970s onward===

A 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;London Assurance&quot;, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Donald Sinden as Sir Harcourt Courtly, Roger Rees as Charles, Judi Dench as Grace and Dinsdale Landen as Dazzle, transferred to the New Theatre in 1972 for a year, prior to its 1974 run in New York. (Sinden received the 1975 Drama Desk Special Award for the Broadway run.) A revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot; ran from 1977 to 1980

In 1981, &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; won the Olivier Awards (then known as the Society of West End Theatre Awards) for Best New Play and for actors Trevor Eve and Elizabeth Quinn. 

Among some of the 1990s productions was the 1994 revival of Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; starring Helen Mirren and John Hurt.
In the 2000s the theatre played host to several Shakespeare productions including a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; set in India with an entirely Asian cast. The production played to packed houses and only closed as the Royal Shakespeare Company themselves had exclusive rights to perform their annual London season of Tragedies there. Between December 2004 and April 2005, they presented &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and a brand new production of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Hecuba&quot; starring Vanessa Redgrave.
On 8 June 2005, Dion Boucicault&#x27;s Victorian melodrama &quot;The Shaughraun&quot; opened; however, its success at the Dublin Gate Theatre was not repeated in London and it closed on 30 July. A dark period of around three months followed before the theatre was transferred to the ownership of Delfont Mackintosh Limited and reopened in October 2005 with The Right Size&#x27;s new production &quot;Ducktastic!&quot;. Once again this failed to live up to expectations and closed just three weeks after opening on 19 November 2005. A short Christmas season of Patrick Stewart&#x27;s one-man version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; played from 6 to 31 December 2005, before the theatre hosted the Edinburgh International Festival hit drama &quot;Blackbird&quot; starring Roger Allam. The award-winning play Enron (directed by Rupert Goold, starring Samuel West and Tim Pigott-Smith) transferred here after a sellout run at the Royal Court. The European premiere of the Broadway hit, &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, started previewing on 2 June 2006 and had its opening night on 28 June 2006, finally closing on 28 March 2009 prior to transferring to the Gielgud Theatre.
Following a production of &quot;Deathtrap&quot;, directed by Matthew Warchus and starring Simon Russell Beale and Jonathan Groff, the theatre became the home of jukebox musical &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot; in February 2011.

<text>The open back unrounded vowel, or low back unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The letter is called &quot;script a&quot; because it lacks the extra hook on top of a printed letter &quot;a&quot;, which corresponds to a different vowel, the open front unrounded vowel. &quot;Script a&quot;, which has a full length linear stroke on its right, should not be confused with &quot;turned script a&quot;, , which has the linear stroke on its left and corresponds to a rounded version of this vowel, the open back rounded vowel.

In some languages (such as Azerbaijani, Estonian, Luxembourgish and Toda) there is the near-open back unrounded vowel (a sound between cardinal and ), which can be transcribed in IPA with or .

<text>James Colledge Pope, (June 11, 1826 – May 8, 1885) was a land proprietor and politician on Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. He served as premier of the colony from 1865 to 1867, and from 1870 to 1873. He was premier of PEI in 1873 when the island joined Canadian confederation.

He was born in Bedeque, Prince Edward Island, the son of Joseph Pope and Lucy Colledge. Pope was a successful businessman who was at one point the island&#x27;s third largest shipowner. He entered PEI politics in 1857 when the island was still a colony of the United Kingdom. He was a member of the Conservative Party, and defended the rights of landowners against growing demands by tenant farmers for land reform.

Pope was named to the Executive Council in 1859, joining the Conservative government of Edward Palmer. In 1865, he became Premier after a dispute over Canadian confederation resulted in Palmer and John Hamilton Gray resigning from the Executive Council. While not hostile to confederation, Pope did not agree with the terms set by the Quebec Conference. A particular problem was the unresolved land question, which pitted the demands of tenant farmers for land reform against demands by landlords for compensation. The question had led to violence, and, in 1865, Pope used soldiers to put down disturbances led by the Tenant League. The next year, his government negotiated the purchase of the large Cunard estate, which composed 15% of the island&#x27;s land mass, in order to redistribute the land to over 1,000 tenants. The colony lacked the funds to purchase all the island&#x27;s proprietary estates.

Pope was in Britain during the London Conference (on the question of Confederation) of 1867, and persuaded delegates to agree to $800,000 being allocated by the federal treasury to buy proprietary lands on PEI so that they could be distributed to tenants. This was seen as bribery on the island, however, and divided the Tories, leading to their defeat in the 1867 election at the hands of the Liberals, who were more hostile to confederation. The Tories were also hurt by their reputation as being pro-landlord: the Tenant League campaigned to defeat the Pope government.

Pope returned to the premiership in 1870 leading a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberals. The question of school funding and the role of separate schools divided the province and both political parties, and caused the fall of Robert Poore Haythorne&#x27;s Liberal government. Pope was able to form a coalition between his Tories and dissident Liberals by promising not to act on the question of schools, or confederation, before an election. The new government instead moved to commence the construction of a railway on the island in 1871. The railway proved to be a severe economic burden that almost bankrupted the island. The government lost a by-election on the railway issue, and Pope, as a result, lost his governing majority in the House of Assembly, and was forced to resign in 1872.

The financial crisis caused by the railway, and the ability of the Canadian government to bail the island out, was a major factor in the colony finally agreeing to seek to join Canadian confederation. The Liberal government of Robert Poore Haythorne sent a delegation to Ottawa, Ontario in February 1873 seeking terms to admission to Canada. Ottawa agreed to take over the railway, provide funds to settle the land question, assume the colony&#x27;s debts and give the new province an annual subsidy. The Liberals called an election on the proposal. Pope&#x27;s Tories argued that the terms were not good enough, and that, if elected, his government would obtain more favourable conditions. Pope&#x27;s party won 20 out of 30 seats in the April election, and he proceeded to Ottawa where he persuaded the Canadian government to increase the promised annual subsidy to PEI by a further $25,000.

PEI entered confederation on July 1, 1873. Pope&#x27;s third stint as Premier ended in September 1873 when he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He did not run in the 1874 federal election, however, and returned to the province&#x27;s House of Assembly in 1875, although he did not return to government. In 1876, he lost his seat in the provincial election which was fought on the issue of school funding and particularly separate schools. Pope&#x27;s position was considered too moderate for voters who supported a secular system. The next year, he returned to the House of Commons and served as Minister of Marine and Fisheries from 1878 to 1882 in the Conservative government of Sir John A. Macdonald.

<doc id="597027" wikidata="Q2275938" url="?curid=597027" title="Duke of York's Theatre">
<text>The Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre is a West End theatre in St Martin&#x27;s Lane, in the City of Westminster, London. It was built for Frank Wyatt and his wife, Violet Melnotte, who retained ownership of the theatre until her death in 1935. Designed by the architect Walter Emden, it opened on 10 September 1892 as the Trafalgar Square Theatre, and was renamed Trafalgar Theatre in 1894. The following year, it became the Duke of York&#x27;s to honour the future King George V.

The theatre&#x27;s opening show was comic opera &quot;The Wedding Eve&quot; by Frédéric Toulmouche. One of the earliest musical comedies, &quot;Go-Bang&quot;, was a success at the theatre in 1894. In 1900, Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Miss Hobbs&quot; was staged as well as David Belasco&#x27;s &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which was seen by Puccini, who later turned it into the famous opera. This was also the theatre where J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; debuted on 27 December 1904. Many famous British actors have appeared here, including Basil Rathbone, who played Alfred de Musset in &quot;Madame Sand&quot; in June 1920, returning in November 1932 as the Unknown Gentleman in &quot;Tonight or Never&quot;.

The theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in September 1960. In the late 1970s the freehold of the theatre was purchased by Capital Radio and it closed in 1979 for refurbishment. It reopened in February 1980 and the first production under the patronage of Capital was &quot;Rose&quot;, starring Glenda Jackson. In 1991 comedian Pat Condell performed sketches at the theatre which were later released on DVD.

ATG Entertainment bought the theatre in 1992; this coincided with the successful Royal Court production of Ariel Dorfman&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;. A host of successes followed including the 21st anniversary performance of Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and the Royal Court Classics Season in 1995.

The theatre houses the producing offices of ATG Entertainment&#x27;s subsidiary Sonia Friedman Productions, whose revival of &quot;In Celebration&quot; starring Orlando Bloom played until 15 September 2007.

Singers Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man and Pink filmed their 2021 video for &quot;Anywhere Away From Here&quot; in the theatre.

<text>Masa or masa de maíz (; ) is a dough made from ground nixtamalized maize. It is used for making corn tortillas, &quot;gorditas&quot;, &quot;tamales&quot;, &quot;pupusas&quot;, and many other Latin American dishes.

It is dried and powdered into a flour form called harina de maíz or masa harina. Masa is reconstituted by mixing with water before using it in cooking. In Spanish, &quot;masa harina&quot; translates simply to &#x27;dough flour&#x27;, and can refer to many other types of dough.

==Preparation==
Field corn grain is dried and then treated by cooking the mature, hard grain in a diluted solution of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or wood ash, and then letting it soak for many hours. The soaked maize is then rinsed thoroughly to remove the unpalatable flavor of the alkali. This process is nixtamalization, and it produces hominy, which is ground into a relatively dry dough to create fresh masa. The fresh masa can be sold or used directly, or can be dehydrated and blended into a powder to create masa harina, or masa flour.

Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the corn. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the corn proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains.

The chemical changes in masa allow dough formation, and also allow the nutrient niacin to be absorbed by the digestive tract. By contrast, untreated cornmeal is unable to form a dough on the addition of water, and a diet heavily reliant on its consumption is a risk factor for pellagra.

==Other uses==
The ground product can be called &quot;masa nixtamalera&quot;. In Central American and Mexican cuisine, &quot;masa nixtamalera&quot; is cooked with water and milk to make a thick, gruel-like beverage called &quot;atole&quot;. When made with chocolate and sugar, it becomes &quot;atole de chocolate&quot;. Adding anise and &quot;piloncillo&quot; to this mixture creates &quot;champurrado&quot;, a popular breakfast drink.

<text>The Ambassadors Theatre (known as the New Ambassadors Theatre from 1999 to 2007) is a West End theatre located on West Street, next to St Martin&#x27;s Theatre and opposite The Ivy, in the City of Westminster. Opened in 1913, it is one of the smallest of West End theatres, seating just over four hundred people.

==Building==
Previous applications to build a new theatre on the site of the Ambassadors had been rejected due to the narrowness of the surrounding streets. In 1912 architect W G R Sprague was granted permission for his &quot;comparatively small theatre&quot; (506 seated, 40 standing) on the condition that the adjacent Tower Court was widened to twenty feet. The theatre was designed by Sprague with a Classical style exterior and Louis XVI style interiors, and built by Kingerlee and Sons of Oxford; its intended height had to be lowered due to a neighbouring building&#x27;s &quot;ancient lights,&quot; resulting in the stalls being situated below ground level.

The Ambassadors was conceived as one of a pair of theatres with its eventual neighbour St. Martin’s, but although the former was completed by June 1913, construction of the latter was delayed by the outbreak of war.

The theatre was awarded the status of a Grade II Listed Building by English Heritage in March 1973.

==Management==
At its opening in June 1913, the Ambassadors was leased by Durrant Swan and managed by John Herbert Jay. A year later, Charles B. Cochran took on the lease and, seeking to offer the public a distraction from the war, introduced to London a series of successful &quot;intimate&quot; revues inspired by those in Paris.

In 1996 the theatre was bought by the Ambassador Theatre Group. The auditorium was divided into two smaller spaces by the creation of a temporary floor at circle level, to accommodate a residency by the Royal Court Theatre during the reconstruction of their venue. In 1999 the residency ended and the theatre was returned to its original design, renamed the New Ambassadors Theatre.

In 2007 the theatre was acquired by Stephen Waley-Cohen, who reinstated its original name and began an extensive programme of refurbishments. In 2014, it was reported that Delfont Mackintosh Theatres had bought the theatre and planned to rename it after Stephen Sondheim. The purchase did not complete, and in 2018 the theatre was reacquired by ATG for £12 million.

== Productions ==
Vivien Leigh made her West End debut in the Ambassadors, starring in &quot;The Mask of Virtue&quot; (1935); this was the play in which Laurence Olivier first saw her perform.

The theatre&#x27;s most famous production is Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, which showed from 1952 to 1974 before moving next door to St. Martin&#x27;s Theatre, where it is still running.

After its purchase by the Ambassador Theatre Group under producer Sonia Friedman, productions included &quot;Some Explicit Polaroids&quot; by Mark Ravenhill, &quot;Spoonface Steinberg&quot; by Lee Hall, &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; by Samuel Beckett and starring John Hurt, and was the West End&#x27;s first home of Marie Jones&#x27; &quot;Stones in His Pockets&quot; and &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; by Eve Ensler.

Recent productions have included the multi-award-winning production of John Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; which subsequently transferred to Broadway, &quot;Ying Tong – A Walk with the Goons&quot;, &quot;Someone Who&#x27;ll Watch Over Me&quot;, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and the world première of Kate Betts&#x27; &quot;On the Third Day&quot; which won the Channel 4 television series &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot;. In 2006, the theatre played host to the landmark revival of Peter Hall&#x27;s production of Waiting for Godot which ran for a strictly limited autumn season.

Recent productions include the Menier Chocolate Factory production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, the Bush Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Whipping it Up&quot;, starring Richard Wilson and Robert Bathurst, and &quot;Love Song&quot;, starring Cillian Murphy and Neve Campbell (November 2006 to February 2007).

In September 2007, renowned dance show Stomp transferred to the theatre for a ten year run, which had its last performance in January 2018.

<text>Aegidienberg (Ripuarian: &quot;Jillienberch&quot; or &quot;Jillienberg&quot;) is a borough (&quot;Stadtbezirk&quot;) of Bad Honnef in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It consists of thirteen villages and is located east of the Siebengebirge range in the Niederwesterwald foothills. Until 1969, Aegidienberg was an independent municipality in the former district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of . The name refers to Saint Aegidius, the patron saint of the local Catholic parish church; until the 16th century, the locality was known as &quot;Hunferode&quot; or &quot;Honnefer Rott&quot;. Population: 7089 (2013).

== Geography ==
The borough of Aegidienberg encompasses the parts of Bad Honnef located east of the Honnef urban forest, in other words east of the Siebengebirge. In geographic terms, the area forms part of the in the foothills of the Niederwesterwald. The various parts of the borough are distributed across hills which all lie within the broader boundary of the Siebengebirge Nature Park. The Siebengebirge itself, with its peaks up to in height, separates Aegidienberg from Bad Honnef proper, which is about away in the Rhine Valley. Aegidienberg is located at an average altitude approximately above Bad Honnef. The two are linked by Landesstraße 144 through the long Schmelz Valley.
Within Aegidienberg are two small lakes, Lake Himberg (&quot;Himberger See&quot;) in the West and Lake Dachsberg (&quot;Dachsberger See&quot;) in the East. Both are former basalt quarries, which were worked until after the Second World War. Two streams which are sources of the Pleisbach, the Logebach and the Quirrenbach, rise in the area and run through it. The Kochenbach is a tributary of the Quirrenbach. Amongst the hills within the district of Aegidienberg are the Himberg (), the Hupperichsberg (), the Markhövel (also called the Romert; ) and the Dachsberg ()—the last being the highest point in the district. The main village of Aegidienberg, on the eponymous hill, is at altitude. Within the district are two contiguous forest areas, the Aegidienberg Forest (&quot;Aegidienberger Wald&quot;) to the East and the Vogelsbitze to the West of the A3 autobahn. At the eastern extremity of the district, part of the Eudenbach gliding area and nature reserve lies within Aegidienberg.
The District of Aegidienberg includes 13 localities: Aegidienberg (Kirchdorf), Brüngsberg, Efferoth, Himberg, Höhe, Hövel, Neichen, Orscheid, Retscheid, Rottbitze, Siefenhoven, Wintersberg and Wülscheid. The Rottlandhof farm is within the municipality of Rheinbreitbach, but portions of it lie within the territory of Aegidienberg and thus of Bad Honnefer. The district is bordered to the north-west by Ittenbach and to the north and north-east by the Oberhau, both sections of the city of Königswinter; and to the east and south by Windhagen and Rheinbreitbach, both of which are in Rhineland-Palatinate.

== History ==

=== Governance and economy since the early Middle Ages ===
A 948 charter of Archbishop of Cologne established the territorial boundaries of the priory of Oberpleis and included within it what is now the district of Aegidienberg. These boundaries have persisted to the present day as town boundaries and to the South and East, district and state boundaries. There is no information for that time about habitation; it is thought that there were isolated farms and charcoal-making operations in the area. Settlement by people from Bad Honnefer, implied by the first recorded placename in the area, &quot;Hunferode&quot;, can only refer to the villages of Himberg, Hövel and Siefenhoven, at the bottom of the Schmelz Valley. In view of the marginal agricultural value of the loamy soil, the origins of the inhabited areas in the remainder of today&#x27;s Aegidienberg, particularly in the East, probably lie in settlement via the valley of the Pleisbach or the roads through the hills.

Until the extinction of the line around 970, the Counts of the exercised secular overlordship in the area. They were succeeded by the Counts Palatine of the Rhine. After the construction of castle in the second half of the 12th century, the area came under its control and from 1484 to 1808 formed part of the &quot;Amt Löwenburg&quot;, a fief of the County of Berg.
The first recorded mention, which may refer only to the village of Aegidienberg, later known as &quot;an der Kirche&quot; (at the church), is dated 6 January 1345 and is of &quot;Hunferode&quot;. This is followed by a mention of &quot;Hunferoyde&quot; dated 5 January 1349. The name Aegidienberg is presumed to have displaced this name since the 16th century. St. Giles, known in Germany as Aegidius, was venerated beginning at the end of the Middle Ages as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and as a patron saint of livestock.
A 1506 charter, &quot;von wegen der bergischen Pastoreyen&quot;, mentions a priest called &quot;Hermannus&quot; whose church was located where the Chapel of St. Servatius now stands, near Himberg. According to the &quot;Erkundigungsbuch des Fürstentums Berg&quot;, &quot;Gilienberg&quot; had the status of a separate parish since the introduction of the new Jülich-Berg court system in 1555. Under this new arrangement, Aegidienberg lost the independent court with seven lay judges which it had previously had, instead sending two judges to the newly formed court at Honnef (from 1745 on, only one). By the mid-18th century at the latest, eight local jurisdictions (known in the Rhineland as &quot;Honschaften&quot;) had developed, which lasted until the dissolution of the Duchy of Berg in 1806: Brüngsberg, Himberg, Höhe, Hövel, Orscheid, Retscheid, Siefenhoven and Wülscheid.
The inhabitants worked the poor clayey soil of Aegidienberg either as smallholders or as tenant farmers. Before the invention of artificial fertilisers, the fields were good for almost nothing except the cultivation of barley and oats, which were the staple foods of the local people in the Middle Ages. Livestock cultivation was later added, and at the beginning of the modern age, the local diet was enriched with potatoes, which gave the community their speciality, &quot;Rievkooche&quot; (&quot;Reibekuchen&quot; - potato pancakes), which to this day are an indispensable part of any public event.
The inhabitants shared rights to the woodland of the &quot;Honnefer Mark&quot; between Aegidienberg and Bad Honnef, now called the Honnef urban forest, including among other things the rights to let their pigs forage for mast, to gather wood for fuel and fencing, and to use fallen twigs for animal bedding. Woodland farmers had sticks available to them for their animals, but only the nobility had the right to cut timber. Furthermore, Aegidienberg had fixed obligations under the tithe system of the Amt Löwenburg: 120, later 200, &quot;malters&quot; of oats had to be paid to various officials. The residents also had to cut the wood for the Löwenburg gallows, which stood in the area of what is now Lohfelder Straße in Honnef, maintain it, and mow the grass at the castle farm. By the end of the 15th century at the latest, the people of Aegidienberg were required to grind all their corn at the Quirrenbach mill, which was located within the parish.

Ores of various base metals were being mined in the Siebengebirge area as early as the Middle Ages, primarily for the production of copper, zinc and lead. In addition to the work in the mines themselves, their constant need for charcoal led to there being many charcoal producers in the region. A copper mine called &quot;Gotteshilfe&quot; was located in Neichen, and in Brüngsberg there were mines called &quot;Flora&quot;, &quot;Anrep-Zachäus&quot; and &quot;Emma-Sofie&quot;, where zinc and copper ores were mined until early in 1906. The heaps of tailings from the mines can still be seen on the slope of the Logebach valley. With declining prices for the metals, the mines in the Siebengebirge area gradually closed down.
Basalt is still quarried in the immediate area of Aegidienberg. The basalt quarries on the Dachsberg and the Himberg had railway connections to the Bröl Valley Railway (&quot;Bröltalbahn&quot;), which had a wide-ranging network extending as far as Asbach, Beuel, Siegburg and Waldbröl. The quarry operators underwrote the branch lines they used for transporting the basalt. Connecting to a passenger line was discussed a number of times but never carried out. Both of the quarries in Aegidienberg ceased operation around the 1960s and today the water-filled pits are used for swimming and other recreation, like many other quarries in the region.

===Prussia and German Empire===
Beginning in 1806, as part of the Amt Löwenburg, Aegidienberg belonged to the Napoleonic Grand Duchy of Berg. At the end of 1808, new administrative structures modelled on those of France were introduced: cantons and &quot;mairies&quot; (town halls). The parish of Aegidienberg was assigned to the &quot;Mairie&quot; and Canton of Königswinter together with Honnef, Königswinter and Ittenbach; however, this only became fully functional early in 1809. Beginning in December 1813, the &quot;mairie&quot; became a &quot;Bürgermeisterei&quot;, the equivalent German term, in the provisional under the Kingdom of Prussia. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 assigned the Rhineland to Prussia, and the Bürgermeisterei of Königswinter then became a conventional Prussian local government entity within the newly formed District (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Siegburg (renamed in 1825). From 1822 on, this was part of the Prussian Rhine Province.

On 1 July 1846, Aegidienberg acquired a local council, replacing the district administration made up of lay judges. Honnef (in 1862) and Königswinter (in 1889) subsequently acquired their own town councils, leaving Aegidienberg and Ittenbach in the Bürgermeisterei of Königswinter-Land, which existed until 1969, being renamed &quot;Amt Königswinter-Land&quot; in 1927.

The municipality of Aegidienberg, (until 1888 also spelt &quot;Egidienberg&quot; or &quot;Ägidienberg&quot;; thereafter &quot;Ägidienberg&quot; was officially recommended, and the only accepted alternate was the present spelling, &quot;Aegidienberg&quot;) consisted in 1885 of 13 settlements with 366 residences (including uninhabited residences) and 327 households. The settlements were: the village of Ägidienberg (97 inhabitants), Brüngsberg (135), Efferoth (13), Himberg (162), Höhe (47), Hövel (285), Neichen (60), Orscheid (203), Retscheid (44), Rottbitze (97), Siefenhoven (108), Wintersberg (22) and Wüllscheid (255). There were a total of 1,528 inhabitants, of whom 751 were male and 777 female. The independent Catholic parish had 1,523 members, and there were in addition five Protestants, for whom the Honnef parish was responsible. The municipality had a total area of , was arable land, pasture and woodland.

Around 1855, a road was built connecting Aegidienberg to Honnef (today Landesstraße 144); this was extended to Flammersfeld by way of Asbach, and later to Altenkirchen. In 1862, roads were built to Wülscheid and Orscheid connecting to what is today Landesstraße 247.

On 10 January 1898, on a suggestion from Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, approximately 50 residents founded the &quot;Aegidienberger Spar- und Darlehenskassenverein&quot; (Aegidienberg Savings and Loan Association). This cooperative made it possible to extend the water supply beginning in 1902, and from 1908 gave support to the Automobilgesellschaft (automobile association), whose aim was to create a bus connection with Bad Honnef and Königswinter. 
On Whitsunday, 12 July 1905, a large fire in Orscheid, caused by children who were presumably playing, destroyed 13 buildings. In 1912 the first gymnastics club, &quot;Germania&quot;, was founded.
When the First World War began in 1914, many men were called up for military service, including all the teachers. Many events were held to promote war bonds. The loan association lost reserves totalling 13,000 RM to the war bonds. The longer the war lasted, the more urgent was the need for raw materials. Children, especially, were required to collect these: paper, glass, tin foil, and also large quantities of foliage to feed the warhorses. Leaves were plucked from the trees and sent either fresh or dried to the collection point at Siegburg. They were dried in every possible place in homes. Copper fittings and every imaginable household object were requisitioned in numerous metal collections; even the church bells were melted down for the armaments industry.
In November 1923, violent armed confrontations which claimed some lives took place especially in Himberg and Hövel between separatists of the Rhenish Republic and those who opposed them. A monument in Hövel and graves in the cemetery commemorate the Siebengebirge insurrection, which is also known as the Battle of Aegidienberg.
Beginning in 1925, local craft workshops built a friary for the of Valkenburg aan de Geul. After its dedication in 1926, the sisters performed various charitable works in the area, including operating a children&#x27;s home and training girls in domestic skills.

=== Third Reich / World War II ===
Starting in 1937, the construction of the Reichsautobahn (now the A3, Bundesautobahn 3) changed the face of the environment considerably. The surveying and construction of the first four-lane motorway in the area took place over several years before the segment through Aegidienberg opened in September 1939. The work included excavations and embankments up to in depth and height, and the construction of a seven-arched bridge across a valley and three underpasses. Loss of land to the motorway rendered many local farms no longer profitable, in addition to which many landowners were left with small and scattered holdings. Land consolidation was begun but could not be completed because of World War II.
The Nazis employed approximately 600 Soviet prisoners of war as forced laborers in the local basalt quarries. As the war drew to a close, shortly before the arrival of the advancing U.S. forces, these people were rounded up in the Giershausen hall and transported further into the interior of Germany. At the end of the war, fierce fighting took place in the area. After the Americans had crossed the Rhine at Remagen on 7 March 1945, Aegidienberg came under heavy American artillery fire on the following days. German forces had dug in here and in turn were heavily shelling the area around Remagen. On 13 March, especially, numerous soldiers died on both sides. Unusually, a short cease-fire was agreed so that the dead could be recovered.
On 16 March the centre of Aegidienberg came under heavy fire and 11 civilians died in the ruins of the convent. The nuns had been denied permission to hoist a white flag with a red cross in order to protect themselves and the approximately 60 children and refugees who were with them there. In addition, there was still a radio vehicle located as a command post in the monastery courtyard, which drew enemy fire like a magnet. That afternoon, carpet bombing of the main part of the settlement by the U.S. Air Force was averted at the last moment through negotiations, and approximately 150 German soldiers surrendered, while others decided to fight on.
After its occupation by American forces on 17 March, Aegidienberg was then subjected by German artillery to several days of so-called and intended &quot;destruction fire&quot;. Panzer Brigade 106 &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; and scattered elements of other units were dug in at Orscheid and Wülscheid and shelled every population centre between Brüngsberg and Rottbitze. Severe damage and in some cases total destruction of all public buildings and a large number of residences and businesses resulted.
In Aegidienberg, the fighting was over on 1 April, Easter Sunday. In Orscheid, Wülscheid and Rottbitze, fighting continued for several more days, with the military situation changing several times. Traces of the fighting are still to be seen in the area. There are many craters in the surrounding woods made by U.S. shells of all calibres, plus at Wülscheid one made by the explosion when a German munitions cart was blown up on 10 March 1945 during the retreat.

=== Since the end of the war ===

In the first years after the war, robberies occurred in the area that caused several deaths and have never been explained. Not until the early 1950s were all the war dead identified and disposed of in a dignified manner. The American dead were transported back to the United States. The remainder were buried in the soldiers&#x27; cemetery at Ittenbach. Approximately 40 of the dead could not be identified. War damage to buildings was temporarily repaired. The school was only reopened, with the permission of the Allied occupation authorities, in 1946. The Catholic church was repaired in stages which lasted into the 1960s. Large amounts of unexploded ordnance in the area constituted a serious danger to life for many years, and there were occasional accidents resulting in injury and death.

The land consolidation project which had become urgently needed in 1937 was resumed in 1948 and completed in 1953. Approximately 13,000 agricultural parcels were consolidated to approximately 1,600, consisting of of arable cropland, grassland, woodland, water, roads and farmsteads, in the district of Aegidienberg and small parts of Oberpleis. From July 1949 to July 1950, the part of Aegidienberg west of the autobahn was part of the , a special territory surrounding the provisional capital of the Federal Republic of Germany which was under the control of the Allied High Commission. In 1955, the then district road opened connecting Aegidienberg and Ittenbach, and in the same year a new chapel of St. Mary was dedicated at the foot of the Dachsberg. On 4 February 1961, the new local Protestant church was dedicated; since then it has been called the &quot;Friedenskirche&quot; (Peace Church).
The &quot;TTV-Aegidienberg&quot; sports club was founded soon after the end of the war, but disbanded in 1952 for financial reasons. Early in 1958, the &quot;Fußballverein Sportfreunde Aegidienberg 1958&quot; was launched, which now has other sports sections in addition to several football teams and is the largest club in Aegidienberg.

In 1967, Aegidienberg had 3,504 residents, of whom 225 were employed in agriculture and forestry, 519 in manufacturing and 351 in services. 564 commuted out of the district and 54 into it. Four industrial enterprises employed 163 people. Public accommodations consisted of: a school, a sports ground, a kindergarten and a library.

Under the of 10 June 1969, Aegidienberg became part of Bad Honnef on 1 August 1969. Previously, there had been proposals to combine Aegidienberg with the mountain districts of Ittenbach, Heisterbacherrott, Oberpleis and Stieldorf. It retains its former municipal borders.
 
The Gladbeck hostage crisis came to its violent end on the A3 in Hövel on 18 August 1988 with the death of an 18-year-old woman. Since 2009 a memorial has marked the spot.

===Post and buses===
Aegidienberg initially belonged to the rural section of the Königswinter postal division; in 1854 it was transferred to the Honnef division. The first post box was installed the same year, at the school. After the completion in 1859 of the provincial road between Honnef and Flammersfeld (now Landesstraße 144), the following year passenger postal service in post coaches was instituted on the segment between Asbach and Honnef via Aegidienberg. This was the first direct connection between Aegidienberg and the Rhine Valley. Initially the coaches stopped at inns in Himberg and Rottbitze. In 1870, as a result of the opening of the railway on the right bank of the Rhine, this passenger service was restricted to Asbach - Honnef, no longer continuing from Honnef to Königswinter, and ran twice a day.

In 1888, Himberg became the first part of the district to have its own contract post office. At the beginning of 1901, droshkies were introduced for passenger service, and beginning in 1909 were replaced with post buses, which ran three to four times a day between Aegidienberg and Königswinter via Honnef. For this purpose, a so-called automobile society was founded in Aegidienberg, which took over the transport service until 1920. From 1921 on, it was provided by the national postal service, the Reichspost. In the 1920s and 1930s, the route changed several times, with the bus sometimes running between Aegidienberg and Rheinbreitbach. When service resumed in 1945 after the Second World War, it ran between Honnef and Aegidienberg; in December 1948 it was extended to Windhagen and in 1950 again to Asbach. The village of Aegidienberg itself only received its own postal annexe in 1953.

=== Former coat of arms ===

The design of the coat of arms for the former municipality of Aegidienberg was suggested in the early 1960s by Franz Hermann Kemp, a teacher and local history expert living in , another district of Bad Honnef. It was finally realised in conformity with the rules of heraldry by Konrad Schaefer, a graphic designer in Euskirchen.

At the bottom, the coat of arms shows three green peaks in the Siebengebirge, the Löwenburg, Lohrberg, and Großer Ölberg. On the middle one of these is superimposed the red and silver checked arms of the Amt Löwenburg, to whose governmental and judicial sphere Aegidienberg belonged for as long as it was in existence. Above that the symbol of Aegidienberg, the Romanesque tower of St. Aegidius&#x27; church, is depicted in silver on a red ground. The coat of arms was &quot;approved&quot; by the district council in its 44th session on 4 November 1963 and certified by the Interior Minister of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia on 16 July 1965. It is still used by local organisations.

=== Population growth ===
Aegidienberg grew rapidly after the Second World War. About half of the population growth in Bad Honnef after 1969 has occurred in Aegidienberg. The following table shows the number of residents on various dates:

== Economy and infrastructure ==
The A3 autobahn crosses the district from north-west to south-east for . North of Aegidienberg, it crosses the Logebach on a bridge long, half of which lies within the Ittenbach district of Königswinter. In the eastern part of Aegidienberg is the Bad Honnef/Linz motorway exit, which forms the basis of the district&#x27;s good traffic infrastructure. Especially in the village of Rottbitze, it has led since the year 2000 to extensive commercial and industrial development on the Vogelsbitze/Zilzkreuz commercial estate (approximately ), to the south of what was already present on the Heideweg. An additional commercial estate on the Dachsberg was inaugurated in 2009; the first project was inaugurated there in early 2013. In addition, by 2005 a second commercial area had developed in Rottbitze with, among other services, a building supplies centre, several discount shops and filling stations.
The Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line for the Intercity-Express (ICE), which opened late in 2002, runs through the district parallel to the A3, with three tunnels and two bridges, including from north to south the Logebach Valley bridge (the northern part of which, like the motorway bridge, is in Königswinter), ; the Aegidienberg tunnel under the central section of the district, ; the Kochenbach Valley bridge, ; and the Rottbitze Tunnel under the motorway exit, . The section of track crossing the hillside fields of the &quot;Kluse&quot; farm was originally laid on the surface but later lowered into a tunnel or hard-floored cutting long. The closest ICE station, Siegburg/Bonn, is in Siegburg, the administrative centre of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis.

The &quot;Schmelztalstraße&quot; (Schmelz Valley Road, Landesstraße 144) connects Aegidienberg to the lowland portion of Bad Honnef. A large amount of the traffic on this road is through traffic to the A3. Landesstraße 143, which begins on the border of the district below Rottbitze, connects Aegidienberg with Oberpleis, to the north. It crosses the A3 between Hövel and Brüngsberg on a stone bridge built in 1938, the so-called &quot;Westerwälder Tor&quot;. This is one of the few remaining stone bridges from the construction of the Reichsautobahn system, and is an artistic landmark.

The district has its own brand of beer, Jillienberger, from the local dialect version of &quot;Aegidienberg&quot;, &quot;Jillienberch&quot; or &quot;Jillienberg&quot;. There is also a breed of horse called Aegidienberger; they are bred by the local Feldmann stud farm. Like the Icelandic horse, the Aegidienberger is a gaited horse.

=== Public facilities ===
Despite incorporation into Bad Honnef, Aegidienberg has retained a certain independence; it is recognised in the latest North Rhine-Westphalian district law as having a special status within the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis, and for that reason the village of Aegidienberg has a 15-member district committee empowered to take decisions concerning purely local matters. This meets in a building in the Aegidiusplatz in the centre of the village which also houses a branch office of the Bad Honnef town administration, a citizens&#x27; advice bureau and a reporting station of the Bonn Police.
In addition to five kindergartens or daycare centres in various parts of the district—two in the village of Aegidienberg, two in Höhe and one in Orscheid—there is a town &quot;Grundschule&quot; (primary school), the Theodor-Weinz-Schule, in Aegidienberg. Plans to establish a comprehensive school for the entire mountain area of the Siebengebirge have so far been unsuccessful. The Catholic and Protestant parishes also each maintain a public library, and the Catholics offer one kindergarten (certified as a family centre) and the Protestants two. Aegidienberg has a sports centre in Rottbitze, on the south side of the Himberg; since 2010 it has had artificial turf.

<doc id="597042" wikidata="Q655418" url="?curid=597042" title="London Conference of 1866">
<text>The London Conference was held in London, in the United Kingdom, in 1866. It was the third and final in a series of conferences that led to Canadian Confederation in 1867. Sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick gathered to set out the final outline of the proposed Canadian Confederation, resulting in the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; (now the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;).

Upon the conclusion of the discussions by the delegates, the British government directed that a bill be drafted to implement the resolutions of the Conference. Introduced in 1867, the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; was passed by both Houses of Parliament and then received royal assent from Queen Victoria on March 29, 1867. It was proclaimed in force on July 1, 1867, creating the Dominion of Canada.

== The Conference ==
The London Conference began on December 4, 1866. It was a continuation of the Quebec Conference held in 1864, which had produced the Quebec Resolutions. The conference was held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, just across the street from the British Parliament buildings. John A. Macdonald was the chairman of the conference.

==Delegates==
In 1866, the Province of Canada was composed of Canada East (now Quebec), and Canada West (now Ontario). The Province of Canada sent a total of six delegates, but for the purposes of the Conference, they were treated as two separate delegations.

===Canada East===
Canada East sent three delegates: George-Étienne Cartier, Alexander Tilloch Galt, and Hector-Louis Langevin.

===Canada West===
Canada West sent three delegates: William Pearce Howland, John A. Macdonald, and William McDougall.

===New Brunswick===
New Brunswick sent five delegates: Charles Fisher, John Mercer Johnson, Peter Mitchell, Samuel Leonard Tilley, and Robert Duncan Wilmot.

===Nova Scotia===
Nova Scotia sent five delegates: Adams George Archibald, William Alexander Henry, Jonathan McCully, John William Ritchie, and Charles Tupper.

== Major issues==
===Inter-colonial railway===
One of the major issues when the Conference opened was the proposed Inter-Colonial Railway linking the Province of Canada to the Maritimes. This issue was quickly resolved when Macdonald stated that the Province of Canada agreed that the obligation to build the railway should be included in the legislation.

===Structure of the Senate===
The composition of the proposed Senate continued to be a major issue, with a suggestion from the British government that the Senate be elected, not appointed.

=== Denominational schools ===
A major issue of contention was the education system, with Roman Catholic bishops lobbying for guarantees protecting the separate school system. This was opposed by delegates from the Maritimes, and the compromise reached was Section 93 of the act, which guaranteed separate school systems in Quebec and Ontario but not in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.

<text>Meldrick Taylor (born October 19, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 2002. He held world championships in two weight classes, including the IBF junior welterweight title from 1988 to 1990, and the WBA welterweight title from 1991 to 1992. As an amateur, Taylor won a gold medal in the featherweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

==Amateur career==
Taylor, one of many boxing champions hailing from the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, learned his craft in the gyms of his hometown and posted a 99-4 record as an amateur fighter. In 1984, Taylor earned a spot on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team at the age of 17, and claimed the gold medal in the featherweight division. Following his victory, he joined the professional ranks.

===1984 Olympic results===
*Round of 64: 
*Round of 32: Defeated Nicolae Talpos (Romania) 5-0
*Round of 16: Defeated Francisco Camacho (Mexico) 5-0
*Quarterfinal: Defeated John Wanjau (Kenya) referee stopped contest in the third round
*Semifinal: Defeated Omar Catari (Venezuela) 5-0
*Final: Defeated Peter Konyegwachie (Nigeria) 5-0 (won gold medal)

In the American Olympic trials Taylor lost to Andrew Minsker, who then went on to win the trials. However, Taylor beat Minsker twice back to back to earn the spot in the Olympic box-offs.

==Professional career==
His early fights were against nondescript journeymen, but in his 12th fight, in May 1986, Taylor won a unanimous decision against fellow contender Harold Brazier and moved into the world rankings. On September 3, 1988, Taylor faced James (Buddy) McGirt for the IBF light welterweight title. He defeated McGirt by a technical knockout (TKO) in the 12th and final round to begin his first title reign.

===Taylor vs. Chávez===

Over the next 18 months, Taylor won four more fights, setting up a unification bout with the WBC light welterweight champion Julio César Chávez on March 17, 1990 in Las Vegas. Chavez had an aura of invincibility, he was considered the best fighter pound for pound in the world and also one of the most dangerous fighters in the sport. This fight drew huge media attention, as both men came in unbeaten (Taylor at 24-0-1 and Chávez at 66-0), and regarded as two of the best boxers in the world, regardless of weight class. Their fight was one of the most famous and controversial bouts in boxing history.

Taylor took control of the action early and began to build up a lead on the scorecards. However, Chávez proved to be a heavier puncher, and was slowly wearing Taylor down even as he lost rounds. Going to the 12th and final round, Taylor led by wide margins on two of the three scorecards, and his corner famously told him that he needed to win that round. Because of this, Taylor chose to continue fighting at close quarters with the hard-hitting Mexican champion. Chávez, realizing time was running out, came at Taylor aggressively in the last round. With 17 seconds left in the fight, Chávez floored Taylor. Taylor beat the 10-count and got back to his feet at six. Referee Richard Steele twice asked Taylor, &quot;Are you ok?&quot; Taylor did not respond and only looked at his corner. Steele waved the fight off with just two seconds left, awarding Chávez a win by TKO.

The controversy surrounding the stoppage continues to this day, and 10 years later, &quot;The Ring&quot; proclaimed it the &quot;Fight of the Decade&quot;.

Many boxing fans believe that Taylor was essentially &#x27;ruined&#x27; as a fighter because of this bout—due in part to the tremendous punishment taken at the hands of Chavez, including several fractures and some kidney damage (according to the HBO &quot;Legendary Nights&quot; episode mentioned before, he was taken to the hospital immediately after the Chavez bout—reportedly urinating blood.)

===WBA welterweight champion and rematch with Chávez===

Taylor had lost his title, but not his desire. Feeling that having to make the 140 pound (64 kg) weight had weakened him against Chavez, Taylor moved up to welterweight (147 pounds) and decisioned undefeated Aaron Davis for the WBA welterweight title on January 19, 1991. He issued a challenge to Chávez for a rematch at 147 pounds, but the latter wouldn&#x27;t move up in weight for many years. Taylor won three more fights before answering a challenge from world junior middleweight champion Terry Norris to fight for Norris&#x27; WBC title. Norris, a naturally bigger and stronger man, knocked Taylor out in the fourth round.

This marked the end of Taylor&#x27;s career as a world-class fighter; he lost the welterweight crown to undefeated challenger Crisanto España in his next fight on Halloween night in 1992. Taylor won his following three fights, including a second-round knockout over number four ranked welterweight Chad Broussard. He got one more title shot, against Chávez on September 17, 1994 in Las Vegas, but, years removed from his prime, he was stopped by Chávez in the eighth round. The fight was competitive, with Taylor getting off to a fast start. But after a brutal sixth round, Taylor&#x27;s legs became rubbery and he was stopped 2 rounds later. Taylor was suspended by The State Athletic Commission in 1997 for failing to appear at a bout in Altoona, PA. It was scheduled for April 6, 1997 against 18-0 Ken Sigurani In a 10-round welterweight event.

He fought off and on over the next couple of years, winning some fights and losing others, before retiring in 2002. He finished with a record of 38-8-1, (20 KOs).

During an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Nights&quot; in 2003, an interview with Taylor was shown, in which his speech was very slurred and difficult to understand. Many viewers were shocked and disturbed when they heard the way Taylor now speaks. Indeed, the episode implicitly attributed this to pugilistic dementia—mentioning, time and again, how Taylor was well past his prime as a fighter.

Meldrick Taylor has written his autobiography, titled &quot;Two Seconds From Glory&quot;.

==2019 arrest==
Meldrick Taylor was arrested on Tuesday, June 4, 2019 in North Philadelphia morning after he allegedly threatened a man with a gun and engaged in a 90-minute standoff with police at his residence. Taylor was charged with aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime and terroristic threats. He was later released on an unsecured bond.

==Personal==
Meldrick Taylor has a twin brother, Eldrick, who was also briefly a professional boxer. Eldrick Taylor compiled a record of 0 wins and 1 loss. Another brother, Myron, competed as a professional boxer as well. Myron Taylor had a record of 29 wins (16 by knockout), 9 losses and one draw (tie), and who once challenged for a world title.

<text>Paul Kibii Tergat (born 17 June 1969) is a Kenyan former professional long distance runner. He became the first Kenyan man to set the world record in the marathon in 2003, with a time of 2:04:55, and is regarded as one of the most accomplished long-distance runners of all time. Runnerworld called him the &quot;Most comprehensive runner of all time&quot;.

Towards the end of his career, he concentrated exclusively on the marathon. Tergat set several world records and won many titles on the track, in cross country, and on the road. He lives and trains in Eldoret, Kenya.

== Early life ==
Paul Tergat was born on 17 June 1969 in Riwo, Baringo District, in Kenya&#x27;s Rift Valley Province. He attended Riwo Primary School and later joined Kapkawa Boys High School. Unlike many athletes, Tergat realised his talent after graduating high school.

== Career ==
Tergat won five straight IAAF World Cross Country Championships titles, 1995 to 1999, which was a record. Says Tergat, &quot;Cross country is what I always liked most. It was my world, my passion. Before the IAAF introduced the short course in 1998, all the world class athletes from 1500 m to the marathon were in the same race.&quot;

He won the Lisbon Half Marathon in 2000, setting a new course record and personal best of 59:06. He won the race again in 2005 with a time of 59:10. Tergat&#x27;s achievements also include 5 victories in the traditional Saint Silvester Road Race, the most important event in Latin American street racing. He holds the record for the present 15 km distance, which he established in 1995. His performances in the Saint Silvester race earned him celebrity status in Brazil.

He has had an intense rivalry with his friend Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia. In the Olympic Games 10,000m finals of both the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he was defeated by Gebrselassie by slim margins. In 2000, the margin of victory was only nine-hundredths of a second.

Tergat finished second to Gebrselassie in the 1997 and 1999 World Championships in Athletics at 10,000 m, and finished third in the 1995 version of that race, behind Gebrselassie and Moroccan Khalid Skah.

On the track, Tergat broke Gebrselassie&#x27;s 10,000-metre world record on 22 August 1997 in Brussels with a time of 26:27.85 minutes. The record was broken again by Gebrselassie in 1998 (time 26:22:75), but Tergat&#x27;s time remains a Kenyan record (as of 2024). On the road, Tergat broke the half marathon world record on 4 April 1998 in Milan by running in 59:17 minutes. (Tergat had run 58:51 minutes at the Stramilano half marathon in 1996, but a misplaced cone made the course slightly too short and no record was allowed.) The previous record, 59:47 minutes was set by Moses Tanui in 1993. Tergat&#x27;s world record was broken in 2005 by Samuel Wanjiru, another Kenyan.

When Tergat raced Gebrselassie in the London Marathon in 2002, it was Tergat who beat Gebrselassie; Tergat was in second place behind then world record holder Khalid Khannouchi. The three runners raced again in the 2007 version with Tergat being the only one of them to finish.

He became an IOC member at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires in September 2013.

=== Marathon career ===
Tergat finished second in his first three marathons: London Marathon in 2001 and 2002 and Chicago Marathon in 2001. He continued marathoning by two fourth places: Chicago 2002 and London 2003.

He set the marathon world record of &quot;2:04:55&quot;, on 28 September 2003 at the Berlin Marathon. That is an average pace of &quot;0:02:57&quot; per kilometre (20.3 km/h) or &quot;0:04:46&quot; per mile (12.6 MPH). In his world record race, Tergat badly abraded his foot. He later said it felt like the sole of his shoe fell off. He also took a momentary wrong turn near the finish. Tergat&#x27;s countryman Sammy Korir, who was a pacesetter for the race, nearly caught up to him. Korir took second place in 2:04:56, then the second-fastest marathon performance in history. Tergat&#x27;s world record was broken in 2007 by Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia. Tergat&#x27;s time remained the Kenyan record until 2009, when winner Duncan Kibet and 2nd placed James Kwambai both timed 2:04:27 at the Rotterdam Marathon
Tergat won the New York City Marathon 6 November 2005, in a thrilling sprint finish through New York&#x27;s Central Park, prevailing over defending champion Hendrick Ramaala 2:09:29.90 to 2:09:30.22.

That year, Tergat inaugurated the Baringo Half Marathon, setting up the professional race on a course near his home town.

A week prior to the London Marathon on 23 April 2006, Tergat pulled a calf muscle. Calling the injury &quot;cruel,&quot; he was forced to withdraw from the star-studded race, which would have featured a long-awaited showdown with Haile Gebrselassie. The race was won by Felix Limo of Kenya. 

Marílson Gomes dos Santos won the 2006 New York City Marathon; Tergat finished third. Gomes made a move at mile 19 and Tergat did not respond. Tergat steadily closed the gap over the final five miles.

Tergat finished sixth (2:08:06) at the 2007 London Marathon in April 2007. The entry list was competitive, including Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie, who dropped out just past the 30-K mark. Kenya&#x27;s Martin Lel won the race in a time of 2:07.42, after a dramatic, gutsy finish.

On 30 September 2007 Ethiopian long distance runner Haile Gebrselassie broke Tergat&#x27;s record marathon time of 2:04.55, finishing the Berlin Marathon in 2:04:26. Moments after finishing the race, Gebrselassie apologised to his friend Tergat for breaking the record, during a congratulatory phone call. Gebrselassie later explained &quot;I am sorry – this record belonged to Paul Tergat,&quot; Gebrselassie told a news conference when asked about the phone call. &quot;Paul is my friend.&quot;

He expressed a desire to compete in 2008 Olympics, but was not selected to represent Kenya. He finished 4th in the New York Marathon later that year.

In 2009, he won the Lake Biwa Marathon in Japan, timing 2:10:22.
In October 2009, he was the guest of honour at the relaunch of the Belgrade Race Through History. Although he never won the competition in the late 1990s, he was the only competitor to run in all of the first four editions and never finished outside of the top three. He stated his desire to close his career at the race and praised the way it promoted Serbia&#x27;s cultural heritage.

He was named by New York Road Runners as the recipient of the 2010 Abebe Bikila Award in recognition of his long-distance achievements, becoming the first Kenyan male winner. In his acceptance he said &quot;The history of marathon running is incomplete without the solid and indelible mark of the late Abebe Bikila&#x27;s contribution, and I am so proud to be associated [with this]&quot;.

== Other activities ==

In January 2004 Tergat was named a UN World Food Programme (WFP) &quot;Ambassador Against Hunger&quot;. When he was a child, Paul Tergat&#x27;s family was too poor to send him to school with food. According to Tergat, he would not have gotten a full education were it not for the World Food Program, which provided lunch at his school.

Tergat set up the &quot;Paul Tergat Foundation&quot; in 2005. It is meant to help disadvantaged Kenyan sportspeople.
He runs a Sports Marketing and PR company known as Fine Touch Communications (organises the annual Sportsman of the Year Awards in Kenya in conjunction with Safaricom, a leading mobile telephony provider in Kenya. He&#x27;s also considering launching a clothing line under the name &quot;Tergat&quot; in the coming months.

Like many other Kenyan athletes, Tergat is enlisted to Armed Forces. He is based at the Moi Air Base in Nairobi.

As of April 2015, Tergat was linked with the role of leading a new interim committee to oversee Athletics Kenya (AK) after rumours surfaced that the Sports Cabinet Secretary, Hassan Wario, would soon dissolve AK.

<doc id="597070" wikidata="Q1397290" url="?curid=597070" title="James Langevin">
<text>James R. Langevin ( ; born April 22, 1964) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress; Langevin was appointed to be the first quadriplegic speaker pro tempore of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019. Langevin did not seek reelection in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Langevin was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Richard and Judy (Barrett) Langevin. He is of French-Canadian descent. He attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick, Rhode Island, and Rhode Island College, from which he received an undergraduate degree, in addition to serving as president of Student Community Government, Inc. He has a Master of Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University.

In 1980, at age 16, Langevin was seriously injured in an accidental shooting. He had been working in the Boy Scout Explorer program at the Warwick Police Department when a firearm was accidentally discharged, leaving him paralyzed. Langevin received $2.2 million in a settlement with the city of Warwick.

==Rhode Island government==
Langevin&#x27;s first experience in politics was when he was elected to the state&#x27;s 1986 constitutional convention and was named its secretary. Langevin, who uses a wheelchair, once ran on the slogan &quot;I&#x27;ll stand up for you&quot;, which he said during a meeting in West Warwick.

Langevin was first elected a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1988 and served as a state representative until 1994. He was elected Secretary of State of Rhode Island in November 1994, defeating Republican incumbent Barbara Leonard. While Secretary of State, he earned a reputation for weeding out corruption in state government.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces
**Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
**Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats and Capabilities (Chair)
*Committee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection
**Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications

===Caucus memberships===

*Afterschool Caucuses
*Congressional Arts Caucus
*Congressional Coalition on Adoption
*Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus
*Congressional Taiwan Caucus
*Congressional Ukrainian Caucus
==Political positions==
Langevin voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Abortion===
Langevin has a mixed record on abortion. He has voted both to restrict and defend the choice to have the procedure. He voted against banning abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act, but for the Abortion Pain Bill, which seeks &quot;to ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child.&quot; He strongly promotes contraceptive availability, and in a 2007 statement said, &quot;I have great respect for the passion displayed by Mr. Smith and Mr. Stupak and I share their opposition to abortion. However, in this instance I must strongly disagree with their decision to prevent the distribution of contraception to some of the most poor and needy people and nations in the world.&quot; Because of his mixed stance on the issue, he has received fluctuating ratings from interest groups such as Planned Parenthood and the National Right to Life Committee.

Langevin believes that abortion should be legal when the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape or when the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother. but wishes to decrease the number of abortions in the country. His relatively complex stance on abortion contributes to somewhat contradictory interest group ratings because of his support for various bills. Langevin&#x27;s stance on abortion supported the interests of the NARAL Pro-Choice America 0% in 2006, but in 2007 the same group gave him a rating of 100% and the National Right to Life Committee gave him zero points, with points assigned for actions connected to an anti-abortion agenda.

===Health care===
Langevin has strongly supported health care reform. In May 2009, he introduced the American Health Benefits Program Act of 2009, with the stated purpose of &quot;amending the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to assure comprehensive, affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans through an American Health Benefits Program. He receives much of his campaign donations from health professionals. Langevin stated his goal of universal health care as &quot;a system of portable and continuous coverage based on quality, affordability and choice that promotes investment in long-term prevention and drives down the cost of care over time.&quot;

===Stem cell research===
One of Langevin&#x27;s top priorities in Congress has been the expansion of federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. His policy position is driven by his paralysis and the possibilities for stem cell research in alleviating this condition; he joined other House members in introducing the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, expanding the limited funding put in place in 2001.

===Cybersecurity===
Langevin helped found the House Cybersecurity Caucus, which he co-chairs. He has appeared on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; speaking about the national security challenges the country will face this century in regard to protecting infrastructure and data. Langevin has said that he hopes to raise awareness of the need for cybersecurity and supports strict penalties for internet crimes as well as strong internet privacy laws.

Langevin supports cybersecurity measures as long as they do not add &quot;unnecessary regulations to business&quot;. In October 2012, Rhode Island passed a statewide cybersecurity plan that Langevin strongly supported. In May 2012, he proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would account for the cyber risks the U.S. faces in terms of national security, saying without these measures the nation is &quot;ignoring key aspects of what is fast becoming the biggest threat to our security&quot;.

Cybersecurity contractors General Dynamics and Raytheon were Langevin&#x27;s two top sources for campaign contributions in the 2010 election.

In June 2015, FBI director James Comey announced that the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of more than 18 million Americans. Langevin called for the resignation of OPM director Katherine Archuleta, saying, &quot;I have seen no evidence Ms. Archuleta understands this central principle of cyber governance, and I am deeply concerned by her refusal to acknowledge her culpability in the breach.&quot;

===Armed forces===
Langevin, who serves on the Committee of Armed Services, has regularly voted for additional support of armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but he has voted for a timeline for U.S. forces to leave Iraq as well as a ban on any permanent U.S. bases in the country. He has also voted against limiting the interrogation techniques used in fighting terror and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

===Tax cuts===
Langevin, who serves on the Congressional Committee on the Budget, supports tax cuts for low-income and middle-class citizens while eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy, indicating in his Political Courage Test that he wishes to &quot;greatly decrease&quot; taxes for families making less than $75,000 a year. He also supports temporary incentives for businesses to invest in job creation. Langevin has a 100% rating from the AFL-CIO and supports the regulation of business.

===Advocacy for disabled people===

Langevin is known as an advocate for people with disabilities and for universal health care, being himself a quadriplegic. He is the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress.

On July 27, 2004, he spoke to the Democratic National Convention, largely on the subject of stem cell research.

In March 2007, Langevin co-sponsored the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which had the stated purpose of &quot;enhancing and furthering research into paralysis and to improve rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities.&quot; The bill passed the House but not the U.S. Senate. In 2009, the bill was included in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, also co-sponsored by Langevin, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama.

In 2008, Langevin announced his support for Hillary Clinton for president, and served as a special adviser to her on issues ranging from stem cell research to people with disabilities.

On July 26, 2010, Langevin became the first member of Congress to preside over the House of Representatives while using a wheelchair. The House had just recently installed a wheelchair lift leading up to the Speaker&#x27;s rostrum.

===Environment===
Langevin leans to the left on environmental and energy issues in Congress. Environmental issue groups have generally given him high ratings; he received a 97% rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2011. He has also received a rating of 100% from the Defenders of Wildlife Foundation. Conservative issue groups concerning the energy and the environment have given him very low ratings. He is a strong supporter of alternative energy from oil and coal, voting against the Stop the War Against Coal Act of September 2012, and has supported measures for new wind farms in New England. He has praised these developments, saying wind farm &quot;development holds great promise for Rhode Island and the country to have more stable and cleaner energy resources, while boosting our economy by presenting an opportunity to build a manufacturing base for these turbines and create quality jobs in the Ocean State.&quot;

In 2011, Langevin strongly opposed the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would limit the EPA&#x27;s ability to regulate carbon outputs. Calling it the &quot;Dirty Air Act&quot;, Langevin said that in passing this act, the U.S. would be &quot;turning back the progress we have made to protect our health under the Clean Air Act&quot;, adding that the passage of the bill would be &quot;continuing our nation&#x27;s addiction to foreign oil.&quot; Moreover, he has fought for more environmental regulations that he believes will help Rhode Islanders live healthier lives, saying that &quot;protecting the environment is a matter of pride.&quot;

==Political campaigns==
Langevin was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2000, defeating perennial candidate Robert Tingle for a seat that was left open when Representative Robert Weygand ran for the U.S. Senate. He took office in 2001, representing Rhode Island&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. He has been reelected with relative ease ever since, defeating independent Rodney Driver in 2006 and Republican Mark Zaccaria in 2008.

2010

In 2010, he defeated Zaccaria again.

2012

Langevin was reelected with 55.7% of the vote, defeating Republican nominee Michael Riley and Independent Abel Collins, an environmental activist.

==Personal life==
Langevin is Roman Catholic.

<text>The Gielgud Theatre is a West End theatre, located on Shaftesbury Avenue, at the corner of Rupert Street, in the City of Westminster, London. The house currently has 994 seats on three levels.

The theatre was designed by W. G. R. Sprague and opened on 27 December 1906 as the Hicks Theatre, named after Seymour Hicks, for whom it was built. The first play at the theatre was a hit musical called &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot; co-written by Hicks. Another big success was &quot;A Waltz Dream&quot; in 1908. In 1909, the American impresario Charles Frohman became manager of the theatre and renamed the house the Globe Theatre, a name that it retained for 85 years. &quot;Call It a Day&quot; opened in 1935 and ran for 509 performances, a long run for the slow inter-war years. &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;, opening in 1966, ran for almost three years, a record for the theatre that was not surpassed until &quot;Daisy Pulls It Off&quot; opened in April 1983 to run for 1,180 performances.

Refurbished in 1987, the theatre has since presented several Alan Ayckbourn premieres, including &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1990), as well as a notable revival of &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; in 1992. During reconstruction of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre on the South Bank, in 1994 the theatre was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in honour of Sir John Gielgud. Another refurbishment was completed in 2008.

The Globe&#x27;s theatre cat, Beerbohm, became famous enough to receive a front-page obituary in the theatrical publication &quot;The Stage&quot; in 1995.

==History==
===Early years===

The theatre opened on 27 December 1906 as the Hicks Theatre in honour of actor, manager and playwright Seymour Hicks, for whom it was built. Designed by W.G.R. Sprague in Louis XVI style, the theatre originally had 970 seats, but over the years boxes and other seats have been removed. The theatre is a pair with the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, which opened in 1907 on the adjacent street corner.

The first play at the theatre was a musical called &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot; by Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton. &quot;My Darling&quot;, another Hicks musical, followed in 1907, followed by the original London production of &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and the next year, the long-running London premiere production of the Straus operetta, &quot;A Waltz Dream&quot; . An astonishing event occurred midway through the run of the theatre&#x27;s next major work, a musical titled &quot;The Dashing Little Duke&quot; (1909), which was produced by Hicks. Hicks&#x27; wife, Ellaline Terriss, played the title role (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks stepped into the role – possibly the only case in the history of musical theatre where a husband succeeded to his wife&#x27;s role.

In 1909, the American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of the theatre and renamed the house Globe Theatre (the &quot;Globe Theatre&quot; on Newcastle Street had been demolished in 1902, making the name available). The reopening production was &quot;His Borrowed Plumes&quot;, written by Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston Churchill&#x27;s mother. During the First World War, the musical &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot; was a success at the theatre. Noël Coward debuted his &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; here in 1925. &quot;Call It a Day&quot; by Dodie Smith opened in 1935 and ran for 509 performances, an unusually long run for the slow inter-war years. Shakespeare and classic plays, as well as musicals, were seen at the theatre in the decades that followed. In 1939, actor John Gielgud directed and starred in a revival of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; that was &quot;regarded at the time as the definitive production of the 20th century.&quot;

===After World War II===
Gielgud took his production of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot;, by Christopher Fry, to the Globe Theatre in 1949 for a successful West End premiere. Likewise, in 1960, &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; had its stage premiere here. Terence Frisby&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;, opening in 1966, ran for 1,064 performances at the theatre, a record that was not surpassed until Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s production of the Olivier Award-winning comedy &quot;Daisy Pulls It Off&quot; by Denise Deegan opened in April 1983 to run until February 1986 for 1,180 performances, the theatre&#x27;s longest run. In 1987 Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; had a hit London premiere, starring Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack, and running for two years. One of several Coward revivals in recent decades, &quot;Design for Living&quot;, starring Rachel Weisz, transferred to the theatre in 1995. When Lloyd Webber rewrote &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, he relaunched it at the theatre to good notices.

The Globe was the home of a resident theatre cat named Beerbohm, after actor Herbert Beerbohm Tree. The tabby&#x27;s portrait still hangs in the corridor near the stalls. Beerbohm appeared on stage at least once in every production, forcing the actors to improvise. He always chose to occupy certain actors&#x27; dressing rooms while they were at the theatre, including Peter Bowles, Michael Gambon and Penelope Keith. Beerbohm was mentioned several times on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, and he was the only cat to have received a front-page obituary in the theatrical publication, &quot;The Stage&quot;. He died in March 1995 at the age of 20.
Refurbished in 1987, with extensive work on the gold leaf in the auditorium, the theatre is particularly notable for its beautiful circular Regency staircase, oval gallery and tower. The theatre has presented several Alan Ayckbourn premieres, including &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1990). Oscar Wilde&#x27;s classic comedy, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1992) and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (2004) saw notable revivals, and the Royal Shakespeare Company and others have brought several Shakespeare and classic play revivals to the theatre in recent decades. The 2007 production of &quot;Equus&quot; attracted considerable press for the nude appearance of 17-year-old Daniel Radcliffe, who was still filming the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. The production was successful enough to transfer to Broadway and ran to 2009 there. Musicals returned in 2009 with a transfer of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, and then a transfer from Broadway of &quot;Hair&quot; the next year, followed by the West End premiere of the stage version of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; before it went on tour.

In 1994, in anticipation of the 1997 opening of the reconstruction of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre on the South Bank, to avoid public confusion, the theatre was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in honour of John Gielgud. The Globe&#x27;s theatre cat, named Beerbohm, became famous enough to receive a front-page obituary in the theatrical publication &quot;The Stage&quot; in 1995. In 2003, Cameron Mackintosh announced plans to refurbish the Gielgud, including a joint entrance foyer with the adjacent Queen&#x27;s Theatre, facing on to Shaftesbury Avenue. Mackintosh&#x27;s Delfont Mackintosh Theatres took over operational control of the Gielgud from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Theatres in 2006.

Work on the facade of the theatre started in March 2007 and the interior restoration, including reinstating the boxes at the back of the dress circle, was completed in January 2008. The theatre is one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series &quot;Great West End Theatres&quot;, presented by Donald Sinden.

<doc id="597080" wikidata="Q737825" url="?curid=597080" title="Washington Park (community area), Chicago">
<text>Washington Park is a community area on the South Side of Chicago which includes the 372 acre (1.5 km) park of the same name, stretching east-west from Cottage Grove Avenue to the Dan Ryan Expressway, and north-south from 51st Street to 63rd. It is home to the DuSable Museum of African American History. The park was the proposed site of the Olympic Stadium and the Olympic Aquatics Center in Chicago&#x27;s bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.

It and surrounding neighborhoods have gone through notable and often turbulent racial transitions.

==History==

In the mid-to-late 19th century, a large number of Irish and German railroad workers and meatpackers made Washington Park home. There was a sprinkling of African American residents in the working-class district south of Garfield Boulevard/55th Street. Affluent American-born European Americans settled the wide north-south avenues that provided a direct route into the Loop to the north. Cable cars, the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; and wide boulevards contributed to late 19th century prosperity. The wide avenues, especially Grand Boulevard (now named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Drive), provided popular locations for mansions and grand apartments built by many wealthy Chicagoans.

The park in this community area was named for President George Washington in 1880. In the 1920s, the University of Chicago created the community area system of city subdivision with the current names that continue to be used today. The community areas although not formally adopted by the United States Census Bureau are largely consistent with census tract boundaries. The Washington Park community area and its census tracts have been unchanged.

=== Changing demographics ===
A turn-of-the-20th-century housing construction boom along with increases in the African American population of the midwest during the Great Migration resulted in the movement of lower-income and predominantly African American Chicagoans southward. Soon, the European-American inhabitants mostly left the area, in a phenomenon often termed &quot;white flight&quot;. The transition was rapid and marked with conflicts such as the Race Riot of 1919. Some white Protestants left to form an exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Black people and Jews from membership.

The area rapidly changed from European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the population was only 7.8% white. By 1960, the population was 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 the total population of the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which allowed redevelopment authorities that acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.

== Religion ==
Religion and worship are cornerstones of the South Side communities. The nearby hub of Bronzeville at 47th and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (known as King Drive and formerly Grand Boulevard) was a cultural hub of the neighborhood that fostered a cultural identity. In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions.

== Structures ==
The neighborhood once contained many public housing complexes including about a third of the nation&#x27;s largest, the Robert Taylor Homes. The Taylor homes have been demolished because of the socioeconomic problems that they perpetuated. The area has minimal industry or commerce at the current time. The other property on the NRHP in the area is the Schulze Baking Company Plant.

The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973. It is a Washington Park landmark and one of the largest African American museums in the country.

=== Namesakes ===
Several nearby regions and institutions use Washington Park in their name. Immediately to the south, Washington Park Subdivision exists where Washington Park Race Track once stood. One city block to the north, Washington Park Court District is a neighborhood that has become a Chicago Landmark.

==In literature and culture==
The Washington Park neighborhood has been the setting for works of popular literature. James T. Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot; trilogy is set in Washington Park. In Richard Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Native Son&quot;, Bigger Thomas drives the drunken Jan Erlone and Mary Dalton around Washington Park, as the two embrace. In addition to hosting the DuSable Museum, the park hosts &quot;Fountain of Time&quot;, the world&#x27;s earliest concrete finished art work.

Additionally, the aforementioned adjacent Washington Park Subdivision has been the subject of notable literature. The conditions of this neighborhood are described in a section of &quot;Black Metropolis&quot; by St. Clair Drake and Horace Roscoe Cayton.

The play &quot;Raisin in the Sun&quot; was inspired by Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s time in the neighborhood after her father won the repeal of restrictive covenants. The Hansberry house, the red brick three-flat at 6140 S. Rhodes Avenue which they bought in 1937, is up for landmark status before the Chicago City Council&#x27;s Committee on Historical Landmarks Preservation.

<doc id="597093" wikidata="Q3194750" url="?curid=597093" title="Keith Milligan">
<text>Keith Wayne Milligan (born February 8, 1950) is a Canadian politician who was the 29th premier of Prince Edward Island, serving for seven weeks in the autumn of 1996. He was educated at Inverness District School, O&#x27;Leary Regional High School and the University of PEI, where he obtained Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education degrees. He is married to the former Deborah Foley and they reside in Tyne Valley. They have three children - Charles Christian (Jolene), Olivia (Shawn) and Dustin.

==Provincial politics==
He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of PEI in a by-election on February 2, 1981, and was re-elected in the general elections of 1982, 1986, 1989, 1993 and 1996. He served as interim Leader of the Opposition and Critic for Education. In 1986 he was appointed Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for the Hospital and Health Services Commission. In 1989, Milligan was appointed Minister of Agriculture. In 1993 he was appointed Minister of Education and Human Resources and in 1994 he was appointed Minister of Transportation and Public Works.

===Brief tenure as Premier===
In October 1996, he was chosen leader of the governing Liberal party and became Premier, following Catherine Callbeck&#x27;s resignation. Milligan&#x27;s Liberals lost the following November provincial election to Pat Binns&#x27; Progressive Conservatives.

==Federal politics==
Having announced he would be seeking the Liberal nomination in the federal riding of Egmont, on November 3, 2007, at the nominating Liberal convention, he lost the nomination to Robert Morrissey. When Morrissey stepped down, however, Milligan was acclaimed as the new candidate on September 5, 2008. He lost to Conservative candidate, Gail Shea in the 2008 election, in one of the narrowest results in the country. A requested recount did not affect the result, and Milligan conceded.

==Since 2008==
Milligan is a former elk farmer and silver fox rancher. He has previously been employed as a teacher with the Unit 1 School board and Regional Director of the West Prince Services Centre. He has been vice-president of the Tyne Valley Community Oyster Festival, a member of the West Prince Community Advisory Board, the Canadian National Fur Breeders&#x27; Association, the PEI Fur Breeders&#x27; Association, the Tyne Valley Fireman&#x27;s Club and the Tyne Valley Community Sports Centre.

<doc id="597105" wikidata="Q5597547" url="?curid=597105" title="Grasshopper escapement">
<text>The grasshopper escapement is a low-friction escapement for pendulum clocks invented by British clockmaker John Harrison around 1722. An escapement, part of every mechanical clock, is the mechanism that gives the clock&#x27;s pendulum periodic pushes to keep it swinging, and each swing releases the clock&#x27;s gears to move forward by a fixed amount, thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate. The grasshopper escapement was used in a few regulator clocks built during Harrison&#x27;s time, and a few others over the years, but has never seen wide use. The term &quot;grasshopper&quot; in this connection, apparently from the kicking action of the pallets, first appears in the &quot;Horological Journal&quot; in the late 19th century.

==History==

John Harrison used the grasshopper escapement in his regulator clocks, and also for the first three of his marine timekeepers, H1 - H3. Determining longitudinal position was a major problem in marine navigation; Newton argued that astronomical positioning could be used, but an easier theoretical possibility was to use accurate knowledge of the time at a specific base location. The difference in time between local time, which was easy to measure, and the time at the base gives the difference in longitude between the base and the ship, since 24 hours of time is equivalent to 360 degrees of longitude. A large prize was offered for a solution to the problem and Harrison devoted his life to devising and building highly accurate timekeepers. Precision and friction were the main problems. Two advantages of the grasshopper escapement are the repeatability of its operation and that it does not need lubrication. The repeatability of its operation is inherent in its design. One pallet is released only by the engagement of the other; the impulse given to the pendulum is thus completely regular in its timing. Lubricants available to Harrison were poor, messy and short-lived. This meant that conventional clocks had to be stopped frequently for cleaning and oiling. Using his clean and absolutely stable grasshopper escapement Harrison began a series of long-term investigations into the performance of clocks, leading to his invention of the gridiron pendulum which counteracted the effects of expansion and contraction with changing temperature. The performance of his improved clocks in turn gave him an accurate, convenient standard against which to test his marine timekeepers.

==Operation==
Harrison developed the grasshopper escapement from a conventional anchor escapement which he built for a turret clock to go in the stable block at Brocklesby Hall in Lincolnshire. This proved to be unreliable, needing repeated attention by which Harrison was inconvenienced, so around 1722 he modified the escapement by putting a hinge in the middle of each arm of the anchor. The hinged pallets both pointed the same way, opposing the rotation of the escape wheel. As the escape wheel pushes the pallet, the hinge moves away from the escape wheel. The pallet pivots about its contact point with the wheel as it pushes the anchor. At the same time, the other pallet is approaching the wheel. When it contacts the wheel, it pushes it backwards slightly and contact between the wheel and the first pallet is broken. Both the pallets are slightly tail-heavy so that they naturally tend to move away from the wheel. The first pallet therefore moves out of the path of the escape wheel and the job of impulsing the pendulum passes to the second pallet.

The first pallet comes to rest against a stop which holds it in the correct position so that when the pendulum is reaching the end of its travel, pushed by the second pallet, the first pallet swings down into the path of the wheel again. It makes contact with the wheel and, driven by the momentum of the pendulum, pushes the wheel backwards slightly. This releases the second pallet, which retires gracefully to its stop, having transferred the task of impulsing the pendulum to the first pallet again. The small movement of the pallet on its hinge involves far less friction than the sliding contact in a conventional escapement; it needs no lubrication and there is so little wear that Harrison was able to make his pallets from wood. One of the original pallets at Brocklesby Park was still working when the clock was renovated in 2005 while the other was only replaced following an accident in 1880. Harrison later modified the layout of the escapement by having one pallet pull rather than push, putting a little hook at the end of the pivoted arm to contact the teeth of the escape wheel. He also put both hinge axes together on a common pin.

When the pallet is pushing the escape wheel backwards it is also being driven hard against its stop. To prevent wear, or damage, the stops are designed to give way. Each stop is hinged about the same axis as its pallet. The pallets are tail-heavy but the stops are nose-heavy, tending to fall towards the wheel. The stops are sufficiently nose-heavy that the combination of pallet plus stop also tends to fall towards the wheel but this is prevented by a fixed pin on the anchor. This means that the pin holds the stop which holds the pallet in just the right place to engage cleanly with the escape wheel. When the pallet meets the wheel, it pushes the wheel backwards and as it does it lifts the stop off its pin. When the wheel then pushes the pallet, the stop comes back down onto its pin and parts company with its pallet. Each stop is also lifted off its pin once in each cycle by the momentum of the arriving pallet.

==Limitations==

The tendency of the pallets to move out of the way of the wheel has some serious consequences. The first is that any time that the drive to the escape wheel is interrupted the pallets lose contact and when the drive is restored, the escape wheel may not be restrained and may accelerate rapidly and uncontrollably. To prevent this happening while the clock was being wound, Harrison invented one of his longest-lasting mechanisms, a maintaining power which is still widely used in clocks and watches. In its usual construction this consists of a ratchet wheel sandwiched between, and co-axial with, the first (and slowest-turning) driving gear of the movement and the barrel that the weight (or spring) is attached to. When the clock is wound, the barrel goes backwards and a ratchet on the maintaining wheel slips over teeth cut on the barrel. The first gear is still driven forward however because there is a spring between the maintaining wheel and the first gear which pushes against it. As it does so it tries to push the maintaining wheel backwards. This is prevented from happening by a pawl fixed to the frame of the clock which engages with teeth cut round the edge of the maintaining wheel. Once the clock is fully wound, pressure on the key is released and the barrel drives the maintaining wheel and the first gear in the normal way. It also rewinds the maintaining spring ready for the next time the clock is wound. During normal operation the pawl that stops the maintaining wheel from going backwards simply slips over the teeth of the maintaining wheel.

The second consequence of the pallets&#x27; tendency to move out of the way of the wheel is that when the clock runs down and stops both pallets return to their stops. Unless the ends of one or both pallets are long enough to sit into the gap between the teeth of the escape wheel then the wheel will run free as soon as the clock is wound. The same problem can arise if the hinges for the stops get dirty and stick in their raised position.

In common with other less accurate escapements, the grasshopper pushes the pendulum back and forth throughout its cycle; it is never allowed to swing freely. This disturbs the pendulum&#x27;s natural motion as a harmonic oscillator. Around the same time as Harrison invented the grasshopper, George Graham introduced an improved version of the deadbeat escapement, originally invented by Richard Towneley in 1675, which allowed the pendulum to swing virtually undisturbed during most of its cycle. This accurate escapement became the standard in precision regulator clocks.

Because of these various idiosyncrasies, the grasshopper escapement was never used widely. Harrison used it in his prototype marine chronometers, H1 - H3, and Justin and Benjamin Vulliamy made a small number of regulators using Harrison&#x27;s design, but it remains today what it was in Harrison&#x27;s time: a brilliant, unique curiosity.

== John Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Clock&quot; ==

A unique public clock built as a tribute to John Harrison&#x27;s grasshopper escapement, the Corpus Clock, was unveiled at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, in Cambridge, England on 19 September 2008. Industrialist John Taylor spent £1 million building the mechanical clock. Feeling that Harrison&#x27;s escapement was not well enough known, the clock&#x27;s grasshopper escapement is exposed on the top of the clock, built in the form of a demonic grasshopper called the &quot;Chronophage&quot; or &quot;time eater&quot;, which rhythmically opens and closes its jaws, representing time being devoured.

The clock, 1.5 metres in diameter, has many other notable features. It has no hands, but rather uses three concentric pairs of stacked annular disks—one pair each for hours, minutes and seconds—slotted and lensed to allow the selective escape of light from an enclosed, continuously lit set of light emitting diodes. The arrangement of slots in each disk, along with the rotation of the foremost disk of each pair, creates a Vernier effect, producing the illusion of lights rotating at various speeds about three concentric circumferences on the clock&#x27;s face.

The pendulum speeds up, slows down, and sometimes stops, but returns to the correct time every five minutes. Taylor designed the clock to remind himself of his own mortality.

== Parmigiani &quot;Senfine&quot; ==
A grasshopper-type escapement is used in an entirely new mechanism intended for wristwatches. This new type of mechanical regulator uses flexible structures both in the escapement and the oscillator. A silicon wheel oscillates about 86,400 times an hour, approximately three times faster than in conventional wristwatches. The initial development was done at the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) with Pierre Genequand, a Swiss physicist, as lead inventor. By eliminating friction as much as possible, such a watch can run for more than a month after rewinding, an exceptional power-reserve. The prototype of such a new calibre (movement) has been exhibited by Parmigiani Fleurier.

== Burgess Clock B ==

A grasshopper escapement is an essential part of a sculptural clock by Martin Burgess, known as Burgess Clock B. One of a pair based on the technology of the late regulator clock by John Harrison, it was completed by Charles Frodsham &amp; Company at the request of its owner, Donald Saff. After successful testing there it was transferred to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich for a detailed assessment of its long-term performance. This was overseen by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers and the National Physical Laboratory, whose representatives attached tamper-proof seals to the case of the clock. Although the clock is electrically wound, thus preventing any disturbance whatever of the clock during the assessment, it is otherwise entirely mechanical. At the end of a period of one hundred days, the maximum error had not exceeded five-eighths of a second - no allowance for a steady drift of time (rate) having had to be applied. As a result, on the 18th of April 2015, the Guinness World Records organisation presented a World Record certificate to Martin Burgess for having made the most accurate purely mechanical clock working in free air. The clock remains at the ROG; in 2017 it was moved to the gallery containing the Harrison marine timekeepers where its performance continues to be monitored.

<text>Beatrice &quot;Bice&quot; di Folco Portinari (; 1265 – 8 or 19 June 1290) was an Italian woman who has been commonly identified as the principal inspiration for Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;, and is also identified with the Beatrice who acts as his guide in the last book of his narrative poem the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (&quot;La Divina Commedia&quot;), &quot;Paradiso&quot;, and during the conclusion of the preceding &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. In the &quot;Comedy&quot;, Beatrice symbolises divine grace and theology.

==Biography==
Beatrice was the daughter of the banker Folco Portinari and was married to another banker, Simone dei Bardi. Dante claims to have met a &quot;Beatrice&quot; only twice, on occasions separated by nine years, but was so affected by the meetings that he carried his love for her throughout his life. The tradition that identifies Bice di Folco Portinari as the Beatrice loved by Dante is now widely, though not unanimously, accepted by scholars. Boccaccio, in his commentary on the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, was the first one to explicitly refer to the woman; all later references are dependent on his unsubstantiated identification. Clear documents on her life have always been scarce, rendering even her existence doubtful. The only hard evidence is the will of Folco Portinari from 1287, which says, &quot;&quot;Item d. Bici filie sue et uxoris d. Simonis del Bardis reliquite&quot; [...], &quot;lib.50 ad floren.&quot;&quot; The sentence is essentially a bequest to Portinari&#x27;s daughter, who was married to Simone dei Bardi. Portinari was a rich banker, born in Portico di Romagna. He moved to Florence and lived in a house near Dante where he had six daughters. Portinari also gave generously to found the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova.

==In the works of Dante Alighieri==
Scholars have long debated whether the historical Beatrice should be identified with the Beatrice of Dante&#x27;s writing. Certainly Beatrice Portinari fits the broad biographical criteria, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that she and Dante knew each other—but the Beatrice of Dante&#x27;s canon doesn&#x27;t seem to rely on any such correspondence and exists as a literary character who bears only a passing resemblance to her historical antecedent.

=== &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; ===
Beatrice first appears in the autobiographical text &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, which Dante wrote around 1293. The &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; autoethnographical poetry and prose present Beatrice, and the poet&#x27;s passion for her, in the context of Dante&#x27;s own social and romantic reality. Dante&#x27;s portrayal of Beatrice in the &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; is unambiguously positive, but at this early stage resembles the more generic attitude of the courtly lady, rather than the sharply defined personality for which Beatrice is famous in the &quot;Commedia&quot;.

According to Dante, he first met Beatrice when his father, Alighiero di Bellincione, took him to the Portinari house for a May Day party. They were both nine years old at the time, though Beatrice was a few months younger. Dante was instantly taken with her and remained so throughout his life in Florence—even though she married another man, the banker Simone de&#x27; Bardi, in 1287. For his part, Dante married Gemma Donati, a cousin of one of the most politically prominent families in Florence, in 1285. Despite this entanglement, he seems to have retained some feeling for Beatrice, even after her death in 1290. As Dante tells us in the &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;, he withdrew into intense study after Beatrice&#x27;s death and began composing poems dedicated to her memory. The collection of these poems, along with others he had previously written in praise of Beatrice, became what we now know as the &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;.

The manner in which Dante chose to express his love for Beatrice, in both the &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; and &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, is in line with the medieval notion of courtly love. Courtly love was a sometimes secret, often unrequited, and always respectful form of admiration for a lady. It is also first and foremost a literary conceit, rather than an actual form of intimacy. It was not uncommon for the lady in question to have no idea of her courtly admirer, and for the admirer in question not to be interested in a real relationship at all. Instead, the courtly lady serves as a subject for the lover to exercise his poetic skill, or even to discuss philosophy, in the practice of praising her. Whether or not Dante had any feelings for his neighbor Beatrice Portinari, courtly love is the modality he chooses to convey his passion, which suggests a degree of remove (at least) between historical reality and autobiographical narrative.

=== &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ===
At the beginning of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, when Virgil appears to guide Dante through the afterlife, he explains that he was sent by Beatrice. She herself was moved to intercede by the Virgin Mary and Saint Lucia. She is referenced frequently throughout his journey through hell and purgatory as a source of inspiration and comfort.

Beatrice personally appears near the end of the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; to take over as guide from the Latin poet Virgil because, as a pagan, Virgil cannot enter Paradise. Moreover Beatrice, being the incarnation of beatific love (as her name implies), is uniquely suited to lead the pilgrim into the realm of divine bliss. Naturally, then, it&#x27;s Beatrice who must lead the pilgrim into heaven. Where Virgil is understood as human reason and philosophy, Beatrice represents religious knowledge and passion: theology, faith, contemplation, and grace. Philosophy is suited to guide the pilgrim through the less holy realms of sin and repentance, but only divine faith can completely lead the soul to God.

Despite representing divine love, Beatrice&#x27;s appearance to Dante in the Garden of Eden in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; is not a joyous reunion. She berates him for weeping when Virgil disappears, and then for abandoning her memory after her death and indulging in sin to such a degree that she had to intercede on his behalf to save him. As Beatrice guides Dante through the spheres of Heaven, she grows increasingly beautiful and indescribable, representing Dante&#x27;s progress towards God. She frequently corrects Dante during his journey, acting as a spiritual guide and source of wisdom. Contrary to her initial harsh treatment, throughout &quot;Paradiso&quot; Beatrice is encouraging and patient towards Dante, taking joy in his gradual progress. When they reach the Empyrean, she leaves him to take her proper place there. Saint Bernard guides Dante for the final portion of his journey. He points out Beatrice&#x27;s place in the Empyrean among several glorified women from the Bible.

Dante compares Beatrice&#x27;s direction of the pageant of the Church in the Garden to an admiral commanding his ship, an unusual masculine simile that has troubled the critical reading of Beatrice as a courtly lady. Her digressions on multiple academic subjects in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; also diverge from the typical portrayal of the courtly beloved, who exists as an object of praise, rather than a subject of discourse. For example, the first of these discourses is on optics, concerning the markings on the moon, and the scientific method in general. She is frequently viewed as a Christ figure, owing to her death, the &quot;new life&quot; Dante finds through her in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, and her interceding before God to save Dante&#x27;s soul in the &quot;Comedy&quot;.

==Legacy==

=== Modern art ===
Beatrice Portinari has been immortalized not only in Dante&#x27;s poems but in paintings by Pre-Raphaelite artists and poets in the nineteenth century. Subjects taken from Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, especially the idealization of Beatrice, inspired a great deal of Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s art in the 1850s, in particular after the death of his wife Elizabeth Siddal. He idealized her image as Dante&#x27;s Beatrice in a number of paintings, such as &quot;Beata Beatrix.&quot;

=== In popular culture ===
Asteroid 83 Beatrix in the asteroid belt is named in her honor, befitting of her role as Dante&#x27;s guide through the heavenly spheres.

The Dante Alighieri Academy Beatrice Campus, a Catholic high school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is named after Portinari.

In the book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket, Snicket&#x27;s love interest is named Beatrice. The relationship between the characters is very similar to that of Beatrice Portinari and Dante.

In the 2014 animated miniseries &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, the main characters Wirt and Greg are guided through the Unknown, a place implied to be the afterlife, by a bluebird named Beatrice. This is one of many parallels between the two works.

<text>The King&#x27;s Men was the acting company to which William Shakespeare (1564–1616) belonged for most of his career. Formerly known as the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, they became the King&#x27;s Men in 1603 when King James I ascended the throne and became the company&#x27;s patron.

The royal patent of 19 May 1603 which authorised the King&#x27;s Men company named the following players, in this order: Lawrence Fletcher, William Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, John Heminges, Henry Condell, William Sly, Robert Armin, Richard Cowley, &quot;and the rest of their associates...&quot; The nine cited by name became Grooms of the Chamber. On 15 March 1604, each of the nine men named in the patent was supplied with four and a half yards of red cloth for the coronation procession.

==Chronologically typed==
===To 1610===
In their first winter season, between December 1603 and February 1604 the company performed eight times at Court and eleven times in their second, from November 1604 through February 1605, including seven plays by Shakespeare and two by Ben Jonson. This represented a workload twice as great as was typical under Elizabeth. The King&#x27;s Men needed more men, and in 1604 the number of sharers was increased from eight or nine, ten, eleven and twelve. The new sharers included John Lowin, Alexander Cooke, and Nicholas Tooley.

May 1605 brought the death of Augustine Phillips. In his will, Phillips left legacies to Shakespeare, Burbage, and eight other members of the company, plus two apprentices, and £5 to the hired men &quot;of the company which I am of&quot;. (Phillips also leaves a bequest to Christopher Beeston, as a former &quot;servant&quot;. Beeston was almost certainly another former apprentice.)

The company gave ten court performances in the winter of 1605–06 and, unusually, three Court performances in the summer of 1606, during a state visit by the King of Denmark. Each Court performance earned them £10. They also toured that summer, and were in Oxford at the end of July, among other stops. Nine performances at Court marked the winter of 1606-07, including a performance of 26 December of &quot;King Lear;&quot; the following winter, 1607–08, saw thirteen Court appearances.

From July to December 1608 the theatres were closed due to plague. The King&#x27;s Men toured the countryside; they were in Coventry in late October. The Blackfriars Theatre, owned by the Burbage family, was organised into a partnership in August that year, with five of the seven shares going to members of the King&#x27;s Men – Shakespeare, Burbage, Heminges, Condell, and Sly. Sly, however, died soon after, and his share was split among the other six. (The two non-actors involved in the arrangement were Cuthbert Burbage, Richard&#x27;s brother, and Thomas Evans, agent for theatre manager Henry Evans.)

The acquisition of the Blackfriars represented an enormous advantage for the company. It allowed the company to perform year round instead of only in clement weather. The Blackfriars hall is thought to have been , including the stage; its maximum capacity was likely in the hundreds of spectators. This can be compared with the maximum capacity at the Globe Theatre of 2500 to 3000. Yet the ticket prices at the Blackfriars were five to six times higher than those at the Globe. Globe tickets ranged from a penny to sixpence (1&quot;d&quot;. to 6&quot;d&quot;.); tickets at the Blackfriars ranged from sixpence to two shillings sixpence (6&quot;d&quot;. to 2&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;.; 1 shilling = 12 pence). The cheapest admission at the Blackfriars equalled the most expensive at the Globe; the most expensive seat at the Blackfriars cost five times as much as its Globe counterpart. Adding the Blackfriars to the Globe should have allowed the King&#x27;s Men to at least double their income from public performances.

Their new wealth allowed the King&#x27;s Men to overcome major adversity: when the Globe Theatre burned down in 1613 (see below), the company could afford an expensive rebuild, replacing the vulnerable thatch roof with tile. The fact that the King&#x27;s Men had a second theatre meant that they did not lose all their playscripts and costumes, as happened to the Admiral&#x27;s/Palsgrave&#x27;s Men in the Fortune Theatre fire of December 1621 (a disaster that was, for that company, the beginning of the end).

1609 was another plague year during which the company travelled, although nine plays were still performed at Court. (Royal patronage was an advantage in difficult times: special payments in times of plague were made to the company in 1603, 1608, 1609, and 1610.)

1610 was a better year, with public performances at the Globe – &quot;Othello&quot; and Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot; among others. By this time the company had been augmented by John Underwood and William Ostler, both veterans of the Children of the Chapel/Queen&#x27;s Revels company. The company left London and performed in Oxford in August, 1610. They were paid by the Oxford Municipal Authorities. A letter by Oxford student at Corpus Christi, Henry Jackson and dated September 1610 and in latin, describes the King&#x27;s Men performing Ben Jonson&#x27;s The Alchemist and describes Desdemona (in Othello) both of which had been performed earlier that year in London. The record is held at Corpus Christi and a copy can be viewed at the Folger Exhibition, Shakespeare Documented.

===To 1616===
In 1611 Jonson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was performed; apart from Richard Robinson&#x27;s substitution for Armin, the cast roster was the same as for &quot;Sejanus&quot; the previous year. This may have been John Heminges&#x27; last production; in 1613 he&#x27;s described as &quot;stuttering.&quot; Heminges normally received the payments for the company&#x27;s Court performances, as far back as 1595; he continued to be active in the company&#x27;s financial affairs even after he left the stage.

Between October 1611 and April 1612 the King&#x27;s Men performed 22 plays at Court, including &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Their connection with &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; also dates from this period; the manuscript of that play reveals that Robert Gough was cast as Memphonius, while Richard Robinson was the Lady.

On Sunday 12 and Monday 13 January 1612, the King&#x27;s Men joined with Queen Anne&#x27;s Men to give Court performances of two Queen&#x27;s Men&#x27;s plays by Thomas Heywood, &quot;The Silver Age&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece.&quot; No cast list for these performances has survived; but given the two companies&#x27; known personnel, this might have been the first time Christopher Beeston acted with his old colleagues since leaving the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men nearly a decade earlier.

In the winter of 1612–13, great Court festivities celebrating the marriage of the Elector Palatine to King James&#x27; daughter Princess Elizabeth were held. The King&#x27;s Men gave 20 performances, including seven plays by Shakespeare (&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; twice), one by Jon
&quot;Cardenio&quot; was performed again at Court on 8 June 1613, before the ambassador from Savoy. The second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 provides partial cast lists for three King&#x27;s Men productions from the c. 1613 period, for Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Bonduca&quot; and &quot;Valentinian&quot; and the Beaumont and Fletcher collaboration &quot;The Captain&quot;.

On 29 June 1613, the Globe Theatre burned down, its thatch roof set afire by squibs set off during a lavish performance of the Shakespeare/Fletcher &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. The Globe was rebuilt by the following spring, at a cost of £1400. The thatch roof was replaced with tile. During the winter of 1613–14 the company played at Court sixteen times.

In 1614 Alexander Cooke and William Ostler both died; their places as sharers were taken, perhaps, by William Ecclestone and Robert Benfield. Ostler&#x27;s death may have been sudden, and was problematic in that he died intestate. His father-in-law, John Heminges, seized control of his theatre shares. Ostler&#x27;s widow, Thomasine Heminges Ostler, sued her father in 1615 for control of the shares – a suit that was apparently unsuccessful.

In the winter of 1614–15 the King&#x27;s Men performed at Court only eight times, half their workload of the previous year. During the next winter, 1615–16, they were back up to fourteen Court performances.

On 23 April 1616, Shakespeare died. His role as the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s leading playwright would be filled by Fletcher and his various collaborators through the coming years, with Philip Massinger assuming greater prominence in the 1630s. Nathan Field joined the company in 1616; already a prominent actor, he would go on to write plays for the King&#x27;s Men in his all-too-brief career with the company.

===To 1623===
Nathan Field&#x27;s contribution to the King&#x27;s Men is illustrated by the play &quot;The Knight of Malta&quot;, which Field wrote with Fletcher and Massinger. The first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 gives a list of the principal cast in the company&#x27;s production of the play, which included Burbage, Field himself, John Underwood, Richard Sharpe, Henry Condell, Robert Benfield, John Lowin, and Thomas Holcombe. (Sharpe and Holcombe were boy actors with the company.) The date of this production is unknown, but it must have occurred in the 1616–19 era, between Field&#x27;s joining the company and Burbage&#x27;s death. Field may also have played the title role in George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; in this period. He is reported to have played the role at some time in his career, and the King&#x27;s Men had the play in their repertory for many years.

1619 was a pivotal year in the company&#x27;s history. The residents of the upscale Blackfriars neighbourhood, many of whom were wealthy and influential politically and socially, had never been happy about the presence of a theatre in their midst; in the spring of 1619 they complained more loudly than usual about the traffic problems associated with the theatre, which blocked access to the local churches. (All the playing companies were required to cease activity during Lent – a requirement they flouted whenever possible, often with impunity.) In response to this local opposition, the King&#x27;s Men obtained a renewal of their royal patent dated 27 March 1619. The patent named the twelve current shareholders in the company; in addition to the veterans Burbage, Lowin, Heminges, and Condell, the list includes William Ecclestone, Robert Gough, Richard Robinson, Nicholas Tooley, and John Underwood, and the newest members, Nathan Field, Robert Benfield, and John Shank.

Shank would be the company&#x27;s primary clown in the years to come; his specialties were dancing and knockabout physical comedy. He was a veteran of several troupes over the previous decades, going back perhaps to Pembroke&#x27;s Men and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Men in the reign of Elizabeth; he had been with the Admiral&#x27;s/Prince Henry&#x27;s/Palsgrave&#x27;s company in the 1610–13 period. Shank may have taken Robert Armin&#x27;s place in the King&#x27;s Men after Armin&#x27;s death in 1615. Shank also trained apprentices for the company – Thomas Holcombe, John Thompson, Thomas Pollard, and John Honyman. Robert Gough had been associated with the actors of the company perhaps as far back as 1591, when he may have been a boy player in &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;; he received a legacy in the 1603 will of Thomas Pope, and he witnessed the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips, whose sister he most likely married. Gough was never a prominent actor, and little is known about the roles he played.

In one particular, the new patent was out of date the day it was issued. On 13 March 1619, Richard Burbage died. In April or May Joseph Taylor transferred from Prince Charles&#x27;s Men to take Burbage&#x27;s place; he would play Hamlet and the other great Shakespeare/Burbage roles. Yet Burbage was missed: in May 1619 the Lord Chamberlain, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, wrote to a colleague that while others had gone to see a play, &quot;I being tender-hearted, could not endure to see so soon after the loss of my old acquaintance Burbage.&quot;

In August 1619, the company premiered its production of the controversial play &quot;John van Olden Barnavelt&quot;. And sometime in this immediate post-Burbage period, they must also have staged Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Humorous Lieutenant&quot;. The cast list for that play in the 1679 Beaumont and Fletcher folio is the only surviving list that includes both Taylor and Condell. Not long after this, Condell must have retired from the stage.

Another blow hit the company in the following year, 1620, when Nathaniel Field died at the young age of 33. His place as sharer was taken by John Rice.

The works of Fletcher and his collaborators, especially Massinger, continued to make up a significant portion of the company&#x27;s repertory in the 1619–22 era. Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Women Pleased&quot; and the Fletcher/Massinger collaborations &quot;The Custom of the Country&quot; and &quot;The Little French Lawyer&quot; were acted by the King&#x27;s Men in this period. Casts lists in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio give the same roster for all three plays: Taylor, Lowin, Underwood, Benfield, Tooley, Ecclestone, and the boys Richard Sharpe and Thomas Holcombe.

Around 1621, the King&#x27;s Men performed &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; again. When the play was first printed two years later, in 1623, the quarto featured a combined cast list for both the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s productions, c. 1614 and c. 1621 (the latter occurred between the deaths of Burbage in 1619 and Tooley in 1623). Together these cast lists give a mixed picture of change and stability in the company in this era.

In both productions, Tooley and Underwood played the &quot;Madmen&quot; in addition to their other roles. Along with the permanent company members or sharers, the cast included four hired men or boys, Pallant, Pollard, Sharpe, and Thompson; note also the doubling (and in the case of Pallant, more than doubling) of roles.

The Fletcher/Massinger collaboration &quot;The Sea Voyage&quot; was licensed by the Master of the Revels on 22 June 1622. On St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, 26 December 1622, The King&#x27;s Men acted another Fletcher/Massinger play, &quot;The Spanish Curate,&quot; at Court.

1623: The First Folio gives a list of names of the 26 &quot;principal actors&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, providing a fairly comprehensive roster of important members of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s/King&#x27;s Men through the previous thirty years. In addition to eight men on the original 1603 royal patent (Shakespeare, Burbage, Heminges, Condell, Phillips, Cowley, Sly, and Armin), the list includes William Kempe, Thomas Pope, George Bryan, John Lowin, Samuel Crosse, Alexander Cooke, Samuel Gilburne, William Ostler, Nathan Field, John Underwood, Nicholas Tooley, William Ecclestone, Joseph Taylor, Robert Benfield, Robert Gough, Richard Robinson, John Shank, and John Rice.

Sometime in 1623, the veteran clown William Rowley joined the King&#x27;s Men for the final two years in his stage career. He would play the Fat Bishop in the next year&#x27;s &quot;A Game at Chess&quot;. Richard Perkins, a leading actor from Queen Anne&#x27;s Men and the Red Bull company, also joined the King&#x27;s Men late in 1623.

===To 1642===
1624: Eliard Swanston left the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men to join the King&#x27;s Men. Previous Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s veterans to join include Nathan Field, John Rice, and (via Prince Charles&#x27;s Men) Joseph Taylor. Swanston is reported to have played Othello and Richard III during his years with the company (which extended at least through 1642).

Robert Gough died in 1624.

Also in 1624, the King&#x27;s Men gave their sensational production of Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Game at Chess&quot;, which ran for an unprecedented nine days straight (6–16 August, Sundays excepted), and also got them prosecuted and fined by the Privy Council. The company got into more trouble in December, for performing Massinger&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Viceroy&quot; without a license from the Master of the Revels.

The sharers in the King&#x27;s Men depended upon a crew of hired men to make their performances work. On 27 December 1624, Sir Henry Herbert issued a list of the company&#x27;s 21 hired men who could not be arrested or &quot;press&#x27;d for soldiers&quot; without the allowance of the Lord Chamberlain or the Master of the Revels. The list includes supporting actors like Robert Pallant, musicians, and functionaries like Edward Knight the prompter and John Rhodes the wardrobe keeper.

The spring of 1625 brought a period of uncertainty. The new king, Charles I, had long had his own troupe of actors, Prince Charles&#x27;s Men; would he make them the new King&#x27;s Men? The existing company&#x27;s established prestige – they were widely recognised the best in the land – led to a continuance of royal patronage. The Prince Charles&#x27;s company folded after their patron became king, with three of its members, Thomas Hobbs, William Penn, and Anthony Smith, joining the King&#x27;s Men. Though the early-to-mid-1620s was a period of economic depression in England, the King&#x27;s Men prospered: the company had fifteen sharers in 1625. This abundance of personnel allowed the company to stage productions with larger casts than before [see: &quot;The Lover&#x27;s Melancholy&quot;; &quot;The Novella&quot;].

Also in 1625, Richard Perkins terminated his brief period with the King&#x27;s Men to become the leading man of the newly formed Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men.

When the King&#x27;s Men premiered Massinger&#x27;s &quot;The Roman Actor&quot; late in 1626, the cast included a new boy player, John Honyman, aged 13. William Trigg was another boy playing female roles for the company in the 1626–32 period; but after that his activities are unknown.

Henry Condell died in December 1627. He left shares in the company&#x27;s theatres, the Blackfriars and the Globe, to his surviving family.

Opposition from the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Blackfriars neighbours reached another peak around 1630. In 1631 a commission investigated the possibility of buying out the Blackfriars property, and concluded that the company&#x27;s investment in the property, over the coming fourteen years of their unexpired lease, was £2900 13&quot;s&quot;. 4&quot;d&quot;. This figure, however, covered only theatre rent and interest; in response the King&#x27;s Men produced an itemised account of their investment, valuing the whole at £21,990, more than seven times as much as the commission&#x27;s figure. The company&#x27;s interest in the theatre was never bought out.

Upon John Heminges&#x27; death in 1630, his shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres passed to his son William. William Heminges&#x27;s disposal of his shares five years later would cause a major controversy within the company; see 1635 below.

The boy player Stephen Hammerton joined the King&#x27;s Men in 1632. Richard Sharpe died in the same year; he was the boy actor who played in both productions of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi,&quot; and later graduated to young male leads, as Hammerton would do over the coming decade.

In 1633, the company had difficulties with Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, over the content of their plays. On 19 October, Herbert forbad the performance of &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Prize,&quot; Fletcher&#x27;s sequel to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, because of its &quot;foul and offensive&quot; content. The company acted the Fletcher/Beaumont play &quot;The Scornful Lady&quot; instead. On 21 October, Herbert addressed a letter to Edward Knight, the &quot;book-keeper&quot; or prompter of the company, on the subject of the &quot;oaths, profaneness, and public ribaldry&quot; in their plays. And on 24 October, John Lowin and Eliard Swanston apologised to Herbert for giving offence. (Joseph Taylor and Robert Benfield were reportedly present at the meeting, but were uninvolved in either the offence or the apology; apparently Swanston and Lowin were in the cast of &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Prize&quot; but Benfield and Taylor were not.) After this incident, the King&#x27;s Men had their old play texts re-examined by Herbert for new productions, something that was previously not required. This meant more fees paid to Herbert.

The text of Fletcher&#x27;s play was repaired adequately by the next month, when the company performed &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Prize&quot; before the King and Queen at St. James&#x27;s Palace on 26 and 28 November 1633. According to Herbert, Shakespeare&#x27;s play was &quot;liked&quot;, but Fletcher&#x27;s play was &quot;very well liked.&quot;

On 7 April 1634, the King&#x27;s Men played George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; at Court. The title role was reportedly played by Eliard Swanston; Joseph Taylor, at this point in his career, was too &quot;grey&quot; for the role of a young firebrand. The company played the same play at Court again on 27 March 1638.

In the early 1630s, William Heminges sold off the theatre shares he&#x27;d inherited from his father upon John Heminges&#x27;s death (1630). He sold (clandestinely, perhaps) two shares in the Blackfriars and three in the Globe to King&#x27;s Man John Shank, for £506. In response to the sale, three other King&#x27;s Men, Eliard Swanston, Thomas Pollard, and Robert Benfield, appealed to the Lord Chamberlain (then Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke) for a chance to buy shares for themselves. Several documents in this matter, including back-and-forth statements from the three petitioners and from Cuthbert Burbage and John Shank, still exist; they contain abundant information on the company&#x27;s business c. 1635.

When the petitioners began their campaign, the eight Blackfriars shares were distributed this way: Shank held two, and Taylor, Lowin, Underwood, Cuthbert Burbage, Mrs. Condell (Henry Condell&#x27;s widow), and Winifred Robinson (Richard Burbage&#x27;s widow and Richard Robinson&#x27;s wife) had one each. Of the sixteen shares in the Globe, Cuthbert Burbage and Mrs. Robinson each owned three and a half shares, Shank had three, and Taylor, Lowin, and Mrs. Condell each owned two. Herbert ordered the existing shareholders to sell shares to Swanston, Benfield, and Pollard, though Burbage and Shank resisted.

The King&#x27;s Men accompanied Charles I on a royal progress in 1636. In so doing they evaded, at least to some degree, the consequences of the prolonged theatre closing due to plague in 1636–37. Comedian John Shank died in 1636, as did Cuthbert Burbage. A royal warrant of 1636 reveals that Shakespeare&#x27;s nephew William Hart (1600–39), the son of the poet&#x27;s younger sister Joan, was an actor in the company at the time.

In the later 1630s the company took up the practice of staging plays written by courtiers favoured by Queen Henrietta Maria, like William Cartwright&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Slave&quot; (1636) or Sir John Suckling&#x27;s &quot;Aglaura&quot; (1637); they were rewarded with the lavish costumes of the productions. The company&#x27;s repertory narrowed in this era; they produced fewer new plays, and those they did stage were mainly these subsidised courtly works. Their economic situation also worsened; from a high of fifteen in 1625, the number of sharers dropped to nine by 1636.

Unable to foresee the coming collapse of 1642, the King&#x27;s Men undertook a major expansion around 1640. They brought in five new men as actors and sharers: William Allen, Theophilus Bird, Michael Bowyer, Hugh Clark, and William Robbins. All five were veterans of Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men; and all five were made Grooms of the Chamber on 22 January 1641, along with Stephen Hammerton. With Massinger&#x27;s death in 1640, the troupe also needed a new house dramatist; James Shirley was recruited for the job. The company staged Shirley&#x27;s &quot;The Cardinal&quot; in 1641, and his &quot;The Sisters&quot; in the Spring of 1642. The production of Shirley&#x27;s next work, &quot;The Court Secret&quot;, was prevented by the theatre closure in September 1642.

===Aftermath===
1642: the Puritans in Parliament gained control over the city of London at the beginning of the English Civil War, and ordered the closing of all theatres on 2 September. The theatres remained officially closed until the Restoration in 1660.

In 1646, the King&#x27;s Men received back-pay from Parliament, money they were still owed for pre-1642 performances.

Clandestine and sporadic theatre activity occurred. 1647 was a year of relative official leniency, when theatrical performances were not uncommon. Ten actors signed the dedication in the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio as the King&#x27;s Men; these were Robert Benfield, Theophilus Bird, Hugh Clark, Stephen Hammerton, John Lowin, Thomas Pollard, Richard Robinson, Joseph Taylor, Eliard Swanston, and William Allen. The first seven men on that list also signed a contract as sharers in the King&#x27;s Men on 28 January 1648, showing that the company was re-activating, or attempting to re-activate, at that time. This iteration of the company collapsed in July the same year when it failed to make a payment.

Another attempt to revive the troupe followed during the winter of 1648–49, with a younger group of actors than the previous crew of veterans; this new group of 16 included Walter Clun and Charles Hart, who had played with the King&#x27;s Men as boys before the 1642 closing. These two plus eight others signed a contract on 27 December 1648 with one Walter Conway, an upholsterer who was their financier. This effort also failed, and was producing litigation as late as 1661.

Repression grew stronger after 1647: in February 1648 and January 1649, King&#x27;s Men players were arrested in the midst of performances. [See: &quot;Rollo Duke of Normandy&quot;.]

Some company members chose alternative careers; Eliard Swanston became a jeweller, while hired men Alexander Gough and Andrew Pennycuicke became stationers.

By the time the theatres formally re-opened in 1660, few of the old players and playwrights remained, and the old theatrical practices and traditions had largely been lost. Female roles were soon performed by women rather than boys [see Edward Kynaston; Margaret Hughes], and the open-air playhouses common in the past were no more; the more elite higher-priced indoor theatres became the norm.

Although a new King&#x27;s Company was established, it had little in common with its predecessor other than a royal patron (though a few members of the old company, like Charles Hart and Walter Clun, made the transition). The Restoration drama in which it participated was largely a new foundation. While Elizabethan and Jacobean classics were the mainstay of the Restoration repertory, many, particularly the tragedies, were adapted to conform to new tastes influenced by the French theatre of Louis XIV. The Elizabethan features of multitude of scenes, multitude of characters, and melange of genres lived on primarily in Restoration comedy.

Born in Montague, Prince Edward Island, Campbell was a teacher by profession before entering politics in 1970 and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island as a Liberal candidate. In 1972, he became Minister of Education; Provincial Secretary in 1974; and Minister of Finance in 1976.

When Liberal leader and PEI Premier Alexander B. Campbell (no relation) announced his retirement, Bennett Campbell was elected interim leader of the PEI Liberal Party by the caucus and was sworn in as premier on September 18, 1978. On December 9, he was elected leader at the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

His government was defeated in the general election held the next year. He remained party leader and leader of the opposition until he decided to enter federal politics. He won the seat for Cardigan in the House of Commons of Canada through a 1981 by-election following the death of Daniel J. MacDonald. On September 22, 1981, he took over Macdonald&#x27;s cabinet portfolio and became Minister of Veterans Affairs in the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He retained his portfolio when John Turner succeeded Trudeau as Liberal leader and prime minister, but lost his seat to Pat Binns in the 1984 election that brought down the short-lived Turner government.

In the 1986 provincial election, Campbell attempted to regain his former district of 3rd Kings, but lost to Progressive Conservative incumbent Joey Fraser by 16 votes.

On September 11, 2008, Campbell died of cancer.

<text>The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eighth, often shortened to Henry VIII, is a collaborative history play, written by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, based on the life of Henry VIII. An alternative title, , is recorded in contemporary documents, with the title not appearing until the play&#x27;s publication in the First Folio of 1623. Stylistic evidence indicates that individual scenes were written by either Shakespeare or his collaborator and successor, John Fletcher. It is also somewhat characteristic of the late romances in its structure. It is noted for having more stage directions than any of Shakespeare&#x27;s other plays.

During a performance of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; at the Globe Theatre in 1613, a cannon shot employed for special effects ignited the theatre&#x27;s thatched roof (and the beams), burning the original Globe building to the ground.

==Synopsis==
The play opens with a Prologue (by a figure otherwise unidentified), who stresses that the audience will see a serious play, and appeals to the audience members: &quot;The first and happiest hearers of the town,&quot; to &quot;Be sad, as we would make ye.&quot;

Act I opens with a conversation between the Dukes of Norfolk and Buckingham and Lord Abergavenny. Their speeches express their mutual resentment over the ruthless power and overweening pride of Cardinal Wolsey. Wolsey passes over the stage with his attendants, and expresses his own hostility toward Buckingham. Later Buckingham is arrested on treason charges—Wolsey&#x27;s doing.
The play&#x27;s second scene introduces King Henry VIII, and shows his reliance on Wolsey as his favourite. Queen Katherine enters to protest about Wolsey&#x27;s abuse of the tax system for his own purposes; Wolsey defends himself, but when the King revokes the Cardinal&#x27;s measures, Wolsey spreads a rumour that he himself is responsible for the King&#x27;s action. Katherine also challenges the arrest of Buckingham, but Wolsey defends the arrest by producing the Duke&#x27;s Surveyor, the primary accuser. After hearing the Surveyor, the King orders Buckingham&#x27;s trial to occur.

At a banquet thrown by Wolsey, the King and his attendants enter in disguise as masquers. The King dances with Anne Bullen.

Two anonymous Gentlemen open Act II, one giving the other an account of Buckingham&#x27;s treason trial. Buckingham himself enters in custody after his conviction, and makes his farewells to his followers and to the public. After his exit, the two Gentlemen talk about court gossip, especially Wolsey&#x27;s hostility toward Katherine. The next scene shows Wolsey beginning to move against the Queen, while the nobles Norfolk and Suffolk look on critically. Wolsey introduces Cardinal Campeius and Gardiner to the King; Campeius has come to serve as a judge in the trial Wolsey is arranging for Katherine.

Anne Bullen is shown conversing with the Old Lady who is her attendant. Anne expresses her sympathy at the Queen&#x27;s troubles; but then the Lord Chamberlain enters to inform her that the King has made her Marchioness of Pembroke. Once the Lord Chamberlain leaves, the Old Lady jokes about Anne&#x27;s sudden advancement in the King&#x27;s favour.
A lavishly-staged trial scene (Act II Scene 4) portrays Katherine&#x27;s hearing before the King and his courtiers. Katherine reproaches Wolsey for his machinations against her, and refuses to stay for the proceedings. But the King defends Wolsey, and states that it was his own doubts about the legitimacy of their marriage that led to the trial. Campeius protests that the hearing cannot continue in the Queen&#x27;s absence, and the King grudgingly adjourns the proceeding. (Act III) Wolsey and Campeius confront Katherine among her ladies-in-waiting; Katherine makes an emotional protest about her treatment.

Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey, and the Lord Chamberlain are shown (Act III Scene 2) plotting against Wolsey. A packet of Wolsey&#x27;s letters to the Pope have been re-directed to the King; the letters show that Wolsey is playing a double game, opposing Henry&#x27;s planned divorce from Katherine to the Pope while supporting it to the King. The King shows Wolsey his displeasure, and Wolsey for the first time realises that he has lost Henry&#x27;s favour. The noblemen mock Wolsey, and the Cardinal sends his follower Cromwell away so that Cromwell will not be brought down in Wolsey&#x27;s fall from grace.

The two Gentlemen return in Act IV to observe and comment upon the lavish procession for Anne Bullen&#x27;s coronation as Queen, which passes over the stage in their presence. Afterward they are joined by a third Gentleman, who updates them on more court gossip – the rise of Thomas Cromwell in royal favour, and plots against Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury. (Scene 2) Katherine is shown ill; is told of Wolsey&#x27;s death; has a vision of dancing spirits. Caputius visits her. Katherine expresses her continuing loyalty to the King, despite the divorce, and wishes the new queen well.

Act V is the climax of the play. The King summons a nervous Cranmer to his presence and expresses his friendship, telling Cranmer that &quot;Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted in us, thy friend&quot; (Act V Scene 1). The King confirms this friendship with the gift of a ring. Later, as a result of a carefully hatched plot, Cranmer is accused of heresy in the King&#x27;s Council and told that he is to be taken to the Tower as a prisoner; Cranmer defends himself vigorously and then shows the King&#x27;s ring (Act V Scene 2). The King enters, declaring Cranmer to be a &quot;good man&quot;, a title that few of the Council deserve. The plot has collapsed.

Queen Anne Bullen gives birth to a daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth. The King asks Cranmer to baptise and be a godfather to the child, &quot;a suit you must not deny me&quot;. The Chamberlain, the Porter and his Man have difficulties controlling the enthusiastic crowds that attend the infant Elizabeth&#x27;s christening. Cranmer delivers a peroration on the glories of the new-born princess&#x27;s future reign, &quot;Upon this land, a thousand thousand blessings&quot; (Act V Scene 4). The King responds, &quot;O lord Archbishop, thou hast made me now a man,&quot; and declares the day to be a holiday.

The Epilogue acknowledges that the play is unlikely to please everyone, but asks nonetheless for the audience&#x27;s approval.

==Sources==
As usual in his history plays, Shakespeare relied primarily on Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; to achieve his dramatic ends and to accommodate official sensitivities over the materials involved. Other material was sourced or adapted from the 1570 edition of Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs, for example Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s plea to Henry before the Legatine Court. Shakespeare not only telescoped events that occurred over a span of two decades, but jumbled their actual order. The play implies, without stating it directly, that the treason charges against the Duke of Buckingham were false and trumped up; and it maintains a comparable ambiguity about other sensitive issues. The disgrace and beheading of Anne Boleyn (here spelled &quot;Bullen&quot;) is carefully avoided, and no indication of the succeeding four wives of Henry VIII can be found in the play.

==Date==
Most modern scholars date &quot;Henry VIII&quot; to 1613, the year in which the Globe Theatre burned down during one of the play&#x27;s earliest known performances. One contemporary report states that the play was new at the time of the fire, having &quot;been acted not passing 2 or 3 times before&quot;.

Despite this evidence, there has been much debate about the date of the work. Nicholas Rowe in 1709 wrote that the play must date from after the death of Elizabeth in 1603 because its &quot;E[u]logy upon Q. Elizabeth, and her Successor K. James, in the latter end of his Henry VIII, is a Proof of that Play&#x27;s being written after the Accession of the latter of those two Princes to the Crown of England&quot;. Rowe was writing before the discovery of the document on the 1613 fire, which was first published by the 18th century scholar Thomas Tyrwhitt and seemed to confirm his view.

However, several 18th- and 19th-century scholars, including Samuel Johnson, Lewis Theobald, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, and James Halliwell-Phillipps, dated the play&#x27;s composition to before 1603. Malone suggested that the brief passage in praise of James was probably added for a performance during his reign but that the extended glorification of Elizabeth implies that it was intended for her ears. James &quot;hated her memory&quot;, so such praise was not likely to have been written under him. Malone mistook the 12 Feb 1604 Stationer&#x27;s Register entry of &quot;the Enterlude of K. Henry VIII&quot; (Samuel Rowley&#x27;s &quot;When You See Me You Know Me&quot;, 1605) as Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and he argued that the reference to the newness of the play in 1613 derived from the fact that it had been expanded with a new prologue and epilogue, perhaps written by Ben Jonson. In fact, Shakespeare&#x27;s play was first registered on 8 November 1623, along with 15 other previously unpublished works, in preparation for the publication of the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;. Halliwell-Phillipps also took the view that the play performed in 1613 was an altogether different work.

These views are no longer held by most modern scholars. Plays offering positive portrayals of major Tudor figures like Henry VIII (&quot;When You See Me You Know Me&quot;) and Queen Elizabeth (&quot;If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody&quot; by Thomas Heywood, 1605) were in fact performed, published, and re-published throughout the Stuart era. Since the play is now generally believed to be one of Shakespeare&#x27;s collaborations with John Fletcher, the 1613 date is consistent with other such collaborations.

==Authorship==

The play was published as the work of Shakespeare, and was accepted as such by scholars until 1850, when the possibility of collaboration with John Fletcher was first raised by James Spedding, an expert on Francis Bacon. Fletcher was the writer who replaced Shakespeare as the principal playwright of the King&#x27;s Men. He is known to have collaborated with Shakespeare on other plays, but there is no contemporary evidence of it for this play; the evidence lies in the style of the verse, which in some scenes appears closer to Fletcher&#x27;s typical style than Shakespeare&#x27;s. It is also not known whether Fletcher&#x27;s involvement can be characterised as collaboration or revision, though the apparent division of scenes between the writers strongly suggests the former.

Spedding and other early commentators relied on a range of distinctive features in Fletcher&#x27;s style and language preferences, which they saw in the Shakespearean play. For the next century the question of dual authorship was controversial, with more evidence accumulating in favour of the collaborative hypothesis. In 1966, Erdman and Fogel could write that &quot;today a majority of scholars accept the theory of Fletcher&#x27;s partial authorship, though a sturdy minority deny it.&quot;

An influential stylistic or stylometric study was undertaken by Cyrus Hoy, who in 1962 divided the play between Shakespeare and Fletcher based on their distinctive word choices, for example Fletcher&#x27;s uses of &quot;ye&quot; for &quot;you&quot; and &quot;&#x27;em&quot; for &quot;them&quot;. In the mid-nineteenth century, James Spedding had proposed a similar division based on the use of eleven-syllable lines; he arrived at the same conclusions Hoy would reach a century later. The Spedding-Hoy division is generally accepted, although subsequent studies have questioned some of its details.

The most common delineation of the two poets&#x27; shares in the play is this:

:Shakespeare: Act I, scenes i and ii; II,iii and iv; III,ii, lines 1–203 (to exit of King); V,i.
:Fletcher: Prologue; I,iii and iv; II,i and ii; III,i, and ii, 203–458 (after exit of King); IV,i and ii; V ii–v; Epilogue.

==Performance==

&quot;Henry VIII&quot; is believed to have been first performed as part of the ceremonies celebrating the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1612–1613, although the first recorded performance was on 29 June 1613. The performance is especially noteworthy because of the fire that destroyed the Globe Theatre during the performance, as described in several contemporary documents. These confirm that the fire took place on that date. The King&#x27;s Men were able to continue performances at the Blackfriars Theatre, their indoor playhouse, a venue having particular significance for contemporary audiences as it was the real location of the powerful trial scene in the play.

One often reported tradition associated with the play involves John Downes, prompter of the Duke of York&#x27;s Company from 1662 to 1706. In his &quot;Roscius Anglicanus&quot; (1708), Downes claims that the role of Henry VIII in this play was originally performed by John Lowin, who &quot;had his instructions from Mr. Shakespeare himself.&quot;

Fifteen years to the day after the fire, on 29 June 1628, The King&#x27;s Men performed the play again at the Globe. The performance was witnessed by George Villiers, the contemporary Duke of Buckingham (no relation to or descendant of the Duke of Buckingham portrayed in the play), who left half-way through, once the play&#x27;s Duke of Buckingham was executed. (A month later, Villiers was assassinated.)

During the Restoration era, Sir William Davenant staged a production, starring Thomas Betterton, that was seen by Pepys. Thomas Betterton played Henry in 1664, and Colley Cibber revived it frequently in the 1720s. A revival produced by Charles Calvert, who also played Wolsey, at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, opening on 29 August 1877, premiered music for the fifth act composed by Arthur Sullivan. Other Victorian stagings of the play were by David Garrick, Charles Kean, Henry Irving (who chose to play Wolsey, the villain and perhaps the showier role of the play, in 1888, with Ellen Terry as the noble Katherine of Aragon). The longest Broadway run the play has had is Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s 1916 production in which Lyn Harding played Henry and Tree played Wolsey, running 63 performances. Tree&#x27;s production was notable for its elaborate exploitation of the play&#x27;s pageantry, typical of the expensive and spectacular staging of the era. The production subsequently toured, with Sydney Greenstreet taking over the title role.

==Modern revivals==

The play&#x27;s popularity has waned since the mid-twentieth century, although Charles Laughton played Henry at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1933 and Margaret Webster directed it as the inaugural production of her American Repertory Company on Broadway in 1946 with Walter Hampden as Wolsey and Eva Le Gallienne as Katherine. John Gielgud played Wolsey, Harry Andrews the king and Edith Evans Katharine at Stratford in 1959.

Another notable production was the first at the reconstructed Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe from 15 May to 21 August 2010, as part of the theatre&#x27;s first season of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays, with cannon fire at the same point as the 1613 production and a cast including Dominic Rowan as Henry, Miranda Raison as Anne, Ian McNeice as Wolsey and Kate Duchêne as Katherine (with Raison also playing Anne in the same season&#x27;s &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot;). It was staged at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre (Washington, D.C.) from 12 October until 28 November 2010; this production added a puppeter-narrator, played by Louis Butelli, named for Henry VIII&#x27;s jester, Will Sommers, as well as the character of Mary I, played by Megan Steigerwald. A remount of that production also played at Alabama Shakespeare Festival in 2012.

In 2019 the play was done in repertory at the Studio Theatre at Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival. The production was filmed by Cineplex for broadcast in theatres; it has also aired on CBC in Canada.

<text>The Etruria Works was a ceramics factory opened by Josiah Wedgwood in 1769 in a district of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, which he named Etruria. The factory ran for 180 years, as part of the wider Wedgwood business.

Wedgwood kept his old works in the nearby town of Burslem at the Ivy House Works and the Brick House Works (demolished – the Wedgwood Institute is built on its site). At least initially, the Etruria Works made the more expensive &quot;ornamental&quot; stonewares Wedgwood was developing, while Burslem continued to produce the cheaper &quot;useful&quot; wares, such as transfer-printed creamware. 

In 1767 Wedgwood paid about three thousand pounds for his new site, which was then known as the Ridgehouse Estate. It lay directly in the path of the Trent and Mersey Canal of which Wedgwood was a promoter. On one side of the canal Wedgwood built a large house, Etruria Hall and on the other side the factory. His architect was Joseph Pickford.

== Wedgwood and Etruscan art ==

The motto of the Etruria works was &quot;Artes Etruriae Renascuntur&quot;. This may be translated from the Latin as &quot;The Arts of Etruria are reborn&quot;.
Wedgwood was inspired by ancient pottery then generally described as Etruscan, but now known to be mostly Ancient Greek pottery. In particular, he was interested in the painted vases which Sir William Hamilton began to collect in the 1760s while serving as British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples.
Hamilton&#x27;s collections were published as Etruscan, although the term was a misnomer, as many of the &quot;Etruscan&quot; items turned out to be pottery of ancient Greece.

More authentically Etruscan in inspiration was Wedgwood&#x27;s black basalt stoneware, which was already in development as the Etruria works were being built and came on the market in 1768. As with the black, burnished and unglazed bucchero pottery characteristic of genuinely Etruscan ceramics, Wedgwood&#x27;s &quot;Black Basaltes&quot; were fired in a reducing atmosphere, achieved by closing vents, where the oxygen-starved flames drew off the oxygen from iron oxides, rendering the ceramic body black, a color that was enriched and deepened with the addition of manganese to the clay.

The designers employed by Wedgwood, of whom John Flaxman is the most famous, were able to adapt this classical art for the eighteenth-century market. The products of Wedgwood&#x27;s factory were greatly admired in Britain and abroad. Some of Flaxman&#x27;s designs are still in production today.

== Factory organisation ==
Wedgwood used division of labour. The site, its appearance and organisation was documented in &quot;Artes Etruriae renascuntur; a record of the historical old works at Etruria as they exist today, forming an unique example of an eighteenth century English factory&quot; (1920).

== The twentieth century ==
There is a description of Etruria in the 1930s in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;English Journey&quot;. By this time the site was affected by mining subsidence, and plans were drawn for a new factory at Barlaston some miles south on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The new factory was built in 1938–40 and most of the old factory was demolished in the twentieth century after the Wedgwood company moved production to Barlaston.

== The site today ==
Little remains of the factory today, although one surviving structure has been protected since the 1970s as a listed building.

Between 1986 and 2013 the local newspaper &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was based on part of the site. As well as &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, the print plant in Etruria was responsible for printing Northern editions of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;.

<text>Joseph Hensley (12 June 1824 – 11 May 1894) was a Prince Edward Island politician. His father, Charles Hensley, had been a member of the legislative council and colonial treasurer. Hensley served briefly as Premier of Prince Edward Island in 1869 and then as an associate justice of the province&#x27;s Supreme Court for a quarter of a century.

==Background==
Josephy Hensley was born and educated in England. His family settled on PEI in 1841 where Hensley became a lawyer. He was appointed to the legislative council by George Coles and served as Attorney-General under Coles&#x27; various Liberal governments of the 1850s. In 1861, Hensley was elected to the House of Assembly in 1861 and became Coles&#x27; lieutenant in the legislature. When Coles retired as Liberal leader and Premier in 1869, Hensley succeeded him. Hensley only served in the office for a few months before accepting an appointment to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and was succeeded as premier by Robert Poore Haythorne.

Prior to becoming premier, while serving as Attorney General, Hensley was the prosecutor in the 1869 murder trial of George Dowie, who was executed in Prince Edward Island&#x27;s last public hanging. During his tenure as a Supreme Court associate justice, he presided over another sensational trial in the murder of Mary Tuplin, in which the defendant William Millman was convicted and hung in 1888.

Hensley&#x27;s death in 1894 at the age of 69 resulted from what was described as &quot;inflammation of the brain.&quot;

<text>The close front unrounded vowel, or high front unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound that occurs in most spoken languages, represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet by the symbol i. It is similar to the vowel sound in the English word &quot;meet&quot;—and often called long-e in American English. Although in English this sound has additional length (usually being represented as ) and is not normally pronounced as a pure vowel (it is a slight diphthong), some dialects have been reported to pronounce the phoneme as a pure sound. A pure sound is also heard in many other languages, such as French, in words like &quot;chic&quot;.

The close front unrounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the palatal approximant . They alternate with each other in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages, with the non-syllabic diacritic and are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound.

Languages that use the Latin script commonly use the letter to represent this sound, though there are some exceptions: in English orthography that letter is usually associated with (as in &quot;bite&quot;) or (as in &quot;bit&quot;), and is more commonly represented by , , , or , as in the words &quot;scene&quot;, &quot;bean&quot;, &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;niece&quot;, &quot;conceive&quot;; (see Great Vowel Shift). Irish orthography reflects both etymology and whether preceding consonants are broad or slender, so such combinations as , , and all represent .

<text>The close front rounded vowel, or high front rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. Across many languages, it is most commonly represented orthographically as (in German, Turkish, Estonian and Hungarian) or (in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish and Albanian) but also as (in French and Dutch and the Kernewek Kemmyn standard of Cornish); / (in the romanization of various Asian languages); (in Cyrillic-based writing systems such as that for Chechen); or (in Cyrillic-based writing systems such as that for Tatar).

Short and long occurred in pre-Modern Greek. In the Attic and Ionic dialects of Ancient Greek, front developed by fronting from back around the 6th to 7th century BC. A little later, the diphthong when not before another vowel monophthongized and merged with long . In Koine Greek, the diphthong changed to , likely through the intermediate stages and . Through vowel shortening in Koine Greek, long merged with short . Later, unrounded to , yielding the pronunciation of Modern Greek. For more information, see the articles on Ancient Greek and Koine Greek phonology.

The close front rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the labialized palatal approximant . alternates with in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages, with the non-syllabic diacritic and are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound.

In most languages, this rounded vowel is pronounced with compressed lips (&#x27;exolabial&#x27;). However, in a few cases the lips are protruded (&#x27;endolabial&#x27;).

==Close front compressed vowel==
The close front compressed vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, the compression of the lips can be shown with the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, though technically &#x27;spread&#x27; means unrounded.

===Features===


===Occurrence===
Because front rounded vowels are assumed to have compression, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have protrusion.

==Close front protruded vowel==

Catford notes that most languages with rounded front and back vowels use distinct types of labialization, protruded back vowels and compressed front vowels. However, a few languages, such as Scandinavian ones, have protruded front vowels. One of these, Swedish, even contrasts the two types of rounding in front vowels (see near-close near-front rounded vowel, with Swedish examples of both types of rounding).

As there are no diacritics in the IPA to distinguish protruded and compressed rounding, an old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for protruded front vowels. Another possible transcription is or (a close front vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.

Acoustically, this sound is &quot;between&quot; the more typical compressed close front vowel and the unrounded close front vowel .

<text>Wetaskiwin ( ) is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada. The city is located south of the provincial capital of Edmonton. The city name comes from the Cree word , meaning &quot;the hills where peace was made&quot;.

Wetaskiwin is home to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum, a museum dedicated to celebrating &quot;the spirit of the machine&quot; as well as the Wetaskiwin and District Heritage Museum, which documents the pioneer arrival and lifestyle in Wetaskiwin&#x27;s early years. Southeast of Wetaskiwin, the Alberta Central Railway Museum acknowledges the impact that the railway had on Central Alberta.

The city is well known in Western Canada for the slogan and jingle &quot;Cars cost less in Wetaskiwin&quot;, from the Wetaskiwin Auto Dealers Association. Both have been in print, radio, and television advertisements since the mid-1970s.

==History==
The future location of Wetaskiwin was once the site of a battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot, known as &quot;Wee-Tas-Ki-Win-Spatinow&quot; for &quot;the place where peace was made&quot;. In 1890, when the Calgary and Edmonton Railway was built, it became a whistle-stop, and was known as Siding 16. In 1892, when the area was surveyed, it was named Wetaskiwin to commemorate the battle. Shortly after the survey, a group of Scandinavian immigrants settled at the townsite. A number of businesses were established, as well as a newspaper, the &quot;Free Lance&quot;.

In 1900, a Baptist church was organized. One year later, the village, with a population of more than 500, and was officially incorporated.

By 1908, Wetaskiwin had a town hall and several churches. The town&#x27;s courthouse was built in 1909, and the water tower was built at about the same time.

After World War II, Wetaskiwin airport was founded; it later became the site of the Reynolds-Alberta Museum.

== Features and attractions ==

=== Water tower ===
Built in 1909, Wetaskiwin&#x27;s water tower is one of the oldest municipal water towers in Canada. The 42-metre-high structure has towered above Wetaskiwin since 1909 and holds 454,609 litres of water.

In 2004, Wetaskiwin City Council considered the possibility of demolishing the water tower, but concerned citizens convinced them the old tower was worth saving. Work to refurbish the tower began in 2005, and by 2006 the water tower was completely restored.

=== Peace cairn ===
The Wetaskiwin Peace Cairn commemorates 60 years of peace between the Blackfoot and Cree First Nations. This historic peace pact took place in a group of hills just north of present-day Wetaskiwin.

At the time of construction, school children each carried a rock and walked in a procession from their school to the hill where the cairn was to be erected.

The cairn was dedicated during the celebrations for Canada&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee on 2 July 1927.

===Manluk Centre===

The Manluk Centre is a 44,756 square foot facility that opened on 13 September 2014. The facility has the Flaman Fitness Facility on its second floor. Built over a two-year period, the facility was funded by contributions from local businesses and individuals. Amenities include a 25-metre pool, a leisure pool, a lazy river, wave machine, slides, whirlpool, and a steam room.

===City Hall===

The current City Hall was originally built as a courthouse, and was completed in 1908 at a cost of $75,000. It was one of seven such buildings commissioned by the new Province of Alberta between 1906 and 1912, under the direction of Provincial Architect A. M. Jeffers.

The building was constructed in modern renaissance style, with the outside being composed entirely of red brick. The front steps, the back steps, the columns, and the keystones are constructed of stone, and the foundation is made of concrete and rubble sheathed with sandstone from the Calgary area.

In the early years, the basement of the courthouse contained the jail cells, the caretaker&#x27;s residence, and the North-West Mounted Police residence. The cells are in their original state, and still contain the original carvings prisoners etched into the brick walls. The caretaker looked after the building and the grounds while his wife looked after the family, as well as feeding the prisoners and the members of the North-West Mounted Police housed there. In 1920, two German field cannons that were seized from Germany at the end of World War were placed on the front lawn of the Old Courthouse. These cannons, presented to the citizens of Wetaskiwin by the Dominion Government of Canada, served to honour the many men and women of this community who volunteered for active service.

In 1983, a new courthouse was built, and the old courthouse sat empty for more than two decades. In the late 1990s, a local developer approached the city with plans to renovate it as City Hall&#x27;s new home; after several meetings between the parties involved, the old courthouse was purchased by the city and renovation began in 2005. Glass was used to frame the new areas of the building; the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Aside from changes required by Alberta&#x27;s building codes, the requirements set out by Alberta Historical Resources were followed during the restoration of the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The wood panelling was retained, and the cast iron radiators were connected to the new geothermal heating and cooling system. New paint and carpet completed the renovations, and in 2007 the building became Wetaskiwin&#x27;s new City Hall.

===By-the-Lake Park===

Wetaskiwin&#x27;s By-the-Lake Park, located near the Automile close to Wetaskiwin&#x27;s downtown core, is a day-use facility featuring a 2.5-kilometre paved trail surrounding a 17-acre man-made lake and a large picnic area and a nature trail with signs identifying various plants and wildlife. The lake is stocked with fish for summer and winter fishing (Alberta Sport Fishing Regulations must be followed) and is used by school and community groups for canoeing and watersports. During the winter months the lake and surrounding area is used for cross-country skiing, ice skating, tobogganing, and pick-up games of pond-hockey.

== Politics ==
Historically the population of Wetaskiwin has voted Conservative in both provincial and federal politics. The city is currently represented in the House of Commons by MP Mike Lake of the Conservative Party.

== Infrastructure ==
The Wetaskiwin Regional Airport is located within Wetaskiwin city limits.

== Media ==
Wetaskiwin is served by two local newspapers, the &quot;Pipestone Flyer&quot; and &quot;The Wetaskiwin Times&quot;.

<text>The close back rounded vowel, or high back rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in many spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

In most languages, this rounded vowel is pronounced with protruded lips (&#x27;endolabial&#x27;). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (&#x27;exolabial&#x27;).

 alternates with labio-velar approximant in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages, with the non-syllabic diacritic and are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound.

==Close back protruded vowel==
The close back protruded vowel is the most common variant of the close back rounded vowel. It is typically transcribed in IPA simply as (the convention used in this article). As there is no dedicated IPA diacritic for protrusion, the symbol for the close back rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, , can be used as an ad hoc symbol . Another possible transcription is or (a close back vowel modified by endolabialization), but that could be misread as a diphthong.

===Features===

===Occurrence===
==Close back compressed vowel==

Some languages, such as Japanese and Swedish, have a close back vowel that has a distinct type of rounding, called &quot;compressed&quot; or &quot;exolabial&quot;. Only Shanghainese is known to contrast it with the more typical &quot;protruded&quot; (endolabial) close back vowel, but the height of both vowels varies from close to close-mid.

There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, compression of the lips can be shown with the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, but &#x27;spread&#x27; technically means unrounded.

It is the band&#x27;s first album to be produced by Glen Ballard, who also co-wrote all twelve of the album&#x27;s songs with guitarist and vocalist Dave Matthews. The album marked a shift in the band&#x27;s sound, prominently featuring electric guitar and concise pop arrangements.

&quot;Everyday&quot; was a commercial success, becoming the band&#x27;s second number one album in the US. Three singles were released (&quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, and &quot;Everyday&quot;), with &quot;The Space Between&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s first top 40 hit in the US. Reviews were mixed to positive; some critics disliked the band&#x27;s change in sound while others welcomed the more accessible material.

==Background==
In the summer of 2000, the band began sessions with longtime producer Steve Lillywhite for a new album. However, the dark nature of the recordings combined with a feeling of stagnation by the band members led to the sessions being abandoned. Matthews instead flew to Los Angeles to meet with Ballard with the intention of finishing the new material. Instead, Matthews and Ballard began a productive writing partnership that resulted in an album&#x27;s worth of new songs in less than two weeks. This material ended up being included on &quot;Everyday&quot; instead, while most of the songs originally recorded with Lillywhite were re-recorded for &quot;Busted Stuff&quot; in 2002.

== Release and reception ==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Everyday&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Everyday&quot; became the band&#x27;s second album in a row to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album has since been certified 3× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales exceeding 3,000,000 copies. It also became the band&#x27;s first number one album in Canada.

&quot;I Did It&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, peaked at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was more successful on the Adult Alternative Airplay chart, where it peaked at number one for a week. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number 22. Like its predecessor, it also topped the Triple A chart for a week. The title track was released as the album&#x27;s final single; despite failing to chart on the Hot 100, it topped the Triple A chart for eight weeks, the band&#x27;s longest stay at the top of the chart until it was surpassed by &quot;Funny the Way It Is&quot; in 2009.

<text>The close central unrounded vowel, or high central unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , namely the lower-case letter &quot;i&quot; with a horizontal bar. Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as barred i.

Occasionally, this vowel is transcribed (centralized ) or (centralized ).

The close central unrounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare post-palatal approximant .

Some languages feature the , which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with and , but other transcriptions such as and are also possible. In many British dictionaries, this vowel has been transcribed , which captures its height; in the American tradition it is more often , which captures its centrality, or , which captures both. is also used in a number of other publications, such as &quot;Accents of English&quot; by John C.

==Occurrence==
 is uncommon as a phoneme in Indo-European languages, occurring most commonly in some Slavic languages, such as Belarusian and Russian (see ы). However, it is very common as a separate phoneme in the indigenous languages of the Americas and is often in phonemic contrast with other close vowels such as and both in modern living languages as well as reconstructed proto-languages (such as Proto-Uto-Aztecan). Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith-Stark identify the presence of this vowel phoneme as an areal feature of a Mesoamerican Sprachbund (although that is not a defining feature of the entire area).

The sound of Polish is often represented as , but actually it is a close-mid advanced central unrounded vowel, more narrowly transcribed . Similarly, European Portuguese unstressed , often represented as , is actually a near-close near-back unrounded vowel, more narrowly transcribed using &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbols such as (mid-centralized), (fronted) and (less rounded, i.e. unrounded).

<text>The close central rounded vowel, or high central rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The sound is also commonly referred to by the name of its symbol, &quot;barred u&quot;.

The close central rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare labialized post-palatal approximant .

In most languages this rounded vowel is pronounced with protruded lips (&quot;endolabial&quot;). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (&quot;exolabial&quot;).

Some languages feature the near-close central rounded vowel (), which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with , and , but is also a possible transcription. The symbol , a conflation of and , is used as an unofficial extension of the IPA to represent this sound by a number of publications, such as &quot;Accents of English&quot; by John C. Wells. In the third edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, represents free variation between and .

==Close central protruded vowel==
The close central protruded vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated diacritic for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, , can be used as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is or (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.

===Features===


===Occurrence===
Because central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.

==Close central compressed vowel==
As there is no official diacritic for compression in the IPA, the centering diacritic is used with the front rounded vowel , which is normally compressed. Other possible transcriptions are (simultaneous and labial compression) and ( modified with labial compression).

===Features===


===Occurrence===
This vowel is typically transcribed in IPA with . It occurs in some dialects of Swedish, but see also close front compressed vowel. The close back vowels of Norwegian and Swedish are also compressed. See close back compressed vowel. It also occurs in Japanese as an allophone. Medumba has a compressed central vowel where the corners of the mouth are not drawn together.

<text>John Myrie Holl (16 August 1802 – 6 April 1869) was a Prince Edward Island politician. He was born in England and likely immigrated to island in 1836 acquiring several hundred acres of property which he named &quot;Kenwith&quot; after his family&#x27;s estate in Devon, England. Holl was appointed to the legislative council in 1840 by governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy. Responsible government came to the island in 1851. In 1853 the Liberal government of the colony&#x27;s first premier, George Coles, was defeated in the general election and was forced to resign in early 1854 when it could not command the support of the House of Assembly which now had a Conservative majority. Holl was appointed Premier despite the fact that he sat in the appointed legislative council rather than the elected House of Assembly. Due to changes in the franchise which broadened the right to vote from property owners to universal male suffrage a new election was held in June 1854 and the Liberals again won power and were able to form a government when the legislature resumed in 1855 ending Holl&#x27;s few months as Premier. Holl continued to sit in the legislative council until leaving the island in 1856.

<text>The close-mid front rounded vowel, or high-mid front rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. 

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the sound is , a lowercase letter o with a diagonal stroke through it, borrowed from Danish, Norwegian, and Faroese, which sometimes use the letter to represent the sound. This sound is represented by the letter in most of Scandinavia; by the digraphs  and  (using the  ligature) in French; and by  in many languages like German-derived languages, Estonian, Swedish, Finnish, and Icelandic. The symbol is commonly referred to as &quot;o, slash&quot; in English.

For the close-mid front rounded vowel that is usually transcribed with the symbol , see near-close front rounded vowel. If the usual symbol is , the vowel is listed here.

==Close-mid front compressed vowel==
The close-mid front compressed vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , which is the convention used in this article. There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, the compression of the lips can be shown with the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, but &#x27;spread&#x27; technically means unrounded.

For the close-mid front compressed vowel that is usually transcribed with the symbol , see near-close front compressed vowel. If the usual symbol is , the vowel is listed here.

=== Features ===


=== Occurrence ===
Because front rounded vowels are assumed to have compression, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have protrusion.

==Close-mid front protruded vowel==
Catford notes that most languages with rounded front and back vowels use distinct types of labialization, protruded back vowels and compressed front vowels. However, a few, such as the Scandinavian languages, have protruded front vowels. One of them, Swedish, even contrasts the two types of rounding in front vowels (see near-close near-front rounded vowel, with Swedish examples of both types of rounding).

As there are no diacritics in the IPA to distinguish protruded and compressed rounding, an old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for protruded front vowels. Another possible transcription is or (a close-mid front vowel modified by endolabialization), but that could be misread as a diphthong.

For the close-mid front protruded vowel that is usually transcribed with the symbol , see near-close front protruded vowel. If the usual symbol is , the vowel is listed here.

Acoustically, the sound is in between the more typical compressed close-mid front vowel and the unrounded close-mid front vowel .

<text>The close-mid central unrounded vowel, or high-mid central unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . This is a mirrored letter e and should not be confused with the schwa , which is a turned e. It was added to the IPA in 1993; before that, this vowel was transcribed (Latin small letter e with diaeresis, not the Cyrillic small letter yo (ё). Certain older sources transcribe this vowel .

The letter may be used with a lowering diacritic , to denote the mid central unrounded vowel.

Conversely, , the symbol for the mid central vowel may be used with a raising diacritic to denote the close-mid central unrounded vowel, although that is more accurately written with an additional unrounding diacritic to explicitly denote the lack of rounding (the canonical value of IPA is undefined for rounding).

<text>The close-mid central rounded vowel, or high-mid central rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a lowercase barred letter o. The value was specified only in 1993; until then, represented the mid central rounded vowel .

The character ɵ has been used in several Latin-derived alphabets such as the one for Yañalif but then denotes a sound that is different from that of the IPA. The character is homographic with Cyrillic Ө. The Unicode code point is .

This vowel occurs in Cantonese, Dutch, French, Russian and Swedish as well as in a number of English dialects as a realization of (as in &quot;foot&quot;), (as in &quot;nurse&quot;) or (as in &quot;goat&quot;).

This sound rarely contrasts with the near-close front rounded vowel and so is sometimes transcribed with the symbol (the symbol for the near-close front rounded vowel).

== Close-mid central protruded vowel ==
The close-mid central protruded vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated diacritic for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, , can be used as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is or (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.

=== Features ===


=== Occurrence ===
Because central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.

== Close-mid central compressed vowel ==
As there is no official diacritic for compression in the IPA, the centering diacritic is used with the front rounded vowel , which is normally compressed. Other possible transcriptions are (simultaneous and labial compression) and ( modified with labial compression).

<text>Mocatta (also &quot;de Mattos Mocatta&quot;, &quot;Lumbroso de Mattos Mocatta&quot; and &quot;Lumbrozo de Mattos Mocatta&quot;) is a surname.

The Mocatta family is a leading Anglo-Jewish family that traces its ancestry to the Sephardic Jewish communities of Spain and Portugal prior to the Inquisition. The family&#x27;s forebears initially sought refuge in Amsterdam and Venice, before immigrating to England in the 1650s. They were among the first twelve Jewish families admitted by Cromwell. In London in 1671, Moses Mocatta established the firm that became Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid; for 300 years it was the world’s leading bullion broker. Although the family sold their stake in the company in the late twentieth century and exited the bullion business, the family continues its tradition of business and charity. 

The family became known for philanthropy, leadership and sponsorship of arts and letters, particularly in the United Kingdom. Long involved in finance and the law, they are considered to be one of the principal families in the &quot;cousinhood&quot; of senior Anglo-Jewish families, the &quot;de facto&quot; Anglo-Jewish aristocracy.

== The Mocatta firm ==
In 1671, Moses Mocatta established a business in London that became Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid. This was the foundation of the modern gold and silver market. The Mocatta business was the world&#x27;s leading bullion broker through the 18th century, and first traded with India in 1676 and with China in the 1720s. Licensed at the Royal Exchange from 1710, for more than a century, the family firm acted as exclusive bullion brokers to the Bank of England. In 1810, the Mocatta firm&#x27;s managing partner appeared before Parliament&#x27;s Select Committee on the High Price of Gold Bullion, when asked: &#x27;Are there any other dealers in gold but yours&#x27;, he replied, &#x27;I apprehend none of considerable amount.&#x27; 

Mocatta was later involved in market stabilisations. Edgar Mocatta had a notable role in ending the Indian silver crisis of 1913. In the late 20th century, the Mocatta firm was closely involved in providing liquidity and stability following the Hunt silver corner of 1980. In association with NM Rothschild, in 1897 and 1919 respectively, Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid established the price discovery mechanisms for silver and gold used into the 21st century. Between 1671 and the 1970s, the Mocatta firm was headed by just seven men. 

== Involvement in charitable and Jewish institutions ==
The family was involved in the establishment of Bevis Marks, the UK&#x27;s oldest synagogue (1701), the Board of Deputies of British Jews (1760), and the West London Synagogue (1840). The family were active in the struggle for Jewish parliamentary emancipation. 

Ten members of the family have served as Chairman or President of the West London Synagogue of British Jews. Moses Mocatta served as President of the Board of Deputies, and family members have participated in communal leadership positions such as the Board of Shechita, Chairman of Jews’ College, and Elders of Bevis Marks. The family also participated in the Oxford and St George&#x27;s Club (Bernhard Baron St George&#x27;s Jewish Settlement) and other such initiatives for the relief of the poor. 

The family led the Jewish community&#x27;s efforts for the relief of famine in Ireland in the mid-19th century.

The family were leaders in the protest at the persecution of Jews in Romania and Bessarabia.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the family were leaders in the Board of Guardians and Trustees for the Relief of the Jewish Poor.

Three members of the Mocatta family served as Honorary Life Governors of the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields. 

David Mocatta donated funding for major parts of the building of the Royal Marsden, the first hospital in the world dedicated to the study and treatment of cancer. 

Frederic Mocatta was a founder of the Industrial Dwellings Society, which provided the London poor with adequate housing. Today it provides low-income key workers with low-cost housing.

<text>The BYU Testing Center is a student assessment center located in the Heber J. Grant Building at Brigham Young University. 

==Building history==

The Heber J. Grant Building was originally built as the BYU library. It was dedicated in 1925 by Heber J. Grant, the first building completed while Franklin S. Harris was president of BYU. The library was housed on the second floor, while the first floor contained classrooms.

After the building of the Harold B. Lee Library the building was used as a museum by the College of Biology and Agriculture until this was moved to the Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum. In 1982 the building began its use as the university&#x27;s testing center.

==Current functions==

The main portion of the Testing Center is a large main testing room, which originally served as BYU&#x27;s library, and now is filled with approximately 500 desks. Students enter through the center&#x27;s administration area. The center also has a few smaller rooms with even more desks that are used as overflows when the main testing rooms reach capacity. One of which, the upstairs overflow, sometimes has soft classical music playing through wall-mounted speakers.
When students exit the testing center, they can see their scores immediately on the BYU Testing Center website if their professor allows students access (for multiple-choice tests only). Earlier, those taking multiple-choice tests waited for a moment or two in the administration area to receive a printout of their results, which usually resulted in the exit area being crowded.

In order to accommodate an increased volume of test takers during finals, the Testing Center opens a remote location at the Richards Building. On normal days, lines are usually shortest before 11:00 AM and after 7:00 PM.

==Procedures==

When students enter the Heber J. Grant Building, they must go to the second floor to receive their tests. An employee will ask the student for their student ID card, scan it, and ask which test the student is there to take. If the student does not have their ID card with them, they may also use their student ID number or NetID. Every student must provide photo identification to verify their identity before being checked out a test. The employee will then scan the student&#x27;s test, inform them which, if any, items are permitted for use during the test (such as calculators, dictionaries, etc.), indicate whether or not they are allowed to write on their test booklet, inspect and stamp any scratch paper, and instruct them to turn off their cell phone, smart watch, and any other smart devices that the student may have brought with them. If a student has not brought a bag with them for their personal belongings, they will be instructed to use one of the blue bags hanging on the wall in the test check-out area to stow their belongs under their desk during their test. Students will then collect a bubble sheet or cover sheet from the printer and proceed into the main testing room to take their test.

While inside of the testing room, students are forbidden from using phones or any smart devices, as well as any items not listed in the &quot;items allowed&quot; box on their bubble or cover sheet. Students may leave to go to the bathroom as long as they bring their phone and test to the test check-out area. Students may also take supervised snack breaks in the test check-in area. Sharpening pencils at the pencil sharpeners in the test check-out area is permitted at any time while taking a test, as is bringing more sheets of scratch paper to be inspected and stamped. Proctors and security cameras are used to keep a close eye on students to prevent attempts to cheat or gain an unfair advantage over other test takers. Students who are caught cheating will be dismissed from the Testing Center and referred to their professors for further disciplinary action.

When a student finishes taking their test, they simply bring their test materials to the test check-in area and hand them to the staff members behind the counter to be scored and filed. Students must return any borrowed items, such as calculators and dictionaries, before leaving the Testing Center. Students are to recycle all note sheets and stamped scratch paper sheets before exiting the premises. 

==Items for sale/rent==

Students may purchase pencils for $0.35 and Blue Books for $0.75. Additionally, students will be assessed a $5.00 &quot;late fee&quot; if taking their test past a deadline arranged by their professor. Scientific calculators and foreign language dictionaries may be borrowed for no cost (if allowed by the professor for a given exam).

<text>The close-mid back rounded vowel, or high-mid back rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is .

==Close-mid back protruded vowel==
The close-mid back protruded vowel is the most common variant of the close-mid back rounded vowel. It is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated diacritic for protrusion in the IPA, the symbol for the close-mid back rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, , can be used as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for the close-mid back protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is or (a close-mid back vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.

In English, the symbol is typically associated with the vowel in the &quot;goat&quot;, but in Received Pronunciation and General American, that vowel is a diphthong whose starting point may be unrounded and more centered than .

For the close-mid near-back protruded vowel that is usually transcribed with the symbol , see near-close back protruded vowel. If the usual symbol is , the vowel is listed here.

===Features===


===Occurrence===
Because back rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.

==Close-mid back compressed vowel==
There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, compression of the lips can be shown with as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, but &#x27;spread&#x27; technically means unrounded.

Only Wu Chinese is known to contrast it with the more typical &quot;protruded&quot; (endolabial) close-mid back vowel, but the height of both vowels varies from close to close-mid.

<doc id="597203" wikidata="Q11803136" url="?curid=597203" title="Thomas Whieldon">
<text>Thomas Whieldon (September 1719 in Penkhull, Staffordshire – March 1795) was an English potter who played a leading role in the development of Staffordshire pottery.

The attribution of actual pieces to his factory has long been uncertain, and terms such as &quot;Whieldon-type&quot; are now often used for a variety of different types of wares. Other terms reflecting the lack of certainty are &quot;Whieldon ware&quot; as a type, and &quot;Astbury-Whieldon&quot;, used for early Staffordshire figures, where the two were pioneers. He worked in earthenware and stoneware, using a variety of types of body and ceramic glazes. He is especially associated with agate ware and tortoiseshell ware; in both cases Whieldon refined the techniques used, and made the types more popular.

== Personal life ==

Whieldon is first recorded as a potter in 1744 when he married Anne Shaw at Barlaston Church. Little is known about his early career and it is not known where he served his apprenticeship. Anne died in 1757 and in 1758 Whieldon married Alice Parrot, the daughter of a notable family from Newcastle-under-Lyme. Josiah Wedgwood recorded how Alice later died very suddenly at church one Sunday night in 1772. Whieldon married a third time in 1776, marrying Sarah Turner, who was from London society, although there was a family connection, as yet unknown, with one John Turner of Lane End, Staffordshire, a potter. James Christie, founder of the auctioneering house of Pall Mall, St James&#x27;s, was a signatory to the marriage settlement.

There were six children from the marriage to Sarah Turner including one daughter and five sons.

Whieldon&#x27;s Account Book provides much information for his business during the period 1749 to 1762 and from 1754 to 1759 when he was in partnership with Josiah Wedgwood, but beyond that there is little documentary evidence of his family or his life save for the normal run of parish records and occasional mentions in the private correspondence of Josiah Wedgwood and others.

Thomas Whieldon became very wealthy as a result of his business acumen but preferred to live next door to his Fenton Vivian factory, at Whieldon Grove, a fine house from which he was able to see his works. He continued to live there after his retirement in 1780, when he demolished his factory and planted an ornamental garden on the site, as none of his children wished to take on the business. In 1786 he was appointed High Sheriff of Staffordshire, underlining his social position, and in 1789 he was granted a coat of arms.

He died in 1795, outliving his former partner Josiah Wedgwood by just a few weeks, and was buried in the parish church of Stoke-upon-Trent.

== Whieldon the potter ==
At some time between 1742 and 1747 Whieldon became a tenant at Fenton Vivian and in 1748 he bought the freehold. He was to remain at this site throughout his career. By 1750 he had bought an additional pottery factory at Fenton Low but this was let to tenants and there is no evidence he ever used the factory at Fenton Low himself. Archaeological finds of sherds at Fenton Low cannot be taken as evidence of Whieldon&#x27;s early production therefore.

Whieldon&#x27;s high reputation enabled him to attract into his employment some of the most important figures in the early history of Staffordshire pottery. These included Aaron Wood, the most prominent ceramic block-cutter or modeller of the day; Josiah Spode, who went on to found his own renowned ceramics factory and William Greatbatch, another prominent figure. From 1754 to 1759 Whieldon enjoyed a partnership with the young Josiah Wedgwood.
Thomas Whieldon was recognised by his contemporaries as one of the most successful potters in Britain and one author has suggested that, aside from Wedgwood&#x27;s family members who were already established in business, &quot;there was probably no one who could have taught him so much about the innovative techniques that were already changing an ancient craft into a substantial industry.&quot;

Other writers have pointed to a possible lack of innovation, on the contrary: according to Brian Dolan, Whieldon&#x27;s production appears to have altered little between 1759, when Wedgwood left him, and 1780 when he retired.

Robin Hildyard has said, less generously, that Whieldon lacked creative ambition and &quot;was content to mass-produce unadventurous wares for general consumption&quot;, providing Wedgwood only with &quot;an object-lesson in how to acquire wealth with a minimum of risk.&quot;

== Wedgwood and Whieldon: the partnership 1754–1759 ==

Thomas Whieldon took Josiah Wedgwood into partnership at his factory at Fenton Vivian in 1754. By then Whieldon was 35 years old and had already achieved financial success and a considerable reputation whilst Wedgwood was just 24 years old; Whieldon had clearly recognised his great potential.

Whieldon&#x27;s pottery production is described by Josiah Wedgwood in his contemporary &quot;Experiment Book&quot; where there is a wealth of manuscript material on the partnership. Here Wedgwood explains that by 1759 there was an urgent need to improve the quality of lead-glazed creamware which was the principle ware being produced by Whieldon at the time. Prices for this type of ware were rapidly declining and the quality of production was suffering as a result.

It is likely that Wedgwood&#x27;s work with Whieldon was largely experimental and concerned with improving the factory&#x27;s wares and looking to the future. This set Wedgwood on a course of experimentation that lead on to his future fame.&quot;These considerations induced me to try for some more solid improvement, as well in the &quot;Body&quot;, as the &quot;Glazes&quot;, the &quot;Colours&quot;, &amp; the &quot;Forms&quot;, of the articles of our manufacture.&quot;Wedgwood was brought into partnership to address these problems and was mainly engaged in improving the lead glazes for creamware. Creamware at that time had already achieved an acceptable white body but no one had succeeded in producing a transparent lead glaze. By 1759, when Wedgwood decided to leave and set up his own independent business, he had already made his first successful experimental glazes.

Even after Wedgwood had established his own business, he continued to buy-in wares from Whieldon, usually biscuitware for later decoration and glazing, to meet demand, when needed. He also frequently bought wares from William Greatbatch, whom he knew from his time with Whieldon.

== The wares ==
Archaeological excavations at the Fenton Vivian site conducted by Arnold Mountford on behalf of Stoke City Museum between 1968 and 1970 found evidence of salt-glazed stoneware, tortoiseshell ware, agateware, red stoneware, glazed red earthenware, blackware and a small amount of plain creamware, all dating from the time of Whieldon&#x27;s partnership with Wedgwood. There were also a few fragments of painted creamware, depicting Chinese-inspired figures and flowers, of a type rarely associated with Whieldon.

Whieldon kept an &quot;Account and Memorandum Book&quot; and his records for 1749–53 show a wide range of pottery goods produced, including coffeepots, teapots, punch pots, bowls, ewers, sugar dishes, plates, tureens and ‘toys’ or trinkets. There is evidence of a range of figures being produced but not in great quantities. Forms were sometimes based on contemporary silver and pewter shapes, and were both press-moulded and slipcast.

None of Whieldon&#x27;s pottery was marked, making attribution difficult. The shards excavated at the Fenton Vivian site are a vital source of information allowing some attribution by typology. It was common practice for factories in the 18th century to share or copy designs, or to buy and sell ceramic block-moulds, so care has to be taken in ascribing particular pots to particular factories in the absence of any other supporting evidence. Finishes such as spouts, handles and knops can provide vital clues.

== Tortoiseshell ware ==

Tortoiseshell ware is an earthenware, often creamware, that is decorated with a limited, rather dark, palette to imitate tortoiseshell, as fashionable material in the period. It was made before Whieldon, by William Greatbatch and many others in Staffordshire and also Liverpool and Leeds. The original technique was to sprinkle the unfired (or &quot;green&quot;) wares with &quot;powdered lead oxide and calcined flint with a trace of manganese oxide&quot;. This produced the colour effect within the glaze. 

Whieldon&#x27;s innovation, about 1750, was his &quot;first important contribution to the pottery trade&quot;. The pigments were applied under the glaze by painting or sponging with metallic oxides, and then a transparent glaze was applied. During the glost firing, the colours flow to produce the tortoiseshell effect.
Tortoiseshell wares were first mentioned by Thomas Whieldon in his &quot;Account and Memorandum Book&quot; of 1749. In his &quot;Experiment Book&quot;, Josiah Wedgwood states that in 1759 tortoiseshell ware was the second most important ware at the Whieldon factory, but the market was declining:“[…] But as no improvement had been made in this branch for several years, the country was grown weary of it; and though the price had been lowered from time to time, in order to increase the sale, the expedient did not answer, and something new was wanted, to give a little spirit to the business.&quot;Historically, tortoiseshell wares have come to be associated almost exclusively with Thomas Whieldon, however, Pat Halfpenny warned that:“The ‘Whieldon’ label has inhibited scholarly research and limited our understanding of the pottery production dates in North Staffordshire.”In his 1991 study of William Greatbatch, David Barker also concluded:
&quot;Many of the wares manufactured by Whieldon are of types now known to have been made by Greatbatch and have been found on the Greatbatch site. Whieldon ware, or Whieldon-type ware are terms which are widely accepted in describing a variety of ceramics, particularly tortoiseshell wares, but which lead to problems in any objective research into the pottery of the period.&quot;In the absence of any supporting information, caution is therefore needed in ascribing any particular tortoiseshell wares to Thomas Whieldon.

== Workforce ==
In the 18th century it was common for whole families, including children, to be working in pottery manufacture. Workers were engaged, for example, as specialist potters, painters or ‘oven’ (or kiln) men. Whieldon had an exceptionally large workforce for the period and expected ‘scrupulous obedience, respectful behaviour and strict punctuality’. Workers were organised into teams and well paid, with skilled workers’ pay being linked to productivity.

Whieldon was remarkable for being the first employer in the potteries to offer rented accommodation for his workers, which he did as early as 1750 with eight houses. Later, Josiah Wedgwood took up the idea of a community for his workforce at the Etruria works when he founded the village of Etruria in 1769, consisting of 42 dwellings and an inn.

A Turnpike Petition dated 1763 revealed that at that time there were 150 separate pottery businesses operating in the Staffordshire Potteries employing as many as 7,000 people.

Potters working with lead glazes were exposed to lead poisoning and the dangers of serious health problems.

== Transportation ==
As the markets for Staffordshire pottery grew during the 18th century, the need for improved transportation links became more pressing. In the early part of the 18th century, goods were generally sold locally and transported by &#x27;crate-men&#x27; who carried goods in large panniers on their backs. Mules were sometimes used instead. Local roads were so poor that mules and men were likely to stumble with their heavy loads into potholes. Some of these potholes were two feet deep or more and were hazardous to life.

Originally, all the main routes by which goods might leave the Potteries involved a combination of road and river transport out to the ports and the coastal trade routes. Road journeys by these routes varied between 20 and 40 miles in length and progress was slow. Because roads were in a poor state before the introduction of turnpikes, many of the finished goods were broken in transit, substantially reducing the profitability of pottery production.

By the 1750s there was a strong London market for goods and some trade with Europe. Whieldon, Spode and Wedgwood were amongst those who subscribed to the first turnpike roads in the neighbourhood. Josiah Wedgwood went on to revolutionise transportation within the Potteries by commissioning the first canals from 1766.

== Forgery ==

Because of the popularity of Whieldon-style tortoiseshell wares and of historic Staffordshire pottery in general, and the high prices they fetch on the market, there has long been a problem of forgery. In more modern times, forgery of Whieldon wares dates back at least until the 1920s when his work commanded high prices.

In 1991 a lawsuit brought a forgery to light when the authenticity of a Whieldon-type candelabrum was called into question. This piece had been vetted by experts before being bought from an English dealer on behalf of an American collector. However, the use of thermoluminescence dating showed that it was modern.

== Enduring reputation ==
Thomas Whieldon&#x27;s works have long been treasured by collectors and have realised high prices for at least the past century.

In 2011, Edmund de Waal selected a Thomas Whieldon teapot of 1760 for his celebration of the potter&#x27;s art.

<text>The open-mid back unrounded vowel or low-mid back unrounded vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , graphically a rotated lowercase &quot;v&quot; (called a turned V but created as a small-capital without the crossbar, even though some vendors display it as a real turned v). Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as a &quot;wedge&quot;, &quot;caret&quot; or &quot;hat&quot;. In transcriptions for English, this symbol is commonly used for the near-open central unrounded vowel and in transcriptions for Danish, it is used for the open back rounded vowel.

==Features==


==Occurrence==
Before World War II, the of Received Pronunciation was phonetically close to a back vowel , which has since shifted forward towards (a near-open central unrounded vowel). Daniel Jones reported his speech (southern British) as having an advanced back vowel between his central and back ; however, he also reported that other southern speakers had a lower and even more advanced vowel that approached cardinal . In American English varieties, such as in the West, the Midwest, and the urban South, the typical phonetic realization of the phoneme is an open-mid central . Truly backed variants of that are phonetically can occur in Inland Northern American English, Newfoundland English, Philadelphia English, some of African-American English, and (old-fashioned) white Southern American English in coastal plain and Piedmont areas. However, the letter is still commonly used to indicate this phoneme, even in the more common varieties with central variants or . That may be because of both tradition and some other dialects retaining the older pronunciation.

<text>The open-mid back rounded vowel, or low-mid back rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . The IPA symbol is a turned letter &quot;c&quot; and both the symbol and the sound are commonly called &quot;open-o&quot;. The name &quot;open-o&quot; represents the sound, in that it is like the sound represented by , the close-mid back rounded vowel, except it is more open. It also represents the symbol, which can be remembered as an &quot;o&quot; which has been &quot;opened&quot; by removing part of the closed circular shape.

In English, the symbol (or ) is typically associated with the vowel in &quot;thought&quot;, but in Received Pronunciation (standard British English), Australian English, New Zealand English and South African English that vowel is produced with considerably stronger lip rounding and higher tongue position than that of cardinal , i.e. as close-mid or somewhat lower. Open-mid or even open realizations are found in North American English (where this vowel is often indistinguishable from the open back unrounded vowel in &quot;bra&quot;) and Scottish English as well as Hiberno-English, Northern England English and Welsh English, though in the last three accent groups closer, -like realizations are also found. In RP, the open-mid realization of has been obsolete since the 1930s. Pronouncing that vowel as such is subject to correction for non-native speakers aiming at RP.

In Received Pronunciation and Australian English, the open-mid back rounded vowel occurs as the main allophone of the vowel . The contrast between and is thus strongly maintained, with the former vowel being realized as close-mid and the latter as open-mid , similarly to the contrast between and found in German, Italian and Portuguese.

<text>Bruno of Cologne, OCart (; ; – 6 October 1101), venerated as Saint Bruno, was the founder of the Carthusians. He personally founded the order&#x27;s first two communities. He was a celebrated teacher at Reims and a close advisor of his former pupil, Pope Urban II. His feast day is 6 October.

==Life==
Bruno was born in Cologne about the year 1030. According to tradition, he belonged to the family of Hartenfaust, or Hardebüst, one of the principal families of the city. Little is known of his early years, except that he studied theology in the present-day French city of Reims before returning to his native land.

His education completed, Bruno returned to Cologne, where he was most likely ordained a priest around 1055 and provided with a canonry at St. Cunibert&#x27;s. In 1056 Bishop Gervais recalled him to Reims, where the following year he found himself head of the episcopal school, which at the time included the direction of the schools and the oversight of all the educational establishments of the diocese. For eighteen years, from 1057 to 1075, he maintained the prestige which the school of Reims attained under its former masters, Remi of Auxerre, and others.

Bruno led the school for nearly two decades, acquiring an excellent reputation as a philosopher and theologian. Among his students were Eudes of Châtillon, afterwards Pope Urban II, Rangier, Cardinal and Bishop of Reggio, Robert, Bishop of Langres, and a large number of prelates and abbots.

== Chancellor of the Diocese of Reims ==
In 1075, Bruno was appointed chancellor of the Archdiocese of Reims, which involved him in the daily administration of the diocese. Meanwhile, the pious Bishop Gervais de Château-du-Loir, a friend to Bruno, had been succeeded by Manasses de Gournai, a violent aristocrat with no real vocation for the Church. In 1077, at the urging of Bruno and the clergy at Reims, de Gournai was suspended at a council at Autun. Manasses responded, in typical eleventh-century fashion, by having his retainers pull down the houses of his accusers. He confiscated their goods, sold their benefices, and even appealed to the pope. Bruno discreetly avoided the cathedral city until in 1080 a definite sentence, confirmed by popular riot, compelled Manasses to withdraw and take refuge with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, the fierce opponent of Pope Gregory VII.

== Refusal to become a bishop ==
On the verge of being made bishop himself, Bruno instead followed a vow he had made to renounce secular concerns and withdrew, along with two of his friends, Raoul and Fulcius, also canons of Reims.

Bruno&#x27;s first thought on leaving Reims seems to have been to place himself and his companions under the direction of an eminent solitary, Robert of Molesme, who had recently (in 1075) settled at Sèche-Fontaine, near Molesme in the Diocese of Langres, together with a band of other hermits, who were later on (in 1098) to form the Cistercians. However, he soon found that this was not his vocation. After a short stay, he went with six of his companions to Hugh of Châteauneuf, Bishop of Grenoble. The bishop, according to the pious legend, had recently had a vision of these men, under a chaplet of seven stars, and he installed them himself in 1084 in a mountainous and uninhabited spot in the lower Alps of the Dauphiné, in a place named Chartreuse, not far from Grenoble. With Bruno were Landuin, Stephen of Bourg, Stephen of Die (canons of St. Rufus), Hugh the Chaplain and two laymen, Andrew and Guerin, who afterwards became the first lay brothers.

They built an oratory with small individual cells at a distance from each other where they lived isolated and in poverty, entirely occupied in prayer and study, for these men had a reputation for learning, and were frequently honoured by the visits of Hugh of Châteauneuf who became like one of themselves.

At the time, Bruno&#x27;s pupil, Eudes of Châtillon, had become pope as Urban II (1088). Resolved to continue the work of reform commenced by Gregory VII and being obliged to struggle against Antipope Clement III and Emperor Henry IV, he was in dire need of competent and devoted allies and called his former master to Rome in 1090.

It is difficult to assign the place which Bruno occupied in Rome, or his influence in contemporary events, because it remained entirely hidden and confidential. Lodged in the Lateran with the pope himself, privy to his most private councils, he worked as an advisor but kept to the background, apart from the fiercely partisan rivalries in Rome and within the curia. Shortly after his arrival in Rome, the papal party was forced to evacuate to the south by the arrival of Henry IV with his own antipope in tow.

Bruno resisted efforts to name him Archbishop of Reggio Calabria, deferring instead in favour of one of his former pupils nearby in a Benedictine abbey near Salerno. Instead, Bruno begged to return again to his solitary life. His intention was to rejoin his brethren in Dauphiné, as a letter addressed to them makes clear. However, the will of Urban II kept him in Italy, near the papal court, to which he could be called at need.

Bruno did not attend the Council of Clermont, where Urban preached the First Crusade, but seems to have been present at the Council of Benevento (March 1091). His part in history is effaced.

The place for his new retreat, chosen in 1091 by Bruno and some followers who had joined him, was in the Diocese of Squillace, in a small forested high valley, where the band constructed a little wooden chapel and cabins. His patron there was Roger I of Sicily, Count of Sicily and Calabria and uncle of the Duke of Apulia, who granted them the lands they occupied, and a close friendship developed. Bruno went to the Guiscard court at Mileto to visit the count in his sickness (1098 and 1101), and to baptize his son, Roger (1097), the future King of Sicily. But more often Roger went into retreat with his friends, where he erected a simple house for himself. Through his generosity, the monastery of St. Stephen was built in 1095, near the original hermitage dedicated to the Virgin.

At the turn of the new century, the friends of Bruno died one after the other: Urban II in 1099; Landuin, the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, his first companion, in 1100; Count Roger in 1101. Bruno followed on 6 October 1101 in Serra San Bruno.

== Bruno&#x27;s legacy ==
After his death, the Carthusians of Calabria, following a frequent custom of the Middle Ages, dispatched a roll-bearer, a servant of the community laden with a mortuary roll, a long roll of parchment, hung round his neck, who travelled through Italy, France, Germany, and England, stopping to announce the death of Bruno, and in return, the churches, communities, or chapters inscribed upon his roll, in prose or verse, the expression of their regrets, with promises of prayers. Many of these rolls have been preserved, but few are so extensive or so full of praise as those about Bruno. 178 witnesses, many of whom had known him, celebrated the extent of his knowledge and the fruitfulness of his instruction. Strangers to him were above all struck by his great knowledge and talents. His disciples praised his three chief virtues — his great spirit of prayer, extreme mortification, and devotion to the Blessed Virgin.

Both the churches built by him in the desert were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: Our Lady of Casalibus in Dauphiné and Our Lady Della Torre in Calabria; faithful to his inspirations, the Carthusian Statutes proclaim the Mother of God the first and chief patron of all the houses of the order, whoever may be their particular patron. He is also the eponym for San Bruno Creek in California.

== Inscription in the Roman calendar ==
Bruno was buried in the little cemetery of the hermitage of Santa Maria. In 1513, his bones were discovered with the epitaph (&#x27;these are the bones of the master Bruno&#x27;) over them. Since the Carthusian Order maintains a strict observance of humility, Saint Bruno was never formally canonized. He was not included in the Tridentine calendar, but in the year 1623 Pope Gregory XV included him in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 6 October.

Saint Bruno has long been regarded as the patron saint of Calabria and one of the patron saints of Germany.

A writer as well as founder of his order, Bruno composed commentaries on the Psalms and on the Epistles of Paul the Apostle. Two letters of his also remain, his profession of faith, and a short elegy on contempt for the world which shows that he cultivated poetry. Bruno&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; reveal that he knew a little Hebrew and Greek; he was familiar with the Church Fathers, especially Augustine of Hippo and Ambrose. &quot;His style&quot;, said Dom Rivet, &quot;is concise, clear, nervous and simple, and his Latin as good as could be expected of that century: it would be difficult to find a composition of this kind at once more solid and more luminous, more concise and more clear.&quot;

In Catholic art, Saint Bruno can be recognized by a skull that he holds and contemplates, with a book and a cross. He may be crowned with a halo of seven stars; or with a roll bearing the device .

<text>Robert Poore Haythorne (2 December 1815 – 7 May 1891) was a Prince Edward Island politician and premier. He was born in England to a prominent family, his father having been mayor of Bristol on several occasions.

Haythorne arrived in Prince Edward Island at the age of 25 and, with his brother, acquired ownership of 10,000 ac (4,000 ha) of land. When the land question became a major issue in the 1860s Haythorne who had been a progressive farmer and a reformer decided to sell his land to his tenants for $2.00/ac ($4.94/ha). His former tenants asked him to run for a seat on the legislative council (which was by then an elected body) in 1867 and he did so winning the seat as a Liberal. Haythorne joined the Liberal government of George Coles and became Premier in 1869 after Coles retired and his successor, Joseph Hensley accepted a judicial appointment.

Politically, Haythorne became skeptical of Canadian confederation and his government rejected pressure by the British to join Canada because he didn&#x27;t see confederation as offering a solution to the land question. He favoured reciprocity with the United States as an alternative. Haythorne&#x27;s majority in the legislature was cut to only four seats as a result of the 1870 election. The issue of school funding divided his government, Haythorne supported funding of separate schools leading to the resignation of several of his ministers and the fall of his government in the fall of 1870.

James Colledge Pope formed a coalition government with dissidents from Haythorne&#x27;s Liberal party but Pope&#x27;s government fell in 1872 when its railway policy almost bankrupted the colony. Haythorne&#x27;s Liberals returned to power but had to commit to a promise to extend the railway to both ends of the island, a project with the colony could not afford. The financial situation forced Haythorne&#x27;s government to send a delegation to Ottawa in February 1873 and seek terms for admission to Canadian confederation which would see the completion of the railway and the Canadian government assume the island&#x27;s debts. Haythorne reached favourable terms including the taking over of the railway by the federal government, the assumption of the colonial debt, an $800,000 payment for the acquisition of proprietary lands in order to settle the land question by allowing land reform, and a promise of continuous steam communication with the mainland.

Haythorne had the legislature dissolved and ran an election on the terms of union with Canada. His Conservative rival, John Colledge Pope, outmanoeuvered Haythorne during the campaign, however, by promising that he could get even better terms. Pope&#x27;s Tories were elected in April, persuaded Ottawa to increase the promised annual federal subsidy to the island by $25,000 and led the island into confederation on July 1, 1873.

Haythorne was named to the Senate of Canada in October 1873 where he supported free trade with the United States and was an active supporter of the federal Liberal party. He remained a Senator until his death in 1891.

<doc id="597225" wikidata="Q1587921" url="?curid=597225" title="Harvey Penick">
<text>Harvey Morrison Penick (October 23, 1904 – April 2, 1995) was an American professional golfer and coach, who coached many Hall of Fame players. Late in life, he became a best-selling writer. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2002, seven years after his death.

==Golf career==
Penick was born in Austin, Texas. He began his golf career as a caddie at the Austin Country Club at age eight. He became the club&#x27;s assistant pro five years later, and after his graduation from high school, was promoted to head professional in 1923, where he remained until 1971. From 1971 on Penick continued teaching at the club, serving as &quot;Professional Emeritus&quot; until his death in 1995.

Penick was the golf coach at the University of Texas from 1931 to 1963, coaching the Longhorns to 21 Southwest Conference championships in 33 years, including 20 out of 23 seasons from 1932 to 1954 (1932–38; 1940–47; 1949–52; 1954). He coached the following members of the World Golf Hall of Fame: Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, and Kathy Whitworth. Other outstanding players coached by Penick include: Sandra Palmer, Judy Kimball, Wes Ellis, Terry Dill, Don Massengale, Rik Massengale, Davis Love Jr., and Ed White. In 1989, Penick was honored by the PGA of America as Teacher of the Year.

==Author==
In 1992, he co-authored (with Bud Shrake) &quot;Harvey Penick&#x27;s Little Red Book&quot;; filled with insightful, easily understood anecdotes, it became the highest selling golf book ever published. While Penick was a strong all-around teacher of the game, he was perhaps the most gifted instructor of the mental game who ever lived. He advocated that &quot;once you address the ball, hitting it to the desired target must be the only thing in your life. Allow no negative thoughts, and focus on your goal.&quot; Penick and Shrake collaborated on four more golf books on similar themes; all sold well. The final three Penick-Shrake books were published after Penick&#x27;s 1995 death, based on Penick&#x27;s extensive notes from his lifetime of golf instruction.

==Death==
During his final illness, he gave lessons from his deathbed to longtime student Ben Crenshaw. The day after serving as a pallbearer at Penick&#x27;s funeral, Crenshaw began play in the 1995 Masters Tournament. With the memory and spirit of his longtime friend and mentor to guide him, he became the second oldest Masters champion, winning his second Masters at the age of 43. In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: &quot;I had a 15th club in my bag,&quot; a reference to Penick. (The &quot;15th club&quot; reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)

Penick died in Austin in 1995. Seven years after his death, in 2002, he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

<text>The Chancellor of France (), also known as the Grand Chancellor or Lord Chancellor, was the officer of state responsible for the judiciary of the Kingdom of France. The Chancellor was responsible for seeing that royal decrees were enrolled and registered by the sundry parlements, provincial appellate courts. However, since the Chancellor was appointed for life, and might fall from favour, or be too ill to carry out his duties, his duties would occasionally fall to his deputy, the Keeper of the Seals of France ().

The last Chancellor died in 1790, by which time the French Revolution was well underway, and the position was left vacant. Instead, in 1791, the Chancellor&#x27;s portfolio and responsibilities were assigned to the Keeper of the Seals who was accordingly given the additional title of Minister of Justice under the Revolutionary government. After the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, the position of the Chancellor was divorced from its judicial responsibilities and re-established as president of the Chamber of Peers, the upper house of the French parliament until 1848. The last Chancellor was Etienne-Denis Pasquier, appointed by King Louis Philippe I in 1837.

<text>In industry, product lifecycle management (PLM) is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its inception through the engineering, design, and manufacture, as well as the service and disposal of manufactured products. PLM integrates people, data, processes, and business systems and provides a product information backbone for companies and their extended enterprises.
==History==
The inspiration for the burgeoning business process now known as PLM came from American Motors Corporation (AMC). The automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors in 1985, according to François Castaing, Vice President for Product Engineering and Development. AMC focused its R&amp;D efforts on extending the product lifecycle of its flagship products, particularly Jeeps, because it lacked the &quot;massive budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors.&quot; After introducing its compact Jeep Cherokee (XJ), the vehicle that launched the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) market, AMC began development of a new model, that later came out as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The first part in its quest for faster product development was computer-aided design (CAD) software system that made engineers more productive. The second part of this effort was the new communication system that allowed conflicts to be resolved faster, as well as reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The product data management was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC, the system was expanded throughout the enterprise connecting everyone involved in designing and building products. While an early adopter of PLM technology, Chrysler was able to become the auto industry&#x27;s lowest-cost producer, recording development costs that were half of the industry average by the mid-1990s.

==Forms==
PLM systems help organizations cope with the increasing complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets.

Product lifecycle management (PLM) should be distinguished from &#x27;product life-cycle management (marketing)&#x27; (PLCM). PLM describes a product&#x27;s engineering aspect, from managing its descriptions and properties through its development and useful life. In contrast, PLCM refers to the commercial management of a product&#x27;s life in the business market concerning costs and sales measures.
Product lifecycle management can be considered one of the four cornerstones of a manufacturing corporation&#x27;s information technology structure. All companies need to manage communications and information with their customers (CRM-customer relationship management), their suppliers and fulfillment (SCM-supply chain management), their resources within the enterprise (ERP-enterprise resource planning) and their product planning and development (PLM).

One form of PLM is called people-centric PLM. While traditional PLM tools have been deployed only on or during the release phase, people-centric PLM targets the design phase.

As of 2009, ICT development (EU-funded PROMISE project 2004–2008) has allowed PLM to extend beyond traditional PLM and integrate sensor data and real-time &#x27;lifecycle event data&#x27; into PLM, as well as allowing this information to be made available to different players in the total lifecycle of an individual product (closing the information loop). This broader reach has resulted in the extension of PLM into closed-loop lifecycle management (CL2M).

==Benefits==
Documented benefits of product lifecycle management include:
* Reduced time to market
* Increase full-price sales
* Improved product quality and reliability
* Reduced prototyping costs
* More accurate and timely requests for quote generation
* Ability to quickly identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions
* Savings through the re-use of original data
* A framework for product optimization
* Reduced waste
* Savings through the complete integration of engineering workflows
* Documentation that can assist in proving compliance for RoHS or Title 21 CFR Part 11
* Ability to provide contract manufacturers with access to a centralized product record
* Seasonal fluctuation management
* Improved forecasting to reduce material costs
* Maximize supply chain collaboration

==Overview of product lifecycle management ==
Within PLM there are five primary areas;
# Systems engineering (SE) is focused on meeting all requirements, primarily meeting customer needs, and coordinating the systems design process by involving all relevant disciplines. An important aspect of lifecycle management is a subset within Systems Engineering called Reliability Engineering. 
# Product and portfolio management2 (PPM) are focused on managing resource allocation, tracking progress, planning for new product development projects that are in process (or in a holding status). Portfolio management is a tool that assists management in tracking progress on new products and making trade-off decisions when allocating scarce resources.
# Product design (CAx) is the process of creating a new product to be sold by a business to its customers. 
# Manufacturing process management (MPM) is a collection of technologies and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured. 
# Product data management (PDM) is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through their development and useful life. Change management is an important part of PDM/PLM.

&quot;Note: While application software is not required for PLM processes, the business complexity and rate of change requires organizations to execute as rapidly as possible.&quot;

==Introduction to development process==
The core of PLM (product lifecycle management) is the creation and central management of all product data and the technology used to access this information and knowledge. PLM as a discipline emerged from tools such as CAD, CAM and PDM, but can be viewed as the integration of these tools with methods, people and the processes through all stages of a product&#x27;s life. It is not just about software technology but is also a business strategy.

For simplicity, the stages described are shown in a traditional sequential engineering workflow.
The exact order of events and tasks will vary according to the product and industry in question but the main processes are:
*Conceive
**Specification
**Concept design
*Design
**Detailed design
**Validation and analysis (simulation)
**Tool design
*Realise
**Plan manufacturing
**Manufacture
**Build/Assemble
**Test (quality control)
*Service
**Sell and deliver
**Use
**Maintain and support
**Dispose

The major key point events are:
*Order
*Idea
*Kickoff
*Design freeze
*Launch

The reality is however more complex, people and departments cannot perform their tasks in isolation and one activity cannot simply finish, and the next activity start. Design is an iterative process, often designs need to be modified due to manufacturing constraints or conflicting requirements. Whether a customer order fits into the timeline depends on the industry type and whether the products are, for example, built to order, engineered to order, or assembled to order.

==Phases of product lifecycle and corresponding technologies==

Many software solutions have been developed to organize and integrate the different phases of a product&#x27;s lifecycle. PLM should not be considered as a single software product, but as a collection of software tools and working methods integrated to address single stages of the lifecycle, connect different tasks, or manage the whole process. Some software providers cover the whole PLM range, while others have a single niche application. Some applications can span many fields of PLM with different modules within the same data model. An overview of the fields within PLM is covered here. The simple classifications do not always fit exactly; many areas overlap, and many software products cover more than one area or do not fit easily into one category.

One of the main goals of PLM is to collect knowledge that can be reused for other projects and to coordinate the simultaneous concurrent development of many products. It is about business processes, people, and methods as much as software application solutions. Although PLM is mainly associated with engineering tasks, it also involves marketing activities such as product portfolio management (PPM), particularly concerning new product development (NPD). Each industry has several life-cycle models to consider, but most are relatively similar. 

Below is one possible life-cycle model; while it emphasizes hardware-oriented products, similar phases would describe any form of product or service, including non-technical or software-based products:

===Phase 1: Conceive===
====Imagine, specify, plan, innovate====
The first stage is the definition of the product requirements based on customer, company, market, and regulatory bodies&#x27; viewpoints. From this specification, the product&#x27;s major technical parameters can be defined. In parallel, the initial concept design work is performed, defining the aesthetics of the product together with its main functional aspects. Many different media are used for these processes, from pencil and paper to clay models to 3D CAID computer-aided industrial design software.

In some concepts, the investment of resources into research or analysis of options may be included in the conception phase – e.g., bringing the technology to a level of maturity sufficient to move to the next phase. However, life-cycle engineering is iterative. It is always possible that something does not work well in any phase enough to back up into a prior phase – perhaps back to conception or research. There are many examples to draw from.

The new product development process phase collects and evaluates market and technical risks by measuring the KPI and scoring model.

===Phase 2: Design===

==== Describe, define, develop, test, analyze and validate ====
This step is where the detailed design and development of the product&#x27;s form starts, progressing to prototype testing, from pilot release to full product launch. It can also involve redesign and ramping to improve existing products and planned obsolescence.
CAD is the primary tool used for design and development. This can be simple 2D drawing/drafting or 3D parametric feature-based solid/surface modeling. Such software may include Hybrid Modeling, Reverse Engineering, KBE (knowledge-based engineering), NDT (Nondestructive testing), and Assembly construction.

This step covers many engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, electronic, software (embedded), and domain-specific, such as architectural, aerospace, and automotive. Along with creating geometry, the components and product assemblies are analyzed. Simulation, validation, and optimization tasks are carried out using CAE (computer-aided engineering) software, either integrated into the CAD package or stand-alone. These are used to perform tasks such as Stress analysis, FEA (finite element analysis), kinematics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and mechanical event simulation (MES). CAQ (computer-aided quality) is used for tasks such as Dimensional tolerance (engineering) analysis. Another task performed at this stage is sourcing bought-out components, possibly with the aid of procurement systems.

===Phase 3: Realize===
====Manufacture, make, build, procure, produce, sell and deliver====
Once the design of the product&#x27;s components is complete, the method of manufacturing is defined. This includes CAD tasks such as tool design; including the creation of CNC machining instructions for the product&#x27;s parts as well as the creation of specific tools to manufacture those parts, using integrated or separate CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) software. This will also involve analysis tools for process simulation of operations such as casting, molding, and die-press forming.

Once the manufacturing method has been identified, CPM comes into play. This involves CAPE (computer-aided production engineering) or CAP/CAPP (computer-aided production planning) tools for carrying out factory, plant and facility layout, and production simulation e.g. press-line simulation, industrial ergonomics, as well as tool selection management.

After components are manufactured, their geometrical form and size can be checked against the original CAD data with the use of computer-aided inspection equipment and software. Parallel to the engineering tasks, sales product configuration, and marketing documentation work takes place. This could include transferring engineering data (geometry and part list data) to a web-based sales configurator and other desktop publishing systems.

===Phase 4: Service===
====Use, operate, maintain, support, sustain, phase-out, retire, recycle and disposal====
Another phase of the lifecycle involves managing &quot;in-service&quot; information. This can include providing customers and service engineers with the support and information required for repair and maintenance, as well as waste management or recycling. This can involve the use of tools such as Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul Management (MRO) software.

An effective service consideration begins during and even prior to product design as an integral part of product lifecycle management. Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) has critical touchpoints at all phases of the product lifecycle that must be considered. Connecting and enriching a common digital thread will provide enhanced visibility across functions, improve data quality, and minimize costly delays and rework.

There is an end-of-life to every product. Whether it be the disposal or destruction of material objects or information, this needs to be carefully considered since it may be legislated and hence not free from ramifications.

====Operational upgrades====
During the operational phase, a product owner may discover components and consumables which have reached their individual end of life and for which there are Diminishing Manufacturing Sources or Material Shortages (DMSMS), or that the existing product can be enhanced for a wider or emerging user market easier or at less cost than a full redesign. This modernization approach often extends the product lifecycle and delays end-of-life disposal.

===All phases: product lifecycle===
====Communicate, manage and collaborate====
None of the above phases should be considered as isolated. In reality, a project does not run sequentially or separated from other product development projects, with information flowing between different people and systems. A major part of PLM is the coordination and management of product definition data. This includes managing engineering changes and release status of components; configuration product variations; document management; planning project resources as well as timescale and risk assessment.

For these tasks data of a graphical, textual, and meta nature – such as product bills of materials (BOMs) – needs to be managed. At the engineering departments level, this is the domain of Product Data Management (PDM) software, or at the corporate level Enterprise Data Management (EDM) software; such rigid level distinctions may not be consistently used, however, it is typical to see two or more data management systems within an organization. These systems may also be linked to other corporate systems such as SCM, CRM, and ERP. Associated with these systems are project management systems for project/program planning.

This central role is covered by numerous collaborative product development tools that run throughout the whole lifecycle and across organizations. This requires many technology tools in the areas of conferencing, data sharing, and data translation. This specialized field is referred to as product visualization which includes technologies such as DMU (digital mock-up), immersive virtual digital prototyping (virtual reality), and photo-realistic imaging.

====User skills====
The broad array of solutions that make up the tools used within a PLM solution-set (e.g., CAD, CAM, CAx...) were initially used by dedicated practitioners who invested time and effort to gain the required skills. Designers and engineers produced excellent results with CAD systems, manufacturing engineers became highly skilled CAM users, while analysts, administrators, and managers fully mastered their support technologies. However, achieving the full advantages of PLM requires the participation of many people of various skills from throughout an extended enterprise, each requiring the ability to access and operate on the inputs and output of other participants.

Despite the increased ease of use of PLM tools, cross-training all personnel on the entire PLM tool-set has not proven to be practical. Now, however, advances are being made to address ease of use for all participants within the PLM arena. One such advance is the availability of &quot;role&quot; specific user interfaces. Through tailorable user interfaces (UIs), the commands that are presented to users are appropriate to their function and expertise.

These techniques include:
* Concurrent engineering workflow
* Industrial design
* Bottom–up design
* Top–down design
* Both-ends-against-the-middle design
* Front-loading design workflow
* Design in context
* Modular design
* NPD new product development
* DFSS design for Six Sigma
* DFMA design for manufacture / assembly
* Digital simulation engineering
* Requirement-driven design
* Specification-managed validation
* Configuration management

===Concurrent engineering workflow===
Concurrent engineering (British English: simultaneous engineering) is a workflow that, instead of working sequentially through stages, carries out a number of tasks in parallel. For example: starting tool design as soon as the detailed design has started, and before the detailed designs of the product are finished; or starting on detailed design solid models before the concept design surfaces models are complete. Although this does not necessarily reduce the amount of manpower required for a project, as more changes are required due to incomplete and changing information, it does drastically reduce lead times and thus time to market.

Feature-based CAD systems have allowed simultaneous work on the 3D solid model and the 2D drawing by means of two separate files, with the drawing looking at the data in the model; when the model changes the drawing will associatively update. Some CAD packages also allow associative copying of geometry between files. This allows, for example, the copying of a part design into the files used by the tooling designer. The manufacturing engineer can then start work on tools before the final design freeze; when a design changes size or shape the tool geometry will then update.

Concurrent engineering also has the added benefit of providing better and more immediate communication between departments, reducing the chance of costly, late design changes. It adopts a problem-prevention method as compared to the problem-solving and re-designing method of traditional sequential engineering.

===Bottom–up design===
Bottom–up design (CAD-centric) occurs where the definition of 3D models of a product starts with the construction of individual components. These are then virtually brought together in sub-assemblies of more than one level until the full product is digitally defined. This is sometimes known as the &quot;review structure&quot; which shows what the product will look like. The BOM contains all of the physical (solid) components of a product from a CAD system; it may also (but not always) contain other &#x27;bulk items&#x27; required for the final product but which (in spite of having definite physical mass and volume) are not usually associated with CAD geometry such as paint, glue, oil, adhesive tape, and other materials.

Bottom–up design tends to focus on the capabilities of available real-world physical technology, implementing those solutions to which this technology is most suited. When these bottom–up solutions have real-world value, bottom–up design can be much more efficient than top–down design. The risk of bottom–up design is that it very efficiently provides solutions to low-value problems. The focus of bottom–up design is &quot;what can we most efficiently do with this technology?&quot; rather than the focus of top–down which is &quot;What is the most valuable thing to do?&quot;

===Top–down design===
Top–down design is focused on high-level functional requirements, with relatively less focus on existing implementation technology. A top-level spec is repeatedly decomposed into lower-level structures and specifications until the physical implementation layer is reached. The risk of a top–down design is that it may not take advantage of more efficient applications of current physical technology, due to excessive layers of lower-level abstraction due to following an abstraction path that does not efficiently fit available components e.g. separately specifying sensing, processing, and wireless communications elements even though a suitable component that combines these may be available. The positive value of top–down design is that it preserves a focus on the optimum solution requirements.

A part-centric top–down design may eliminate some of the risks of top–down design. This starts with a layout model, often a simple 2D sketch defining basic sizes and some major defining parameters, which may include some Industrial design elements. Geometry from this is associatively copied down to the next level, which represents different subsystems of the product. The geometry in the sub-systems is then used to define more detail in the levels below. Depending on the complexity of the product, a number of levels of this assembly are created until the basic definition of components can be identified, such as position and principal dimensions. This information is then associatively copied to component files. In these files the components are detailed; this is where the classic bottom–up assembly starts.

The top–down assembly is sometimes known as a &quot;control structure&quot;. If a single file is used to define the layout and parameters for the review structure it is often known as a skeleton file.

Defense engineering traditionally develops the product structure from the top down. The system engineering process prescribes a functional decomposition of requirements and then the physical allocation of product structure to the functions. This top down approach would normally have lower levels of the product structure developed from CAD data as a bottom–up structure or design.

===Both-ends-against-the-middle design===
Both-ends-against-the-middle (BEATM) design is a design process that endeavors to combine the best features of top–down design, and bottom–up design into one process. A BEATM design process flow may begin with an emergent technology that suggests solutions that may have value, or it may begin with a top–down view of an important problem that needs a solution. In either case, the key attribute of BEATM design methodology is to immediately focus on both ends of the design process flow: a top–down view of the solution requirements, and a bottom–up view of the available technology which may offer the promise of an efficient solution. The BEATM design process proceeds from both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the top–down requirements, and bottom–up efficient implementation. In this fashion, BEATM has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies. Indeed, some of the best success stories from either top–down or bottom–up have been successful because of an intuitive, yet unconscious use of the BEATM methodology. When employed consciously, BEATM offers even more powerful advantages.

===Front loading design and workflow===
Front loading is taking top–down design to the next stage. The complete control structure and review structure, as well as downstream data such as drawings, tooling development, and CAM models, are constructed before the product has been defined or a project kick-off has been authorized. These assemblies of files constitute a template from which a family of products can be constructed. When the decision has been made to go with a new product, the parameters of the product are entered into the template model, and all the associated data is updated. Obviously, predefined associative models will not be able to predict all possibilities and will require additional work. The main principle is that a lot of the experimental/investigative work has already been completed. A lot of knowledge is built into these templates to be reused on new products. This does require additional resources &quot;up front&quot; but can drastically reduce the time between project kick-off and launch. Such methods do however require organizational changes, as considerable engineering efforts are moved into &quot;offline&quot; development departments. It can be seen as an analogy to creating a concept car to test new technology for future products, but in this case, the work is directly used for the next product generation.

===Design in context===
Individual components cannot be constructed in isolation. CAD and CAID models of components are created within the context of some or all of the other components within the product being developed. This is achieved using assembly modelling techniques. The geometry of other components can be seen and referenced within the CAD tool being used. The other referenced components may or may not have been created using the same CAD tool, with their geometry being translated from other collaborative product development (CPD) formats. Some assembly checking such as DMU is also carried out using product visualization software.

==Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM)==
Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM) is an alternate genre of PLM in which the process by which the product is made is just as important as the product itself. Typically, this is the life sciences and advanced specialty chemicals markets. The process behind the manufacture of a given compound is a key element of the regulatory filing for a new drug application. As such, PPLM seeks to manage information around the development of the process in a similar fashion that baseline PLM talks about managing information around the development of the product.

One variant of PPLM implementations are Process Development Execution Systems (PDES). They typically implement the whole development cycle of high-tech manufacturing technology developments, from initial conception, through development, and into manufacture. PDES integrates people with different backgrounds from potentially different legal entities, data, information and knowledge, and business processes.

==Market size==
After the Great Recession, PLM investments from 2010 onwards showed a higher growth rate than most general IT spending.

Total spending on PLM software and services was estimated in 2020 to be $26 billion a year, with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 7.2% from 2021 to 2028. This was expected to be driven by a demand for software solutions for management functions, such as change, cost, compliance, data, and governance management.

==Pyramid of production systems==

According to Malakooti (2013), there are five long-term objectives that should be considered in production systems:

* Cost: Which can be measured in terms of monetary units and usually consists of fixed and variable costs.
* Productivity: Which can be measured in terms of the number of products produced during a period of time.
* Quality: Which can be measured in terms of customer satisfaction levels for example.
* Flexibility: Which can be considered the ability of the system to produce a variety of products for example.
* Sustainability: Which can be measured in terms of ecological soundness i.e. biological and environmental impacts of a production system.

The relation between these five objects can be presented as a pyramid with its tip associated with the lowest Cost, highest Productivity, highest Quality, most Flexibility, and greatest Sustainability. The points inside of this pyramid are associated with different combinations of five criteria. The tip of the pyramid represents an ideal (but likely highly unfeasible) system whereas the base of the pyramid represents the worst system possible.

<text>The open-mid central unrounded vowel, or low-mid central unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is (formerly ). The IPA symbol is not the digit or the Cyrillic small letter Ze (з). The symbol is instead a reversed Latinized variant of the lowercase epsilon, ɛ. The value was specified only in 1993; until then, was an alternative symbol for the mid central unrounded vowel .

The letter may be used with a raising diacritic , to denote the mid central unrounded vowel. It may also be used with a lowering diacritic , to denote the near-open central unrounded vowel.

Conversely, , the symbol for the mid central vowel may be used with a lowering diacritic to denote the open-mid central unrounded vowel, although that is more specifically written with an additional unrounding diacritic to explicitly denote the lack of rounding (the canonical value of IPA is undefined for rounding).

<text>Daniel Wheeler Bursch (born July 25, 1957) is a former NASA astronaut, and Captain of the United States Navy. He had four spaceflights, the first three of which were Space Shuttle missions lasting 10 to 11 days each. His fourth and final spaceflight was a long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station as a crew member of Expedition 4, which lasted from December 2001 to June 2002. This 196-day mission set a new record for the longest duration spaceflight for an American astronaut, a record simultaneously set with his crew mate Carl Walz. Their record has since been broken, and as of 2016 it is held by Scott Kelly, who flew a 340-day mission during Expeditions 43, 44 and 45.

==Education==
Bursch graduated from Vestal Senior High School, Vestal, New York, in 1975; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the United States Naval Academy in 1979, and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Science from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1991.

==Navy career==
Bursch graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1979, and was designated a Naval Flight Officer in April 1980 at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. After initial training as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator (B/N), he reported to VA-34 in January 1981, and deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the aircraft carrier , and to the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans aboard . He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in January 1984. Upon graduation in December he worked as a project test flight officer flying the A-6 Intruder until August 1984, when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as a flight instructor. In April 1987, Bursch was assigned to the commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, as strike operations officer, making deployments to the Indian Ocean aboard the cruiser and the carrier . Redesignated an Aeronautical Engineering Duty officer (AEDO), he attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, from July 1989 until his selection to the astronaut program.

He has flown over 3,430 flight hours in more than 35 different aircraft.

==Astronaut career==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Bursch became an astronaut in July 1991. His technical assignments to date include: Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch, working on controls and displays for the Space Shuttle and Space Station; Chief of Astronaut Appearances; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control. A veteran of four space flights, Bursch has logged over 227 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-68 (1994) and STS-77 (1996), and served as flight engineer on International Space Station Expedition 4 (2001–2002). Dan Bursch and fellow astronaut Carl Walz completed one of the longest U.S. space flights of 196 days in space. In January 2003, Bursch reported to the Naval Postgraduate School for a two-year assignment as an instructor in the Space Systems Academic Group.

He left NASA in May 2005 and later retired from active duty in July 2005 after 26 years of service in the U.S. Navy. Bursch joined The Aerospace Corporation in July 2005 and is currently serving as the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Chair at the Naval Postgraduate School.

===STS-51===
STS-51 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1993. During the ten-day mission the crew of five aboard the deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Following a spacewalk by two crew members to evaluate Hubble Space Telescope repair tools, the crew initiated rendezvous burns and Bursch recovered the SPAS using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The mission concluded on September 22, 1993, with the first night landing at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 236 hours and 11 minutes.

===STS-68===
STS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. As part of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s cargo bay to study Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth&#x27;s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours and 46 minutes.

===STS-77===
STS-77 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on May 19, 1996. It included the fourth Spacehab module flight as a scientific laboratory, designated SPACEHAB-4. It consisted of 12 separate materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology experiments, with an emphasis on commercial space product development. STS-77 completed a record four rendezvous in support of two satellites sponsored by the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the SPARTAN 207/Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) and the Passive Aerodynamically stabilized Magnetically damped Satellite/Satellite Test Unit (PAMS/STU). Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the ten-day mission ended with Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at the Kennedy Space Center on May 29, 1996. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes.

===Expedition 4===
The Expedition 4 crew launched on December 5, 2001 aboard STS-108 and docked with the International Space Station on December 7, 2001. During a 6½ month stay aboard the Space Station, the Expedition 4 crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The crew spent 196 days in space establishing a U.S. space flight endurance record for Dan Bursch and crew mate Carl Walz. Wearing the Russian Orlan spacesuit, Bursch logged 11 hours and 48 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition-Four crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002.

He served as an A-6 Intruder bombardier/navigator with squadrons in the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. He returned to NAS Pensacola in 1975 for pilot training and was redesignated as a naval aviator in September 1976. He was then assigned to the 2nd MAW at MCAS Cherry Point, where he flew A-6 Intruders. He graduated from the United States Naval Test Pilot School in 1981, and served at the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, as the A-6 program manager, X-29 advanced technology demonstrator project officer, and as a test pilot for flight systems and ordnance separation testing on A-6 Intruder and A-4 Skyhawk series aircraft. Prior to his selection as an astronaut candidate, he was serving as the assistant operations officer of Marine Aircraft Group 12 at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.

Cabana retired from the Marine Corps in August 2000 in the rank of colonel.

He has logged over 7,000 hours in 34 different kinds of aircraft.

==NASA career==

Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Cabana completed initial astronaut training in July 1986, qualifying for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His initial assignment was as the Astronaut Office Space Shuttle flight software coordinator until November 1986. At that time he was assigned as the deputy chief of aircraft operations for the Johnson Space Center where he served for years. He then served as the lead astronaut in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) where the Orbiter&#x27;s flight software is tested prior to flight. Cabana has served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control during Space Shuttle missions, and as chief of astronaut appearances. Prior to his assignment to command STS-88, Cabana served three years as NASA&#x27;s Chief of the Astronaut Office.

Following STS-88, Cabana served as the deputy director of flight crew operations. After joining the ISS Program in October 1999, Cabana served as manager for international operations. From August 2001 to September 2002, he served as director of Human Space Flight Programs, Russia. As NASA&#x27;s lead representative to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (Rosaviakosmos) and its contractors, he provided oversight of all human space flight operations, logistics, and technical functions, including NASA&#x27;s mission operations in Korolev and crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia.

Upon his return to Houston, Cabana was assigned briefly as the deputy manager of International Space Station (ISS) Program. From November 2002 to March 2004, he served as director of Flight Crew Operations Directorate, responsible for directing the day-to-day activities of the directorate, including the NASA Astronaut Corps and aircraft operations at Ellington Field. He was then assigned as deputy director of the Johnson Space Center, where he served for three and a half years. From October 2007 through October 2008, Cabana served as director of John C. Stennis Space Center.

In October 2008 he was reassigned as director of the John F. Kennedy Space Center, and served as director for over a decade.

In May 2021, Cabana was appointed as the Associate Administrator of NASA. As a former active astronaut still employed by NASA, Cabana remained a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps as a non-flight eligible management astronauts. Cabana retired from NASA on December 31, 2023.

==Spaceflight experience==

STS-41 &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on October 6, 1990, from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 10, 1990. During 66 orbits of the Earth, the five-man crew successfully deployed the Ulysses spacecraft, starting the interplanetary probe on its four-year journey, via Jupiter, to investigate the polar regions of the Sun; operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone levels; activated a controlled &quot;fire in space&quot; experiment (the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment, or SSCE); and conducted numerous other middeck experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer membrane production, and microgravity effects on plants.

STS-53 &quot;Discovery&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1992. The crew of five deployed the classified Department of Defense payload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. After completing 115 orbits of the Earth in 175 hours, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 9, 1992.

STS-65 &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 8, 1994, returning to Florida on July 23, 1994. The crew conducted the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) mission utilizing the long Spacelab module in the payload bay. The flight consisted of 82 experiments from 15 countries and six space agencies from around the world. During the record-setting 15-day flight, the crew conducted experiments that focused on materials and life sciences research in a microgravity environment paving the way for future operations and cooperation aboard International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth in 353 hours and 55 minutes.

STS-88 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (December 4–15, 1998) was the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the 12-day mission, &quot;Unity&quot;, the U.S. built node, was attached to &quot;Zarya&quot;, the Russian built Functional Cargo Block (FGB). Two crewmembers performed three spacewalks to connect umbilicals and attach tools/hardware in the assembly and outfitting of the station. Additionally, the crew performed the initial activation and first ingress of the International Space Station preparing it for future assembly missions and full-time occupation. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 built by the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Phillips Laboratory, and SAC-A, the first successful launch of an Argentine satellite. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

Cabana has logged over 1,010 hours in space.

<text>A carbon star (C-type star) is typically an asymptotic giant branch star, a luminous red giant, whose atmosphere contains more carbon than oxygen. The two elements combine in the upper layers of the star, forming carbon monoxide, which consumes most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, leaving carbon atoms free to form other carbon compounds, giving the star a &quot;sooty&quot; atmosphere and a strikingly ruby red appearance. There are also some dwarf and supergiant carbon stars, with the more common giant stars sometimes being called classical carbon stars to distinguish them.

In most stars (such as the Sun), the atmosphere is richer in oxygen than carbon. Ordinary stars not exhibiting the characteristics of carbon stars but cool enough to form carbon monoxide are therefore called oxygen-rich stars.

Carbon stars have quite distinctive spectral characteristics, and they were first recognized by their spectra by Angelo Secchi in the 1860s, a pioneering time in astronomical spectroscopy.

==Spectra==

By definition carbon stars have dominant spectral Swan bands from the molecule C2. Many other carbon compounds may be present at high levels, such as CH, CN (cyanogen), C3 and SiC2. Carbon is formed in the core and circulated into its upper layers, dramatically changing the layers&#x27; composition. In addition to carbon, S-process elements such as barium, technetium, and zirconium are formed in the shell flashes and are &quot;dredged up&quot; to the surface.

When astronomers developed the spectral classification of the carbon stars, they had considerable difficulty when trying to correlate the spectra to the stars&#x27; effective temperatures. The trouble was with all the atmospheric carbon hiding the absorption lines normally used as temperature indicators for the stars.

Carbon stars also show a rich spectrum of molecular lines at millimeter wavelengths and submillimeter wavelengths. In the carbon star CW Leonis more than 50 different circumstellar molecules have been detected. This star is often used to search for new circumstellar molecules.

===Secchi===
Carbon stars were discovered already in the 1860s when spectral classification pioneer Angelo Secchi erected the Secchi class IV for the carbon stars, which in the late 1890s were reclassified as N class stars.

===Harvard===
Using this new Harvard classification, the N class was later enhanced by an R class for less deeply red stars sharing the characteristic carbon bands of the spectrum. Later correlation of this R to N scheme with conventional spectra, showed that the R-N sequence approximately run in parallel with c:a G7 to M10 with regards to star temperature.

===Morgan–Keenan C system ===

The later N classes correspond less well to the counterparting M types, because the Harvard classification was only partially based on temperature, but also carbon abundance; so it soon became clear that this kind of carbon star classification was incomplete. Instead a new dual number star class C was erected so to deal with temperature and carbon abundance. Such a spectrum measured for Y Canum Venaticorum, was determined to be C54, where 5 refers to temperature dependent features, and 4 to the strength of the C2 Swan bands in the spectrum. (C54 is very often alternatively written C5,4). This Morgan–Keenan C system classification replaced the older R-N classifications from 1960 to 1993.

===The Revised Morgan–Keenan system===
The two-dimensional Morgan–Keenan C classification failed to fulfill the creators&#x27; expectations:
#it failed to correlate to temperature measurements based on infrared,
#originally being two-dimensional it was soon enhanced by suffixes, CH, CN, j and other features making it impractical for en-masse analyses of foreign galaxies&#x27; carbon star populations,
#and it gradually occurred that the old R and N stars actually were two distinct types of carbon stars, having real astrophysical significance.
A new revised Morgan–Keenan classification was published in 1993 by Philip Keenan, defining the classes: C-N, C-R and C-H. Later the classes C-J and C-Hd were added. This constitutes the established classification system used today.

==Astrophysical mechanisms==
Carbon stars can be explained by more than one astrophysical mechanism. &quot;Classical carbon stars&quot; are distinguished from &quot;non-classical&quot; ones on the grounds of mass, with classical carbon stars being the more massive.

In the &quot;classical carbon stars&quot;, those belonging to the modern spectral types C-R and C-N, the abundance of carbon is thought to be a product of helium fusion, specifically the triple-alpha process within a star, which giants reach near the end of their lives in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). These fusion products have been brought to the stellar surface by episodes of convection (the so-called third dredge-up) after the carbon and other products were made. Normally this kind of AGB carbon star fuses hydrogen in a hydrogen burning shell, but in episodes separated by 104–105 years, the star transforms to burning helium in a shell, while the hydrogen fusion temporarily ceases. In this phase, the star&#x27;s luminosity rises, and material from the interior of the star (notably carbon) moves up. Since the luminosity rises, the star expands so that the helium fusion ceases, and the hydrogen shell burning restarts. During these &quot;shell helium flashes&quot;, the mass loss from the star is significant, and after many shell helium flashes, an AGB star is transformed into a hot white dwarf and its atmosphere becomes material for a planetary nebula.

The &quot;non-classical&quot; kinds of carbon stars, belonging to the types C-J and C-H, are believed to be binary stars, where one star is observed to be a giant star (or occasionally a red dwarf) and the other a white dwarf. The star presently observed to be a giant star accreted carbon-rich material when it was still a main-sequence star from its companion (that is, the star that is now the white dwarf) when the latter was still a classical carbon star. That phase of stellar evolution is relatively brief, and most such stars ultimately end up as white dwarfs. These systems are now being observed a comparatively long time after the mass transfer event, so the extra carbon observed in the present red giant was not produced within that star. This scenario is also accepted as the origin of the barium stars, which are also characterized as having strong spectral features of carbon molecules and of barium (an s-process element). Sometimes the stars whose excess carbon came from this mass transfer are called &quot;extrinsic&quot; carbon stars to distinguish them from the &quot;intrinsic&quot; AGB stars which produce the carbon internally. Many of these extrinsic carbon stars are not luminous or cool enough to have made their own carbon, which was a puzzle until their binary nature was discovered.

The enigmatic &quot;hydrogen deficient carbon stars&quot; (HdC), belonging to the spectral class C-Hd, seems to have some relation to R Coronae Borealis variables (RCB), but are not variable themselves and lack a certain infrared radiation typical for RCB:s. Only five HdC:s are known, and none is known to be binary, so the relation to the non-classical carbon stars is not known.

Other less convincing theories, such as CNO cycle unbalancing and core helium flash have also been proposed as mechanisms for carbon enrichment in the atmospheres of smaller carbon stars.

==Other characteristics==
Most classical carbon stars are variable stars of the long period variable types.

===Observing carbon stars===
Due to the insensitivity of night vision to red and a slow adaption of the red sensitive eye rods to the light of the stars, astronomers making magnitude estimates of red variable stars, especially carbon stars, have to know how to deal with the Purkinje effect in order not to underestimate the magnitude of the observed star.

===Generation of interstellar dust===
Owing to its low surface gravity, as much as half (or more) of the total mass of a carbon star may be lost by way of powerful stellar winds. The star&#x27;s remnants, carbon-rich &quot;dust&quot; similar to graphite, therefore become part of the interstellar dust. This dust is believed to be a significant factor in providing the raw materials for the creation of subsequent generations of stars and their planetary systems. The material surrounding a carbon star may blanket it to the extent that the dust absorbs all visible light.

Silicon carbide outflow from carbon stars was accreted in the early solar nebula  and survived in the matrices of relatively unaltered chondritic meteorites. This allows for direct isotopic analysis of the circumstellar environment of 1-3 M☉ carbon stars. Stellar outflow from carbon stars is the source of the majority of presolar silicon carbide found in meteorites.

==Other classifications==
Other types of carbon stars include:
* CCS – Cool Carbon Star
* CEMP – Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor
** CEMP-no – Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor star with no enhancement of elements produced by the r-process or s-process nucleosynthesis
** CEMP-r – Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor star with an enhancement of elements produced by r-process nucleosynthesis
** CEMP-s – Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor star with an enhancement of elements produced by s-process nucleosynthesis
** CEMP-r/s – Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor star with an enhancement of elements produced by both r-process and s-process nucleosynthesis
* CGCS – Cool Galactic Carbon Star

==Use as standard candles==

Classical carbon stars are very luminous, especially in the near-infrared, so they can be detected in nearby galaxies. Because of the strong absorption features in their spectra, carbon stars are redder in the near-infrared than oxygen-rich stars are, and they can be identified by their photometric colors. While individual carbon stars do not all have the same luminosity, a large sample of carbon stars will have a luminosity probability density function (PDF) with nearly the same median value, in similar galaxies. So the median value of that function can be used as a standard candle for the determination of the distance to a galaxy. The shape of the PDF may vary depending upon the average metallicity of the AGB stars within a galaxy, so it is important to calibrate this distance indicator using several nearby galaxies for which the distances are known through other means.

<text>Anusim (, ; singular male, anús, ; singular female, anusá, , meaning &quot;coerced&quot;) is a legal category of Jews in &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will, typically while forcibly converted to another religion. The term &quot;anusim&quot; is most properly translated as the &quot;coerced [ones]&quot; or the &quot;forced [ones]&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;anusim&quot; is derived from the Talmudic phrase &quot;averah b’ones&quot; (), meaning &quot;a forced transgression.&quot; The Hebrew &quot;ones&quot; () derives from the triconsonantal root (Aleph-Nun-Samekh), and originally referred to any case where a person has been forced into any act against his or her will. In Modern Hebrew, the word &quot;ones&quot; is mainly used to mean rape, thus &quot;anusim&quot; (or female &quot;anusot&quot;) nowadays means rape victims, the older meaning used only in the historical context.

The term &quot;anús&quot; is used in contradistinction to &quot;meshumad&quot; (), (literally &quot;self-destroyed&quot;) which means a person who has voluntarily abandoned the practice of Jewish law in whole or in part. The forced converts were also known as &quot;cristianos nuevos&quot; (Spanish) or &quot;cristãos-novos&quot; (Portuguese); &quot;converso&quot; or &quot;marrano&quot;, which had and still has today a pejorative connotation in Spanish.

==Related terms==

Besides the term &quot;anusim&quot;, halakha has various classifications for those Jews who have abandoned, or are no longer committed to, the rabbinic Jewish tradition, whether or not they have converted to another religion.

The two most common descriptions are:

* &quot;&quot;Min&quot; (), or an apostate of Judaism, for a Jew who basically denies the existence of God; and
* &quot;&quot;Meshumad&quot; (), literally &quot;self-destroyed&quot; or a heretic to Judaism, for a Jew who deliberately rebels against the observance of Jewish law.

The main difference between a &quot;min&quot;, a &quot;meshumad&quot;, and the &quot;anusim&quot; is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a &quot;min&quot; and a &quot;meshumad&quot;, while for the &quot;anusim&quot; it is not.

In more recent times, the term &quot;anusim&quot; has also been used to describe &quot;Reverse Marranos&quot;, that is, Haredi Jews who are religious on the outside, but are not necessarily practicing in private.

==History of use==
The term &quot;anusim&quot; became more frequently used after the forced conversion to Christianity of Ashkenazi Jews in Germany at the end of the 11th century. In his religious legal opinions, Rashi, a French rabbi who lived during this period, commented about the issue of anusim.

Several centuries later, following the mass forced conversion of Sephardi Jews (those Jews with extended histories in Spain and Portugal, known jointly as Iberia, or Sepharad in Hebrew) of the 15th and 16th centuries, the term &quot;anusim&quot; became widely used by Spanish rabbis and their successors for the following 600 years, henceforth becoming associated with Sephardic history.

The term may be properly applied to any Jew of any ethnic division. Since that time, it has also been applied to other forced or coerced converted Jews, such as the Mashhadi Jews of Persia (now Iran), who converted to Islam in the public eye, but secretly practised Judaism at home. They lived dual-religious lives, being fully practising Muslims in public life, and fully practising Jews at home.

In non-rabbinic literature, the more widely known Sephardic anusim are also referred to as:
*&quot;Conversos&quot;, meaning &quot;converts [to Christianity]&quot; in Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish).
*&quot;New Christians&quot;, or in Spanish, and in Portuguese (), which also encompasses converts from Islam.
*&quot;Crypto-Jews&quot;, and
*&quot;Marranos&quot;, a term which refers to those conversos which practiced Judaism in secret and, as a result, were targeted by the Spanish inquisition.

==In rabbinic literature==
The subject of anusim has a special place in rabbinic literature. In normal circumstances, a person who abandons Jewish observance, or part of it, is classified as a &quot;meshumad&quot;. Such a person is still counted as a Jew for purposes of lineage, but is under a disability to claim any privilege pertaining to Jewish status: for example, he should not be counted in a minyan, that is, a quorum for religious services.

&quot;Anusim&quot;, by contrast, not only remain Jews by lineage but continue to count as fully qualified Jews for all purposes. Since the act of the original abandonment of the religion was done against the Jew&#x27;s will, the Jew under force may remain a kosher Jew, as long as the &quot;anús&quot; keeps practising Jewish law to the best of his/her abilities under the coerced condition. In this sense, &quot;kosher&quot; is the rabbinic legal term applied to a Jew who adheres to rabbinic tradition and is accordingly not subject to any disqualification.

==Rabbinic legal opinions==
Se‘adyá ben Maimón ibn Danan in the 15th century stated:
Hakham Joseph Shalom, writing in the 16th century, stated:This is how it is with these &quot;conversos&quot;: They derive from the hope of Israel, despite the fact that they have been immersed among the idolaters. Their hope and righteousness endure forever (...) furthermore, when they come to be included among the Jews, they are simply circumcised; they are not immersed like converts who were never part of the Jewish people.Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of the State of Israel, stated in the mid-20th century:
It follows that Uziel considered &quot;anusím&quot; as Jews, because only Jews can give or receive a &quot;get&quot;, a Jewish divorce. Maimonides stated in the Mishneh Torah Sefer Shofetím, Hilekhót Mumarím 3:3:

== Current status ==
There is much controversy regarding the status of conversions today. While the chief rabbis are wary of converting large groups, there are some rabbis such as Haim Amsalem and Chuck Davidson who have done mass conversions of Bnei Anusim (descendants of original Anusim). In the United States Reform rabbi Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach movement to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.

<text>The is a submarine-launched attack floatplane designed for the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. It was intended to operate from I-400 class submarines, whose original mission was to conduct aerial attacks against the United States.

==Design and development==
From the late 1920s, the Imperial Japanese Navy had developed a doctrine of operating floatplanes from submarines to search for targets.

In December 1941, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, proposed constructing a large fleet of submarine aircraft carriers (also designated STo or &quot;sen-toku&quot;—special submarine) whose purpose was to mount aerial attacks against American coastal cities. The submarines would surface to launch their aircraft by catapult, submerge to avoid detection, then surface again to retrieve the aircrews, who would ditch their planes nearby. By June 1942, the plan was to build a fleet of eighteen such submarines. This was later cut to nine, then five, and finally just three, as Japan&#x27;s wartime fortunes declined.

To equip the submarine aircraft carriers, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service requested that Aichi design a folding attack aircraft with a range of and a speed of . Aichi was already manufacturing under license the D4Y1 &quot;Suisei&quot; (Judy), a relatively small single-engined carrier dive bomber with exceptionally clean lines and high performance. Detailed engineering studies commenced in an effort to modify the Suisei for use aboard the I-400 submarines but the difficulties in doing so were eventually judged insurmountable and a completely new design was initiated.
Aichi&#x27;s final design, designated AM-24 by Aichi and given the military designation M6A1, was a two-seat, low-winged monoplane powered by a Aichi AE1P Atsuta 30 engine (a licence-built copy of the Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled V12 engine). The original specification dispensed with a traditional undercarriage but it was later decided to fit the aircraft with detachable twin floats to increase its versatility. If conditions permitted, these would allow the aircraft to land next to the submarine, be recovered by crane and then re-used. The floats could be jettisoned in flight to increase performance or left off altogether for one-way missions.
The &quot;Seiran&#x27;s&quot; wings rotated 90 degrees and folded hydraulically against the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage (with the tail also folding down) to allow for storage within the submarine&#x27;s diameter cylindrical hangar. Armament was a single torpedo or an equivalent weight in bombs. One Type 2 machine gun was mounted on a flexible mounting for use by the observer.

As finalized, each I-400 class submarine had an enlarged watertight hangar capable of accommodating up to three M6A1s. The &quot;Seirans&quot; were to be launched from a compressed-air catapult mounted on the forward deck. A well-trained crew of four men could roll a &quot;Seiran&quot; out of its hangar on a collapsible catapult carriage, attach the plane&#x27;s pontoons and have it readied for flight in approximately 7 minutes.

In order to shorten the launching process and eliminate the need for time-consuming engine warm-ups, the &quot;Seirans&quot; were to be catapulted from a cold start. This necessitated heating the engine oil for each plane to approximately in a separate chamber and pumping it, as well as hot water, through the engine just prior to launch while the planes were still in the hangar. In this way, the aircraft&#x27;s engine would be at or near normal operating temperature immediately upon getting airborne. The idea was borrowed from the Germans who planned on using a similar launch method for the aircraft of their unfinished carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

The first of eight prototype &quot;Seirans&quot; was completed in October 1943, commencing flight testing in November that year. A problem with overbalance of the auxiliary wings was eventually solved by raising the height of the tail fin. Further testing was sufficiently successful for production to start in early 1944. In order to aid pilot conversion to the &quot;Seiran&quot;, two examples of a land based trainer version fitted with a retractable undercarriage were built. These were given the designation M6A1-K &quot;Nanzan&quot; (&quot;Southern Mountain&quot;). Besides the difference in landing gear, the vertical stabilizer&#x27;s top portion, which was foldable on the &quot;Seiran&quot;, was removed.

==Operational history==
The first production examples of the &quot;Seiran&quot; were completed in October 1944. Deliveries were slowed by an earthquake near Nagoya on 7 December 1944, and by an American air-raid on 12 March 1945. Construction of the STo submarines was stopped in March 1945, after two submarine aircraft carriers had been completed and a third finished as a fuel tanker. These were supplemented by two smaller Type AM submarines, originally designed as command submarines carrying reconnaissance floatplanes, but capable of carrying two &quot;Seirans&quot;. Owing to the reduced carrier submarine force, production of the &quot;Seiran&quot; was halted, with a total of 28 completed (including the prototypes and the M6A1-Ks).

The new submarines and aircraft were assigned to the 1st Submarine Flotilla, comprising the two STo submarines, the &quot;I-400&quot; and the flagship &quot;I-401&quot;, each carrying three &quot;Seirans&quot; together with two type AMs, the &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot;. The 1st Submarine Flotilla commenced training with the &quot;Seirans&quot; in January 1945, and the crews gradually learned how to handle the submarines and aircraft. Launching all three &quot;Seirans&quot; took longer than expected: 30 minutes if floats were fitted, although this could be reduced to 14.5 minutes if the floats were not used.

The first mission of the &quot;Seiran&quot; squadron, which was named the was to be a surprise air strike on the Gatun locks of the Panama Canal, to cut the main supply line for US forces in the Pacific. When the force was finally ready to set off on their mission against Panama, Japan&#x27;s increasingly desperate situation led to a change in plan, with the target for the attack, called Operation &quot;Hikari&quot; (Splendour), being switched to the American base at Ulithi Atoll where forces, including aircraft carriers, were massing in preparation for attacks on the Japanese Home Islands. The flotilla departed Japan on 23 July 1945 and proceeded towards Ulithi. On 16 August, the flagship &quot;I-401&quot; received a radio message from headquarters, informing them of Japan&#x27;s surrender and ordering them to return to Japan. All six &quot;Seirans&quot; on board the two submarines, having been disguised for the operation as American planes in violation of the laws of war, were catapulted into the sea with their wings and stabilizers folded (for the &quot;I-401&quot;) or pushed overboard (for the &quot;I-400)&quot; to prevent capture.

<text>The open-mid front rounded vowel, or low-mid front rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the sound is . The symbol œ is a lowercase ligature of the letters o and e. The letter , a small capital version of the ligature, is used for a different vowel sound: the open front rounded vowel.

==Open-mid front compressed vowel==
The open-mid front compressed vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , which is the convention used in this article. There is no dedicated IPA diacritic for compression. However, the compression of the lips can be shown by the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, but &#x27;spread&#x27; technically means unrounded.

===Features===


===Occurrence===
Because front rounded vowels are assumed to have compression, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have protrusion.

==Open-mid front protruded vowel==
Catford notes that most languages with rounded front and back vowels use distinct types of labialization, protruded back vowels and compressed front vowels. However, a few, such as Scandinavian languages, have protruded front vowels. One Scandinavian language, Swedish, even contrasts the two types of rounding in front vowels (see near-close front rounded vowel, with Swedish examples of both types of rounding).

As there are no diacritics in the IPA to distinguish protruded and compressed rounding, an old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for protruded front vowels. Another possible transcription is or (an open-mid front vowel modified by endolabialization), but it could be misread as a diphthong.

Acoustically, the sound is &quot;between&quot; the more typical compressed open-mid front vowel and the unrounded open-mid front vowel .
