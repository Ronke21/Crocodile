<text>Adverse possession in common law, and the related civil law concept of usucaption (also &quot;acquisitive prescription&quot; or &quot;prescriptive acquisition&quot;), are legal mechanisms under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property, usually real property, may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation without the permission (licence) of its legal owner.

It is sometimes colloquially described as &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot;, a term associated with occupation without legal title during the westward expansion in North America, as occupying real property without permission is central to adverse possession. Some jurisdictions regulate squatting separately from adverse possession.

==Description==
In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, many legal systems courts recognize that once someone has occupied property without permission for a significant period of time without the property owner exercising their right to recover their property, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to eject, but a new title to the property &quot;springs up&quot; in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property&#x27;s new owner. Over time, legislatures created statutes of limitations setting a time limit for how long owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these limitation periods vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years.

Although the elements of an adverse possession action differ by jurisdiction, a person claiming adverse possession in a common law system is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse and continuous for the statutory period. The possession by a person is not adverse during periods when they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner.

Civil Law jurisdictions may recognize a similar right of &quot;acquisitive prescription&quot;. For example, the French Code Civil 2258 et. seq. recognizes that title may be acquired through thirty years of &quot;continuous and uninterrupted possession which is peaceful, public, unequivocal, and as owner.&quot; It is related to the Roman law concept of usucaption or usucapio.

In Denmark, the concept was first mentioned as &quot;Hævd&quot; in Jyske Lov in 1241, though only regulating between peasants and the church, with an asymmetric time limit of 30 years for the church, and 40 years for the peasant. In 1475, the 40 year limit was ruled to apply between farmers as well. In 1547 (after the Reformation) a rule was passed to change this to 20 years for everyone. The rule was later adopted into the Danish Code, published in 1683, this specific part still being in force today. The Norwegian Code from 1688, also contains a similar provision.

Personal property, traditionally known as chattel, may also be adversely possessed, but owing to the differences in the nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, and favour the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve works of art.

==History==
In Roman law, &quot;usucapio&quot; laws allowed someone who was in possession of a good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner did not appear after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.

Parliament passed England&#x27;s first general statute limiting the right to recover possession of land in 1623, the Limitation Act 1623 (21 Jas. 1. c. 16). At common law, if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a right to possession was not allowed to allege that the land had come into their possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been &#x27;put into seisin&#x27;) at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognised a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute—first to the reign of Henry II, and then to the reign of Richard I. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient. A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the limitation period in most common law jurisdictions.

At traditional English common law, it was not possible to obtain title to property of the Crown by means of adverse possession. This principle was embodied by the Latin maxim &quot;nullum tempus occurrit regi&quot; (&#x27;no time runs against the king&#x27;). In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession. Land with &quot;registered title&quot; in some Torrens title systems is also immune, for example, land that has been registered in the Hawaii Land Court system.

In the common law system of England and its historical colonies, local legislatures—such as Parliament in England or American state legislatures—generally create statutes of limitations that bar the owners from recovering the property after a certain number of years have passed.

==England and Wales==
Adverse possession is one of the most contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the Middle Ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.

A more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another&#x27;s property if continual use is made. Squatting in England has been a way for land to be efficiently utilised, particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner&#x27;s right of action to eject the &quot;adverse possessor&quot; would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1623 (21 Jas. 1. c. 16), just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims. Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of &quot;possession&quot; that was &quot;adverse&quot; were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. Different rules are in place for the limitation periods of adverse possession in unregistered land and registered land. However, in the Land Registration Act 2002 adverse possession of registered land became much harder.

In recent times the Land Registry has made the process of claiming adverse possession and being awarded “title absolute” more difficult. Simply occupying or grazing the land will no longer justify the grant of title, instead the person in adverse possession must demonstrate commitment to own and utilize the land to the exclusion of all others.

Another significant limit on the principle, in the case of leases, is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired.

===Land Registration Act 2002===
The Land Registration Act 2002 received royal assent on 26 February 2002. The rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under schedule 6 of the Land Registration Act 2002, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor is entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the Land Registration Act 2002, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule&#x27;s function was to ensure land was used efficiently.

===Requirements===
Before the considerable hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced in the Land Registration Act 2002, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward.

First, under schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, the time when adverse possession began was when &quot;possession&quot; was taken. This had to be more than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But &quot;possession&quot; did not require actual occupation. So in &quot;Powell v McFarlane&quot;, it was held to be &quot;possession&quot; when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane&#x27;s land. The intruder must also show that they were dealing with the land as an occupying owner might have done, and that no one else had done so.

The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12-year time limit on McFarlane&#x27;s claim to have expired. As a result, proving intention to possess is likely to rely heavily on the factual matrix of the case and the squatters&#x27; factual possession. In &quot;Clowes Developments (UK) Ltd v Walters and Others [2005] EWHC (Ch)&quot;, the squatter cannot be found to have an intention to possess if they mistakenly believe that they are on the property with the permission of the title owner.

Third, possession is not considered &quot;adverse&quot; if the person is there with the owner&#x27;s consent. For example, in &quot;BP Properties Ltd v Buckler&quot;, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.

===Human rights challenges===
In &quot;JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham&quot;, Mr and Mrs Graham had been let a part of Mr Pye&#x27;s land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting planning permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right to &quot;peaceful enjoyment of possessions&quot; under Protocol 1, article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court in its Grand Chamber rejected this, holding that it was within a national government&#x27;s margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules. The House of Lords in &quot;Ofulue v Bossert&quot; in 2009 confirmed this understanding.

===Timing===
For registered land, adverse possession claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the date the Land Registration Act 2002 came into force) are governed by section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner&#x27;s title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the adverse possessor. The adverse possessor can then apply to be the new registered proprietor of the land.

For registered land, adverse possession claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure. Where land is registered, the adverse possessor may henceforth apply to be registered as owner after 10 years of adverse possession and the Land Registry must give notice to the true owner of this application. This gives the landowner a statutory period of time (65 business days) to object to the adverse possession, object to the application on the ground that there has not actually been the necessary 10 years&#x27; adverse possession, and/or to serve a &quot;counter-notice&quot;. If a counter-notice is served, then the application fails unless
* it would be unconscionable because of an equity by estoppel for the registered proprietor to seek to dispossess the squatter and the squatter ought in the circumstances to be registered as proprietor, or
* the squatter is for some other reason entitled to be registered as proprietor, or
* the squatter has been in adverse possession of land adjacent to their own under the mistaken but reasonable belief that they are the owner of it, the exact line of the boundary with this adjacent land has not been determined and the estate to which the application relates was registered more than a year prior to the date of the application.

Otherwise, the squatter becomes the registered proprietor according to the land registry. If the true owner is unable to evict the squatter in the two years following the first [unsuccessful] application, the squatter can apply again after this period and be successful despite the opposition of the owner. The process effectively prevents the removal of a landowner&#x27;s right to property without their knowledge, while ensuring squatters have a fair way of exercising their rights.

Where a tenant adversely possesses land, there is a presumption that they are doing so in a way that will benefit the landlord at the end of their term. If the land does not belong to their landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the reversion. If the land does belong to their landlord, it would seem that it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of their term.

Since September 2012, squatting in a residential building is a criminal offence, but this does not prevent title being claimed by reason of adverse possession even if the claimant is committing a criminal offence. This was confirmed in &quot;Best v Chief Land Registrar&quot;, where it was held that criminal and land law should be kept separate.

==United States==
===Requirements===
The party seeking title by adverse possession may be called the &quot;disseisor&quot;, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an adverse possession claim may be different in a number of states, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, in a manner that is open and notorious, continuously, and use it as if it were their own in a manner expected for the type of property. Some states impose additional requirements. Many of the states have enacted statutes regulating the rules of adverse possession. Some states require a hostility requirement to secure adverse possession. While most states take an objective approach to the hostility requirement, some states require a showing of good faith. Good faith means that claimants must demonstrate that they had some basis to believe that they actually owned the property at issue. Four states east of the Mississippi that require good faith in some form are Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.

====Additional requirements====
In addition to the basic elements of an adverse possession case, state law may require one or more additional elements to be proved by a person claiming adverse possession. Depending upon the state, additional requirements may include:

*Color of title, claim of title, or claim of right. Color of title and claim of title involve a legal document that appears (incorrectly) to give the disseisor title. In some jurisdictions the mere intent to take the land as one&#x27;s own may constitute &quot;claim of right&quot;, with no documentation required. Other cases have determined that a claim of right exists if the person believes they have rightful claim to the property, even if that belief is mistaken. A negative example would be a timber thief who sneaks onto a property, cuts timber not visible from the road, and hauls the logs away at night. Their actions, though they demonstrate actual possession, also demonstrate knowledge of guilt, as opposed to claim of right.
*Good faith (in a minority of states) or bad faith (sometimes called the &quot;Maine Doctrine&quot; although it is now abolished in Maine)
*Improvement, cultivation, or enclosure
*Payment of property taxes. This may be required by statute, such as in California, or just a contributing element to a court&#x27;s determination of possession. Both payment by the disseisor and by the true owner are relevant.
*Dispossession of land owned by a governmental entity: Generally, a disseisor cannot dispossess land legally owned by a government entity even if all other elements of adverse possession are met. One exception is when the government entity is acting like a business rather than a government entity.

===Consequences===
A disseisor will be committing a civil trespass on the property he has taken and the owner of the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass (&quot;ejectment&quot;) or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.

In 2008, due to the volume of adverse possession and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession. Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner&#x27;s rights. Approximately eight years after the 2008 amendment, on 30 June 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of adverse possession where title had vested prior to 2008. The Court specifically held that title to the adversely possessed property vested when the plaintiff &quot;satisfie[d] the requirement of the statute in effect at the relevant time.&quot; In other words, if title had vested at some time &quot;after&quot; the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have to satisfy the adverse possession standards amended by the New York State Legislature in 2008; however, if title vested at some time &quot;before&quot; the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have lawfully acquired title to the disputed area by satisfying the pre-amendment standard for adverse possession. &quot;Hudson Square Hotel&quot; also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the air rights are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) &quot;where&quot; (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) &quot;what&quot; property rights are acquired as a result of title to the ground floor area (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff. In &quot;Hudson Square Hotel&quot; the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building. This argument was motivated, in part, by the fact that the zoning laws at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six times the square footage of the ground floor area. For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of buildable square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession. The Court clarified, &quot;It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor.&quot; In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land. The Court also held, &quot;With title to land come air rights.&quot; In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land.

In other jurisdictions, the disseisor acquires merely an equitable title; the landowner is considered to be a trustee of the property for the disseisor.

Adverse possession extends only to the property actually possessed. If the original owner had a title to a greater area (or volume) of property, the disseisor does not obtain all of it. The exception to this is when the disseisor enters the land under a color of title to an entire parcel, their continuous and actual possession of a small part of that parcel will perfect their title to the entire parcel defined in their color of title. Thus a disseisor need not build a dwelling on, or farm on, every portion of a large tract in order to prove possession, as long as their title does correctly describe the entire parcel.

In some jurisdictions, a person who has successfully obtained title to property by adverse possession may (optionally) bring an action in land court to &quot;quiet title&quot; of record in their name on some or all of the former owner&#x27;s property. Such action will make it simpler to convey the interest to others in a definitive manner, and also serves as notice that there is a new &quot;owner of record&quot;, which may be a prerequisite to benefits such as equity loans or judicial standing as an abutter. Even if such action is not taken, the title is legally considered to belong to the new titleholder, with most of the benefits and duties, including paying property taxes to avoid losing title to the tax collector. The effects of having a stranger to the title paying taxes on property may vary from one jurisdiction to another. (Many jurisdictions have accepted tax payment for the same parcel from two different parties without raising an objection or notifying either party that the other had also paid.)

Adverse possession does not typically work against property owned by the public.

The process of adverse possession would require a thorough analysis if private property is taken by eminent domain, after which control is given to a private corporation (such as a railroad), and then abandoned.

Where land is registered under a Torrens title registration system or similar, special rules apply. It may be that the land cannot be affected by adverse possession (as was the case in England and Wales from 1875 to 1926, and as is still the case in the state of Minnesota) or that special rules apply.

Adverse possession may also apply to territorial rights. In the United States, Georgia lost an island in the Savannah River to South Carolina in 1990, when South Carolina had used fill from dredging to attach the island to its own shore. Since Georgia knew of this yet did nothing about it, the U.S. Supreme Court (which has original jurisdiction in such matters) granted this land to South Carolina, although the Treaty of Beaufort (1787) explicitly specified that the river&#x27;s islands belonged to Georgia.

=== Louisiana ===
Louisiana, which is a civil law state, adopts the legal doctrine of acquisitive prescription. It is derived from French law and governs the right of a person to gain possession of immovable property (a home). Pursuant to Civil Code Article 742, there are two ways that a squatter can gain possession of an immovable property: (1) peaceable and uninterrupted possession... for ten years in good faith and by just title; [or] (2) uninterrupted possession for thirty years without title or good faith.

==Squatter&#x27;s rights==
Most cases of adverse possession deal with boundary line disputes between two parties who hold clear title to their property. The term &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot; has no precise and fixed legal meaning. In some jurisdictions the term refers to temporary rights available to squatters that prevent them, in some circumstances, from being removed from property without due process. For example, in England and Wales reference is usually to section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. In the United States, no ownership rights are created by mere possession, and a squatter may only take possession through adverse possession if the squatter can prove all elements of an adverse possession claim for the jurisdiction in which the property is located.

As with any adverse possession claim, if a squatter abandons the property for a period, or if the rightful owner effectively removes the squatter&#x27;s access even temporarily during the statutory period, or gives their permission, the &quot;clock&quot; usually stops. For example, if the required period in a given jurisdiction is twenty years and the squatter is removed after only 15 years, the squatter loses the benefit of that 15-year possession (i.e., the clock is reset at zero). If that squatter later retakes possession of the property, that squatter must, to acquire title, remain on the property for a full 20 years after the date on which the squatter retook possession. In this example, the squatter would have held the property for 35 years (the original 15 years plus the later 20 years) to acquire title.

Depending on the jurisdiction, one squatter may or may not pass along continuous possession to another squatter, known as &quot;tacking&quot;. Tacking is defined as &quot;The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one&#x27;s own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period.&quot; There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and Privity of Estate. One of the three types of privity is required in order for one adverse possessor to &quot;tack&quot; their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating &quot;color of title.&quot; A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary &quot;continuous and hostile&quot; element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.

===England and Wales===

Although &quot;squatting&quot; is a criminal offence in England and Wales under Section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), the Court of Appeal has clarified that Section 144 will not bar a person who wants to claim adverse possession, based on the rule of &quot;ex turpi causa&quot;, from relying on illegal squatting as an act demonstrating possession of the property.

Section 17 of the Limitation Act 1980 means the old title holder&#x27;s estate will be extinguished and a new one will be created for the successful squatter. This section also inserted an immediate power of entry to the premises into Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

Finally, schedule 6 (para 7) of the Land Registration Act 2002 allows the successful adverse possessor to be registered as the new proprietor.

==Theory and scholarship==
=== Utilitarianism ===
Scholars have identified four utilitarian policies which justify adverse possession.

The first is that it exists to cure potential or actual defects in real estate titles by putting a statute of limitations on possible litigation over ownership and possession. Because of the doctrine of adverse possession, a landowner can be secure in title to their land. Otherwise, long-lost heirs of any former owner, possessor or lien holder of centuries past could come forward with a legal claim on the property.

The second theory is that adverse possession is &quot;a useful method for curing minor title defects&quot;. For example, someone may have had the intention to sell all of a parcel of land but mistakenly excluded a portion of it on the title. Thus, adverse possession allows the purchaser of the land to maintain ownership of the parcel which they believed was theirs from the impressions given by the seller.

The third theory is that adverse possession encourages and rewards productive use of land. Essentially, &quot;by vesting title in the industrious settler—rather than the absentee landowner—adverse possession promote[s] rapid development&quot;.

The fourth theory is that the adverse possessor places a high personal value on the land while the real title holder has effectively abandoned it, thus on principles of personhood and efficiency it makes sense to allow the change in title.

=== Copyright scholarship ===
Some legal scholars have proposed the extension of the concept of adverse possession to intellectual property law, in particular to reconcile intellectual property and antitrust law or to unify copyright law and property law.

<text>Sex segregation, sex separation, sex partition, gender segregation, gender separation, or gender partition is the physical, legal, or cultural separation of people according to their gender or biological sex at any age. Sex segregation can simply refer to the physical and spatial separation by sex without any connotation of illegal discrimination. In other circumstances, sex segregation can be controversial. Depending on the circumstances, it can be a violation of capabilities and human rights and can create economic inefficiencies; on the other hand, some supporters argue that it is central to certain religious laws and social and cultural histories and traditions.

==Definitions==

The term &quot;sex&quot; in &quot;sex segregation&quot; refers to the biological distinctions between men and women, used in contrast to &quot;gender&quot;. The term &quot;segregation&quot; refers to separation of the sexes, which can be enforced by rules, laws, and policies, or be a &quot;de facto&quot; outcome in which people are separated by sex. Even as a &quot;de facto&quot; outcome, sex segregation taken as a whole can be caused by societal pressures, historical practices, socialized preferences and “fundamental biological differences”. Sex segregation can refer to literal physical and spatial separation by sex. The term is also used for the exclusion of one sex from participation in an occupation, institution, or group. Sex segregation can be complete or partial, as when members of one sex predominate within, but do not exclusively constitute, a group or organization.

In the United States some scholars use the term &quot;sex separation&quot; and not &quot;sex segregation&quot;.

The term gender apartheid (or sexual apartheid) also has been applied to segregation of people by gender, implying that it is sexual discrimination. If sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination, its effects have important consequences for gender equality and equity.

==Types==

Sex segregation can occur in both public and private contexts, and be classified in many ways. Legal and gender studies scholar David S. Cohen offers one taxonomy in categorizing sex segregation as mandatory, administrative, permissive, or voluntary. Mandatory and administrative sex segregation are required and enforced by governments in public environments, while permissive and voluntary sex segregation are stances chosen by public or private institutions, but within the capacity of the law.

===Mandatory===

Mandatory sex segregation is legally required and enforces separation based on sex. Examples include separation of men and women in prisons, law enforcement, military service, public toilets, and housing. These mandatory rules can be nuanced, as in military service, where sexes are often separated in laws about conscription, in housing, and in regulations on which sexes can participate in certain roles, like frontline infantry. Mandatory sex segregation also includes less obvious cases of separation, as when men and women are required to have same-sex attendants for body searches. Mandatory sex segregation can thus dictate parameters for employment in sex segregated spaces, including medical and care work contexts, and can be a form of occupational segregation. For example, a government may mandate that clinics hire female nurses to care for female patients.

===Administrative===
Administrative sex segregation involves public and government institutions segregating by sex in their operating capacity, rather than as the result of a formal mandate. Examples of administrative sex segregation include sex segregation in government sponsored medical research, sports leagues, public hospitals with shared rooms, rehabilitation programs, and some public education facilities. Administrative sex segregation can occur in these environments simply as through the provisioning of sex segregated public toilets despite limited explicit legal requirements to do so.

===Permissive===

Permissive sex segregation is segregation which is explicitly permitted by law, i.e. affirmatively authorized, but not necessarily legally required or encouraged. Permissive sex segregation exempts certain things from anti-sex-discrimination laws, often allowing for, among others, segregation of religious and military schools, undergraduate schools that have traditionally admitted based on sex, health clubs, athletic teams, social fraternities and sororities, choirs and choruses, voluntary youth service organizations such as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, father/son and mother/daughter activities, and sex-exclusive beauty pageants and scholarships.

===Voluntary===

Sex segregation that is neither legally mandated, nor enacted in an administrative capacity, nor explicitly permitted by law, is recognized as voluntary sex segregation. Voluntary sex segregation refers to lack of explicit legal prescriptions; it does not necessarily indicate the free choice of either the segregated or the segregators, and it may be imposed by social and cultural norms. Voluntary sex segregation takes place in numerous national professional and interest-based membership organizations, local and larger clubs, professional sports teams, private recreational facilities, religious institutions, performing arts, and more.

==Theoretical explanations==
Within feminist theory and feminist legal theory, there are six main theoretical approaches that can be considered and used to analyze the causes and effects of sex segregation. They include libertarianism, equal treatment, difference feminism, anti-subordination, critical race feminism, and anti-essentialism.

===Libertarianism===

Libertarian feminist theory stems from ideologies similar to libertarian political theory; that legal and governmental institutions should not regulate choices and should allow people&#x27;s free will to govern their life trajectories. Libertarianism takes a free market approach to sex segregation saying that women have a natural right and are the most informed to make decisions for themselves but rejects special protections specifically for women. Autonomy is central to libertarianism, so theorists believe that the government should not interfere with decision making or be concerned with reasoning behind such decisions since men and women culturally and naturally make different and often diverging choices. Policies and laws enforced by the government should not act to change any inherent differences between the sexes. 
Libertarianism most directly relates to voluntary sex segregation as it maintains that the government should not regulate private institutions or entities&#x27; segregation by sex and should not regulate how individuals privately group themselves. Libertarian feminist David Berstein argues that while sex segregation can cause harm, guarding the freedom of choice for men and women is more important than preventing such sex segregation since methods of prevention can often cause more harm than good for both sexes. Women&#x27;s health clubs are an example of how sex segregation benefits women since desegregation would interfere with women&#x27;s abilities to exercise without the distraction of men and &#x27;ogling&#x27; without any direct benefit to allowing men a membership. Additionally, libertarians would allow for permissive sex segregation since it allows people to choose how to organize their interactions and relationships with others.
Libertarian feminists acknowledge that there is legal precedence for sex segregation laws, but argue for such parameters to ensure equal treatment of similarly situated men and women. As such, libertarianism could allow or reject specific forms of sex segregation created to account for natural or biological differences between the sexes.

===Equal treatment===

Equal treatment theory or formal equity often works in tandem with libertarianism in that equal treatment theorists believe governments should treat men and women similarly when their situations are similar. In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, equal treatment theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation. For example, equal treatment theory was adopted by the many feminists during the United States&#x27; feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of equal treatment theory led to the adoption of intermediate scrutiny as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations. While equal treatment theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently. In this manner, libertarianism and equal treatment theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.

===Difference feminism===

Difference feminism arose from libertarianism and equal treatment theories&#x27; perceived failure to create systemic equality for women. Difference feminism celebrates biological, psychological, moral differences between men and women, accusing laws concerning sex segregation of diluting these important differences. Difference feminists believe that such laws not only ignore these important differences, but also can exclude participation of women in the world. Difference feminism&#x27;s goal is to bring about a consciousness of women&#x27;s femininity and to cause the revaluation of women&#x27;s attributes in a more respectful, reverent manner.&lt;br&gt;
Difference feminism and equal treatment theory are quite contrasting feminist theories of sex segregation. Difference feminism often justifies sex segregation through women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s differences while equal treatment theory does not support separation because of differences in sex. Difference feminism, however, argues against segregation that stems from societal and &quot;old-fashioned&quot; differences between men and women, but believes that segregation that takes women&#x27;s differences into account and promotes equality is acceptable, even going so far as to say that some forms of sex segregation are necessary to ensure equality, such as athletics and education, and policies such as Title IX.

===Anti-subordination===
Anti-subordination feminist theory examines sex segregation of power to determine whether women are treated or placed subordinately compared to men in a law or situation. The theory focuses on male dominance and female subordination and promotes destroying a sex-based hierarchy in legal and social institutions and preventing future hierarchies from arising. Anti-subordination also supports laws that promote the status of women even if they lower men&#x27;s status as a consequence. Controversial applications of anti-subordination that can either perpetuate the subordination of women or create the subordination of men include sex segregation in education and in the military.

===Critical race feminism===

Critical race feminism developed due to the lack of racial inclusivity of feminist theories and lack of gender inclusivity of racial theories. This theory is more global than the others, attempting to take into account the intersectionality of gender and race. Critical race feminism demands that theorists reexamine surface-level segregation and focus on how sex segregation stems from different histories, causing different effects based on race, especially for women of color. This segregation is evident in many racially divided countries, especially in the relationship between the end of race-segregated schools and sex segregation. Critical race feminism critiques other theories&#x27; failure to take into account their different applications once race, class, sexual orientation, or other identity factors are included in a segregated situation. It creates the need to examine mandatory and administrative sex segregation to determine whether or if they sustain racial stereotypes, particularly towards women of color. Additionally, critical race feminists wonder whether permissive and voluntary sex segregation are socially acceptable manners by which to separate races and sexes or whether they maintain and perpetuate inequalities. Critical race feminism is a form of anti-essentialism (below).

===Anti-essentialism===

Anti-essentialists maintain that sex and gender categories are limiting and fail to include the unlimited variety of difference in human identity and impose identities rather than simply note their differences. Theorists believe that there is variation in what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and by promoting the differences through sex segregation, people are confined to categories, limiting freedom. Anti-essentialists examine how society imposes specific identities within the sex dichotomy and how subsequently sex and gender hierarchies are created, perpetuated, and normalized. This theory requires that there is a specific disentanglement between sex and gender. Anti-essentialists believe that there should not be an idea of what constitutes masculinity or femininity, but that individual characteristics should be fluid to eliminate sex and gender-based stereotypes. No specific types of sex segregation are outwardly promoted or supported by anti-essentialists since mandatory and administrative sex segregation reinforce power struggles between the sexes and genders while permissive or voluntary forms of sex segregation allow institutions and society to sort individuals into categories with differential access to power, and supporting the government&#x27;s elimination of such permission for certain institutions and norms to continue to exist.

==Contemporary policy examples==

Sex segregation is a global phenomenon manifested differently in varying localities. Sex segregation and integration considered harmless or normal in one country can be considered radical or illegal in others. At the same time, many laws and policies promoting segregation or desegregation recur across multiple national contexts. Safety and privacy concerns, traditional values and cultural norms, and belief that sex segregation can produce positive educational and overall social outcomes all shape public policy regarding sex segregation.

===Safety and privacy===

Some sex segregation occurs for reasons of safety and privacy. Worldwide, laws often mandate sex segregation in public toilets, changing rooms, showers, and similar spaces, based on a common perceived need for privacy. This type of segregation policy can protect against sexual harassment and sexual abuse. To combat groping, street harassment, and eve teasing of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated women only spaces. For example, sex-segregated buses, women-only passenger cars, and compartments on trains have been introduced in Mexico, Japan, the Philippines, the UAE and other countries to reduce sexual harassment. Some places in Germany, Korea, and China all have women&#x27;s parking spaces, often for related safety issues. Many more countries, including Canada, the United States, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom also grant parking privileges to pregnant women, for safety or access reasons.

Sex segregation rooted in safety considerations can furthermore extend beyond the physical to the psychological and emotional as well. A refuge for battered mothers or wives may refuse to admit men, even those who are themselves the victims of domestic violence, both to exclude those who might commit or threaten violence to women and because women who have been subjected to abuse by a male might feel threatened by the presence of any man. Women&#x27;s health clinics and women&#x27;s resource centers, whether in Africa or North America, are further examples of spaces where sex segregation may facilitate private and highly personal decisions. Women-only banks may be similarly intended to provide autonomy to women&#x27;s decision making.

===Religious and cultural ideas===

Sex segregation can also be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under the pretenses of safety or privacy concerns. Gender separation and segregation in Judaism and Islam reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, monastic orders, prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex.

From a policy perspective, theocracies and countries with a state religion have sometimes made sex segregation laws based partially in religious traditions. Even when not legally enforced, such traditions can be reinforced by social institutions and in turn result in sex segregation. In the South Asian context, one institution conducive to sex segregation, sometimes but not always rooted in national law, is purdah.

During the Taiping Rebellion (1851–64) against the Qing dynasty, areas controlled by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had strict sex separation enforced. Even married couples were not allowed to live together until 1858.

The Muslim world and the Middle East have been particularly scrutinized by scholars analyzing sex segregation resulting from the consequences of Sharia, the moral and religious code of Islam that, in the strictest version, Muslims hold to be the perfect law created by God. Saudi Arabia has been called an epicenter of sex segregation, stemming partially from its conservative Sunni Islamic practices and partially from its monarchy&#x27;s legal constraints. Sex segregation in Saudi Arabia is not inherent to the country&#x27;s culture, but was promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by the government, the Sahwa movement, and conservative and religious behavioral enforcers (i.e. police, government officers, etc.). 
Israel has also been noted both for its military draft of both sexes and its sex-segregated Mehadrin bus lines.

===Education and socialization===
Sex segregation is sometimes pursued through policy because it is thought to produce better educational outcomes. In some parts of the world, especially in Europe, where education is available to girls as well as boys, educational establishments were frequently single-gender. Such single-sex schools are still found in many countries, including but not limited to, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In the United States in particular, two federal laws give public and private entities permission to segregate based on sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. These laws permit sex segregation of contact sports, choruses, sex education, and in areas such as math and reading, within public schools.

Studies have analyzed whether single-sex or co-ed schools produce better educational outcomes. Teachers and school environments tend to be more conducive to girls&#x27; learning habits and participation rates improve in single-sex schools. In developing countries, single-sex education provides women and girls an opportunity to increase female education and future labor force participation. Girls in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in co-educational schools in math, average class scores for girls are higher, girls in single-sex math and science classes are more likely to continue to take math and science classes in higher education, and in case studies, boys and girls have reported that single-sex classes and single-sex teachers create a better environment for learning for both sexes.

Critics of single-sex schools and classes claim that single-sex schooling is inherently unequal and that its physical separation contributes to gender bias on an academic and social basis. Single-sex schooling also allegedly limits the socialization between sexes that co-educational schools provide. Coeducational school settings have been shown to foster less anxiety, have happier classrooms, and enable students to participate in a simulated social environment with the tools to maneuver, network, and succeed in the world outside of school. Even in co-ed schools, certain classes, such as sex education, are sometimes segregated on the basis of sex. Parallel education occurs in some schools, when administrators decide to segregate students only in core subjects.
Segregation by specialization is also evident in higher education and actually increases with economic development of a country. Cambodia, Laos, Morocco, and Namibia are countries with the least amount of gender segregation in tertiary studies while Croatia, Finland, Japan, and Lithuania have the most.

===Sport===
Even outside of educational settings women&#x27;s sports are sex segregated from men&#x27;s sports.

===Desegregation===

Desegregation policies often seek to prevent sex discrimination, or alleviate occupational segregation. These policies encourage women and men to participate in environments typically predominated by the opposite sex. Examples include government quotas, gender-specific scholarships, co-ed recreational leagues, or programming designed to change social norms.

In China, deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress and members of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference National Committee proposed that the public should be more attentive to widespread instances of occupational segregation in China. Often employers reject specifically women applicants or create sex requirements in order to apply. The Labour Contract Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women state that no employer can refuse to employ women based on sex or raise application standards for women specifically, but also do not currently have clear sanctions for those who do segregate based on sex.
China has also begun to encourage women in rural villages to take up positions of management in their committees. Specifically, China&#x27;s Village Committee Organization Law mandates that women should make up one third or more of the members of village committees. The Dunhuang Women&#x27;s Federation of Dunhuang City, in China&#x27;s Gansu Province, provided training for their village&#x27;s women in order to build political knowledge.

In March 2013 in the European Union, a resolution was passed to invest in training and professional development for women, promote women-run businesses, and include women on company boards. In Israel, the Minister of Religious Services, Yaakov Margi Shas, has recently supported removal of signs at cemeteries segregating women and men for eulogies and funerals, prohibiting women from taking part in the services. The Minister agreed with academic and politician, Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie, who questioned him about segregation policies enacted by rabbis and burial officials, that governmental opposition to sex segregation was necessary to combat these practices not supported by Jewish or Israeli law.

In other cases, sex segregation in one arena can be pursued to enable sex desegregation in another. For example, separation of boys and girls for early math and science education may be part of an effort to increase the representation of women in engineering or women in science.

Sometimes, countries will also argue that segregation in other nations violates human rights. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces in order to secure women&#x27;s rights in Saudi Arabia Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes to the idea of a segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of Wahhabism. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as &quot;Khilwa&quot; and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops. The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country&#x27;s first women&#x27;s only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated segregated institution. Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and abayas and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world&#x27;s first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce.

=== In prisons ===
Sex segregation is very prevalent in the administration of prisons. 

Radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon says that the policy is in place for ease of management and not for protecting women, examplified by the fact that women&#x27;s prisons put women who have been convicted of rape or murder in the same wards as women who have been convicted of prostitution, or killing their batterers.

==Significance==

===In human development ===

For most children, sex segregation manifests itself early in the socialization process via group socialization theory, where children are expected to behave in certain sex-typed manners and form sex in and out-groups. In pre-school classrooms, for example, making gender more salient to children has been shown to lead to stronger gender stereotypes and inter-group biases between sex groups. These evident tendencies were also manifested in decreased playtime with children of the opposite sex, or a kind of early, selective sex segregation based on preconceived social norms. While specifically segregating by sex for playtime has not been linked to any long-lasting effects on women&#x27;s rights compared to men, these different manners of socialization often lead to communication and power struggles between men and women and to differential life decisions by each sex based on these long-established gendered identities.

In elementary and secondary education, sex segregation sometimes yields and perpetuates gender bias in the form of treatment by teachers and peers that perpetuates traditional gender roles and sex bias, underrepresentation of girls in upper level math, science, and computer classes, fewer opportunities for girls to learn and solve problems, girls receiving less attention compared to the boys in their classes, and significantly different performance levels between boys and girls in reading and math classes. Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Sex segregation in educational settings can also lead to negative outcomes for boys such as boys in co-educational classrooms having academic scores higher than boys in single-sex classrooms. On the contrary, girls in single-sex classrooms have academic scores higher than girls in co-educational classrooms. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a comparative disadvantage for either sex. Athletic participation and physical education are examples where appeals to differences in biological sex may encourage segregation within education systems. These differences can impact access to competition, gender identity construction, and external as well as internalized perceptions of capabilities, especially among young girls.

Separation of public toilets by sex is very common around the world. In certain settings the sex separation can be critical to ensure the safety of females, in particular schoolgirls, from male abuse. At the same time, sex segregated public toilets may promote a gender binary that excludes transgender people. Unisex public toilets can be a suitable alternative and/or addition to sex-segregated toilets in many cases.

A special case presents with choirs and choruses, especially in the tradition of the choir school which uses ensemble and musical discipline to ground academic discipline. Male and female voices are distinctive both solo and in ensemble, and segregated singing has an evolved and established aesthetic. Male voices, unlike female voices, break in early adolescence, and accommodating this break in an educational program is challenging in a coed environment. Coeducation tends to stigmatize males, as is often the case in expressive arts, unlike athletics.

===In economies===

Physical sex separation is popular in many institutions on a tertiary level (between types of institutions), while fields of study or majors are not highly gendered, such as later life decisions such as work/care work conflicts. Men tend to occupy engineering, manufacturing, science, and construction fields while women dominate education, humanities and arts, social sciences, business, law, and health and welfare fields. However, important life decisions as occupations can yield other instances of sex segregation by impacting occupational sex imbalances and further male and female socialization. Vicki Schultz (1990) indicates that although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sex discrimination in employment and promised working women change, &quot;most women continue to work in low paying, low status, and traditionally female jobs.&quot; Schultz (1990) states that &quot;employers have argued that women lack interest in male-dominated jobs, which are highly rewarded and nontraditional for women.&quot; According to Schultz, the courts have accepted this argument, subsequently not holding employers liable. Schultz contends that &quot;the courts have failed to recognize the role of employers in shaping women&#x27;s work aspirations.&quot; (Schultz, 1990:1750,1756)) Schultz states that the judicial framework that has been established by the courts &quot;has created an unduly narrow definition of sex discrimination and an overly restrictive role for the law in dismantling sex segregation.&quot; (Schultz, 1990:1757) Schultz concludes by saying, &quot;courts can acknowledge their own constructive power and use it to help create a work world in which women are empowered to choose the more highly rewarded occupations that Title VII has long promised.&quot; (Schultz, 1990:1843) Even at psychological levels, socialized preferences for or against sex segregation can also have significant effects. In one study, women in male-dominated work settings were the most satisfied psychologically with their jobs while women in occupational settings with only 15-30% men were less satisfied due to favored treatment of the male minority in such a segregated atmosphere. Stark segregation by occupation can lead to a sexual division of labor, influencing the access and control men and women have over inputs and outputs required for labor. Additionally, occupational sex segregation has certain health and safety hazards for each sex, since employment conditions, type of work, and contract and domestic responsibilities vary for types of employment. In many areas of work, women tend to dominate the production line jobs while men occupy managerial and technical jobs. These types of workplace factors and interactions between work and family have been cited by social stratification research as key causes for social inequality. Family roles are especially influential for predicting significant differences in earnings between married couples. Men benefit financially from family roles such as a husband and a father, while women&#x27;s incomes are lowered when becoming a wife and mother.

Other gender disparities via sex segregation between men and women include differential asset ownership, house and care work responsibilities, and agency in public and private spheres for each sex. These segregations have persisted because of governmental policy, blocked access for a sex, and/or the existence of sex-based societal gender roles and norms. Perpetuation of gender segregation, especially in economic spheres, creates market and institutional failures. For example, women often occupy jobs with flexible working environments in order to take on care work as well as job responsibilities, but since part-time, flexible hourly jobs pay less and have lower levels of benefits, large numbers of women in these lower income jobs lowers incentives to participate in the same market work as their male counterparts, perpetuating occupational gender lines in societies and within households. Schultz (1990) article indicates that &quot;working-class women have made it a priority to end job segregation for they want opportunities that enable them to support them and their families.&quot; (Schultz, 1990:1755) Additionally, economic development in countries is positively correlated with female workers in wage employment occupations and negatively correlated with female workers in unpaid or part-time work, self-employment, or entrepreneurship, job sectors often seen occupied by women in developing countries. Many critics of sex segregation see globalization processes as having the potential to promote systemic equality among the sexes.

==In fiction==
Some literary works of social science fiction and gender, sex and sexuality in speculative fiction that consider sex segregation are the books &quot;Swastika Night&quot; or &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (later converted into a TV series).

<doc id="597793" wikidata="Q7844989" url="?curid=597793" title="Troglitazone">
<text>Troglitazone is an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drug, and a member of the drug class of the thiazolidinediones. It was prescribed for people with diabetes mellitus type 2. 
It was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1997. It was subsequently withdrawn.

==Mechanism of action==
Troglitazone, like the other thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).

Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and – more strongly – PPARγ. Troglitazone also contains an α-Tocopherol moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce inflammation. Troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.

==History==

Troglitazone was developed by Daiichi Sankyo (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by Parke-Davis in the late 1990s but turned out to be associated with an idiosyncratic reaction leading to drug-induced hepatitis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potentially high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA, and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post. A panel of experts approved it in January 1997. Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the British market in December 1997, from the United States market in 2000, and from the Japanese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe.

Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin resistance. At the time, it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs. It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes.

Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for FDA review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin&#x27;s potential to harm the liver and the heart, and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug&#x27;s approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996, and his review was purged by the FDA. Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting at which Gueriguian used &quot;intemperate&quot; language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian. Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this. According to Peter Gøtzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity.

The FDA approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time, Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the FDA overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a New York Times interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild.

Glaxo Wellcome received approval from the British Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to market troglitazone, as Romozin, in July 1997. After reports of sudden liver failure in patients receiving the drug, Parke-Davis and the FDA added warnings to the drug label requiring monthly monitoring of liver enzyme levels. Glaxo Wellcome removed troglitazone from the market in Britain on December 1, 1997. Glaxo Wellcome had licensed the drug from Sankyo Company of Japan and had sold it in Britain from October 1, 1997.

On May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died of acute liver failure after taking troglitazone. Importantly, she had been monitored closely by physicians at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a participant in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) diabetes prevention study. This called into question the efficacy of the monitoring strategy. The NIH responded on June 4 by dropping troglitazone from the study. Dr. David J. Graham, an FDA epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin. Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner–Lambert&#x27;s early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.): &quot;I believe that the company... deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies.&quot;

On March 21, 2000, the FDA withdrew the drug from the market. Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an FDA medical officer, wrote in a March 3, 2000 letter to Senator John Ashcroft of strong evidence that Rezulin could not be used safely. He was later threatened by the FDA with dismissal. By that time, the drug had been linked to 63 liver-failure deaths and had generated sales of more than $2.1 billion for Warner-Lambert. The drug cost $1,400 a year per patient in 1998. Pfizer, which had acquired Warner-Lambert in February 2000, reported the withdrawal of Rezulin cost $136 million.

== Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity ==
Since the withdrawal in 2000, mechanisms of troglitazone hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied using a variety of &quot;in vivo&quot;, &quot;in vitro&quot;, and computational methods. These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of troglitazone results from a combination of metabolic and nonmetabolic factors. The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system. Initially, the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone. Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the hydroxy group (OH group) of the chromane ring. Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl groups (CH3 groups) ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring. This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel troglitazone derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines.

==Lawsuits==
In 2009, Pfizer resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings. The company also paid as much as $250 million to resolve state-court suits. In 2004, it set aside $955 million to end Rezulin cases.

<doc id="597799" wikidata="Q6220548" url="?curid=597799" title="John Banks (New Zealand politician)">
<text>John Archibald Banks (born 2 December 1946) is a New Zealand former politician. He was a member of Parliament for the National Party from 1981 to 1999, and for ACT New Zealand from 2011 to 2014. He was a Cabinet Minister from 1990 to 1996 and 2011 to 2013. He left Parliament after being convicted of filing a false electoral return – a verdict which was later overturned.

In between his tenures in Parliament, he served as Mayor of Auckland City for two terms, from 2001 to 2004 and from 2007 to 2010. When seven former smaller councils were combined into one to run the Auckland &#x27;supercity&#x27; in 2010, Banks unsuccessfully ran for mayor again. The electoral return that he filed after that campaign, detailing donations received and campaign expenses, was the subject of Banks&#x27; conviction and eventual acquittal. After new evidence came to light, it was decided in May 2015 that there would be no retrial.

==Early life==
Banks was born in Wellington in 1946. When he was a young child, his parents Archibald (Archie) and Kitty were imprisoned for procuring abortions. His father was a career criminal and his mother an alcoholic. From the age of two he was raised by an aunt and uncle, alongside &quot;many foster children&quot;. When John was 14, Archie was released from prison. They moved to Auckland and John attended Avondale College.

He grew up in poverty. In a 2014 speech to Parliament he recalled 

==Before politics==
In his career before entering politics, Banks worked as a market researcher in the pharmaceutical industry, as a commercial property developer, and as a restaurant owner. He served for a time as Chairman of the New Zealand Licensed Restaurant and Cabaret Association.

Banks began his political career in local-body politics with election to the Birkenhead Borough Council in 1977. In 1980 he was elected a member of the Auckland Regional Authority for Birkenhead.

==Member of Parliament==




In the 1978 general election, Banks stood as the National Party candidate for the Roskill electorate, but was unsuccessful. Banks ran against Labour Party incumbent Arthur Faulkner, seeing the electorate as an opportunity to enter parliament, due to Faulkner&#x27;s small majority in 1975 and the electorate&#x27;s newly redrawn boundaries. Banks campaigned full-time in the Roskill electorate, driving a Holden HQ during his campaign (instead of his Jaguar), and caused major controversies when making comments about Polynesian New Zealanders. In the 1981 election, he stood in a different seat, Whangarei, and won. He would retain this seat for the remainder of his parliamentary career with the National Party.

===Cabinet minister===
When National won the 1990 election, Banks entered Cabinet, becoming Minister of Police, Minister of Tourism, and Minister of Sport.

Banks said in 2019 after the Christchurch mosque shootings that he was &quot;haunted&quot; by not being able to persuade his cabinet colleagues to ban semi-automatic guns after the Aramoana massacre in 1990.

While Minister of Police, he was fined $750 for answering his cellular phone on a commercial flight in 1991.

===Stance on homosexual law reform===
On the final reading of New Zealand&#x27;s 1986 Homosexual Law Reform, John Banks said that &quot;This day will be remembered as a sad and sickening day for New Zealand. A very black cloud tonight and those members who[...]vote for legalised sodomy at the age of 16 should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves,&quot; and voted against the Bill.

When debating New Zealand&#x27;s 1993 Human Rights Act, which would prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians based on sexuality, Banks said that &quot;The problem with this homosexual business we&#x27;ve now made legal in his country...and parliament is soon going to legislate... to allow sexual deviants or people with sexual alternatives to work... with immunity.&quot;

===Radio Pacific talkback host===
Banks gained a position as the host of a talkback radio programme on Radio Pacific in August 1992, taking over the Sunday afternoon timeslot from former Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon, for whom he had occasionally substituted during 1991 and 1992. In 1995, his fellow National Party Member of Parliament John Carter rang his programme impersonating a workshy Māori called Hone, which caused widespread offence.
He left the station in 2007 when it reformatted to a sports talkback format.

===Leaving Cabinet and Parliament===
In 1996, he resigned from Cabinet, becoming a backbencher, after he refused to be in the same cabinet as New Zealand First leader and coalition partner Winston Peters.

Banks retired from Parliament at the 1999 election, returning in 2011.

==Mayor of Auckland City==

===First term 2001–2004===
In 2001, he contested and won the Auckland City mayoralty, defeating the incumbent Christine Fletcher (herself also a former National MP). Banks remained controversial in his new role, although often regarding financial and management issues rather than social policy. He governed with the support of the traditional incumbent ticket at Auckland City, Citizens and Ratepayers Now. Banks brought in a streamlined decision making process at council, kept spending increases within inflation, sold half of the Auckland International Airport shares to pay off Auckland City&#x27;s increasing debt, and proposed massive transport projects such as the Eastern Transport Corridor. Banks&#x27; personal style, coupled with his mayoral agenda, polarised many Aucklanders. In 2001 he was caught speeding on a jet ski close to the beach, not long after criticising boy racers.

He also said Asian immigrants had filthy habits such as spitting on footpaths.

====2004 mayoralty campaign====
A serious and ultimately successful challenge to Banks&#x27; mayoralty came from cereal-maker Dick Hubbard in late August 2004. Six weeks before the election, Hubbard was the more popular candidate in opinion polls.

The mayoral campaign gained notoriety as one of the &quot;nastiest&quot; and hardest-fought in memory. In September 2004, Banks&#x27;s campaign manager, Brian Nicolle, resigned amidst allegations of &quot;gutter politics&quot; after he ordered distribution of copies of a &quot;National Business Review&quot; article highly critical of Hubbard to hundreds of letterboxes in Auckland. Nicolle at first denied ordering the article distribution, but eventually admitted it. That he&#x27;d acted without the authorisation of Banks as the candidate made the story even more controversial during the campaign.

On 9 October 2004, Hubbard was elected as Mayor of Auckland. In early interviews after his election loss, Banks stated that he would look after his varied business interests, both in New Zealand and Australia.

===Post-2004 election===
For a time, rumours suggested that he might return to national politics, standing as a candidate either for the National Party or ACT New Zealand. Several meetings took place between Banks and senior ACT members. In the end, however, Banks declined to become an ACT candidate.

In February 2005, Banks returned to talkback radio reprising his &quot;Breakfast with Banksie&quot; early morning radio show on Radio Pacific.

While on the talkback show, a caller said that &quot;six inches of barbed wire shoved up gay mens arses&quot; which John Banks retorted, would be a waste of &quot;good barbed wire.&quot; In 2006, Banks said on his talk back radio show that he had &quot;...never seen so many dead beat losers in one photograph in all my life, that is outside a Labour Party conference, as these Māori Warriors for Safe Sex.&quot; This was in relation to a safe sex advertisement that was targeted at Māori men who have same-sex relations.

===Re-election in 2007===
In October 2006, Banks announced he was giving serious consideration to standing for the Auckland mayoralty again. He indicated that if he did become mayor again, he would practise a more inclusive style of leadership with a firmer focus on financial matters. He also indicated qualified support for the proposed 2007 &quot;Hero Parade&quot;, which was an annual gay parade held in the 1990s prior to his becoming mayor. Banks ditched the controversial Eastern Corridor proposal that caused a split in his voting base.

In July 2007 Banks announced his intention to stand for mayor in the October 2007 local body election, running on a platform of &quot;affordable progress&quot; and transparency in council meetings. Polls soon showed him in a clear lead. In 2010, Banks campaigned for and negotiated with the government to help owners of &#x27;leaky homes&#x27; meet the costs of repairs.

On 13 October 2007, Banks was re-elected as Mayor of Auckland, becoming only the second mayor in Auckland City&#x27;s history to have come back to the mayoralty after defeat, after Dove-Myer Robinson in 1968.

===Second term 2007–2010===
Upon his successful re-election, Banks indicated a number of initial changes and spending cuts in order to meet his goal of keeping future rates increases at affordable levels. Banks and the Citizens and Ratepayers council majority re-introduced a streamlined council structure, bringing in five super-committees instead of the previous 14 committees.

Banks has also campaigned on job creation and economic development initiatives, such as a film friendly policy for Auckland, to attract television, movie and commercial filming. The benefits of the film industry was reported as almost $900 million in GDP activity for Auckland region.

His personality, especially during his first mayoral term, has been called that of a bully, &quot;raised by Sir Robert Muldoon in the ways of the bear pit&quot;. However, it has been commented that his leadership style became much less brusque and confrontative in his second term, something he himself ascribes to the &quot;long, cold shower&quot; he received in being defeated by political newcomer Dick Hubbard in the 2004 elections.

===Auckland Council===
Banks supported the creation of a unitary authority or a &quot;supercity&quot;. After the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance recommended and the Government confirmed it would introduce a single council for the Auckland region, Banks stood in the 2010 Auckland mayoral election for the new Auckland Council. Banks has been critical of some of the aspects of the new supercity, favouring increased powers to the local boards that would represent people at the grassroots level.

Banks was unsuccessful, with Len Brown elected the first &quot;supercity&quot; mayor. Brown&#x27;s margin over Banks was more than 65,000 votes. Banks declared as &quot;anonymous&quot; donations to his campaign that had been made by Kim Dotcom. He is accused of knowing that Dotcom had made them, leading to ongoing court action – see false electoral return accusation.

==Return to Parliament==
On 18 May 2011, Mr Banks moved back to national politics by joining the ACT New Zealand Party. He stood in the Epsom electorate in that year&#x27;s general election, becoming the sole MP for the party, and subsequently its leader. In parliament, he supported the National Government and was appointed as a Minister. Before the end of the parliamentary term, he was found guilty of filing a false electoral return in 2010. In 2013 John Banks voted in favour of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, which allowed same sex couples to marry within New Zealand. He resigned as an MP on 13 June 2014.

===Teapot tapes===
Two weeks before the 2011 election, Banks and Prime Minister John Key had a very public cup of tea together in a cafe in Newmarket. This was seen as an endorsement of Banks by Key as the pseudo-National candidate for Epsom. Numerous members of the media covered the meeting but were eventually asked to leave so Banks and Key could talk in private. Journalist Bradley Ambrose left a recording device on the table, and subsequently gave the recording of the politicians&#x27; conversation to the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; newspaper. The recording allegedly contained comments about the leadership of ACT and disparaging remarks about elderly New Zealand First supporters. There was intense media interest in what was on the recording but the Herald refused to publish the recording – which became known as the Teapot Tape.

===Election results===
The ACT Party attracted only 1.07% of the party vote in the election. However, Banks won the Epsom electorate and become the party&#x27;s sole MP. Party leader Don Brash resigned shortly thereafter and in February 2012, Banks was unanimously voted ACT party leader by the ACT board.

===Minister in Fifth National Government===
Banks served as Minister of Regulatory Reform, Minister for Small Business, Associate Minister of Commerce and Associate Minister of Education in the Fifth National Government until resigning the ministerial portfolios on 16 October 2013.

===Resignations===
When Banks was committed to trial in October 2013 over his false 2010 electoral return (for the Auckland mayoralty), he resigned his Ministerial positions. He remained as an MP and leader of the Act Party. In December 2013, he announced his intention to step down as Act leader (his replacement, Jamie Whyte, was elected by the party in February 2014). After being found guilty in June 2014, he resigned from Parliament.

==False electoral return accusation==
Banks was accused of filing a false electoral return after the 2010 Auckland mayoralty campaign. A High Court trial in 2014 found him guilty, but new evidence saw the Court of Appeal overturn his conviction later that year. A retrial was initially ordered by the Solicitor-General, but after new evidence came to light the Court of Appeal ruled against a retrial.

===High Court verdict (2014, since overturned)===
The High Court found that Banks knew that two donations of $25,000, both declared as anonymous, were from Kim Dotcom. Dotcom had offered a single $50,000 donation, but Banks requested two cheques of $25,000 – this being the maximum amount allowed as an anonymous donation at the time under the Local Electoral Act 2001. Banks resigned from Parliament on 13 June, ahead of sentencing on 1 August 2014.

===Sequence of events===
This sequence of events is drawn from the judgement in Banks&#x27; 2014 trial.

====Dotcom meetings and donation====
Kim Dotcom and John Banks first met in April 2010, when Dotcom flew Banks to his mansion in a helicopter. They &quot;discussed ... Mr Dotcom’s goals. He hoped to undertake venture capital investment in this country. There was also a short discussion about Mr Dotcom’s residence application and Mr Banks offered to assist in this regard&quot;. Banks, with his wife Amanda, visited the mansion again on 5 June. Over lunch, they discussed fundraising for his campaign. Dotcom offered $50,000 towards the campaign.

Kim, his wife Mona Dotcom, and their head of security Wayne Tempero all gave evidence that Banks asked for the donation to be split and remain anonymous. All three told the court that Banks explained this would make it easier for him to &quot;help&quot; Dotcom in the future. Justice Wylie found each of them to be &quot;reliable and credible&quot; witnesses.

Amanda Banks initially denied any discussion of the campaign or donations at the same lunch, but this changed under cross-examination. John Banks&#x27; evidence was different again, suggesting that they discussed donations of amounts up to $200,000, or even funding for the entire campaign, but not in great detail. Banks claimed to have suggested a single $25,000 donation, which could remain anonymous.

Later, Banks thanked Dotcom for his support over the phone. He never discussed Dotcom&#x27;s donation with his campaign team.

====Mayoral results and filing of election return====
Results were declared on 14 October, confirming Banks&#x27; loss to Len Brown. After the campaign Lance Hutchison, JP, a volunteer member of Banks&#x27; campaign team, completed the electoral return. Hutchison decided which donations to record as anonymous, including all five of the $25,000 donations the campaign received. Unlike Banks, Hutchison had no way of knowing about Dotcom&#x27;s donations. Banks signed the return on 9 December without reading the listed donations.

====2011 Parliamentary election====
Having failed in his bid to become Mayor of Auckland, Banks returned to national politics, re-entering Parliament as the Member for Epsom in the November 2011 general election. He was ACT&#x27;s only MP. Dotcom had refused to support the ACT Party&#x27;s campaign.

====Dotcom arrest====
In January 2012, police raided Kim Dotcom&#x27;s mansion, seized a range of assets, and arrested him on suspicion of copyright violation. He was held in Mt Eden Prison, in John Banks&#x27; Epsom electorate. The bedding aggravated his bad back and he wanted his own mattress from his mansion. He had his solicitor, Gregory Towers, contact Mr Banks for help.

Towers and Banks spoke on the phone for half an hour. Notes that Towers made at the time showed that Banks was unwilling to publicly support Dotcom in case &quot;it b/comes known about election support etc&quot;. This note became an important piece of evidence, being accepted by Justice Wylie to refer to the $50,000 given by Dotcom, and to show that Banks knew it was not public knowledge.

====2012 investigation====
In April 2012, allegations surfaced about donations to Banks&#x27; 2010 mayoral campaign. Labour MP Trevor Mallard laid a complaint about a $15,000 donation from SkyCity, listed as anonymous by Banks. Days later, Dotcom himself told &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; and TV3&#x27;s &quot;Campbell Live&quot; programme about his own donations, saying that the $50,000 was split at Banks&#x27; request, that the cheques were written out in the presence of Banks, and that Banks called him a few days later to thank him. Two complaints, including another from Mallard, were made to the police about the Dotcom donations. (Like Mallard, the second complainant had also raised the SkyCity donations.)

The Police subsequently investigated, interviewing a number of people including Banks and Dotcom. In July 2012, Assistant Commissioner Malcolm Burgess announced that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Banks and that the complaint was laid outside the statutory six month time limit.

====Private prosecution====
After the Police declined to charge Banks in relation to the donations, retired accountant Graham McCready brought a private prosecution against him instead. This went to court in December 2012. In April 2013 the judge found in favour of McCready, ruling that there was &quot;sufficient evidence&quot; for the case to go to trial. Banks subsequently resigned as a Minister of the Crown, but not as an MP. About a week after the ruling, the Solicitor General took over the prosecution from McCready. Banks then sought and lost a judicial review of the judge&#x27;s decision.

The trial began on 19 May 2014, with the guilty verdict delivered on 5 June.

====Conviction, sentence, appeal and exoneration====
Justice Edwin Wylie convicted Banks on 1 August 2014. He was sentenced to two months&#x27; community detention and 100 hours of community work. The community detention essentially works as a curfew from 7pm to 7am on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights during which he must remain in his residence.

Within a week, Banks filed an appeal, claiming that new &quot;watertight&quot; evidence would exonerate him. His sentence was placed on hold and the Court of Appeal heard his appeal on 29 October. Signed affidavits from two new witnesses, American businessmen David Schaeffer and Jeffery Karnes, stated that they were at the lunch on 5 June 2010, and that there was no discussion about splitting the $50,000 donation into two parts. Kim and Mona Dotcom had both denied that the men were at the lunch in question. The Court of Appeal reserved its decision until late November, when it overturned Banks&#x27; conviction and ordered a retrial so the American businessmen&#x27;s affidavits could be considered. In May 2015, the Court of Appeal reversed its decision to order a retrial when a new document was disclosed. The document included the affidavits from the two witnesses, confirming that Kim Dotcom and his then-wife Mona had fabricated their version of the events when giving evidence.

===Local Electoral Amendment Bill===
An amendment to local electoral laws nicknamed the &#x27;John Banks bill&#x27; passed its first reading in November 2012. It tightens restrictions on campaign donations, and was directly inspired by the &#x27;anonymous&#x27; donations to Banks&#x27; 2010 mayoralty campaign. The Local Electoral Amendment Bill passed its third reading and became law in June 2013. Local Government Minister Chris Tremain said &quot;The Bill limits anonymous donations that a candidate can keep to $1500, clarifies and tightens the definition of &#x27;anonymous donation&#x27;, increases disclosure obligations and requires electoral officers to publish candidate returns of their donations and expenses.&quot; The bill also increased penalties for non-compliance.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Banks was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services in the 2000 New Year Honours, and a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local-body affairs, in the 2011 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
In 2014, Banks had an apartment in central Auckland, having previously lived in Remuera.

He married Amanda Medcalf in December 1987. They adopted three children from a Saint Petersburg orphanage in 1995, a girl and two boys. They separated over the stress created by Mr Banks&#x27; 2014 trial and Amanda moved to central Otago.

He holds a private pilot&#x27;s licence, for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. He is also an avid motorcar and motorcycle enthusiast, owning a Harley Davidson motorbike.

Banks has stated that he believes the first chapters of the Book of Genesis, describing the creation of the world in six days, are literally true.

In late January 2021, Banks was sacked as a talkback host from the MagicTalk radio network, after agreeing with a racist caller that Māori were a &quot;stone age&quot; people 

===Paternity case===

In 2016 Antony Shaw, an English language teacher living in Japan, launched legal proceedings against Banks as a paternity claim.

In the High Court proceedings, Shaw said his mother Pamela Mayes told him he was conceived during a relationship she had with Banks in 1969, and that when she told Banks she was pregnant that he had ended the relationship. In a sworn affidavit, Mayes alleged that Banks procured drugs that would make her miscarry, and pressured her into taking the necessary dosage, which she refused to do.

In 1999 Mayes told Shaw his real father was John Banks. First Mayes and later Shaw contacted Banks to request confirmation of paternity but this was denied. Banks also denied the request for a DNA test.

After hearing evidence in the High Court case, Judge Courtney declared that Banks is the birth father of Antony Brett Shaw.

<text>Lanark County is a county and census division located in the Canadian province of Ontario. Its county seat is Perth, which was first settled in 1816 and was known as a social and political capital before being overshadowed by a city known today as Ottawa.

Most European settlements of the county began in 1816, when Drummond, Beckwith and Bathurst townships were named and initially surveyed. The first farm north of the Rideau was cleared and settled somewhat earlier, in 1790. The county took its name from the town of Lanark in Scotland. Nearly all the townships were named after British public and military figures from the era of early settlement.

==History==

===Bathurst District===
In 1824, Lanark County was severed from Carleton County in Bathurst District, and it consisted of the following townships and lands:

When Carleton was withdrawn from the District in 1838, Renfrew County was severed from part of Lanark, but the two remained united for electoral purposes. By 1845, all lands in the District had been surveyed into the following townships:


In 1851, the township of Pakenham was transferred from Renfrew to Lanark.

===United Counties of Lanark and Renfrew===
Effective January 1, 1850, Bathurst District was abolished, and the &quot;United Counties of Lanark and Renfrew&quot; replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. The counties remained united for electoral purposes in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, referred to as the County of Lanark, until Renfrew gained its own seat in 1853.

The separation of Renfrew from Lanark began in 1861, with the creation of a Provisional Municipal Council that held its first meeting in June 1861. The United Counties were dissolved in August 1866.

===Current constituent municipalities===
Smiths Falls is a separated town and is for municipal purposes not part of the county. It is mostly located in Lanark, while its southern part was annexed from the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville.

==Geography==

The county is located in the sub-region of Southern Ontario named Eastern Ontario. Geologically, the northern part of the county is in the Canadian Shield and the southern part is in the Great Lakes Basin. The county has two large rivers, the Mississippi and Rideau, each of which empty into the Ottawa River. The landscape is varied including Canadian Shield (with gneiss, granite and marble) as well as limestone plains, with a variety of tills, sands and clays left from the melting of glaciers in the last ice age.

At the time of settlement, most of the county was covered in temperate deciduous forest; the dominant forest trees included maple, hemlock, oak and beech. Some of the higher ridges in the west of the county were likely once natural fire barrens, with a distinctive fauna and flora. The clearance of forests began with early settlement, at which time one of the important exports from the area was potash, made from the ashes of the trees burned in clearing.

The natural diversity of the landscape supports over 1,200 species of plants in the county flora. Seventeen areas have been documented as outstanding examples of plant diversity; these include Blueberry Mountain, Burnt Lands Alvar, Clay Bank Alvar, Christie Lake, Murphy&#x27;s Point Provincial Park and Almonte Town Park. The county also has 47 provincially significant wetlands. Some of the largest are Blueberry Marsh (north of Perth), the Innisville Wetlands (upstream of Mississippi Lake) and the Goodwood Marsh south of Carleton Place. In addition to David White&#x27;s list of 17 areas of plant diversity, Paul Keddy lists 17 special places in the county. Both lists have the Burnt Lands Alvar, the Christie Lake Barrens and Murphy&#x27;s Point Provincial Park. Keddy&#x27;s list adds areas such as Playfairville Rapids, Lavant/Darling Spillway and the Carleton Place Hackberry stand. Also of interest is an old shoreline which crosses the county diagonally, approximately from Almonte in the northeast to Perth in the southwest. This shoreline was formed about 12,000 years ago near the end of the last ice age when much of the Ottawa Valley was inundated by the Champlain Sea. Many areas below this old shoreline are flat clay plains, with occasional outcrops of gneiss or limestone ridges.

Some of the distinctive southern animals in the county include five-lined skinks (Ontario&#x27;s only species of lizard), black ratsnakes and southern flying squirrels. Unusual southern plants include arrow arum, a nationally rare wetland plant found near Mississippi Lake. The south-facing cliffs over Big Rideau Lake, including Foley Mountain, have a slightly warmer climate, and therefore support an unusual southern flora including shagbark hickory, tall cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla arguta&quot;) and a rare fern, blunt-lobed woodsia. Cliff Bennett provides a list of 26 routes for canoe and kayak exploration of the county.

==Demographics==
From the census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lanark County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
The county is one of the top centres of maple syrup production in Ontario and describes itself as &quot;The Maple Syrup Capital of Ontario&quot;.

==Recreation==

There are two provincial parks in Lanark County: Murphy&#x27;s Point Provincial Park on Big Rideau Lake and Silver Lake Provincial Park along Highway 7 near the west end of the county. The Rideau Trail and Trans-Canada Trail both go through Lanark County. There are also several conservation areas run by the Mississippi Valley Conservation Authority, the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, and the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust. The K&amp;P rail trail goes through the northwest corner of the county.

<doc id="597814" wikidata="Q275657" url="?curid=597814" title="Myxosporea">
<text>Myxosporea is a class of microscopic animals, all of whom are parasites. They belong to the Myxozoa clade within Cnidaria. They have a complex life cycle that comprises vegetative forms in two hosts—one an aquatic invertebrate (generally an annelid but sometimes a bryozoan) and the other an ectothermic vertebrate, usually a fish. Each parasitized host releases a different type of spore. The two forms of spore are so different in appearance that until relatively recently they were treated as belonging to different classes within the Myxozoa.

== Taxonomic status ==
The taxonomy of both actinosporeans and myxosporeans was originally based on spore morphology. In 1994 the phylum Myxozoa was redefined to solve the taxonomic and nomenclatural problems arising from the two-host life cycle of myxozoans. The distinction between the two previously recognised classes Actinosporea and Myxosporea disappeared and the class &quot;Actinosporea&quot; was suppressed, becoming a synonym of the class &quot;Myxosporea&quot; (Bütschli, 1881). The generic names of actinosporeans were retained as collective &quot;type&quot; names, and it was proposed that they be used to characterise different morphological forms of actinosporeans. Those remaining actinosporeans whose myxosporean stage is unattested are being retained as &quot;species inquirenda&quot; until their specific identity is established.

It has been hypothesized that myxosporeans might have evolved from a transmissible tumor of &quot;Polypodium&quot;. This hypothesis is called the &quot;SCANDAL hypothesis&quot;, an acronym for &quot;speciation by cancer development animals&quot;, referencing its radical nature.

== Transmission ==
Until the 1980s, direct transmission of myxosporeans was presumed. In 1984, it was shown experimentally that spores of &quot;Myxobolus cerebralis&quot; failed to produce infections when fed to salmonids. To reproduce successfully, this species requires a tubificid worm as an intermediate host, in which the spores develop into a &quot;species&quot; of the &quot;genus&quot; &quot;Triactinomyxon&quot;. These spores develop inside the oligochaete into forms which are infectious to salmonids. 

Such a life cycle—with two different sexual stages, each resulting in two kinds of resistant spores—is unique amongst parasitic organisms, let alone those in the kingdom of animals. This mode of life has been confirmed in several other &quot;Myxobolus&quot; species. This vector has also been proved in other families. &quot;Ceratonova shasta&quot;, an economically important parasite of salmonids, has been shown to use a polychaete worm as an alternate host.

Direct transmission between fish has also been demonstrated, so far in three species of &quot;Enteromyxum&quot;.

Examples of Myxosporean genera are &quot;Kudoa&quot;, which attacks fish muscle, and &quot;Myxobolus,&quot; which attacks the hearts of freshwater fish.

<text>Ashtapadis or Ashtapadi refers to the Sanskrit hymns of the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;, composed by Jayadeva in the 12th century. The &quot;ashtapadis&quot;, which describe the beauty of Lord Krishna and the love between Krishna and the &quot;gopis&quot;, are considered a masterpiece in esoteric spirituality and the theme of &#x27;Divine romance&#x27;. The literal meaning of &quot;ashtapathi&quot;, &#x27;eight-steps&#x27;, refers to the fact that each hymn is made of eight couplets (eight sets of two lines). It is also the source of the word &quot;ashtāpada&quot;, an Indian board game, the forerunner of chess. Although the original tunes of the &quot;ashtapadis&quot; were lost in history, they remain popular and are widely sung in a variety of tunes, and used in classical dance performances, across India. Ashtapadis are regularly performed at Kerala temples in the accompaniment of an &quot;idakka;&quot; a genre of music called &quot;sopana sangeetham.&quot;

The lyrical poetry of the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; is divided into twelve chapters, each of which is sub-divided into twenty four divisions called &quot;Prabandha&quot;. The &quot;Prabandhas&quot; contain couplets grouped into eights, called &quot;ashtapadis&quot;.

<text>Melvin Emery Patton (November 16, 1924 – May 9, 2014) was an American sprinter, who set the world record of 9.2 seconds in the 100 yard dash in 1948. He also set a 220 yd world record in 1949 on a straightaway of 20.2, breaking the record held by Jesse Owens.

Patton won two gold medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics. He was ranked first in the world in the 100 m and 200 m events in 1947 and 1949.

==Biography==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Mel Patton or &quot;Pell Mell&quot;, as he was nicknamed in the late 1940s, made his mark in track and field while a student at the University of Southern California, where he was coached by Dean Cromwell. During his collegiate years, Patton was a member of the Delta-Eta chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He also attended University High School in Los Angeles.

Patton won the NCAA 100-yard dash in 1947 and in 1948 and 1949 completed the 100 and 220 yd sprint double at that same meet. In 1947 he tied the 100 yd dash world record of 9.4, which he lowered it 9.3 the following year. In 1949 he set a 220 yd world record on a straightaway of 20.2, breaking the record held by Jesse Owens.

In the Olympic Trials, he suffered a rare loss to Barney Ewell in the 100 m final, then in the Olympic Games placed only fifth in the 100 m. He atoned for that disappointment by taking two gold medals in the 200 m and the 4 × 100 m relay.

After retiring from competition, Patton participated in several professional races in Australia. Then he worked as a teacher and athletics coach at Long Beach City College and Wichita State University before becoming an executive in the aerospace and electronics industries. Previously he served in the U.S. Navy as a seaman and aviator during World War II. In the 1970s Patton helped develop the national sports program in Saudi Arabia. He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1985, and died in Fallbrook, California on May 9, 2014. He was married to Shirley and had a daughter Susan and a son named Gary.

<doc id="597835" wikidata="Q7445369" url="?curid=597835" title="Sedona Airport">
<text>Sedona Airport is a non-towered airport located southwest of the central business district of Sedona, a city in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. The airport covers and has one runway and one helipad.

Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Sedona Airport is assigned SEZ by the FAA and SDX by the IATA (which assigned SEZ to Seychelles International Airport in Mahé, Seychelles).

The airport is located on top of a high mesa overlooking a major portion of the city; it has been termed a tabletop runway. It is not uncommon for tourists or locals driving around downtown Sedona to see an approaching airplane fly overhead and then suddenly disappear into the mountains without ever appearing to land. The airport is also located very close to the Red Rocks of Sedona.

The airport is well known as being the location of the flying lessons on the ground and in the air in Microsoft Flight Simulator, where it is also one of the handcrafted airports, giving real-life detail of the taxiways and runway.

== History ==

The airport was inaugurated in 1955. At that time it had no paved runway, and animals such as coyotes could be seen walking around the air-strip. This proved dangerous to pilots arriving at Sedona. By 1957, a small, paved runway had been built.

By 1990, the airport&#x27;s runway had been improved and it had begun to receive service from a local scheduled airline. Air Sedona, founded by Jack Seeley in 1981, served Sedona from such places as Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Las Vegas, the nearby Grand Canyon airport and others until 1995. Sedona&#x27;s airport is not able to accommodate commercial jets of a size of a Boeing 737 or larger. It does, however, attract a large number of smaller business jets and aircraft such as Cessna and Beech airplanes and helicopters.

At one point, the airport was served by Desert Pacific Airlines.

Scenic Airlines discontinued service at Sedona in April 1997.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On April 13, 2003, a Beechcraft Bonanza carrying three people collided with terrain after striking the fence to the southwest of runway 21. The flight instructor, student, and passenger were all fatally injured in the crash.
*Two-time Olympic distance runner Pat Porter, his 15-year-old son Connor, and a friend of his son, 14-year-old Connor Mantsch, died when their airplane, a Beechcraft Duke piloted by Porter, crashed after takeoff from the airport, on July 26, 2012.
*On April 25, 2021, a Cessna 182 Skylane crashed, resulting in two people injured.

<doc id="597837" wikidata="Q2993331" url="?curid=597837" title="Sato–Tate conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Sato–Tate conjecture is a statistical statement about the family of elliptic curves &quot;Ep&quot; obtained from an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; over the rational numbers by reduction modulo almost all prime numbers &quot;p&quot;. Mikio Sato and John Tate independently posed the conjecture around 1960.

If &quot;Np&quot; denotes the number of points on the elliptic curve &quot;Ep&quot; defined over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements, the conjecture gives an answer to the distribution of the second-order term for &quot;Np&quot;. By Hasse&#x27;s theorem on elliptic curves,

:formula_1

as formula_2, and the point of the conjecture is to predict how the O-term varies.

The original conjecture and its generalization to all totally real fields was proved by Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, and Richard Taylor under mild assumptions in 2008, and completed by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor in 2011. Several generalizations to other algebraic varieties and fields are open.

==Statement==
Let &quot;E&quot; be an elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers without complex multiplication. For a prime number &quot;p&quot;, define &quot;θ&quot;&quot;p&quot; as the solution to the equation

:formula_3

Then, for every two real numbers formula_4 and formula_5 for which formula_6

:formula_7

==Details==
By Hasse&#x27;s theorem on elliptic curves, the ratio

:formula_8

is between -1 and 1. Thus it can be expressed as cos &quot;θ&quot; for an angle &quot;θ&quot;; in geometric terms there are two eigenvalues accounting for the remainder and with the denominator as given they are complex conjugate and of absolute value 1. The &quot;Sato–Tate conjecture&quot;, when &quot;E&quot; doesn&#x27;t have complex multiplication, states that the probability measure of &quot;θ&quot; is proportional to

:formula_9

This is due to Mikio Sato and John Tate (independently, and around 1960, published somewhat later).

==Proof==
In 2008, Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor published a proof of the Sato–Tate conjecture for elliptic curves over totally real fields satisfying a certain condition: of having multiplicative reduction at some prime, in a series of three joint papers.

Further results are conditional on improved forms of the Arthur–Selberg trace formula. Harris has a conditional proof of a result for the product of two elliptic curves (not isogenous) following from such a hypothetical trace formula. In 2011, Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor proved a generalized version of the Sato–Tate conjecture for an arbitrary non-CM holomorphic modular form of weight greater than or equal to two, by improving the potential modularity results of previous papers. The prior issues involved with the trace formula were solved by Michael Harris, and Sug Woo Shin.

In 2015, Richard Taylor was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics &quot;for numerous breakthrough results in (...) the Sato–Tate conjecture.&quot;

==Generalisations==
There are generalisations, involving the distribution of Frobenius elements in Galois groups involved in the Galois representations on étale cohomology. In particular there is a conjectural theory for curves of genus &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.

Under the random matrix model developed by Nick Katz and Peter Sarnak, there is a conjectural correspondence between (unitarized) characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements and conjugacy classes in the compact Lie group USp(2&quot;n&quot;) = Sp(&quot;n&quot;). The Haar measure on USp(2&quot;n&quot;) then gives the conjectured distribution, and the classical case is USp(2) = SU(2).

==Refinements==
There are also more refined statements. The Lang–Trotter conjecture (1976) of Serge Lang and Hale Trotter states the asymptotic number of primes &quot;p&quot; with a given value of &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;, the trace of Frobenius that appears in the formula. For the typical case (no complex multiplication, trace ≠ 0) their formula states that the number of &quot;p&quot; up to &quot;X&quot; is asymptotically

:formula_10

with a specified constant &quot;c&quot;. Neal Koblitz (1988) provided detailed conjectures for the case of a prime number &quot;q&quot; of points on &quot;E&quot;&quot;p&quot;, motivated by elliptic curve cryptography.
In 1999, Chantal David and Francesco Pappalardi proved an averaged version of the Lang–Trotter conjecture.

<doc id="597842" wikidata="Q6042934" url="?curid=597842" title="Integrated Programme">
<text>The Integrated Programme (IP) is a scheme that allows high-performing students in secondary schools in Singapore to skip the GCE Ordinary Level (O-Level) examination (typically taken by students at the end of their fourth or fifth year in secondary school) and proceed to sit for the GCE Advanced Level (A-Level) examination, International Baccalaureate (IB), or an equivalent examination, after six years of secondary education. The A-level examination is typically taken by students at the end of their second or third year in junior college.

==Overview==
The programme allows for more time to be allocated to enrichment activities. Without the O-level examinations, students have greater flexibility and can immerse themselves in a more broad-based education, ultimately leading to the A-level examination. Generally, only the top performers are eligible to participate in the IP programme, which is currently regarded as experimental. As a result, the majority of students pursue their secondary education at the regular pace by completing a four-year O-level course before proceeding to a two-year A-level education.

== A-level programmes ==
The integrated programme was first implemented in Dunman High School, Hwa Chong Institution (formerly The Chinese High School), Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School, Raffles Girls School, Raffles Institution, and River Valley High School in 2004.

The IP allows students to skip the O-level at secondary four and be admitted directly to junior colleges (while there are cases of students being asked by the school to &quot;leave&quot; this system as their pace could not be kept up). However, the students would still have to take the Mother Tongue O-level. All the schools allowed in the scheme accepts the top 10% of the national cohort. This ensures that students who are under the IP can cope with their A-level after bypassing their O-level.

Some junior colleges including National Junior College, Temasek Junior College, and Victoria Junior College, offer it independently. VJC is now offering it with Cedar Girls Secondary and Victoria School (more info below)

For the four-year IP, secondary two students from various schools are allowed to apply for this programme. These students have their secondary three and four education in the junior college itself, followed by the A-level course.

Dunman High School (DHS) applied for the IP system in mid-2004 standalone, and the Ministry of Education approved the first batch to be enrolled in 2005, with Year 1 and Year 3 students, each having a cap of about 135 out of 380 students. Full IP was granted in late 2005, and the school went full IP at the beginning of 2006.

River Valley High School joined the IP system in 2006 by operating a six-year course standalone.

Since 2009, National Junior College has also accepted students who have taken the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), making it a six-year program.

Since 2012, Victoria School and Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School are offering the IP with Victoria Junior College which will build upon the four-year Victoria Integrated Programme (VIP) in the junior college. It is called the VCA IP (Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme).

In January 2013, the Joint Integrated Programme, commonly referred to as the JIP, offered by Catholic High School, CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls&#x27; School and Singapore Chinese Girls&#x27; School, along with Eunoia Junior College, was established. The four schools are the newest additions to the Integrated Programme landscape.

The three secondary schools will continue to offer the &#x27;O&#x27; Level track alongside the IP track, thus they are termed by the MOE as dual track schools. Such schools allow students to have the flexibility to switch to the stream that is better suited to the students&#x27; needs.

== International Baccalaureate program ==
Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Methodist Girls&#x27; School, St. Joseph&#x27;s Institution, Hwa Chong International School, Singapore Sports School and School of the arts or SOTA have adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB) which is generally regarded as a better track if the students have plans to study overseas in the future. In addition, the IB allows students to take arts and science subjects, philosophy courses, and extensive research papers. Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) is regarded as one of the top schools in terms of results of the IB in the world, having averages as high as 42 out of a total of 45 points. St. Joseph&#x27;s Institution started its IP in 2013.

== NUS High School Diploma ==
The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science is the only IP school in Singapore which specialises in mathematics and science and leads to the NUS High School Diploma. It aims to develop all-rounded students through its 6-year diploma curriculum, which allows rigour and depth, or flexibility and breadth. NUS High School is also affiliated and very closely linked to the National University of Singapore (NUS). Students in this school graduate with the NUS High School diploma, which has been accredited by all universities in Singapore as well as top universities worldwide. For placement into overseas universities, they may also take the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and Advanced Placement (AP).

==List of schools offering the Integrated Programme==

==Criticism of the Integrated Programme==
The success of an IP student is based on an assumption that students are self-disciplined enough to ensure that they manage their time well and be diligent in their studies, so that they will remember all the core content taught to them and yet find enough time to engage actively in independent learning. However, this may be considered a utopian ideal. Without an important watershed intervening national examination to help them focus, students may simply let their guard down.

IP may also widen inequality among students in Singapore. Most of the places in top Junior Colleges are reserved for IP students. This includes Victoria Junior College, Raffles Institution, National Junior College and Hwa Chong Institution. As such, students taking the O Level track will face tighter competition when they wish to enter top schools in Singapore, in comparison to their IP peers.

The Integrated Programme is allegedly for clearly university-bound students. While for non-IP students who fail to perform well in the A-level, they still have their O-level qualifications, which act as a &quot;safety net&quot;. However, in the absence of this &quot;safety net&quot;, IP students who under-perform in the A-level will have only their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) certificate to fall back on.

<doc id="597844" wikidata="Q740997" url="?curid=597844" title="Levitation (physics)">
<text>Levitation (from Latin &quot;&quot;, ) is the process by which an object is held aloft in a stable position, without mechanical support via any physical contact.

Levitation is accomplished by providing an upward force that counteracts the pull of gravity (in relation to gravity on earth), plus a smaller stabilizing force that pushes the object toward a home position whenever it is a small distance away from that home position. The force can be a fundamental force such as magnetic or electrostatic, or it can be a reactive force such as optical, buoyant, aerodynamic, or hydrodynamic.
Levitation excludes floating at the surface of a liquid because the liquid provides direct mechanical support. Levitation excludes hovering flight by insects, hummingbirds, helicopters, rockets, and balloons because the object provides its own counter-gravity force.

==Physics==
Levitation (on Earth or any planetoid) requires an upward force that cancels out the weight of the object, so that the object does not fall (accelerate downward) or rise (accelerate upward). For positional stability, any small displacement of the levitating object must result in a small change in force in the opposite direction. the small changes in force can be accomplished by gradient field(s) or by active regulation. If the object is disturbed, it might oscillate around its final position, but its motion eventually decreases to zero due to damping effects. (In a turbulent flow, the object might oscillate indefinitely.)

Levitation techniques are useful tools in physics research. For example, levitation methods are useful for high-temperature melt property studies because they eliminate the problem of reaction with containers and allow deep undercooling of melts. The containerless conditions may be obtained by opposing gravity with a levitation force instead of allowing an entire experiment to freefall.

==Magnetic levitation==


Magnetic levitation is the most commonly seen and used form of levitation. This form of levitation occurs when an object is suspended using magnetic fields.

Diamagnetic materials are commonly used for demonstration purposes. In this case the returning force appears from the interaction with the screening currents. For example, a superconducting sample, which can be considered either as a perfect diamagnet or an ideally hard superconductor, easily levitates in an ambient external magnetic field. The superconductor is cooled with liquid nitrogen to levitate on top of a magnet becoming super diamagnetic. In a powerful magnetic field utilizing diamagnetic levitation, even small live animals have been levitated.

It is possible to levitate pyrolytic graphite by placing thin squares of it above four cube magnets with the north poles forming one diagonal and south poles forming the other diagonal. Researchers have even successfully levitated (non-magnetic) liquid droplets surrounded by paramagnetic fluids. The process of such inverse magnetic levitation is usually referred to as Magneto-Archimedes effect.

Magnetic levitation is in development for use for transportation systems. For example, the Maglev includes trains that are levitated by a large number of magnets. Due to the lack of friction on the guide rails, they are faster, quieter, and smoother than wheeled mass transit systems.

Electrodynamic suspension uses AC magnetic fields.

==Electrostatic levitation==

In electrostatic levitation an electric field is used to counteract gravitational force. Some spiders shoot silk into the air to ride Earth&#x27;s electric field.

==Aerodynamic levitation==

In aerodynamic levitation, the levitation is achieved by floating the object on a stream of gas, either produced by the object or acting on the object. For example, a ping pong ball can be levitated with the stream of air from a vacuum cleaner set on &quot;blow&quot; - exploiting the Coandă effect which keeps it stable in the airstream. With enough thrust, very large objects can be levitated using this method.

===Gas film levitation===
This technique enables the levitation of an object against gravitational force by floating it on a thin gas film formed by gas flow through a porous membrane. Using this technique, high temperature melts can be kept clean from contamination and be supercooled. A common example in general usage includes air hockey, where the puck is lifted by a thin layer of air. Hovercraft also use this technique, producing a large region of high-pressure air underneath them.

==Acoustic levitation==

Acoustic levitation uses sound waves to provide a levitating force.

==Optical levitation==

Optical levitation is a technique in which a material is levitated against the downward force of gravity by an upward force stemming from photon momentum transfer (radiation pressure).

==Buoyant levitation==
Gases at high pressure can have a density exceeding that of some solids. Thus they can be used to levitate solid objects through buoyancy. Noble gases are preferred for their non-reactivity. Xenon is the densest non-radioactive noble gas, at 5.894g/L. Xenon has been used to levitate polyethylene, at a pressure of 154atm.

==Casimir force==
Scientists have discovered a way of levitating ultra small objects by manipulating the Casimir force, which normally causes objects to stick together due to forces predicted by quantum field theory. This is, however, only possible for micro-objects.

==Uses==

===Maglev trains===

Magnetic levitation is used to suspend trains without touching the track. This permits very high speeds, and greatly reduces the maintenance requirements for tracks and vehicles, as little wear occurs. This also means there is no friction, so the only force acting against it is air resistance.

===Animal levitation===

Scientists have levitated frogs, grasshoppers, and mice by means of powerful electromagnets utilizing superconductors, producing diamagnetic repulsion of body water. The mice acted confused at first, but adapted to the levitation after approximately four hours, suffering no immediate ill effects.

<text>Traffic psychology is a discipline of psychology that studies the relationship between psychological processes and the behavior of road users. In general, traffic psychology aims to apply theoretical aspects of psychology in order to improve traffic mobility by helping to develop and apply crash countermeasures, as well as by guiding desired behaviors through education and the motivation of road users. 
Behavior is frequently studied in conjunction with crash research in order to assess causes and differences in crash involvement. Traffic psychologists distinguish three motivations of driver behavior: reasoned or planned behavior, impulsive or emotional behavior, and habitual behavior. Additionally, social and cognitive applications of psychology are used, such as enforcement, road safety education campaigns, and also therapeutic and rehabilitation programs.

Broad theories of cognition, sensory-motor and neurological aspects psychology are also applied to the field of traffic psychology. Studies of factors such as attention, memory, spatial cognition, inexperience, stress, inebriation, distracting/ambiguous stimuli, fatigue, and secondary tasks such as phone conversations are used to understand and investigate the experience and actions of road users.

==Definition(s)==
Traffic psychology focuses on the cognitive, non cognitive, and sensory-motor aspects of individuals within the driving and traffic environment. By examining the emotions that influence cognitive processes, traffic psychology helps us understand the resulting actions and offers strategies to modify behavior.

As a tool, traffic psychology employs subjective analysis to improve overall quality of life by observing, identifying, and modifying behavior. Its primary objective is to understand, predict, and implement measures to change road use behavior, ultimately aiming to reduce the negative impacts of traffic participation.

==Behavior research==
Behavior research in traffic psychology often deals with subjects like motivation, personality and gender differences, habits, overconfidence, age and skill differences, attention, and violation of traffic rules.
A classification of behavioral factors into those that reduce driving capability and those that promote risky behavior with further division into those with short- and long-term impact helps the conceptualization of the problems and may contribute to the prioritization of behavior modification.

Traffic and transport sciences concern themselves with the study, comprehension, explanation and prediction of everything related to the mobility of people and products. It incorporates several aspects of the transportation systems along with multiple techniques. This process attempts to develop valid and reliable methods to better understand and predict the effects of human variability with its environmental interactions on safety.

The transportation system consists of road, rail, sea and air infrastructures. It includes the possibilities and limitations of its economics, laws and regulations, which sets barriers to the capabilities of an individual and mass motorist. For instance, speed can be influenced by method of travel (vehicle, airplane, train or ship), by financial capabilities for the type of vehicle (jet versus commercial, speed boat against sail boat and sedan compared to a luxury sports car), or by regulations such as speed limits in rural areas versus city driving.

The traffic environment takes into account location, time constraints, population and dangers that are exposed to motorists. These environmental factors pose danger and risk to motorists that may be fatal. Driving in wet, narrow, and dark conditions exposes drivers to far greater risk than driving on a sunny day on an open road. This is just one type of road factor for crashes that Sullman goes on to explain in further detail:
::…crashes include lack of visibility or obstructions, unclean road or loose material, poor road conditions or road markings, and the horizontal curvature of the road. Environmental influences such as cold or hot weather, noise and vibration are all more likely to impact on stress and fatigue states 
Variability of the driver&#x27;s age, personality, temperament, stress and expertise affect speed, control and decisions. Drivers generally use some degree of risk compensation to assess driving decisions and it is skewed by varying levels of intoxication. Alcohol and drug usage, alertness and fatigue, distraction and focus are a few of the main factors attributed to driver error and crashes.

==Crash research==
In addition to behavior research, crash research is also a component in traffic psychology, looking at driving methodology, individual differences, characteristics of personality, temporary impairments, and relevant capabilities, the driver as an information processor (includes perception and reaction times), human factors on highway crashes, and the pedestrian (identifying vulnerability, causes and prevention of crashes).

===Human factors===
Examination of the operator plays a large role in transportation psychology. While many external factors influence traffic safety, internal factors are also significant. Some factors include:
* Decision-making
* Demographics
* Distraction 
* Detection Thresholds
* Drugs and alcohol 
* Driving training and experience 
* Familiarity with vehicle and environment 
* Fatigue 
*Individual differences in driving 
* Inattention
* Perception-reaction time
* Response to the unexpected 
* Risky behaviors 
* Stress and panic
*Task capability

== Psychological research ==

=== Neuropsychology===
Linking brain regions, networks, and circuits with behaviors involved in operating a vehicle is one of the more salient topics of research within traffic psychology. Seven separate brain networks have been identified in driving simulations as being of importance to the neurophysiological processes involved in driving. The networks each have a unique function as outlined by Porter: The parietoccipital sulcus is involved in visual monitoring, motor cortex and cerebellar areas—for gross motor control and motor planning; orbitofrontal and cingulate — for error monitoring and inhibition, including motivation, risk assessment, and internal space; and medial frontal, parietal, and posterior cingulate for vigilance, including spatial attention, visual stream, monitoring, and external space. By linking neuropsychological processes and driving, the ability to understand errors, development, and safety is enhanced. The involvement of motor and cerebellar networks in driving was confirmed by Calhoun, Pekar, and Pearlson (2004). Research in alcohol dosage and its related effect on neuropsychological processes found that greater quantities of alcohol created a larger likelihood to engage in high speed driving and an increase in the number of times the speed limit was exceeded.

==Psychological assessment, counseling, and rehabilitation==
Rehabilitation counseling is a process because of the many steps involved for an individual to become self-reliant. A driver rehabilitation specialist (DRS) is one who “plans, develops, coordinates and implements driving service for individuals with disabilities” DSR&#x27;s may come from backgrounds such as physical therapy, psychology, and driver education.

Evaluating a driver requires many aspects. A clinical assessment includes a review of the medical history, driving history, and driving needs. Visual and perceptual assessment along range of motion, motor strength, coordination, sensation, reaction time and cognitive assessment is a crucial aspect and the focus of the medical history evaluation.

“An initial driver evaluation can last one to four hours, depending on the client’s presenting disabilities and driving needs. Following the clinical assessment, clients undergo an on-road assessment if they meet the minimum state standards for health and vision, and the client holds a valid driver’s license or permit. The on-road assessment is performed in a driver rehabilitation vehicle equipped with dual brakes, rear-view mirror and eye-check mirror for the DRS, and any necessary adaptive equipment” 

The goal in the rehabilitation process is to have the individual realize their condition and attempt to reinstate them into a driving environment in which they will pose no threat to others.

==Approach==
Transportation psychology has emerged rapidly since the 1980s and, from its inception, has followed an interdisciplinary approach and has shared common topics with other fields, in particular medicine (e.g. driving aptitude), engineering (e.g. ergonomics and human factors), and economics (e.g. travel demand management). Mobility, including its positive and negative repercussions, originates in people&#x27;s decisions and behavior – and these could be influenced. The main causes of traffic crashes are errors due to maladaptive behavior in interaction with roadways or other vehicles.

<text>Henry Norwood &quot;Barney&quot; Ewell (February 25, 1918 – April 4, 1996) was an American athlete, and winner of one gold and two silver medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Born into poverty in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Ewell was one of the world&#x27;s leading sprinters of the 1940s. Ewell attended John Piersol McCaskey High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McCaskey High School honored Ewell by dedicating their stadium in his name. Ewell was also inducted into the J.P. McCaskey Athletic Hall of Fame during the school&#x27;s 50th anniversary year in 1988. Earlier in 1986, he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

Ewell was the state&#x27;s greatest high school sprinter-jumper in the mid-1930s, but he first achieved renown while a student at Pennsylvania State University, running the 100 m and 200 m races and winning 12 gold medals and championships in collegiate meets between 1940 and 1942. He also won 11 gold medals in AAU national meets between 1939 and 1948. He was an outstanding long jumper as well, leaping 25 feet 2 inches (7.68 m) in 1942.

He served his country in 1941–1945, returned to the university, and received his B.S. degree in 1947. He surprised everyone by making the 1948 Olympic team, equaling the world record of 10.2 in the 100 m dash at the 1948 AAU championship, which was also the Olympic trials.

At the Olympic Games in London, he thought he had won the 100 m only to learn the victory was given to teammate Harrison Dillard. In the 200 m, Ewell had another close finish and again finished second – this time to teammate Mel Patton. He was added to the 4 × 100 m relay when Ed Conwell became sick and the American team strolled to an easy victory. However, the exchange between Ewell and Lorenzo Wright was ruled out of the zone and the American team was disqualified. After viewing a film of the race, however, officials reversed the ruling, and Ewell finally had his Olympic gold medal.

After the Olympics Ewell lost his amateur status for accepting gifts from his fans, but he continued to compete in Australia and New Zealand as a professional. 

In 1950 Ewell, ran the fastest ever 100 yards in Australia at the Wangaratta Sports Carnival in a time of 9.5 seconds.

He also took part in the Scottish Border games circuit during the summer of 1950. He lived most of those weeks in the town of Bathgate. He won one of the most prestigious sprints on the Border Games circuit at Jedburgh. Running off scratch over 120 yards he ran a time of 11.37 secs. He also took part in a special invitation race in August that same year to mark his time in Scotland (run as a handicap race) over 120 yards at the famous Powderhall venue. Ewell from the scratch mark lost narrowly to Albert C Charles (off 12.5 yds).

Ewell died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

<text>Rosenborg Castle () is a renaissance castle in Copenhagen, Denmark. The castle was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 and is an example of Christian IV&#x27;s many architectural projects. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style, typical of Danish buildings during this period, and has been expanded several times, finally evolving into its present condition by the year 1624. Architects Bertel Lange and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger are associated with the structural planning of the castle.

==History==

The castle was used by Danish regents as a royal residence until around 1710. After the reign of Frederik IV, Rosenborg was used as a royal residence only twice, and both these times were during emergencies. The first time was after Christiansborg Palace burned down in 1794, and the second time was during the British attack on Copenhagen in 1801.

==Architecture==
===Long Hall===
Located on the third floor, the Long Hall was completed in 1624. It was originally intended as a ballroom. Around 1700 it was used as Royal Reception Room and for banquets. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that it became known as the &quot;Knight&#x27;s Hall&quot;.

Christian V had the hall partly modernised with twelve tapestries depicting the King&#x27;s victories in the Scanian War (1675–1679). The stucco ceiling seen today is from the beginning of the 18th century. It shows the Danish Coat of Arms surrounded by the Orders of the Elephant and of Dannebrog. Side reliefs depict historical events from the first years of the reign of Frederik IV, including the liberation of the serfs, the founding of the dragoons and of the land militia among them. The frescos in the ceiling by Hendrick Krock, represent the Regalia.

Among the main attractions of Rosenborg are the coronation chair of the absolutist kings and the throne of the queens with the three silver lions standing in front. The Long Hall also contains a large collection of silver furniture, of which most is from the 17th century.

==Rosenborg Collections==
The castle is open to the public for tours and houses a museum exhibiting the Royal Collections, artifacts spanning a breadth of royal Danish culture, from the late 16th century of Christian IV to the 19th century. Some of these articles once belonged to the nobility and the aristocracy. The castle, now state property, was opened to the public in 1838.

Of special interest to tourists is a treasury displaying the Crown Jewels and the Danish Crown Regalia located in the castle. A Coronation Carpet is also stored there. The Throne Chair of Denmark is located in the castle. In the summer time, flowers bloom in front of the castle in the castle garden.

==Gardens==
The castle is situated in &quot;Kongens Have&quot; (&quot;The King&#x27;s Garden&quot;), also known as &quot;Rosenborg Castle Garden&quot;. The Rosenborg Castle Garden is the country&#x27;s oldest royal garden and was embellished in the Renaissance style by Christian IV shortly before the construction of the main castle. Today, the gardens are a popular retreat for the people of Copenhagen, and attract an estimated 2.5 million visitors every year. Next to the castle are barracks where the Royal Life Guards is garrisoned. The Life Guard guards the castle.

<text>The Indian River is a river in Renfrew County and Nipissing District in Eastern and Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin, and is a left tributary of the Muskrat River.

==Course==
The river begins at an unnamed lake in the southeast corner of Algonquin Provincial Park, in geographic Master Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It flows north, then turns southeast at the point where it takes in the left tributary Walker Creek, from the railway point of Kathmore. From this point, the river valley is used as the route of the now abandoned Canadian National Railway Beachburg Subdivision, a section of track that was originally constructed as the Canadian Northern Railway main line. The river passes the railway point of Dahlia, and leaves the park and Nipissing District to enter Renfrew County, at geographic Richards Township in the municipality of Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards. After only , it passes into geographic Fraser Township in the municipality of Laurentian Valley, then reaches the unincorporated place and railway point of Indian. It continues east, loops under Renfrew County Road 58, and reaches the community of Alice. It flows again under Renfrew County Road 58, then Renfrew County Road 26 at the community of Davis Mills, and under Ontario Highway 17, at this point part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The river enters the city of Pembroke, and reaches its mouth at the Muskrat River, just before that river reaches its own mouth at the Ottawa River.

<text>The Royal League was an annual Scandinavian football tournament held three times between teams from the three Scandinavian monarchies (Denmark, Sweden, and Norway), starting after the end of the regular domestic seasons of Norway and Sweden. Denmark, however, was in mid-season when the tournament started. The four best-placed teams in the football leagues of Denmark, Norway and Sweden participate in the tournament.

There was discussion of expanding the league, and include the winners of Veikkausliiga and 
Landsbankadeild, which are the Finnish and the Icelandic premier divisions.

The 2007–08 edition was cancelled for financial reasons.

==History==
For the 2004–05 Royal League tournament, the twelve participating teams were initially placed into three groups. The two best-placed teams from each country were placed in the same group, while the two other teams were placed in the two other groups. In each group, each team played against the other three teams, home and away. The two best-placed teams of each group were randomly placed into two new groups. The three teams of each new group played each other, home and away. The 2005 Royal League Final was contested on 26 May 2005, by Swedish team IFK Gothenburg and FC Copenhagen from Denmark. FC Copenhagen won the title following a penalty shootout.

In the second season of the tournament, the twelve participating teams were also divided into three preliminary groups. The two best-placed teams of each group, and the two best third-placed teams went on to play quarterfinals. The rest of the tournament was played in a knockout-system. The quarter-finals and semi-finals were played both at home and away, while there was only a single final game to decide the winner. The 2006 Royal League Final was contested on 6 April 2006, by FC Copenhagen and Lillestrøm from Norway. FC Copenhagen won their second title, when Razak Pimpong scored to 1–0 in the last minutes of the game.

For the 2006–07 Royal League tournament, the structure of initial group stage and subsequent knockout-stage was kept. As opposed to the previous edition of the tournament, the knock-out stages were played as single games, with the team having the best group stage record earning home field advantage. The 2007 Royal League Final was contested on 15 March 2007, by Danish team Brøndby IF and FC Copenhagen. Brøndby won 1–0, on a penalty kick converted by Martin Ericsson.

The league has received quite a lot of criticism since the first season. The teams rarely bother to play with their best side, and this leads to a lack of interest. Raising the award money and/or giving direct place in the UEFA Champions League have been suggested as ways to improve the situation.

The 2007–08 edition was cancelled for financial reasons, but the board planned to resurrect the tournament for the 2008–09 season. On 11 October 2008 it was announced that the 2008–09 season would not be held either, as the TV rights for the tournament had not been sold.

There were however plans for a tournament in 2010, but under a new name; Royal Cup.

<doc id="597862" wikidata="Q196122" url="?curid=597862" title="Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip">
<text>The Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip is a 2005 strategic move by Israel in which the country unilaterally dismantled all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and four additional settlements in the Northern West Bank. The Israeli settlers who had lived in those settlements, as well as military personnel who protected them, were evacuated and resettled and redeployed elsewhere within Israel. By executing the plan unilaterally, Israel rejected any coordination or orderly hand-over to the Palestinian Authority. In spite of the disengagement, the United Nations, international human rights organizations, many legal scholars, and a “majority of academic commentators” regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) reaffirmed this position on the basis of Israel&#x27;s continued control of the Gaza Strip. The 2024 ICJ advisory opinion, Article 42 of the Hague Relations and precedent in international law maintain that a territory remains occupied so long as an army could reestablish physical control at any time.

The disengagement was proposed in 2003 by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, adopted by the government in June 2004, and approved by the Knesset in February 2005 as the &quot;Disengagement Plan Implementation Law&quot;. The motivation behind the disengagement was described by Sharon&#x27;s top aide as a means of isolating Gaza and avoiding international pressure on Israel to reach a political settlement with the Palestinians. The disengagement plan was implemented in August 2005 and completed in September 2005. Israeli security forces, over a period of several days, evicted settlers who refused to accept government compensation packages and voluntarily vacate their homes prior to the August 15, 2005 deadline. The eviction of all Israeli residents, demolition of the Israeli residential buildings and evacuation of associated security personnel from the Gaza Strip was completed by September 12, 2005. The eviction and dismantlement of the four settlements in the northern West Bank was completed ten days later. Over 8,000 Jewish settlers from the 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip were relocated.

Palestinians celebrated amid skepticism that the withdrawal would take place. Israeli polls on support for the plan during the time showed support for the plan in the 50–60% range and opposition in the 30–40% range. The Israeli military met heavy resistance and riots from settlers while pulling out. Two far-right Israelis self-immolated. Benjamin Netanyahu resigned from Sharon&#x27;s government over the pullout.

== Background ==
Israel occupied the Gaza Strip during the Six Day War, capturing it from Egypt along with the Sinai peninsula. In 1970, the first Israeli settlement was built. In 1993, as part of the Oslo Accords, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel agreed to an outline for Palestinians to self-govern in the Palestinian territories. In 1994, Israel withdrew from Gaza City and Jericho, giving civilian and city functions to the Palestinian Authority. The Second Intifada broke out, and peace process negotiations halted.

Historian Avi Shlaim writes that persistent attacks by Hamas on Israeli settlers and soldiers increased the costs of maintaining a presence in Gaza, making it unsustainable. Shlaim says that the withdrawal aimed to undermine the Oslo peace process by freezing the political process and indefinitely delaying discussions about a Palestinian state. Additionally, demographic concerns played a role. According to Shlaim, the higher Palestinian birth rate posed a &quot;demographic time bomb,&quot; threatening the Jewish majority in areas claimed by Israel. By withdrawing from Gaza, Israel effectively removed 1.4 million Palestinians from its demographic considerations. Shlaim writes that although Sharon stated the move was a contribution to peace, it was a unilateral decision serving Israeli national interests and was not intended as a prelude to further withdrawals or genuine peace efforts.

== Rationale and development of the policy ==
In his book &quot;Sharon: The Life of a Leader&quot;, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s son Gilad wrote that he gave his father the idea of the disengagement. Sharon had originally dubbed his unilateral disengagement plan the &quot;separation plan&quot; or &quot;Tokhnit HaHafrada,&quot; before realizing that, &quot;separation sounded bad, particularly in English, because it evoked apartheid.&quot;

In an interview from November 2003, Ehud Olmert, the deputy leader to Sharon, who had been subtly suggesting a unilateral approach for a couple of months, elaborated on his evolving policy. 
He expressed his certainty that the Israeli government would soon need to seriously and decisively address the &quot;demographic issue&quot;. He believed this issue would be the primary determinant of the solution they would have to adopt. He observed that an increasing number of Palestinians wanted to move from a fight against occupation to a fight for &quot;one-man-one-vote&quot;. However, according to Olmert, for Israelis, it would signify the end of the Jewish state. The parameters of a unilateral solution as described by Olmert would be to maximize the Jewish population, minimize the Palestinian population, avoid withdrawing to the 1967 border, and not divide Jerusalem. He recalled that Moshe Dayan had proposed unilateral autonomy 23 years ago. Similarly, he expressed the need to consider unilateral separation, which would likely prevent dialogue with the Palestinians for at least 25 years.

Sharon suggested his disengagement plan for the first time on December 18, 2003, at the Fourth Herzliya Conference. In his address to the Conference, Sharon stated that &quot;settlements which will be relocated are those which will not be included in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State of Israel in any future agreement.&quot; It was at this time that he began to use the word &quot;occupation&quot;. Bernard Avishai states that the Gaza withdrawal was designed to obviate rather than facilitate peace negotiations: Sharon envisaged at the same time annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlements like Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Ariel which he had in the meantime developed, and thereby isolate Palestinians on the West Bank in territory that constituted less than half of what existed beyond the Green Line.

Sharon formally announced the plan in his April 14, 2004, letter to U.S. President George W. Bush, stating that &quot;there exists no Palestinian partner with whom to advance peacefully toward a settlement&quot;.

On June 6, 2004, Sharon&#x27;s government approved an amended disengagement plan, but with the reservation that the dismantling of each settlement should be voted separately. On October 11, at the opening of the Knesset winter session, Sharon outlined his plan to start legislation for the disengagement at the beginning of November, and on October 26, the Knesset gave its preliminary approval. On February 16, 2005, the Knesset finalized and approved the plan.

In October 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s senior adviser, Dov Weissglass, explained the meaning of Sharon&#x27;s statement further:
The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process, and when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress.

That is exactly what happened. You know, the term &#x27;peace process&#x27; is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it&#x27;s the return of refugees, it&#x27;s the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen... what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did.

Demographic concerns, the maintenance of a Jewish majority in Israeli-controlled areas, played a significant role in the development of the policy.

The rationale for the disengagement has been partly attributed to Arnon Soffer&#x27;s campaign regarding &quot;the danger the Palestinian womb posed to Israeli democracy.&quot; Sharon mentioned the demographic rationale in a public address on August 15, 2005, the day of the disengagement, as follows: &quot;It is no secret that, like many others, I had believed and hoped we could forever hold onto Netzarim and Kfar Darom. But the changing reality in the country, in the region, and the world, required of me a reassessment and change of positions. We cannot hold on to Gaza forever. More than a million Palestinians live there and double their number with each generation.&quot; At the same time, Shimon Peres, then Vice Prime Minister, stated in an interview that: &quot;We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography&quot;.

Continued control of Gaza was considered to pose an impossible dilemma with respect to Israel&#x27;s ability to be a Jewish and democratic state in all the territories it controls.

== Political approval process ==

Failing to gain public support from senior ministers, Sharon agreed that the Likud party would hold a referendum on the plan in advance of a vote by the Israeli Cabinet. The referendum was held on May 2, 2004, and ended with 65% of the voters against the disengagement plan, despite some polls showing approximately 55% of Likud members supporting the plan before the referendum. Commentators and the press described the rejection of the plan as a blow to Sharon. Sharon himself announced that he accepted the Likud referendum results and would take time to consider his steps. He ordered Minister of Defense Shaul Mofaz to create an amended plan which Likud voters could accept.

On June 6, 2004, Sharon&#x27;s government approved an amended disengagement plan, but with the reservation that the dismantling of each settlement should be voted separately. The plan was approved with a 14–7 majority but only after the National Union ministers and cabinet members Avigdor Liberman and Binyamin Elon were dismissed from the cabinet, and a compromise offer by Likud&#x27;s cabinet member Tzipi Livni was achieved.

Following the approval of the plan, it was decided to close the Erez industrial zone and move its factories to cities and towns in Israel such as Ashkelon, Dimona, Yeruham, and Sderot. Ehud Olmert, then the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Labor, stated that the closing was part of Israel&#x27;s plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.

As a result of the passing of the plan (in principle), two National Religious Party (NRP) ministers, Effi Eitam and Yitzhak Levi, resigned, leaving the government with a minority in the Knesset. Later, the entire faction quit after their calls to hold a national referendum were ignored.

Sharon&#x27;s pushing through this plan alienated many of his supporters on the right and garnered him unusual support from the left-wing in Israel. The right believes that Sharon ignored the mandate he had been elected on, and instead adopted the platform of his Labor opponent, Amram Mitzna, who was overwhelmingly defeated when he campaigned on a disengagement plan of far smaller magnitude. At that time, Sharon referred to Gaza communities such as Netzarim as &quot;no different than Tel Aviv&quot;, and said that they are of such strategic value that &quot;the fate of Netzarim is the fate of Tel Aviv.&quot;

Many on both sides remained skeptical of his will to withdraw beyond Gaza and the northern West Bank. Sharon had a majority for the plan in the government but not within his party. This forced him to seek a National Unity government, which was established in January 2005. Opponents of the plan, and some ministers, such as Benjamin Netanyahu and former minister Natan Sharansky, called on Sharon to hold a national referendum to prove that he had a mandate, which he refused to do.

On September 14, the Israeli cabinet approved, by a 9–1 majority, plans to compensate settlers who left the Gaza Strip, with only the NRP&#x27;s Zevulun Orlev opposing. The government&#x27;s plan for compensation used a formula that based actual amounts on location, house size, and number of family members among other factors. Most families were expected to receive between US$200,000 and 300,000.

On October 11, at the opening of the Knesset winter session, Sharon outlined his plan to start legislation for the disengagement in the beginning of November. In a symbolic act, the Knesset voted 53–44 against Sharon&#x27;s address: Labor voted against, while the National Religious Party and ten members of Likud refused to support Sharon in the vote.

On October 26, the Knesset gave preliminary approval for the plan with 67 for, 45 against, seven abstentions, and one member absent. Netanyahu and three other cabinet ministers from Sharon&#x27;s ruling Likud government threatened to resign unless Sharon agreed to hold a national referendum on the plan within fourteen days.

On November 9, Netanyahu withdrew his resignation threat, saying &quot;In this new situation [the death of Yasser Arafat], I decided to stay in the government&quot;. Following the vote fourteen days earlier, and Sharon&#x27;s subsequent refusal to budge on the referendum issue, the three other cabinet ministers from the Likud party backed down from their threat within days.

On December 30, Sharon made a deal with the Labor Party to form a coalition, with Shimon Peres becoming Vice Premier, restoring the government&#x27;s majority in the Knesset.

On February 16, 2005, the Knesset finalized and approved the plan with 59 in favor, 40 opposed, 5 abstaining. A proposed amendment to submit the plan to a referendum was rejected, 29–72.

On March 17, the Southern Command of the Israel Defense Forces issued a military order prohibiting Israeli citizens not living in the Gaza Strip settlements from taking up residence there.

On March 28, the Knesset again rejected a bill to delay the implementation of the disengagement plan by a vote of 72 to 39. The bill was introduced by a group of Likud MKs who wanted to force a referendum on the issue.

On August 7, Netanyahu resigned just before the cabinet ratification of the first phase of the disengagement plan by a vote of 17 to 5. Netanyahu blamed the Israeli government for moving &quot;blindly along&quot; with the disengagement by not taking into account the expected upsurge in terrorism.

On August 10, in his first speech before the Knesset following his resignation, Netanyahu spoke of the necessity for Knesset members to oppose the proposed disengagement:Only we in the Knesset are able to stop this evil. Everything that the Knesset has decided, it is also capable of changing. I am calling on all those who grasp the danger: Gather strength and do the right thing. I don&#x27;t know if the entire move can be stopped, but it still might be stopped in its initial stages. [Don&#x27;t] give [the Palestinians] guns, don&#x27;t give them rockets, don&#x27;t give them a sea port, and don&#x27;t give them a huge base for terror.On August 15, Sharon said that, while he had hoped Israel could keep the Gaza settlements forever, reality simply intervened. &quot;It is out of strength and not weakness that we are taking this step&quot;, repeating his argument that the disengagement plan has given Israel the diplomatic initiative.

On August 31, the Knesset voted to withdraw from the Gaza–Egypt border and allow Egyptian deployment of border police along the demilitarized Egyptian side of the border, revising the previously stated intent to maintain Israeli control of the border.

== Description of the plan ==
The Gaza Strip contained 21 civilian Israeli settlements and the area evacuated in the West Bank contained four, as follows:

Hermesh and Mevo Dotan in the northwestern West Bank were included in the original disengagement plans, but were dropped from the plans in March.

Sharon said that his plan was designed to improve Israel&#x27;s security and international status in the absence of political negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. About nine thousand Israeli residents within Gaza were instructed to leave the area or face eviction by the night of Tuesday, August 16, 2005. Settlers were offered compensation to move voluntarily, which about two-thirds accepted.

Under the Revised Disengagement Plan adopted on June 6, 2004, the IDF was to have remained on the Gaza–Egypt border and could have engaged in further house demolitions to widen a &#x27;buffer zone&#x27; there (Art 6). However, Israel later decided to leave the border area, which is now controlled by Egypt and the Palestinians, through the PNA. Israel will continue to control Gaza&#x27;s coastline and airspace and reserves the right to undertake military operations when necessary. (Art 3.1). Egypt will control Gaza&#x27;s Egyptian border. Israel will continue to provide Gaza with water, communication, electricity, and sewage networks. The agreements brokered, according to Condoleezza Rice, proposed that Palestinians have control over exits and entrances, trucks and buses move between Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinians establish seaport and airport. This plan did not come to pass. Israel and Egypt have concluded an agreement under which Egypt can increase the number of police on its side of the border, while the IDF evacuates the Gazan side. The text of the agreement is not yet public. The estimated cost of Israel&#x27;s disengagement is around $2 billion.

Because the Palestinian Authority in Gaza did not believe it had sufficient control of the area at this time, observers such as the Human Rights Watch and legal experts have argued that the disengagement will not end Israel&#x27;s legal responsibility as an occupying power in Gaza.

== Execution of the plan ==
=== Gaza Strip ===

The disengagement began with Operation &quot;Yad l&#x27;Achim&quot; (, &quot;Giving brothers a hand&quot;).

The aim of the operation was to give the Gush Katif settlers the option to leave voluntarily. IDF soldiers helped the settlers who chose to do so by packing their belongings and carrying them. During the operation, soldiers went into settlers&#x27; homes and presented them with removal decrees. In addition, the IDF arranged crews of social nurses, psychologists, and support to youths.

On April 8, 2005, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said that Israel should consider not demolishing the evacuated buildings in the Gaza Strip, with the exception of synagogues (due to fears of their potential desecration, which eventually did occur), since it would be more costly and time-consuming. This contrasted with the original plan by the Prime Minister to demolish all vacated buildings.

On May 9, the beginning of the evacuation of settlements was officially postponed from July 20 until August 15, so as to not coincide with the Jewish period of The Three Weeks and the fast of Tisha B&#x27;Av, traditionally marking grief and destruction.

On July 13, Sharon signed the closure order of Gush Katif, making the area a closed military zone. From that point on, only residents who presented Israeli ID cards with their registered address in Gush Katif were permitted to enter. Permits for 24–48 hours were given to select visitors for a few weeks before the entire area was completely sealed off to non-residents. Despite this ban, opponents of the disengagement managed to sneak in by foot through fields and bare soil. Estimates range from a few hundred to an army estimate of 5000 infiltrators. At one point, Sharon contemplated deploying Israel Border Police (&quot;Magav&quot;) forces to remove non-residents, but decided against it, as the staffing requirement would have been too great.

About two-thirds of settlers accepted compensation for voluntary relocation. 

At midnight between August 14 and 15, the Kissufim crossing was shut down, and the Gaza Strip became officially closed for entrance by Israelis. The Gush Katif Municipal Council threatened to unilaterally declare independence, citing the Gaza Strip&#x27;s internationally disputed status and Halacha as a foundation. Meanwhile, on August 14, proclaimed the independence of Shirat HaYam as &quot;The Independent Jewish Authority in Gaza Beach&quot;, and submitted appeals for recognition to the United Nations and Red Cross.

On August 15, the evacuation commenced under the orders of Maj. Gen. Dan Harel of the Southern Command. At 8 a.m., a convoy of security forces entered Neve Dekalim and began evacuating residents. Many settlers chose to leave peacefully, others were forcibly evicted, and some attempted to block buses and clashed with security forces. The evacuation continued after midnight of August 17 by agreement with settlers who requested a time extension for packing their things, and to compensate for the evacuation delays caused by protesters. Some settlers had already shipped out their belongings because they knew they would be unable to remain, but on principle refused to leave voluntarily and stayed so the military would be required to remove them by force.

Evacuations of six settlements shifted into forced removals as 14,000 Israeli soldiers and police officers forcibly evicted settlers and &quot;mistanenim&quot; (infiltrators). They went house to house, ordering settlers to leave and breaking down the doors of those who did not. There were scenes of troops dragging screaming and sobbing families from houses and synagogues, but with less violence than expected. Some of the soldiers were also observed sobbing, and there were instances of soldiers joining settlers in prayer before evicting them. Some settlers lit their homes on fire as they evacuated so as to leave the Palestinians nothing. Settlers blocked roads, lit fires, and pleaded with soldiers to disobey orders. One West Bank settler set herself on fire in front of a Gaza checkpoint, and in Neve Dekalim, a group of fifteen American Orthodox Jews barricaded themselves in a basement and threatened to light themselves on fire. One policeman had ammonia thrown in his eyes. One soldier was stabbed.

Kfar Darom was next evacuated. Residents and their supporters strung up barbed wire fences around the area, and security forces cut their way in. Some 300 settlers barricaded themselves in the local synagogue, while another group barricaded themselves on the roof with barbed wire, and pelted security forces with various objects. Police removed them by force after negotiations failed, and there were injuries to both settlers and officers. On August 17, the settlement of Morag was evacuated by 200 police officers.

On August 18, Shirat HaYam was evacuated by military and police forces, after infiltrators had been removed and the settlement&#x27;s speaker system was disabled after settlers used it to call on troops to disobey orders. Youth placed obstacles made of flammable materials and torched tires and garbage dumpsters. Fires spread to Palestinian areas, and IDF bulldozers were deployed to put them out. A number of people also barricaded themselves in the synagogue and public buildings and on a deserted rooftop. Aryeh Yitzhaki defended his home with an M16 rifle, and dozens of settlers barricaded themselves inside or on the roof of his home, with at least four of those on the rooftop being armed. A brief stand-off with security forces ensued, and snipers were deployed after Yitzhaki threatened to fire at troops. Security forces stormed the rooftop and arrested settlers without any violence. IDF and police forces evacuated the home after Yitzhaki surrendered weapons and ammunition belonging to his group, but were met with bags of paint and whitewash thrown by settlers, and Yitzhaki&#x27;s wife and another right-wing activist initially refused to evacuate and lay on the ground holding their infants.

Bedouin citizens of Israel from the village of Dahaniya, situated in the no-man&#x27;s land on the Israel–Gaza Strip border, were evacuated and resettled in Arad. The village had a long history of cooperation with Israel, and the residents, who were viewed in Gaza as traitors, had asked to be evacuated due to security concerns.

On August 19, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that some settlers had their children leave their homes with their hands up, or wearing a Star of David badge, to associate the actions of Israel with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Some protestors said that they would &quot;not go like sheep to the slaughter&quot;, a phrase strongly associated with the Holocaust. On August 22, Netzarim was evacuated by the Israeli military, completing the withdrawal.
The evacuation of the settlers was completed by August 22, after which demolition crews razed 2,800 houses, community buildings and 26 synagogues. Two synagogues, whose construction allowed for them to be taken apart and reassembled, were dismantled and rebuilt in Israel. The demolition of the homes was completed on September 1, while the Shirat HaYam hotel was demolished later.

On August 28, the IDF began dismantling Gush Katif&#x27;s 48-grave cemetery. All of the bodies were removed by special teams of soldiers supervised by the Military Rabbinate and reburied in locations of their families&#x27; choosing. In accordance with Jewish law, all soil touching the remains was also transferred, and the dead were given second funerals, with the families observing a one-day mourning period. All coffins were draped in the Israeli flag on the way to reburial. The transfer was completed on September 1.

The IDF also pulled out its forces in the Gaza Strip, and had withdrawn 95% of its military equipment by September 1. On September 7, the IDF announced that it planned to advance its full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip to September 12, pending cabinet approval. It was also announced that in the area evacuated in the West Bank the IDF planned to transfer all control (excluding building permits and anti-terrorism) to the PNA – the area will remain &quot;Area C&quot; (full Israeli control) &quot;de jure&quot;, but &quot;Area A&quot; (full PNA control) &quot;de facto&quot;.

When the disengagement began, Israel had not yet decided on whether or not to withdraw from the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip of land serving as a buffer zone along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Although Sharon was initially opposed to withdrawing from the Philadelphi Route, he relented after legal advisers told him that it was impossible to declare Israel had fully withdrawn from the Gaza Strip so long as it controlled the border with Egypt. On August 28, the Israeli government approved the Philadelphi Accord, under which Egypt, which was prohibited from militarizing the Sinai without Israeli approval as per its peace treaty with Israel, was authorized to deploy 750 border guards equipped with heavy weaponry to the Philadelphi Route. The agreement was approved by the Knesset on August 31. On September 12, the IDF withdrew all forces from the Philadelphi Route.

The Israeli Supreme Court, in response to a settlers&#x27; petition to block the government&#x27;s destruction of the synagogues, gave the go-ahead to the Israeli government. Sharon decided not to proceed with their demolition, however. On September 11, the Israeli cabinet revised an earlier decision to destroy the synagogues of the settlements. The Palestinian Authority protested Israel&#x27;s decision, arguing that it would rather Israel dismantle the synagogues. On September 11, a ceremony was held when the last Israeli flag was lowered in the IDF&#x27;s Gaza Strip divisional headquarters. All remaining IDF forces left the Gaza Strip in the following hours. The last soldier left the strip, and the Kissufim gate was closed on the early morning of September 12. This completed the Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip. However, an official handover ceremony was cancelled after the Palestinian Authority boycotted it in response to Israel&#x27;s decision not to demolish the synagogues. On September 21, Israel officially declared the Gaza Strip to be an extraterritorial jurisdiction and the four border crossings on the Israel-Gaza border to be international border crossings, with a valid passport or other appropriate travel documents now required to cross through them.


===Northern West Bank (Samaria)===
On September 22, the IDF evacuated the four settlements in the northern West Bank. While the residents of Ganim and Kadim, mostly middle-class seculars, had long since left their homes, several families and about 2,000 outsiders tried to prevent the evacuation of Sa-Nur and Homesh, which had a larger percent of observant population. Following negotiations, the evacuation was completed relatively peacefully. The settlements were subsequently razed, with 270 homes being bulldozed. In Sa-Nur, the synagogue was left intact, but was buried under mounds of sand by bulldozers to prevent its destruction by the Palestinians.

During the pullout, hundreds of people were arrested for rioting, and criminal charges were filed against 482 of them. On January 25, 2010, the Knesset passed a bill granting a general amnesty to around 400 of them, mostly teenagers. While most had by then finished serving their sentences, their criminal records were expunged. The people who were not pardoned as part of this amnesty had either been convicted of crimes that involved endangering human life, and involved the use of explosives or serious violence, or had a previous criminal record.

Following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal, on September 12 Palestinian crowds entered the settlements waving PLO and Hamas flags, firing gunshots into the air and setting off firecrackers, and chanting slogans. Radicals among them desecrated 4 synagogues. Destroyed homes were ransacked. Hamas leaders held celebratory prayers in Kfar Darom synagogue as mobs continued to ransack and loot synagogues. Palestinian Authority security forces did not intervene, and announced that the synagogues would be destroyed. Less than 24 hours after the withdrawal, Palestinian Authority bulldozers began to demolish the remaining synagogues. Hamas took credit for the withdrawal, and one of their banners read: &#x27;Four years of resistance beat ten years of negotiations.&#x27;

=== Greenhouses ===
When Israel left, large numbers of greenhouses that had been handed over to assist economic regrowth were destroyed by Israeli settlers or damaged by Palestinians. Half of the greenhouses were demolished by their owners before being evacuated for lack of the agreed payment. Two months prior to the withdrawal, half of the 21 settlements&#x27; greenhouses, spread over , had been dismantled by their owners, leaving the remainder on , placing its business viability on a weak footing. The Economic Cooperation Foundation of American Jewish donors raised $14 million to buy over 3,000 greenhouses from Israeli settlers to transfer to the Palestinian Authority. International bodies, and pressure from James Wolfensohn, Middle East envoy of the Quartet, who gave $500,000 of his own money, offered incentives for the rest of the greenhouses to be left to the Palestinians of Gaza. An agreement was reached with Israel under international law to destroy the settlers&#x27; houses and shift the rubble to Egypt. The disposal of asbestos presented a particular problem: some 60,000 truckloads of rubble required passage to Egypt.

The remaining settlements&#x27; greenhouses were looted by Palestinians for 2 days after the transfer, for irrigation pipes, water pumps, plastic sheeting and glass, but the greenhouses themselves remained structurally intact, until order was restored. The deputy Palestinian finance minister said around 30% of greenhouses were damaged. Palestinian Authority security forces attempted to stop the looters, but were inadequately staffed. In some places, there was no security, while some Palestinian police officers joined the looters. The Palestine Economic Development Company (PED) invested $20,000,000 and by October the industry was back on its feet. Economic consultants estimated that the closures cost the whole agricultural sector in Gaza $450,000 a day in lost revenue. 25 truckloads of produce per diem through that crossing were needed to render the project viable, but only rarely were just 3 truckloads able to obtain transit at the crossing, which however functioned only sporadically, with Israel citing security concerns. It appears that on both sides corruption prevailed, such as instances of Gazans negotiating with Israeli officers at the crossing and offering bribes to get their trucks over the border. By early 2006, farmers, faced with the slowness of transit, were forced to dump most of their produce at the crossing where it was eaten by goats. Ariel Sharon fell ill, a new Israeli administration eventually came to power and Wolfensohn resigned his office, after suffering from obstacles placed in his way by the U.S. administration, which was sceptical of the agreements reached on border terminals. Wolfensohn attributed this policy of hindrance to Elliott Abrams. Further complications arose from Hamas&#x27;s election victory in January 2006, and the rift that emerged between Hamas and Fatah. He attributed the electoral success of Hamas to the frustration felt by Palestinians over the non-implementation of these agreements, which shattered their brief experience of normality. &quot;Instead of hope, the Palestinians saw that they were put back in prison,&quot; he concluded. The project was shut down in April 2006 when money ran out to pay the agricultural workers.

=== Lawsuits to stop evictions ===
On June 9, 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled the Gaza withdrawal plan was constitutional, rejecting 12 petitions by opponents of the withdrawal. In their 320-page ruling, the judges upheld four technical challenges dealing with financial compensation for settlers who were to be evicted, but stressed the withdrawal itself was constitutional and did not violate the human rights of Israeli settlers.

Yoram Sheftel, a lawyer for the settlers, said his expectations were low because the Supreme Court tended to side with the government against Israeli settlers. He said &quot;We didn&#x27;t expect anything from this court since the petitioners are Jews and patriots. This was fully expected.&quot; However, Israeli justice minister Tzipi Livni praised the court decision, expressing hope that the ruling would defuse potentially violent settler resistance to the evacuation. She told Army Radio &quot;I hope this ruling makes it absolutely clear to the individual settler that the plan is going ahead.&quot;

Israeli settlers in Gaza also attempted to stop the evictions by saying they were protected persons under of the Fourth Geneva Convention and therefore it would be a war crime for Israel to evict them from the region per of the same convention. On August 22, 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court dismissed the petition, saying:
[...] by virtue thereof should be dismissed (858 F-G) 3. [...] the petitioners, who are Israeli citizens living in the evicted areas, do not fall under the definition of the term “protected persons” under the 1949 Geneva Convention for the Protection of Civilians in Times of War, and under the principles of the laws of occupation.
According to the court, Israeli settlers were not protected persons under international humanitarian law if any harm came from Israel since they were nationals of that country in the context of international armed conflict (IAC). The laws of war applicable to IAC generally accords protection to enemy nationals and stateless persons or neutral citizens outside the territory of a belligerent power, but not to nationals under their own state authority, neutral citizens in the territory belonging to a belligerent nation, and nationals of a co-belligerent country.

== Aftermath ==
The year of the disengagement would see the removal of 8,475 settlers from Gaza, while in that same year the number of new settlers in the West Bank increased by 15,000. After Israel&#x27;s disengagement, there was increased freedom of movement within Gaza due to Israel&#x27;s removal of its settlements. Israel&#x27;s disengagement also resulted in loss of the settlement factories, workshops, and greenhouses where Gazans were employed. The year following the disengagement saw a tightening of external Israeli control over Gaza, specifically, the closure of crossings into Gaza for people and goods, increased restrictions on the coastline for fishing, and increased aerial, maritime and on the ground military activity. The Israeli human rights organization Gisha lists various examples of actions requiring Israeli permission or approval in the year following the disengagement. These restrictions include the need for Israeli permission to import basic necessities such as milk, to host foreign lecturers at universities, and register children in the Palestinian population registry. Additionally, fishermen must obtain permission to fish off Gaza&#x27;s coast, and nonprofits need approval to receive tax-exempt donations. Financial transactions such as the transfer of salaries to teachers are also controlled by Israel, which affects the payment of salaries by the Palestinian Ministry of Education. Moreover, farmers require authorization to export agricultural products, and students wishing to study abroad depend on Israel&#x27;s approval for the opening of the Gaza-Egypt crossing.

Political economist Sara Roy describes the disengagement from Gaza as completing the separation and isolation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. She describes the period before the disengagement as a period of increasing dependence on the Israeli economy and that of the West Bank, while the period after the disengagement is characterized by economic, social and political isolation of Gaza. She describes the disengagement as normalizing the occupation in the eyes of the international community, despite the expansion of the occupation and the lack of any &quot;safe passage&quot; between Gaza and the West Bank.

=== Compensation and resettlement ===

Under legislation passed by the Knesset, evacuated settlers were to be compensated for the loss of their homes, lands, and businesses. Originally, the law only allowed anyone age 21 or over who had lived in one of the evacuated settlements for over five consecutive years to be compensated, but the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that compensation for younger settlers should also be included in compensation payments to evacuated families. Settlers who lived in the area for at least two years were eligible for more money. The Israeli government offered bonuses to settlers who moved to the Galilee or Negev, and implemented a program in which settlers had the option to build their own homes, with the option of a rental grant. The Housing Ministry doubled the number of apartments available in the Negev. Farmers were offered farmland or plots of land on which to build a home, in exchange for reduced compensation. Land was to be compensated at a rate of $50,000 per dunam (), with homes being compensated at a rate per square meter. Workers who lost their jobs were eligible for unemployment benefits ranging from minimum wage to twice the average salary, for up to six months. Workers aged 50 to 55 were offered years&#x27; worth of unemployment benefits, and those over 55 were eligible for a pension until age 67. A special category was created for communities that moved en masse, with the government funding the replacement of communal buildings. In cases where communities did not stay together and communal property was lost, individuals would receive compensation for donations made to those buildings. Taxes on compensation sums given to business owners were reduced from ten to five percent. The total cost of the compensation package as adopted by the Knesset was 3.8 billion NIS (approximately $870 million). Following an increase in the number of compensation claims after the disengagement, another 1.5 billion NIS (approximately $250 million) was added. In 2007, a further $125 million was added to the compensation budget. Approximately $176 million was to be paid directly to the evacuees, $66 million to private business owners, and the rest was allocated to finance the government&#x27;s pullout-related expenses. Yitzhak Meron, the lawyer who represented the evacuees, in dealing with the government offices, recently (11.08.2014) described how this came about, as well as his perception of the situation.

According to an Israeli committee of inquiry, the government failed to properly implement its compensation plans. By April 2006, only minimal compensation (approximately $10,000) had been paid to families to survive until they obtained new jobs, which was difficult for most people, considering that most of the newly unemployed were middle-aged and lost the agricultural resources that were their livelihood. Those seeking compensation also had to negotiate legal and bureaucratic hurdles.

This criticism received further support from State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss&#x27;s, report, which determined that the treatment of the evacuees was a &quot;big failure&quot; and pointed out many shortcomings.

By 2007, 56.8% of evacuees had found jobs, 22.3% were unemployed and seeking work, and 31.2% of evacuees were unemployed and living off government benefits rather than seeking work. The average monthly salary among the evacuees was NIS 5,380 (about $1,281), a slight rise of 2.1 percent from the average salary the year before. This was, however, a sharp drop of 39% from the settlers&#x27; average monthly income before the disengagement. The average salary among evacuees was lower than the general average, as compared to above average before the disengagement. In addition to a drop in salary, the evacuees also suffered a drop in their standard of living due to the increased price of goods and services in their places of residence as compared to the settlements.
Following the disengagement, settlers were temporarily relocated to hotels, sometimes for as long as half a year, before moving to mobile homes as temporary housing known as &#x27;caravillas&#x27;, before they could build proper homes. By June 2014, about 60% of evacuees were still living in these caravillas. Only 40% had moved to permanent housing, although construction of permanent settlements for the evacuees continues to progress. By July 2014, eleven towns for the evacuees had been completed with the expellees joining ten additional towns. Many of the permanent settlements under construction were given names reminiscent of the former Gaza settlements. By August 2014, unemployment among evacuees had dropped to 18%. In 2010 a bill was introduced in the Knesset providing a basic pension to business owners whose businesses collapsed.

=== Fatah–Hamas conflict ===
In September 2005, CNN reported increasing lawlessness in Gaza, rival militant groups competing for power, and hundreds of masked Hamas gunmen carrying rifles and grenade launchers marching through the streets of a refugee camp.

Following the withdrawal, Hamas was elected as the Palestinian government which started the chain reaction leading to Operation &quot;Summer Rains&quot; later within that year.

In December 2006, news reports indicated that a number of Palestinians were leaving the Gaza Strip, due to political disorder and &quot;economic pressure&quot; there. In January 2007, fighting continued between Hamas and Fatah, without any progress towards resolution or reconciliation. Fighting spread to several points in the Gaza Strip with both factions attacking each other. In response to constant attacks by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, Israel launched an airstrike which destroyed a building used by Hamas. In June 2007, the Fatah–Hamas conflict reached its height and Hamas took control over the Gaza Strip. An emergency cabinet led by Fatah began governing the West Bank. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for Hamas to let go of its position, but the Gaza Strip remains controlled by Hamas.

=== Closure ===
A British Parliamentary commission, summing up the situation eight months later, found that while the Rafah crossing agreement worked efficiently (although this crossing was closed for 148 days in 2006), from January–April 2006, the Karni crossing was closed 45% of the time, and severe limitations were in place on exports from Gaza, with, according to OCHA figures, only 1,500 of 8,500 tons of produce getting through; that they were informed most closures were unrelated to security issues in Gaza but either responses to violence in the West Bank or for no given reason. The promised transit of convoys between Gaza and the West Bank was not honoured; with Israel insisting that such convoys could only pass if they passed through a specially constructed tunnel or ditch, requiring a specific construction project in the future; Israel withdrew from implementation talks in December 2005 after a suicide bombing attack on Israelis in Netanya by a Palestinian from Kafr Rai.

Gisha reported that during the 2006 winter agricultural season, in which Gaza farmers were to export produce to Israel, the West Bank, and Europe, the Karni Crossing was closed 47% of the time. The closures caused an estimated $30 million in losses in the first quarter of 2006 alone. In the first year following the disengagement, the number of trucks carrying exports from the Gaza Strip per day was fewer than 20. In comparison, the agreement with Israel stipulated allowing 400 trucks to exit per day.

===Museum===
In August 2008, a museum of Gush Katif opened in Jerusalem near Machane Yehuda. Yankeleh Klein, the museum director, sees it as an artistic commemoration of the expulsion from the 21 Gaza settlements, and the evacuees&#x27; longing to return. The art displayed in the museum is that of Gaza evacuees along with pieces by photographers and artists who were involved in the disengagement or were affected by it.

In the newly renovated Katif Center, more properly called the &quot;Gush Katif Heritage Center in Nitzan,&quot; Israel, guided tours are provided by Gush Katif expellees. Project Coordinator Laurence Beziz notes that &quot;Our goal is to tell the story of 35 years of pioneering the land of Israel in Gush Katif and to allow an insight as to what life was in Gush Katif.&quot;

==Controversy over occupation status==
The United Nations, international human rights organizations and many legal scholars regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel. The International Court of Justice reaffirmed this position, stating that the occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip are unlawful and its discriminatory laws and policies against Palestinians violate the prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid. The ICJ rejected the claim that Gaza was no longer occupied following the 2005 disengagement, on the basis of Israel&#x27;s continued control over the Gaza Strip.

In Jaber Al-Bassiouni Ahmed v. The Prime Minister, the Israeli Supreme Court assumed that occupation had ended with the disengagement but did not explain the theory or facts that led to this conclusion. After the disengagement, Israel claimed that its occupation of Gaza had ended, but also acknowledged that Gaza was not a sovereign state. It labeled Gaza as a &quot;hostile entity,&quot; a status that neither grants Palestinians the right to self-governance and self-protection, nor obliges Israel to protect Gaza&#x27;s civilian population. Israel uses this argument to deny Palestinians of full self-governance as well as the use of military force to suppress any resistance to Israeli control.

Following the withdrawal, Israel continued to maintain direct control over Gaza&#x27;s air and maritime space, six of Gaza&#x27;s seven land crossings, maintains a no-go buffer zone within the territory, controls the Palestinian population registry, and Gaza remains dependent on Israel for its water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities.

Some argue that Gaza is not occupied given that Israel does not have &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in the territory (permanently). The European Court of Human Rights made a similar argument in the case of Nagorno-Karabach. Cuyckens argues that such a requirement would allow the occupying power &quot;to easily escape the obligations otherwise imposed upon it under the law of occupation by avoiding placing troops on the ground while nevertheless controlling the territory concerned from the outside.&quot; However, she agrees that Gaza is no longer occupied – &quot;Gaza is not technically occupied, given that there is no longer any effective control in the sense of Article 42 of the Hague Regulations.&quot; Yoram Dinstein argues that &quot;the Occupying Power must deploy boots on the ground in or near the territory&quot; but that the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip can be at most seen as a &quot;partial withdrawal&quot;, since Israel continues to occupy the West Bank. Dinstein argues that the occupation of the Gaza Strip has not ended and that Israel&#x27;s insistence on its liberty to retake any section of the Gaza Strip militarily is a testament to that fact. Yuval Shany argues that Israel is probably not an occupying power in Gaza under international law, writing that &quot;it is difficult to continue and regard Israel as the occupying power in Gaza under the traditional law of occupation&quot;. In 2024, Shany reaffirmed that &quot;Indeed, control for purposes of a determination of belligerent occupation does not require the continual presence of the army everywhere within the territory.&quot; Rubin argues that regardless of the conditions imposed by Israel after disengagement, the occupation ended after Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip.”

== Reception ==

===Pro and against withdrawal===
The Disengagement Plan was also criticized by both Israelis and other observers from the opposite viewpoint as an attempt to make permanent the different settlements of the West Bank, while the Gaza Strip was rendered to the Palestinian National Authority as an economically uninteresting territory with a Muslim population of nearly 1.4 million, seen as a &quot;threat&quot; to the Jewish identity of the Israeli democratic state. As Leila Shahid, speaker of the PNA in Europe declared, the sole fact of carrying out the plan unilaterally already showed that the plan was only thought of according to the objectives of Israel as viewed by Sharon. Brian Cowen, Irish Foreign Minister and speaker of the European Union (EU), announced the EU&#x27;s disapproval of the plan&#x27;s limited scope in that it did not address withdrawal from the entire West Bank. He said that the EU &quot;will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.&quot; However, Europe has given tentative backing to the Disengagement plan as part of the road map for peace. Critics pointed out that, at the same time that Sharon was preparing the withdrawal, he was favoring settlements in the West Bank, among them Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, the largest Israeli settlement near Jerusalem. According to Peace Now, the number of settlers increased by 6,100 compared with 2004, to reach 250,000 in the West Bank. In an October 6, 2004, interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Dov Weissglass, Sharon&#x27;s chief of staff, declared: &quot;The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process... When you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Disengagement supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians.&quot;

Benjamin Netanyahu resigned from Sharon&#x27;s Cabinet over Israel&#x27;s pullout from Gaza.

===Positions of foreign governments===

====United States====
President George W. Bush endorsed the plan as a positive step towards the road map for peace.

In his May 26, 2005, joint press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, in the White House Rose Garden, President George W. Bush stated his expectations &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the Roadmap Plan. This included an expectation that changes to the 1949 Armistice lines be mutually agreed to and not made unilaterally. In addition, Bush stated his expectation that a two-state solution must ensure contiguity of the West Bank as well as &quot;meaningful linkages&quot; between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

====European Union====
Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), stated on June 10, 2004, his support fo the disengagement as an opportunity to restart the implementation of the Road Map.

The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen (Ireland having Presidency of the EU at the time), announced the European Union&#x27;s disapproval of the plan&#x27;s limited scope in that it does not address withdrawal from the entire West Bank. He said that the EU &quot;will not recognize any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.&quot; However, Europe has given tentative backing to the Disengagement Plan as part of the road map for peace.

====United Nations====
Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, commended on August 18, 2005 what he called Israeli Prime Minister Sharon&#x27;s &quot;courageous decision&quot; to carry through with the painful process of disengagement, expressed the hope that &quot;both Palestinians and Israelis will exercise restraint in this challenging period&quot;, and &quot;believes that a successful disengagement should be the first step towards a resumption of the peace process, in accordance with the Road Map&quot;, referring to the plan sponsored by the diplomatic Quartet – UN, EU, Russia, and the United States – which calls for a series of parallel steps leading to two states living side-by-side in peace by the end of the year.

===Public opinion===

====Israeli opinions====

Polls on support for the plan during the time showed support for the plan in the 50–60% range, and opposition in the 30–40% range. A June 9, 2005, Dahaf Institute/Yedioth Ahronoth poll showed support for the plan at 53%, and opposition at 38%. A June 17, telephone poll published in &quot;Maariv&quot; showed 54% of Israel&#x27;s Jews supporting the plan. A poll carried out by the Midgam polling company, on June 29 found support at 48% and opposition at 41%, but a Dahaf Institute/Yedioth Ahronot poll of the same day found support at 62% and opposition at 31%. A poll conducted the week of July 17 by the Tel Aviv University Institute for Media, Society, and Politics shows that Israeli approval of the disengagement is at 48%; 43% of the respondents believe that Palestinian terrorism will increase following disengagement, versus 25% who believe that terrorism will decline.

On July 25, 2004, the &quot;Human Chain&quot;, a rally of tens of thousands of Israelis to protest against the plan and for a national referendum took place. The protestors formed a human chain from Nisanit (later moved to Erez Crossing because of security concerns) in the Gaza Strip to the Western Wall in Jerusalem a distance of 90 km. On October 14, 2004, 100,000 Israelis marched in cities throughout Israel to protest the plan under the slogan &quot;100 cities support Gush Katif and Samaria&quot;.

On August 10, 2005, in response to calls from Jewish religious leaders, including former Chief Rabbis Avraham Shapira, Ovadia Yosef, and Mordechai Eliyahu, between 70,000 (police estimate) and 250,000 (organizers&#x27; estimate) Jews gathered for a rally centered at the Western Wall in prayer to ask that the planned disengagement be cancelled. The crowds that showed up for the rally overwhelmed the Western Wall&#x27;s capacity and extended as far as the rest of the Old City and surrounding Jerusalem neighborhoods. The prayer rally was the largest of its kind for over 15 years, since the opposition to the Madrid Conference of 1991. On August 11, 2005, between 150,000 (police estimates) and 300,000 (organizers&#x27; estimates) people massed in and around Tel Aviv&#x27;s Rabin Square for an anti-disengagement rally. Organizers called the event &quot;the largest expression of public protest ever held in Israel.&quot; According to a police spokesman, it was one of the largest rallies in recent memory.

A September 15, 2004, survey published in &quot;Maariv&quot; showed that:
*69% supported a general referendum to decide on the plan; 26% thought that approval in the Knesset would be enough.
*If a referendum were to be held, 58% would vote for the disengagement plan, while 29% would vote against it.

Dov Weisglass was quoted in an interview with Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; on October 6, 2004, as saying that the disengagement would prevent a Palestinian state for years to come (see above). This incident has bolstered the position of critics of the plan that Sharon is intentionally trying to scuttle the peace process.

====Palestinian====

On August 8, 2005, &quot;Haaretz&quot; quoted a top Palestinian Authority religious cleric, Sheikh Jamal al-Bawatna, the mufti of the Ramallah district, in a fatwa (a religious edict) banning shooting attacks against Israeli security forces and settlements, out of concern they might lead to a postponement of the pullout. According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, this is the first time that a Muslim cleric has forbidden shooting at Israeli forces.

On August 15, 2005, scenes of delight took place across the Arab world, following the long-ingrained suspicion that the disengagement would not take place.

===Israeli media coverage===
The Israeli media systematically overstated &quot;the threat posed by those opposed to disengagement and emphasiz[ed] extreme scenarios&quot;, according to the Israeli media monitoring NGO Keshev (&quot;Awareness&quot;). Keshev&#x27;s report states that: 

Based on Keshev&#x27;s research, the Israeli print and TV media &quot;relegated to back pages and buried deep in the newscasts, often under misleading headlines&quot; items that &quot;mitigat[ed] the extreme forecasts.&quot; Editors delivered &quot;one dominant, ominous message: The Police Declares High Alert Starting Tomorrow, Almost Like a State of War&quot; Channel 1 (main news headline, August 14, 2005)

&quot;The discrepancy between the relatively calm reality emerging from most stories and the overall picture reflected in the headlines is evident in every aspect of the disengagement story: in the suppression of information about the voluntary collection of weapons held by the settlers in the Gaza Strip; in reporting exaggerated numbers of right-wing protesters who infiltrated the Strip before the evacuation; in misrepresentation of the purpose of settler protest (which was an exercise in public relations, not a true attempt to thwart the disengagement plan); and in playing down coordinated efforts between the Israeli security forces and the settlers.&quot;

The price for this misrepresentation was paid, at least in part, by the settlers, whose public image was radicalized unjustifiably. After the disengagement was completed without violence between Israelis and a sense of unity and pride pervaded society, &quot;the media chose to give Israeli society, and especially its security forces, a pat on the back.&quot;

<text>Damal Krishnaswamy Pattammal () (19 March 1919 – 16 July 2009), popularly known as D. K. Pattammal or DKP, was an Indian Carnatic musician and a playback singer for film songs in Tamil. Pattammal, along with her contemporaries M. S. Subbulakshmi and M. L. Vasanthakumari, are popularly referred to as the female trinity of Carnatic Music. This trio initiated the entry of women into mainstream Carnatic Music. She has been appreciated all over the world by Carnatic music lovers.

==Early life and background==
Pattammal was born in a Brahmin family in Kancheepuram of Tamil Nadu, India. She was named Alamelu, but fondly called &quot;Patta&quot; as a child prodigy. Her father, Damal Krishnaswamy Dikshithar, who was deeply interested in music, inspired her to learn Carnatic music. Her mother, Kanthimathi (Rajammal), although a talented singer herself, was not permitted to sing even for friends or relatives in line with strict orthodox tradition. Despite her orthodox background, Pattammal sang and showed considerable music talent at an early age. Her parents initiated her into devotional singing.

Pattammal did not receive formal training in a systematic manner beginning with the basics. She also did not receive regular gurukula training; in accordance with those times, women, especially from conservative families, were constrained from attending gurukula training. She initially received tuition from an unnamed Telugu-speaking musician, whom she called &quot;Telugu vadyar&quot; or &quot;Telugu teacher&quot;, who also taught her Telugu and Sanskrit. She later learnt music from her mother, some disciples of C Subramanya Pillai (popularly known as Naina Pillai), as well as Rajalakshmi, daughter of Veena Dhanammal. Pattammal also learnt from Ambi Dikshitar, a grandson of prolific composer Muthuswamy Dikshitar. Pattammal subsequently continued learning compositions of Dikshitar from musicologist and former Supreme Court judge, T. L. Venkatarama Iyer. She also studied directly under Papanasam Sivan, a prolific Tamil composer.

As a child, Pattammal sat through Carnatic music concerts, and on returning home, notated the kritis she heard, and key phrases of ragas. Her brothers D. K. Ranganathan, D. K. Nagarajan, and D. K. Jayaraman – later her vocal accompanists, helped her in this task. She also sang simple devotional hymns and songs her father taught her. There was no radio or recorded music which was available in those times.

After she married R. Iswaran in 1939, Pattammal continued her pursuit in music while fulfilling the domestic duties of a traditional housewife, getting up as early as 4am to begin her day.

==Singing career==
At age eight, Pattammal won first prize for singing Thyagaraja&#x27;s &quot;Raksha Bettare&quot; in Bhairavi, at a competition conducted by C Subramanya Pillai (popularly known as Naina Pillai), whom Pattammal admired deeply. According to Pattammal, Naina Pillai would host Thyagaraja Utsavams (festivals dedicated to Tyagaraja) in Kancheepuram every year, and was a veteran in the art of singing Ragam Thanam Pallavi.
In 1929, at age 10, Pattammal gave her first radio performance for Madras Corporation Radio (now known as AIR). In 1933, at age 13, Pattammal gave a full-length public concert at Madras Rasika Ranjani Sabha; she is considered the first woman from a Brahmin-caste family to do so. In the same year, her music was first captured in recording discs by the Columbia Company, as it was then known. One year later, she moved to Chennai to become a regular performer in concerts and gave her first performance at the Mahila Samajam (the Egmore Ladies Club), and won acclaim. She quickly rose to stardom, and her musical career spanned more than 65 years. In 1936, she gave her maiden performance at the Madras Music Academy.

D. K. Pattammal&#x27;s knowledge was encyclopaedic; she was considered as an authority on Muthuswami Dikshitar&#x27;s compositions, and is also known for her renditions of these. She learnt authentic versions of these compositions from Ambi Dikshitar, a descendant of Muthuswami Dikshitar, as well as Justice T. L. Venkatrama Iyer, an authority on Dikshithar&#x27;s compositions. She popularised several Dikshithar&#x27;s compositions in her concerts, and also sang Tiruppugazhs and Tevarams that she learnt from Appadurai Achari. Pattammal also learnt many compositions of Papanasam Sivan, directly from the composer himself. She went on to popularise these compositions of Papanasam Sivan, as well as those of Subramania Bharathiyar, both in film and Carnatic music.

Pattammal started a few revolutionary trends in Carnatic music. She was the first Brahmin woman to have performed this genre of music publicly. Brahmins ranked as the highest in the caste hierarchy prevalent in India in the early 20th century, and society considered it taboo for a Brahmin woman to perform on stage.

Pattammal was also the first woman to have performed Ragam Thanam Pallavi in concerts. Ragam Thanam Pallavi, which was classed as a male stronghold, is the most difficult concert item in Carnatic music, as it calls for great skill and a high degree of concentration to handle the rhythmic complexities involved. Pattammal went further to perform very complex Pallavis in intricate talas (rhythmic cycles); impressing and earning the respect of her male peers, connoisseurs and fellow-musicians. Her singing of pallavis was technically perfect, and aesthetically pleasing. For this reason, she became dubbed &quot;Pallavi Pattammal&quot;. She learnt a few pallavis and compositions from Naina Pillai, and several from Vidyala Narasimhalu Naidu, the nephew of Tirupati Narayanaswami Naidu, a prominent composer of javalis. Today, many female Carnatic musicians perform Ragam Thanam Pallavi as the main item in their concerts.

===Films===
Pattammal was one of the earliest Carnatic musicians to sing in films, and was introduced in this medium by Papanasam Sivan. Although she received many offers to sing for films, she only accepted those that involved devotional or patriotic songs, and declined offers to sing romantic songs. The first film Pattammal sang in was &quot;Thyagabhoomi&quot; (1939). A scene, towards the end of the film, showed a group of freedom fighters marching in a procession, carrying the Indian National Congress party flag, with &quot;Desa Sevai Seyya Vaareer&quot; being sung by Pattammal in the background. The song, written by Kalki (R. Krishnamurthy) and tuned by Papanasam Sivan, highlighted the Freedom Movement and invited people to join. The fame that the film and the song generated led to both being banned by the British government.

Pattammal popularised several patriotic compositions of Subramania Bharathiyar. In &quot;Naam Iruvar&quot; (1947), her renditions of &quot;Vetri Ettu Dhikkum Etta&quot;, and &quot;Aaduvome Pallu-p- Paduvome&quot;, a remarkably prescient creation celebrating a free India, went on to be big hits. In &quot;Raama Raajyam&quot; (1948), Pattammal popularised Subramania Bharathi&#x27;s &quot;Thoondir Puzhvinai-p-pol&quot;, and she made his composition, &quot;Theeradha Vilayattu Pillai&quot;, &quot;Vedhala Ulagam&quot; (1948) a favourite with listeners. Pattammaal&#x27;s singing, along with the dancing of Baby Kamala in the film, made the latter of these especially memorable. In AVM&#x27;s &quot;Vaazhkai (1949 film)&quot;, where Vyjayanthimala was introduced to film acting, Pattammaal sang the nationalist poet&#x27;s &quot;Bharatha Samudhaayam Vaazhgave&quot;. Pattammal also had the rare honour of performing at the foundation-laying ceremony of the Bharathi Memorial at Ettayapuram.

Pattammal sang in other films including &quot;Mahatma Urangaar&quot; (1947), &quot;Pizhaikkum Vazhi&quot; (1948), &quot;Laavanya&quot; (1951). The last song Pattammaal sang in film was at the age of 80 for the Tamil film, &quot;Hey Ram&quot; (2000). Ilaiyaraaja and Kamal Haasan carted recording equipment to her home and had her sing &quot;Vaishnav Janato&quot;, a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi, for the film.
Pattammal was one of the artists in Jana Gana Mana video album composed by A. R. Rahman which was released on 26 January 2000 to mark the 50th year of the Indian Republic. Pattammaal who, at 80, was senior-most among the rest of the other vocal artists in this video album.

===Tours===

Pattammaal has performed in all major states, sabhaas and venues throughout India, as well as numerous destinations around the world, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sri Lanka and other countries.

===Disciples===
Pattammal&#x27;s style of singing attracted many students, foremost among them her younger brother D. K. Jayaraman, who sang with her in several concerts, and who himself received the Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1990.

<doc id="597867" wikidata="Q6473861" url="?curid=597867" title="Laila Harré">
<text>Laila Jane Harré (born 8 January 1966) is a New Zealand former politician and trade unionist. Joining the Labour Party at 15, she left in 1989 to join the left-wing splinter party NewLabour, later the Alliance. She was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 1996 and re-elected in 1999. In her second term, she served as Minister for Women in the Fifth Labour Government, overseeing the introduction of paid parental leave. After long-time leader Jim Anderton split from the Alliance in 2002, Harré replaced him as leader. With the party&#x27;s fortunes in steep decline, it failed to win any seats in that year&#x27;s election.

Harré then worked as a trade unionist for the next decade, including as secretary of the National Distribution Union. She returned to politics as issues director for the Green Party in 2012, but left in 2014. She was then drafted as leader of Kim Dotcom&#x27;s Internet Party, in alliance with the Mana Movement, but resigned after the party failed to win any seats in the 2014 election. She rejoined the Labour Party in 2016, and has remained active as a commentator on politics and current affairs.

==Early life==
Harré&#x27;s father was a social anthropologist, and the family spent a part of her childhood (including some years of primary school) living in Fiji while he studied urbanisation there. Her mother was an actress. After returning to New Zealand, she attended secondary school in Auckland at Auckland Girls&#x27; Grammar, before gaining Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees at the University of Auckland. At university she won the senior prizes for political studies and law and became an anti-nuclear activist.

==Professional life==
After finishing her degree she spent 10 weeks on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border with the &quot;Harry Holland Coffee Picking Brigade&quot; before spending a year working at the United Nations on disarmament issues and as a representative of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. She then worked for some time as a lawyer specialising in industrial relations and employment law, and developing close links to the trade-union movement.

===1982–1996: Labour, NewLabour, and the Alliance===
Harré joined the Labour Party in 1982, representing the youth wing on the party&#x27;s New Zealand Council. She worked in the Beehive as an advisor to disarmament minister Fran Wilde. Throughout her seven-year membership of the party she was a critic of the policies advanced by Roger Douglas, who became Minister of Finance when Labour won the 1984 election. Douglas, an advocate of free-market economics, introduced a programme of radical reforms (often collectively labelled Rogernomics) which alienated many of Labour&#x27;s traditional supporters, including Harré.

In 1989, Harré resigned from the Labour Party. She became a founding member of the NewLabour Party, an organisation started by dissident Labour MP Jim Anderton. NewLabour later joined with several other parties to form the Alliance. She stood for the Alliance nomination to contest the Tamaki by-election in 1992, but was unsuccessful. At the 1992 local-body elections she stood as a candidate for the newly created Auckland Regional Services Trust on the Alliance ticket. Harré was not elected, but polled the highest of unsuccessful candidates. The next year she stood as the Alliance candidate for the Te Atatū electorate in the 1993 election, but was again unsuccessful, coming runner-up to Labour&#x27;s Chris Carter.

===1996–2002: Member of Parliament===

In the 1996 election, which took place under the new MMP electoral system, the Alliance ranked Harré in eighth place on its party list. The Alliance gained a sufficient number of votes for Harré to enter parliament.

After the 1999 election, the Alliance formed a coalition government with Labour (which had by then backed away from many of the policies introduced by Douglas). Harré became Minister for Women&#x27;s Affairs and Minister of Youth Affairs and Associate Minister of Labour and Commerce. She later gained additional responsibilities as Minister of Statistics.

She led the parliamentary campaign for the introduction of paid parental leave from Opposition and as a Minister sponsored the legislation to introduce 12 weeks paid parental leave in 2002. Other causes championed by Harré included legislation protecting the interests of building industry sub-contractors, significant minimum-wage increases and the reduction of age discrimination in the minimum wage. She re-launched the pay-equity debate as Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs, and a campaign to increase annual leave from three weeks to four weeks.

In late 2001, however, the Alliance began to show signs of internal strain. In particular, some members of the party felt that it was losing its independent political identity and failing to differentiate itself from the Labour Party on issues such as free trade, tertiary-education funding and other core areas. The decision of Jim Anderton and a majority of Alliance MPs to back New Zealand&#x27;s involvement in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan brought these tensions to a head, dividing the caucus and separating the parliamentary leadership from the majority in the non-parliamentary party organisation (led by Matt McCarten). Harré, however, aligned herself with the grass-roots party view, and became its &quot;de facto&quot; leader in parliament.

The collapse of the Alliance soon became inevitable, with Anderton and his supporters deciding to contest the 2002 election as a new party (the Progressives). Harré, considered to be the foremost of the MPs who remained behind, was chosen to lead what remained of the Alliance into its election campaign, aiming to at least retain a presence in parliament. Harré herself was seen as the party&#x27;s best chance of keeping a parliamentary seat, having a relatively strong chance of winning the seat of Waitakere. In the election itself, however, Harré placed second, being defeated by Labour&#x27;s Lynne Pillay.

The following year, Harré stepped down as leader of the Alliance, being replaced by Matt McCarten. Harré was still active in the Alliance afterwards and was elected to the party executive at its annual conference in 2003. At the 2004 party conference she chose not to re-contest a position within the Alliance stating that from then on the most pragmatic approach for the Alliance would be to instead support the Greens and Maori Party. She was not aligned to any other political party from 2004 to 2011, but in 2012 accepted a role as issues director of the Green Party.

===2002–2014: Outside parliamentary politics===

From 2002 to 2005, Harré led the industrial work of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, including its successful pay-equity campaign for public-sector nurses. She served as General Secretary of the National Distribution Union from 2005 to 2009, after which she joined the Auckland Transition Agency.
Between 2010 and 2012 Harré worked for the International Labour Organization in Fiji. Subsequently, in 2012 she started work as the inaugural issues director of the Green Party, a position she resigned from in 2013. Harré quit the Green Party in protest to the way that the Greens had handled a rebuffed proposition by the Labour Party for conducting a joint electoral campaign.

Harré co-owns an Auckland restaurant, Ika, which pays a living wage to its staff.

===2014: Internet Party leadership ===
On 29 May 2014, Harré was named as the first leader of New Zealand&#x27;s Internet Party. Vikram Kumar, chief executive of the Internet Party, initially approached her in early 2014 about becoming the party&#x27;s leader, but Harré declined. Kumar encouraged her to meet with Kim Dotcom, a meeting which led to Harré taking the project seriously, and subsequently accepting the offer. On announcing the decision, she stated that she got involved again in politics because she wanted to encourage young people to vote, and to re-connect disenfranchised people with the political system. The party allied with the Mana Party to contest the 2014 election as the Internet MANA Party. Harré had second place on the combined party&#x27;s list.

Following the failure of Internet MANA to enter Parliament, Harré stood back from media view for several weeks before formally announcing she was stepping down as leader of the Internet Party, effective December 2014.

Since the election, Harré has been occasionally writing on New Zealand left-wing blog site &quot;The Daily Blog&quot;, and undertook a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; across New Zealand called &quot;Rethinking the System&quot;. In December 2016, Harré announced she had rejoined the Labour Party 27 years after she left to join NewLabour.

==Personal life==
Harré lives in Te Atatū Peninsula and is married to Barry Gribben. They met through the Labour Party and share an interest in an organic vineyard, a restaurant, and several properties. She also has two children.

Harré was diagnosed with breast cancer, and, because she has a family history of the disease, opted for a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction. She made a full recovery in 2012.

Harré has run several marathons, including the 2013 Boston Marathon, where she was only a few hundred metres away from the terrorist bombing that occurred near the finish line.

Laila Harré is a niece of philosopher and psychologist Rom Harré and the sister of psychologist and environmentalist Niki Harré.

<text>Simon Bisley is a British comic book artist best known for his 1990s work on &quot;ABC Warriors&quot;, &quot;Lobo&quot; and &quot;Sláine&quot;.

==Early life==
Simon Bisley began drawing when he was six years old. He is self-taught, with only a short one-year stay at an art college, saying &quot;I found it very difficult to get any kind of feedback from the art teachers. They weren&#x27;t interested at all in what I was doing, so I became kind of very introverted with regard to my artwork and yeah, I was just all self-taught.&quot;

==Career==
Bisley started his career doing magazine and album covers, his first work being a T-shirt design for heavy metal magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;

Eventually, even though he had no experience in comics strip drawing at the time, he was hired by the magazine &quot;2000 AD&quot; after they saw his interpretations of their magazine characters. According to the Comic Book Database, &quot;while still a student, Bisley did a painting of a robot holding a baby that he sent to the offices of 2000 AD. The image was seen by Pat Mills and inspired him to relaunch the ABC Warriors strip, with Bisley as artist, in 1987&quot;. He started with work on ABC Warriors in 1987, later moving to Sláine and Judge Dredd.

Simon Bisley significantly contributed to the visual and conceptual development of the character Lobo (DC Comics) in the comic book universe. Alan Grant and Keith Giffen initially contacted Bisley to rework Lobo&#x27;s appearance. Bisley added distinctive elements such as big biker boots, skull knee guards, a hook and chain around Lobo&#x27;s arm, and made the character much more muscular, transforming him into an impressive space biker.

He also created Lobo&#x27;s dog, “Dawg”, incorporating the character into the story despite it not being in the original script. Bisley&#x27;s tendency to add more than what was written in the script sometimes led Grant to rewrite sections of the book.

Bisley distorted and surreal artistic style, combined with garish colors and crude language, emphasized the character&#x27;s violent and absurd nature. He illustrated the 1990 4 issues mini-series&quot;Lobo: The Last Czarnian&quot;, written by Keith Giffen and Alan Grant, where Lobo, the intergalactic bounty hunter, escorts a mysterious prisoner. Simon Bisley also illustrated the 1992 four-issue mini-series &quot;Lobo&#x27;s Back&quot;, where Lobo is killed and sent to both heaven and hell, only to fight his way back to life. The series is filled with dark humor, over-the-top violence, and Lobo&#x27;s characteristic irreverence.

In addition to his interior artwork, Bisley also produced iconic painted covers that became closely associated with Lobo&#x27;s brutal and offbeat image. 
Originally a minor character, Bisley significantly contributed to the reinvention of Lobo with an anarchic touch that left a lasting impact, making it one of his most iconic contributions to the comic book world.

The original painting for&quot; Lobo&quot; #1 sold for $192,000 at auction in 2021.

Since 1997, Bisley has been a regular contributor to the comics magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.

Bisley has done design work for several music videos, including Chippendales&#x27; &quot;Room Service&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Bisley was commissioned to create artwork for the drum kit used by System of a Down drummer John Dolmayan, an avid comic book collector and vendor. Dolmayan commissioned Bisley to illustrate the Hulk and Thing on one drum, while the art for other drums in the kit, which depicted other characters and scenes, were produced by Kevin Eastman, Tim Vigil, and Arthur Adams.

==Influences==
Bisley&#x27;s style is strongly influenced by Frank Frazetta, Gustav Klimt, Salvador Dalí, and Richard Corben, Bill Sienkiewicz, and Egon Schiele. He also took inspiration from rock album covers and graffiti as well as traditional comics art.

Bisley&#x27;s work influenced the Beast in the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Satan Pit&quot;, and Simon Pegg&#x27;s character graphic artist Tim Bisley on the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;.

<text>Lyn 1896 Fotballklubb () is a Norwegian football club and a department of the sports club Ski- og Fotballklubben Lyn based in Oslo, whose members also participate in Nordic skiing and orienteering. Until 2010, SFK Lyn had two football departments, one professional section and one amateur section. After the professional football department, FK Lyn, was bankrupted in 2010, the fans decided to support the amateur department, Lyn Fotball, instead. With the help of some of the old FK Lyn players, Lyn Fotball has won three consecutive promotions, and are playing in the 2. divisjon. The team plays its home matches at Bislett Stadium, and the head coach is currently Jan Halvor Halvorsen.

Lyn was founded in 1896 and is one of the oldest football clubs in Norway. They were founding members of the Football Association of Norway in 1902. The club won the top division title in 1964 and 1968 and have won the cup eight times. Lyn was also the initiator of the construction of Ullevaal Stadion, which has served as Norway&#x27;s national stadium since 1927 and was Lyn&#x27;s home ground from 1926 to 2010. Lyn has traditionally been perceived as representing the upper and middle classes, whereas the eastside club Vålerenga was seen as belonging to the workers.

The club enjoyed some success during the first half of the 20th century, securing many cup titles, and despite failing to win the league title, had a certain stature in Norwegian football. The Norway national football team that won the bronze medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics included six players from Lyn. The captain of this team was Lyn-player Jørgen Juve, who is still the player with the most goals scored for the Norway national team. The club&#x27;s most recent period of success was during the 1960s, when they won four trophies and reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Lyn also fields a women&#x27;s team, which in 2012 won promotion to the 1. divisjon, the second tier in women&#x27;s football. In 2017 the women&#x27;s team, managed by Glenn Kleven, won promotion to the Toppserien, the top tier of women&#x27;s football in Norway.

== History ==

=== Early success ===
Lyn was founded on 3 March 1896 at St. Hanshaugen. Lyn was one of three clubs who in 1902 founded the Football Association of Norway, and is the only one still existing. In the first decade of Football in Norway, the club was one of the strongest and won four consecutive Norwegian Cups from 1908 until 1911. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, six Lyn-players, Arne Brustad, Øivind Holmsen, Fredrik Horn, Magnar Isaksen, Jørgen Juve and Frithjof Ulleberg, represented the Norway national football team that won the bronze medal, with Juve as the team&#x27;s captain. Jørgen Juve is still the player with the most goals scored for the Norway national team.

Lyn also won the cup in 1945 and 1946 but had to wait until 1964 for their first league-title. With Harald Berg and Ola Dybwad-Olsen as main contributors the club secured another victory in the cup in 1967, and in 1968 the club won The Double, clinching both the League title and the Cup, and became the first team from Norway to reach the quarter-final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they met Barcelona. Because of the weather conditions during the winter in Norway, both matches were played in Spain. Lyn lost the first game 2-3 and in the second match Lyn was leading 2–0 with 15 minutes left to play. The match ended 2-2 and thus Lyn was eliminated.

The Double was followed by a dismal period in the club&#x27;s history. The club was relegated in 1969, and even though the team was promoted back after one year and reached the cup final in 1970, the club was again relegated in 1973. During the next 30 years, Lyn was swiftly relegated and promoted between the first and the third tier and the club was never playing in the top division for more than three consecutive seasons. During this period the fan base eroded and Lyn is said to have lost a generation of supporters.

During the 90s the club went back and forth between the Premier League and the First Division. In 1994, Lyn reached the Norwegian Cup final but lost 2–3 to Molde.

=== The Brynestad-period ===
Norwegian investor Atle Brynestad bought the club in 1999, in effect saving it from bankruptcy. In 2000, the team was promoted to the Premier League, after winning the First Division with an unprecedented number of points, and they retained their spot in the top flight the following year. In the 2002-season a strengthened Lyn took the lead early on and had gained a large advantage halfway through the season, but had to settle for a 3rd-place finish after a disastrous slump in form and the controversial appointment of new head coach, Hrvoje Braović. The misery, in part due to the constant hiring and firing of coaches, continued into the next year. Lyn struggled at the bottom of the table for most of the season but avoided relegation thanks to the efforts of team captain Tommy Berntsen, who took on the role as coach after Teitur Thordarson, the 5th coach in two years, had resigned. 2004 was a recovery year for Lyn, ending the season in 6th place and reaching the Norwegian Cup final (lost to Brann).
2005 was an eventful year for the club, both on and off the pitch. The club&#x27;s youth program was beginning to bear fruits and with former international Henning Berg as the new head coach the club claimed 3rd spot in the league. Lyn defeated Rosenborg at Ullevaal for the first time since 1968 and repeated the feat in the away game.

In April, the club&#x27;s talented Nigerian midfielder Mikel John Obi signed a contract with Manchester United, and according to a statement by Lyn&#x27;s managing director Morgan Andersen, it was the most expensive transfer in Norwegian football to date. The transfer has since been the source of a heated dispute, and Mikel instead joined Chelsea after a long period of time. FIFA released an announcement stating that Lyn had done everything correct in the process. The transfer is said to have cost Chelsea £16 million. £12 million of this to Manchester United and £4 million to Lyn.

=== Bankruptcy ===
On 10 October 2008, Chelsea announced on their website that they were initiating legal proceedings against Lyn Oslo and their former director Morgan Andersen in an attempt to recover the entire £16 million fee paid. Chelsea maintain that this was due to the contract of the original transfer being based on a fraudulent misrepresentation.

In 2007, the club sold Nigerian international Chinedu Obasi to TSG Hoffenheim for an expected €5 million.

The 2009 season was again very disappointing with the club relegated from Tippeligaen and saved from liquidation at the last moment.

The 2010 season saw Lyn at Bislett Stadium (sharing with Skeid) in the second level of Norway football. In April 2010 Idar Vollvik&#x27;s company, Ludo, was presented as the club&#x27;s latest sponsor in an attempt to rescue the club from its financial crisis, but to no avail, and on 30 June 2010, the club declared bankruptcy.

=== Recent years ===
Following the bankruptcy, Lyn&#x27;s fans gathered around the club&#x27;s surviving team in the 6. divisjon (seventh tier) for the remainder of the 2010 season moving their home games to Frogner Stadion, drawing large crowds to their home games. In late 2010, Lyn club paid all debt associated with the reserves team of the bankrupt top-flight club. The football association then awarded Lyn the licence formerly held by the reserves, allowing the club to play the 2011 season in the Fourth Division. Led by Finn Bredo Olsen, Lyn secured promotion to the 3. divisjon, after a perfect season with no losses or draws. On 30 September 2012, Lyn secured promotion to the 2. divisjon, after beating Lommedalen 9–0 in front of 2,113 spectators at Frogner Stadion. But, in 2015, Lyn was relegated to the 3. divisjon after three seasons and the unsuccessful attempts to promote to the 1. divisjon.
After 6 seasons in the 3. divisjon, Lyn got promoted to the 2. divisjon in 2022. The next season they got promoted to the 1. divisjon for the first time since 2010.

== Colours and badge ==

Lyn&#x27;s home colours are red and white shirts and blue shorts. The shirts have red sleeves and a red front with a broad, vertical white bar in the middle, which is traditionally twice as wide as the sides (a 25-50-25 red-white-red pattern). The back has the same pattern, with inverted colours.

During the first years the club had two kits, one with blue and white horizontally striped jerseys and white shorts, and a red kit in the same fashion. These were used interchangeably up until at least 1906. It is unclear exactly when the current kit was adopted, but it was in use by the time Lyn had claimed their first Norwegian Cup in 1908. The socks have traditionally been red. White socks have also been used, most recently from the beginning of the 1990s until 2004, when the red socks were brought back.

The club uses an all-blue away kit, though several different colours have been used in the past.

The current club badge is a modified version of a design originally introduced in 1900. It was made by one of the first members of the club, Leif Eriksen, and replaced a silver badge from 1898. The crest features a football in the upper left corner and a pair of skis in the lower right corner, representing the two major sports of the club. While the badge is based on the heraldic shield form of the old coat of arms of Norway, Eriksen was probably not himself familiar with the rules of heraldic design. The name of the club and the date and year of its founding were written in gold on a white background, violating the so-called rule of tincture. Also, the date and year were written in different styles. The badge has therefore been altered twice, in 1996 and finally in 2001. On the current badge the date has been removed and replaced by &quot;18 LYN 96&quot; in red writing on a white background.

== Stadium ==
After the 2009 season FC Lyn made the decision to move from Ullevaal Stadion to Bislett Stadium. Bislett, which is also an international track and field stadium, has a capacity of 15,400.
Following the bankruptcy in 2010, Lyn&#x27;s fans gathered around the club&#x27;s surviving team moving their home games to Frogner Stadion, which has a capacity of 4,000. In 2014 Lyn moved back to Bislett Stadium.

<text>Paphos, also spelled as Pafos, is a coastal city in southwest Cyprus and the capital of Paphos District. In classical antiquity, two locations were called Paphos: Old Paphos, today known as Kouklia, and New Paphos. It is the fourth-largest city in the country, after Nicosia, Limassol and Larnaca, with an urban population of 63,600 in 2018.

The current city of Paphos lies on the Mediterranean coast, about west of Limassol (the biggest port on the island), both of which are connected by the A6 highway. Paphos International Airport is the country&#x27;s second-largest airport, and is a gateway to western and southern Cyprus. The city has a subtropical-Mediterranean climate, with the mildest temperatures on the island.

In 1980, Paphos was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its ancient architecture, mosaics, and ancient religious importance. It was selected as a European Capital of Culture for 2017 along with Aarhus.

== Geography ==
Paphos is the most active seismic region in Cyprus based on the historical data of events with evidence of a number of strong earthquakes, some of which caused severe damage, loss of life and tsunamis. The strongest earthquakes which hit Paphos, occurred in 76 AD, 1222 (7.0–7.5), 1953 (6.5 ), 1995 (5.9 ), 1996 (6.8 ) and 2022 (6.6 ).

==History==
===Foundation myth===
In the founding myth, the town&#x27;s name is linked to the goddess Aphrodite, as the eponymous Paphos was the son (or, in Ovid, daughter) of Pygmalion whose ivory cult image of Aphrodite was brought to life by the goddess as &quot;milk-white&quot; Galatea.

The author of &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; gives the genealogy. Pygmalion was so devoted to the cult of Aphrodite that he took the statue to his palace and kept it on his couch. The &quot;daimon&quot; of the goddess entered into the statue, and the living Galatea bore Pygmalion a son, Paphos, and a daughter, Metharme. Cinyras, debated as to if he is the son of Paphos or Metharme&#x27;s suitor, founded the city under Aphrodite&#x27;s patronage and built the great temple to the goddess there. According to another legend preserved by Strabo (xi. p. 505), it was founded by the Agapenor, a hero of the Trojan wars.

===Old Paphos===
Old Paphos (&quot;Palaepaphos&quot;), now known as Kouklia (; or ; ) (Engel, &quot;Kypros&quot;, vol. i. p. 125), is on a hill to the east of the modern city. It had a road which spanned a few miles to the sea. It was not far from the Zephyrium promontory and the mouth of the Bocarus stream.

Archaeology shows that Old Paphos has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. It was a centre for Aphrodite&#x27;s cult. Aphrodite&#x27;s mythical birthplace was on the island. The founding myth is interwoven with the goddess such that Old Paphos became the most famous and important place for worshipping Aphrodite in the ancient world.

The Greek names of two ancient kings, &quot;Etevandros&quot; and &quot;Akestor&quot;, are attested in Cypriot syllabary on objects of seventh century BC found in Kourion.

=== Aphrodite and Paphos ===
The Greeks agreed that Aphrodite had landed at the site of Paphos when she rose from the sea. According to Pausanias (i. 14), although her worship was introduced to Paphos from Syria, it was much more likely that it was of Phoenician origin. Before being proven by archaeology it was thought that Aphrodite&#x27;s cult had been established before the time of Homer (c. 700 BC), as the grove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos are mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (viii. 362). Archaeology established that Cypriots venerated a fertility goddess in a cult that combined Aegean and eastern mainland aspects before the arrival of the mainland Greeks. Female figurines and charms found in the immediate vicinity date back to the early third millennium. The temenos was well established before the first structures were erected in the Late Bronze Age:
Old Paphos was the centre of worshipping Aphrodite for the whole Aegean world. The Cinyradae, or descendants of Cinyras, were the chief priests; Greek by name but of Phoenician origin. Their power and authority were great, but it may be inferred from certain inscriptions that they were controlled by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was also an oracle here. Few cities have ever been so much sung and glorified by the poets. The ruins of Aphrodite&#x27;s vast sanctuary are still discernible, its circumference marked by huge foundation walls. After its destruction by an earthquake it was rebuilt by Vespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as well as on earlier and later ones, and in the style on those of Septimius Severus. From these representations and the existing ruins, Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, an architect of Copenhagen, has attempted to restore the building.

===New Paphos===

New Paphos (&quot;Nea Paphos&quot;) was founded on the sea near a natural harbour. It lay about 60 stadia or 12 km northwest of the old city. It also had a founding myth: it was said to have been founded by Agapenor, chief of the Arcadians at the siege of Troy, who, after the capture of the city, was driven out by the storm that separated the Greek fleet onto the coast of Cyprus. (Pausanias viii. 5. § 2.) An Agapenor was mentioned as king of the Paphians in a Greek distich preserved in the Analecta; and Herodotus (vii. 90) alludes to an Arcadian &quot;colony&quot; in Cyprus.

In reality, it was probably founded by Nicocles (d. 306 BC), the last king of Palaepaphos, based on an inscription recording his founding of the temple of Artemis Agrotera at Nea Paphos. The inhabitants of Marion were probably also transferred to this new city after its destruction in 312 BC by Ptolemy. A hoard of unused silver coins (in the Cyprus museum) found under the Hellenistic House dating back to the end of the 4th century BC are the earliest find at the site and indicates its founding date.

Old Paphos always retained the pre-eminence in worship of Aphrodite, and Strabo states that the road leading to it from New Paphos was annually crowded with male and female votaries travelling to the ancient shrine, and coming not only from the New Paphos, but also from other towns of Cyprus. When Seneca said (&quot;N. Q.&quot; vi. 26, Epistle 91) that Paphos was nearly destroyed by an earthquake, it is difficult to say to which of the towns he refers. Dio Cassius (liv. 23) relates that it was restored by Augustus, and called &quot;Augusta&quot; in his honor; but though this name has been preserved in inscriptions, it never supplanted the ancient one in popular use.

An inscription from the 80s BC speaks of a certain Onesander of Paphos being appointed to the Great Library of Alexandria.
According to the biblical &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, after landing at Salamis and proclaiming the Word of God in the synagogues, the prophets and teachers, Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus, traveled along the entire southern coast of the island of Cyprus until they reached Paphos. There, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted after Saul rebuked the Sorcerer Elymas. In Paphos, Acts first identifies Saul as Paul.

Tacitus (&quot;Hist.&quot; ii. 2, 3) records a visit of the youthful Titus to Paphos before he acceded to the empire, who inquired with much curiosity into its history and antiquities. (Cf. Suetonius &quot;Titus&quot; c. 5.) Under this name the historian included the ancient as well as the more modern city: and among other traits of the worship of the temple he records that the only image of the goddess was a pyramidal stone.

The sanctuary was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

===Archaeology===

Paphos Archaeological Park covers most of the ancient Greek and Roman City and is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its ancient ruins.

The most significant remains so far discovered are four large and elaborate Roman villas: the House of Dionysos, the House of Orpheus, the House of Aion and the House of Theseus, all with preserved mosaic floors. In addition, excavations have uncovered an Agora, Asklepion, the Basilica of Panagia Limeniotissa, a theatre, and a necropolis known as the Tombs of the Kings.

===Post-Classical history===

Paphos gradually lost much of its attraction as an administrative centre, particularly after the founding of Nicosia. The city and its port continued to decline throughout the Middle Ages and Ottoman rule, as Nicosia, and the port city of Larnaca became more important.

The city and district continued to lose population throughout the British colonial period and many of its inhabitants moved to Limassol, Nicosia and overseas. The city and district of Paphos remained the most underdeveloped part of the island until 1974.

===Modern Paphos===
Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, there was rapid economic activity in all fields, especially tourism in the Kato Paphos area. The government invested heavily in irrigation dams and water distribution works, road infrastructure and the building of Paphos International Airport, the second international airport in Cyprus.

In the 1980s, Kato Paphos received most of the investment. In the 1990s, Coral Bay Resort was further developed and in the 2000s, the Aphrodite Hills resort was developed.

Today Paphos, with a population of about 35,961 (), is a popular tourist resort and is home to a fishing harbour. Ktima is the main residential district while Kato Paphos, by the sea, is built around the medieval port and contains most of the luxury hotels and the entertainment infrastructure of the city. Apostolou Pavlou Avenue (St. Paul&#x27;s Avenue), the busiest road in Paphos, connects two quarters of the city. It begins near the city centre at Kennedy Square and ends outside the medieval fort at the harbour.

==Economy==
The economy of Paphos heavily depends on tourism and there are four resorts in the district: Kato Paphos, Coral Bay, Latchi, and Aphrodite Hills. The largest is Kato Paphos which employs over half of Paphos&#x27; population. Farming, especially banana, grape and tobacco cultivation, contributes significantly to Paphos&#x27; economy.

==Landmarks==

Paphos Castle stands by the harbor, and was originally a Byzantine fort built to protect the harbour. It was rebuilt by the Lusignans in the 13th century before being dismantled in 1570 by the Venetians, who were unable to defend it against the Ottomans who restored and strengthened it after capturing the island. Saranta Kolones, Kato Paphos, near the harbor, is a castle built in the first years of Lusignan rule (beginning of the 12th century) maybe on the site of a previous Byzantine castle. It was destroyed in the earthquake of 1222.

Among the treasures unearthed near Paphos are the mosaics in the Houses of Dionysos, Theseus and Aion, preserved after 16 centuries underground; vaults and caves; the Tombs of the Kings; and the pillar to which Saint Paul was said to have been tied and whipped and the ancient Odeon Theatre. Other places of interest include the Byzantine Museum and the District Archaeological Museum, with its collection of Cypriot antiquities from the Paphos area dating back from the Neolithic Age up to 1700 AD. Near the Odeon are the ruins of the ancient city walls, the Roman Agora, and a building dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine.

The mosaic floors of these elite villas dating from the 3rd to the 5th century are among the finest in the Eastern Mediterranean. They mainly depict scenes from Greek mythology.

The city contains many catacomb sites dating back to the early Christian period. The most famous is Saint Solomoni Church, originally a Christian catacomb retaining some of its 12th century frescoes. A sacred tree at the entrance is believed to cure the ailments of those who hang a personal offering on its branches.

A few kilometres outside the city, the rock of Aphrodite (lit. &quot;Stone of the Greek&quot;) emerges from the sea. According to legend, Aphrodite rose from the waves at this spot. The Greek name, &quot;Petra tou Romiou&quot; is associated with the legendary frontier-guard of Byzantine times, Digenis Acritas, who kept the marauding Saracens at bay. It is said that to repel one attack he heaved a large rock at his enemy.

The site recently had the Aphrodite Hills resort built on it. The resort features a five-star intercontinental resort hotel, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, fitness facilities, holiday villas, apartments, townhouses and the Retreat Spa.

Near Petra tou Romiou is Palaepaphos, Old Paphos, one of the most celebrated places of pilgrimage in the ancient Greek world, and once an ancient city-kingdom of Cyprus. The ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite stand here, dating back as early as 12th century BC. The temple was one of the most important places of Aphrodite&#x27;s cult and pilgrimage of the ancient world until the 3rd–4th centuries AD. The museum, housed in the Lusignan Manor, houses artifacts from the area.

Yeroskipou is a town in Paphos&#x27; metropolitan area known for many years for its delight &#x27;loukoumi&#x27;.

North-east of Paphos lies Ayios Neophytos (St. Neophytos) Monastery, known for its &quot;Encleistra&quot; (Enclosure) carved out of the mountain by the hermit himself, which features some Byzantine frescoes from the 12th and 15th centuries. The painted village church of Emba (Empa) is nearby.

Four kilometres () north of Paphos is the village of Lemba (Lempa), home to numerous artists, many of whom have open studio shops. It is home to the sculpture known as the Great Wall of Lempa by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art.

Off the coast of Paphos is the wreck of M/V &quot;Demetrios II&quot; which ran aground on 23 March 1998 in heavy seas during a voyage from Greece to Syria with a cargo of timber.

Similarly, on 8 December 2011, the EDRO III ran aground off the coast of Cyprus. It is located near the Sea Caves of Paphos on the western shore of the island close to the Akamas Peninsula. Built in the 1960s, registered in Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Edro III is owned by an Albanian shipping company. It was traveling from Limassol, Cyprus to Rhodes when it ran aground. It is still shipwrecked to this day, although its cargo and fuel oil were removed. Local authorities are hesitant to remove the ship from the rocks due to the fact that the coastline is a protected natural park where turtles nest and endemic plant and animal species thrive.

==Climate==
Paphos has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;), closely bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The greatest amounts of rain occur from November to mid-March, while it almost never rains in the summer, with an average of less than in July and August. In these rainless months, however, humidity measurements can go up to 85 percent.

Snowfall occurs rarely approximately every 10 years and does not normally lead to any significant disruption. It occurs almost annually in the hills of Tsada, north. The last significant snowfall in the city centre occurred in the winter of 2001.

Frost is also very rare.

Heatwaves in July and August are relatively common, when hot air masses from the Sahara desert drift over to Cyprus causing temperatures to rise. Cyprus has experienced drought-like conditions and the current trend of global warming may increase the severity of these conditions. In the summer of 2008, Cyprus had to ship water by tanker from Greece to meet demand on the island. Since then, water conditions have eased due to good winter rains.

==Transport==
Paphos was once the only traffic-free town in Cyprus; things changed after the urbanization and rise of the population in less than ten years. The roads in the town centre remain unchanged and are unable to accommodate the new level of traffic. The problems exist because some planned road links remain on paper, including:
* 2nd part of the northern ring road
* Western ring road
* Airport road
* Paphos – Coral Bay road upgrade

===Public transport===
Buses in Paphos are operated by Osypa.

For intercity transportation the main operator is Intercity Buses which offers daily connections across all cities in the southern part of Cyprus.

The main bus station is Karavella station. It is the nexus for all intercity routes and many of the local routes. The other major bus station in Paphos is the Kato Paphos Harbor station, located close to Paphos Harbor and the Paphos Archaeological Park.

===Motorways===
Paphos did not have a motorway link until 2001. It is now accessed through the A6 which connects Paphos with Limassol. The A7 motorway from Paphos to Polis was to have been completed by 2013, though work has not started yet due to the financial crisis in Cyprus. The works are undergoing as of August 2023.

===Airport===

Since 1982, air traffic of Paphos is served by Paphos International Airport located southeast of the city, near Timi. It serves approximately 1.75 million people every year. A new terminal opened in late 2008 adjacent to the old one.

===Port===
The port is able to hold 300 boats and serves as a small marina and a fisherman shelter. The castle&#x27;s square hosts Aphrodite&#x27;s festival every September since 1998. Several other yearly events are hosted in the square, including the Paphos beer festival. Cargo and cruise ships use the Limassol Port away. A marina is planned to be constructed north, next to Coral Bay in Kissonerga. The new marina will serve up to 1,000 boats.

==Hospitals and medical centres==
Paphos has only one general hospital located at Anavargos, northeast of the city centre. It was built to replace the old hospital, which was demolished shortly after being abandoned; now, it is a modern medical centre. There was consideration that it might be turned into a university hospital when Neapolis University was opened; as of July 2017, this has not transpired.

There are two hospices in the area: The Friends Hospice and the Archangel Michael Hospice, which is funded by the Catholic Church in Cyprus.

There are also several private clinics spread throughout the area, such as St George&#x27;s Private Hospital, built in 1991.

==Education==
The Paphos municipality has 38 primary state schools, 8 secondary state schools (known as gymnasiums and lyceums), 3 privately run English schools and one privately run Russian school. First elementary school in Paphos was founded in 1796, in village Kritou Terra.

===Higher education===
The town of Paphos has one higher education institute that began accepting students in June 2010. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and consists of 4 schools. Soon, American University of Beirut is going to finish constructions of new Paphos filial.

==Arts==
Paphos is known for its cultural and historical interests, including the Tomb of the Kings, Mosaics, castle and numerous churches, though it is also popular for its festivals and annual events.

During September, Paphos holds an annual opera at the Paphos&#x27; Aphrodite Festival at the harbor. The castle serves as a backdrop and stage for the performance. Another annual event is Open Studios Cyprus which takes place during selected weekends in October. Selected artists open their studio doors to the general public and provide an informal environment to view and discuss the work with the artist.

There are a number of privately owned galleries and exhibition spaces. Details and dates for the regular events can be found in the local English newspapers, such as Cyprus Weekly and Cyprus Monthly. Palia Ilektriki is an exhibition and conference space maintained by the Paphos Municipality. In the centre of the town, this converted plays host to both conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, Open Studios Cyprus used this location to launch the event with an Opening Art Exhibition.

In 2012, Paphos won the title as European Capital of Culture 2017, under the Executive Direction of Ektor Tsatsoulis and the Artistic Director Spyros Pisinos. In 2013, Marios Joannou Elia became the artistic director of &quot;Pafos 2017&quot;. Following the financial crisis on the island in 2013, Elia redesigned and recalculated the entire programme.

==Pafos 2017-European Capital of Culture==
Paphos held the title of the European Capital of Culture for the year 2017 alongside Aarhus, Denmark. This was a great opportunity for the town to evolve, develop and attract more tourists to discover the true beauty of Pafos. The few years before 2017 many improvements were made around town and everyone was preparing for the honorable title. It started off with the Opening Ceremony that gave the chance for many artistic people to shine such as modern and contemporary dance groups, the Music School of Pafos and last but not least Alkistis Protopsalti. During that year, multiple cultural events, such as the Europakonzert 2017 featuring the Berliner Philarmoniker and the famous Yamato Taiko Drum Ensemble performance, took place across the town of Paphos each month. The program had a huge diverse group of volunteers that contributed greatly on the events. Pafos after its magnificent Closing Ceremony in December 2017, where Giannis Kotsiras and Yasmin Levi have performed, has officially passed on the baton of the title of European Capital of Culture to Valletta in Malta and Leeuwarden in the Netherlands.

==Sports==
Paphos has a long history in sports with several football, basketball, volleyball teams, including Pafos FC. The Pafian gymnastic club is called Korivos, and it owns (via the Cyprus Athletic Organisation) the local Aphroditi Sports hall and the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium, named after Stylianos Kyriakides (; 1910–1987), a marathon runner from the nearby village Statos, who won the 1946 Boston Marathon. According to a newspaper report, he was running with John Kelley near the end, when an old man shouted from the crowd, &quot;For Greece, for your children!&quot;, inspiring him to pull away and win the race.

Paphos was home to Turkish Cypriot sport team Baf Ülkü Yurdu. After the intercommunal conflict and Turkish invasion Baf Ülkü Yurdu relocated to Morphou.

<doc id="597879" wikidata="Q913813" url="?curid=597879" title="Plum-headed parakeet">
<text>The plum-headed parakeet (Psittacula cyanocephala) is a species of parakeet in the family Psittacidae. It is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and was once thought to be conspecific with the blossom-headed parakeet (&quot;P. roseata&quot;) before being elevated to a full species. Plum-headed parakeets are found in flocks, the males having a pinkish purple head and the females, a grey head. They fly swiftly with twists and turns accompanied by their distinctive calls.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the plum-headed parakeet in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in India. He used the French name &quot;Le perruche a teste bleu&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Psittaca cyanocephalos&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the plum-headed parakeet. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus cyanocephalus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;cyanocephalus/cyanocephala&quot; combines the Ancient Greek words &quot;dark-blue&quot; and &quot;-headed&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; which was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800.

== Description ==
The plum-headed parakeet is a mainly green parrot, 33 cm long with a tail up to 22 cm. The male has a red head which shades to purple-blue on the back of the crown, nape and cheeks, while the female has a blueish-gray head. There is a narrow black neck collar with verdigris below on the nape and a black chin stripe that extends from the lower mandible. There is a red shoulder patch and the rump and tail are bluish-green, the latter tipped white. The upper mandible is orangish-yellow, and the lower mandible is dark. The female has a dull bluish grey head and lacks the black and verdigris collar, which is replaced by yellow. The upper-mandible is corn-yellow and there is no black chin stripe or red shoulder patch. Immature birds have a green head and both mandibles are yellowish. The dark head is acquired after a year. The delicate bluish red appearance resembling the bloom of a peach is produced by a combination of blue from the optical effects produced by the rami of the feather and a red pigment in the barbules.

Some authors have considered the species to have two subspecies, the nominate from peninsular India (type locality restricted to Gingee) and the population from the foothills of the Himalayas as &quot;bengalensis&quot; on the basis of the colour of the head in the male which is more red and less blue. Newer works consider the species to be monotypic.

The different head colour and the white tip to the tail distinguish this species from the similar blossom-headed parakeet (&quot;P. roseata&quot;). The shoulder patch is maroon coloured and the shorter tail is tipped yellow in &quot;P. roseata&quot;.

A supposed species of parakeet, the so-called intermediate parakeet &quot;Psittacula intermedia&quot; is thought to be a hybrid of this and the slaty-headed parakeet (&quot;P. himalayana&quot;).
== Habitat and distribution ==
The plum-headed parakeet is a bird of forest and open woodland, even in city gardens. They are found from the foothills of the Himalayas south to Sri Lanka. They are not found in the dry regions of western India. They are sometimes kept as pets and escaped birds have been noted in New York, Florida and in some places in the Middle East.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The plum-headed parakeet is a gregarious and noisy species with a range of raucous calls. The usual flight and contact call is repeated now and then. The flight is swift, and the bird often twists and turns rapidly. It makes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit and blossoms which make up its diet. They feed on grains, fruits, the fleshy petals of flowers (&quot;Salmalia&quot;, &quot;Butea&quot;) and sometimes raid agricultural fields and orchards. The breeding season in India is mainly from December to April, and July to August in Sri Lanka. Courtship includes bill rubbing and courtship feeding. It nests in holes, chiselled out by the pair, in tree trunks, and lays 4–6 white eggs. The female appears to be solely responsible for incubation and feeding. They roost communally. In captivity, it can learn to mimic beeps and short whistling tunes, and can talk very well.

&quot;Neoaulobia psittaculae&quot;, a quill mite, has been described from the species. A species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot;, &quot;H. handai&quot;, has been described from blood samples from the plum-headed parakeet.

== History ==
Ctesias of Cnidus, a 5th-century BC Greek physician to the emperor Artaxerxes II, who ruled the Achaemenid Empire, accompanied Artaxerxes on his 401 BC campaign against his brother Cyrus the Younger. He was author of the lost &quot;Indica&quot;, a description of India which he wrote based on his experience in Persia and information he gathered from Persian accounts. Fragments of the &quot;Indica&quot; were preserved by Photius of Constantinople in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; in the 9th century AD; one of these has been identified as describing &quot;Psittacula cyanocephala&quot; and its abilities as a talking bird. It is likely Ctesias saw the bird himself, with an Indian handler; though his description could also apply to &quot;Psittacula roseata&quot;, that species is native to areas far further east and is much less likely candidate in Greater Iran. In his summary of Ctesias, Photius wrote:

<text>Popstars Live was an Australian music talent show television program similar to &quot;Australian Idol&quot; that aired on the Seven Network in early 2004. It was an evolution of the original &quot;Popstars&quot; TV show which aired between 2000 and 2002 on Seven. The show spawned a single and album that made the ARIA charts in April that year.

&quot;Popstars Live&quot; premiered on the Seven Network in February 2004. It was scheduled to run for 16 weeks and was originally slated to air on Sunday and Wednesday nights. During its short run &quot;Popstars Live&quot; had a troubled history, with two key personnel, Christine Anu and John Paul Young, leaving the program in April 2004 while others have publicly expressed their own concerns about the show. The show was also a ratings failure.

==Origins==
&quot;Popstars Live&quot; was based on the original &quot;Popstars&quot;, a reality television program that was broadcast on the Seven Network between 2000 and 2002. The aim of that program was to select members for a group or a solo singer and follow the process of recording a single and/or album and the subsequent promotion of the record made by the artists.

The Australian TV show saw the creation of three acts which enjoyed initial success:

* Bardot (2000) a girl group number one single and album;
* Scandal&#x27;us (2001) a mixed pop group, number one single, number two album;
* Scott Cain (2002) a male singer, number one single.

While the first season of &quot;Popstars&quot; was one of the most popular programs on Australian television in 2000, its popularity steadily declined in later seasons. In 2003, the Seven Network rested the concept. However, the success of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, a show that became the most popular program on Australian television that year, soon led to the Seven Network revisiting the &quot;Popstars&quot; format.

Record sales for &quot;Idol&quot; contestants also played a role in the resurrection of &quot;Popstars&quot; with &quot;Australian Idol&quot; winner Guy Sebastian releasing an album &quot;Just as I Am&quot; that went six times platinum in Australia and runner up Shannon Noll&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot; striking up sales of five times platinum. Hoping to emulate the success of BMG Records, which had signed on Sebastian and Noll, Universal Music quickly signed up for the new series.

==Format==
The first five episodes featured the selection of the finalists by the judges. The finalists would then sing live in front of an audience with one finalist being eliminated each week until the final winner is selected. The program aimed to attract a large proportion of voters under 25, a similar as &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.

==Cast==

The &quot;Popstars&quot; Team consisted of:

* Luke Jacobz host;
* Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum judge;
* Christine Anu judge;
* Shauna Jensen judge;
* Tania Doko artist mentor;
* John Paul Young artist mentor;

The judges initially said that they would offer constructive criticism to the contestants unlike the strong and sometimes personal criticism offered by Mark Holden and Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson of rival series Australian Idol.

==Finalists==

The finalists were (in order of elimination):
* Tarryn Wall
* Renee Simone
* Kiki Courtidis
* Don Pancho
* Daniel Hamill

* Miranda Murphy, from Perth, Western Australia. On 12 July 2004, her debut single, &quot;That Girl&quot; debuted at number 19 on the Australian singles charts on 22 July 2004. After an unusually lengthy hiatus from the music scene, and a general lack of activity, it is widely suspected she has been dropped by her record company, due to poor single sales, and a national declining interest in &#x27;bubblegum pop&#x27; products of talent quest programs. She now works at &quot;Jaanz school of singing&quot;.
* Kayne Taylor, from Melbourne, Victoria who won the 2004 Australian season.

Contestants &quot;Bunny and Xy&quot; were axed from the program in controversial circumstances. Kayne Taylor ended up winning altogether, defeating Miranda Murphy in the final.

==Reception and controversies==
The first live performance attracted disappointing ratings when broadcast, attracting only 850,000 in Australian mainland capitals, finishing behind &quot;American Idol&quot; on Network Ten and shows on the Nine Network. David Leckie, the managing director of the Seven Network, blamed the disappointing ratings on what he considered to be the bland comments of the judges and pressured the producers to ensure that the judges made stronger comments.

Christine Anu refused to offer harsh criticism of the contestants resigning in April 2004. In a statement issued on her departure, she said: &quot;I chose to play a positive role model and wanted to encourage these young people in their endeavours, rather than criticise them. Although leaving &quot;Popstars Live&quot; was a difficult decision for me to make, I do feel somewhat relieved that I can now focus on my music.&quot; John Paul Young was sacked although the producers claimed that his contract had finished.

Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum and Tania Doko were also criticising elements of the program in the media in early April. Trevor Steel, a UK record producer and the former lead singer of eighties pop group The Escape Club, was brought in by Universal Music as a replacement judge to offer stronger criticism of contestants.

Ratings for &quot;Popstars Live&quot; continued to decline for the next episode. With 2003 Australian ratings blockbuster &quot;The Block&quot; due to commence its 2004 season on the Nine Network and &quot;American Idol&quot; performing well on Network Ten, the Seven Network executives shifted the program from Sunday night to Saturday night and scheduled wildlife documentaries to fill the slot. As Saturday night is the night of the week when the fewest people watch television in Australia and when members of the target audience for &quot;Popstars Live&quot; are most likely to go out, this shift was widely perceived as an admission of defeat by network executives. The Saturday night program was dropped altogether a few episodes later, leaving only the Wednesday program.

==Album==
Universal Music released an album &quot;Popstars Live: The Finalists&quot; featuring the finalists singing versions of well-known songs. The first single &quot;Stand Up Next to Me&quot; features the finalists singing on the track.

===Sales Performance===
In their first week of sales from 5 April 2004, the single barely made the Australian Top 50 and the album could only debut at number 61. Although Universal Music shipped enough copies of both the single and the album to stores to achieve gold status in Australia (35,000 copies), the single and the album only sold one thousand copies. The single eventually reached #29 on the charts and the album reached the ARIA Top 50. Kayne Taylor&#x27;s debut single &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; debuted in the top 10 of the Australian charts at the end of June 2004. Runner-up Miranda Murphy also had a debut single &quot;That Girl&quot; released, and it debuted in the top 20 a few weeks after. However, this didn&#x27;t seem to boost the success of &quot;Popstars Live&quot; nor its contestants, with no others releasing singles, nor have Kayne or Miranda released a second single as of November 2004.

This contrasts with the sales success of artists appearing on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and to a lesser extent the original &quot;Popstars&quot;. With the television program being moved to a different timeslot less likely to catch the eyes of potential record buyers and the single failing to attract support of radio, it seems as though the album will disappoint the hopes of Universal Music who would have been hoping to match the success of BMG Records from &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestants.

<doc id="597884" wikidata="Q1271952" url="?curid=597884" title="Blossom-headed parakeet">
<text>The Blossom-headed parakeet, Psittacula roseata or &quot;Himalayapsitta roseata,&quot; is a parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It has a lime green body and a pink or bluish grey-head and is found in Southeast Asia. This species is sometimes also referred to as Rosy-headed parakeet.

==Description==
&quot;Psittacula roseata&quot; is a lime-green parrot, long with a tail up to . It weighs on average 2.9 - 3.1 oz (85 - 90 g).

The male&#x27;s head, cheeks, and ears are pink becoming pale blue towards the back of the crown and nape. There is a narrow black neck collar and a black chin stripe. There is a reddish brown shoulder spot on the inner middle wing coverts. Long, central tail feathers are blue and tipped with pale yellow. Side tail feathers are yellow green and tipped with pale yellow. The upper mandible is orange yellow, and the lower mandible is a dark grey. Eyes are pale yellow.

The female &quot;Psittacula roseata&quot; differs with a pale blue grey head and the black neck collar is instead yellow green. The red shoulder spot is smaller among females, the upper mandible is yellow, and the lower bill is a dark grey.

&quot;Psittacula juneau,&quot; a subspecies, is similar in description to &quot;Psittacula roseata&quot;, except it has a more yellowish plumage and the red wing patch is larger. The central tail feathers are paler in colour and the side tail feathers are yellower.

Immature, juvenile birds have a green head and a grey chin. Both mandibles are yellowish and there is no red shoulder patch. Juvenile birds have grey eyes.

The different head colour and the yellow tip to the tail distinguish this species from the similar Plum-headed parakeet (&quot;H. cyanocephala&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The &quot;Psittacula&quot; genus, introduced in 1800 by naturalist Georges Cuvier, includes 16 species of parrots and parakeets. The genus name &quot;Psittacula&quot; is derived from the latin word psittacus, or “parrot”. Biswamoy Biswas, an Indian ornithologist, was credited as the authority on this species in 1951 due to his contributions researching the birds of Nepal and Bhutan.

A revised classification of the genus by Michael Braun and coauthors in 2019 split the genus into multiple monophyletic genera. The proposed monophyletic genus, &quot;Himalayapsitta,&quot; includes the Plum-headed parakeet, Grey-headed parakeet, Slaty-headed parakeet, and the Blossom-headed parakeet. This taxonomic system is currently followed by the IUCN Red List.

Two subspecies of the Blossom-headed parakeet are recognized:
* &quot;P. r. roseata&quot; - Biswas, 1951 – West Bengal (India) to Bangladesh
* &quot;P. r. juneae&quot; - Biswas, 1951 – Northeast India and North Myanmar to Indochina

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is a resident breeder in Southeast Asia. The range expands from Eastern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Northeast India and Nepal, eastwards into Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and also China. It is a non-migratory bird and lives year round in the same range.

The blossom-headed parakeet inhabits lowland and foothill open forests. It occurs in altitudes around 1500m and in light forests such as savannas, secondary growth forests, forest edges, clearings, and cultivated areas. In Thailand, the Blossom-headed parakeet is common in cultivated land and forest outskirts.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Blossom-headed parakeet nests in holes in trees, laying 4-5 white eggs. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit and blossoms which make up its diet. The species is normally found moving in small flocks or in family groups, and often in the company of Moustached parakeets.

Blossom-headed parakeet class are described as having a range of raucous calls, sometimes being gregarious and noisy or soft and melodic much like the Plum-headed parakeet (&quot;P. cyanocephala&quot;).

== Breeding and captivity ==
Although uncommon in overseas aviculture, this species has been historically kept in captivity for importation into Europe. It is trapped and sold illegally as a cage bird, such as at Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok, Thailand. Blossom-headed parakeets are generally non-aggressive to other captive birds.In 1879, aviculturist Dr. Karl Russ was the first person to record a successful breeding attempt with the Blossom-headed parakeet. As in the wild, the species lays a clutch of two to four eggs which are incubated by the hen. Incubation lasts around 24 days and newly hatched birds remain in the nest for seven to eight weeks.

Millet, oats, and canary and sunflower seeds are recommended staple diets for captive Blossom-headed parakeets. Young parakeets consume a soaked seed mix, green food, and fruit in large amounts.

== Threats and conservation ==
The Blossom-headed parakeet was classified as near threatened by the IUCN Red List in 2013 because of its moderately rapid decline from trapping and habitat loss. While populations are stable or declining slowly in its range in India and Thailand, populations in Laos and Vietnam have declined very rapidly over the past three decades.The species is vulnerable to habitat loss especially in degraded lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests. Human pressures such as agricultural land conversion, hunting, and climate change increase disturbances to Blossom-headed parakeet habitats. Parakeet species are also highly impacted by poaching and trapping for the cage-bird trade.
Blossom-headed parakeets commonly frequent farm edges and rural villages in flocks of 20 to 30 birds, causing damage to agricultural crops. The species was found to be the highest contributor to depredation of marigold crops in a 1994 study in India. The parakeets preferred to feed from flowers near perching sites and away from human activity.

<text>Ronald Prescott &quot;Ron&quot; Reagan (born May 20, 1958) is an American political commentator and broadcaster. Reagan is a former radio host and political analyst for KIRO and Air America Radio, with which he hosted his own daily three-hour show. He has also been a contributor to MSNBC.

The family lived in Sacramento while his father was governor, from 1967 His sister, Patti Davis, is five and a half years older. His older adoptive brother Michael Reagan, adopted as an infant by Ronald Reagan and his first wife, Jane Wyman, is 13 years older. He also had two half-sisters born to Reagan and Wyman, Maureen Reagan (1941–2001) and Christine Reagan, who was born prematurely on June 26, 1947, and died the same day.

Ron Reagan undertook a different philosophical and political path from his father at an early age. At 12, he told his parents he would not be going to church anymore because he was an atheist.

Reagan attended and was expelled from The Webb School of California. He commented:

They [the school administration] thought I was a bad influence on the other kids. As I recall, the immediate reason was I went to a dance at a neighboring girl&#x27;s school in a classmate&#x27;s car. This was an infraction. They had been looking for an excuse. I didn&#x27;t get caught at anything.

Reagan dropped out of Yale University in 1976 after one semester to become a ballet dancer. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in pursuit of his lifelong dream and participated in the Joffrey II Dancers, a troupe for beginning dancers, where he was mentored by Sally Brayley. &quot;Time&quot; wrote in 1980: &quot;It is widely known that Ron&#x27;s parents have not managed to see a single ballet performance of their son, who is clearly very good, having been selected to the Joffrey second company, and is their son nonetheless. Ron talks of his parents with much affection. But these absences are strange and go back a ways.&quot; The parent Reagans went to see Ron perform at the Lisner Auditorium on Monday, May 18, 1981. The elder Reagan commented in his White House diary on this day that Ron&#x27;s performance was &quot;darn good&quot; and reminiscent of Fred Astaire.

Reagan, who was 22 and married by the time his father took office, never lived in the White House. He dropped his Secret Service protection 18 months into his father&#x27;s presidency.

==Career==
In February 1986, Reagan hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Reagan became more politically active after his father left the White House in 1989. In contrast to his father, the younger Reagan&#x27;s views were unabashedly liberal. In a 2009 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview, Ron said that he did not speak out politically during his father&#x27;s term because the press &quot;never cared about my opinions &quot;as such,&quot; only as they related to &quot;him&quot;&quot;, adding he did not want to create the impression that he and his father were on bad terms because of political differences. In 1991, Reagan hosted &quot;The Ron Reagan Show&quot;, a syndicated late-night talk show addressing political issues of the day, which was canceled after a brief run since it was unable to compete with the higher ratings of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and &quot;Nightline&quot;.

Reagan has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist and has hosted talk shows on cable TV networks such as the Animal Planet network. In Britain, he is best known for having co-presented &quot;Record Breakers&quot; (based on &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;) for the BBC. Reagan presented a report from the United States each week.

He has served on the board of the Creative Coalition, an organization founded in 1989 by a group that included Susan Sarandon and Christopher Reeve, to politically mobilize entertainers and artists, generally for First Amendment rights and causes such as arts advocacy and public education. From February to December 2005, Reagan co-hosted the talk show &quot;Connected: Coast to Coast with Monica Crowley&quot; on MSNBC.

Until its demise in 2010, Air America Media aired &quot;The Ron Reagan Show.&quot; The program made its debut on September 8, 2008.

In 2011, he published &quot;My Father at 100: A Memoir&quot;. In interviews promoting the book, Reagan described noticing his father was having certain mental lapses which, in hindsight, caused the younger Reagan to speculate subsequently that his father may have already been in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease while still in office. This assertion was attacked by critics, including his brother, Michael Reagan. Ron Reagan subsequently clarified that he did not feel the lapses were evidence of &quot;dementia.&quot;

==Political activities==
Reagan is not a member of a political party, but votes Democratic. In July 2004, Reagan spoke at the Democratic National Convention about his support for lifting Bush&#x27;s restrictions on federally funded embryonic stem cell research, from which he expected a cure or new treatments for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, of which his father had recently died. &quot;There are those who would stand in the way of this remarkable future, who would deny the federal funding so crucial to basic research. A few of these folks, needless to say, are just grinding a political axe and they should be ashamed of themselves,&quot; Ron Reagan said of the restrictions. &quot;We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology.&quot; Reagan&#x27;s mother Nancy also supported this position.

In September 2004, he told the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; newspaper that the George W. Bush Administration had &quot;cheated to get into the White House. It&#x27;s not something Americans ever want to think about their government. My sense of these people is that they don&#x27;t have any respect for the public at large. They have a revolutionary mindset. I think they feel that anything they can do to prevail — lie, cheat, whatever — is justified by their revolutionary aims&quot; and that he feared Bush was &quot;hijacking&quot; his father&#x27;s reputation.

Reagan later wrote the essay &quot;The Case Against George W. Bush by Ron Reagan&quot; for &quot;Esquire&quot;. He voted for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. Reagan endorsed Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for president in the 2008 presidential election. In November 2015, Reagan endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 Democratic Party primaries.

In early 2020, Reagan stated his father would have opposed Donald Trump, remarking to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that &quot;The Republican Party at this point, for a whole host of reasons to do with Donald Trump, is an entirely illegitimate political party just made up of a bunch of sycophantic traitors mouthing Kremlin propaganda to defend this squalid little man who is occupying the White House,&quot; Reagan said. &quot;This is a dying party. They either have to remake themselves entirely or they will disappear eventually. Within a decade the Republican Party will be a minor fringe group if it continues going this way. My father would have been ashamed of this Republican Party. He would have been embarrassed and ashamed that a president of the United States was as incompetent and traitorous as the man occupying the White House now. He’s a disgrace to the office of the presidency.&quot;

==Personal life==

Reagan lives in Seattle. He married Doria Palmieri, a clinical psychologist, in 1980. She died in 2014 from neuromuscular disease. They had no children. He married Federica Basagni in July 2018.

Reagan stated in a 2004 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that he did not claim any religion, but that his sympathies were with Buddhism and his wife was a Buddhist. In a June 23, 2004, interview on CNN show &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, while discussing reasons why he would not run for political office, Ron Reagan stated &quot;I&#x27;m an atheist [...] I can&#x27;t be elected to anything because polls all say that people won&#x27;t elect an atheist.&quot;

In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In May 2014, Reagan appeared in an advertisement for broadcast on Comedy Central for the Freedom From Religion Foundation in which he declared himself &quot;an unabashed atheist&quot; who is &quot;not afraid of burning in Hell.&quot; The ad received renewed attention in October 2019 when it aired on CNN during the fourth 2020 Democratic Presidential Debate. The ad was also run during the CNN Democratic debates in January and March 2020.

It was proclaimed on 7 March 1906 as the Warringah Shire Council, and became &quot;Warringah Council&quot; in 1993. In 1992, Pittwater Council was formed when the former A Riding of Warringah Shire voted to secede. From this point on until amalgamation, Warringah Council administered of land, including nine beaches and of coastline. Prior to its abolition it contained of natural bushland and open space, with Narrabeen Lagoon marking Warringah&#x27;s northern boundary and Manly Lagoon marking the southern boundary.

On 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced that Warringah Council, along with the Pittwater and Manly councils would be merged to establish the Northern Beaches Council with immediate effect. The last mayor of Warringah Council was Cr Michael Regan, who was elected on 13 September 2008. The council seat was located in Warringah Civic Centre in Dee Why on Pittwater Road.

===Composition and election methods===
===Final composition and election method===
Warringah Council was composed of ten councillors, including the mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor was directly elected (from 2008 to 2016) while the nine other Councillors were elected proportionally with three separate wards each electing three councillors. The last election was held on 8 September 2012, and the makeup of the council, including the mayor, was as follows when the council was dissolved.

The last Council, elected in 2012, in order of election by ward, is as follows.

== History ==
The traditional Aboriginal owners of the land we now know as Warringah had mostly disappeared from this area within years of European settlement, mainly due to an outbreak of smallpox in 1789.

The name Warringah was taken from the Aboriginal word for Middle Harbour, which was recorded as &quot;Warrin ga&quot;, by the government surveyor, James Larmer, in 1832.

Warringah had been in use for several years in the late 1800s and early 1900s as the name of the NSW electorate covering the areas of Mosman, Neutral Bay, North Sydney, Manly and the Northern Beaches. The use of the name Warringah was picked up again in 1906 when it was given to Shire 131. Warringah also has other meanings in various Aboriginal languages including &#x27;grey head&#x27; and &#x27;signs of rain&#x27;.

Warringah was explored early on in the settlement of Sydney, only a few weeks after the arrival of the First Fleet. However, it remained a rural area for most of the 1800s, with only small settlements in the valleys between headlands. While it was geographically close to the city centre, to reach the area over land from Sydney via Mona Vale Road was a trip of more than 100 kilometres.

=== Creation of Warringah Shire Council ===
On 7 March 1906, the Warringah Shire was proclaimed by the NSW Government Gazette, along with 132 other new Shires as a result of the passing of the &quot;Local Government (Shires) Act 1905&quot;. It ran roughly from Broken Bay in the north to Manly Lagoon to the south, and by Middle Harbour Creek and Cowan Creek in the west. It covered and had a population of around 2800, with 700 dwellings. Under the Shires Act, ratepayers with properties worth at least five pounds could vote for up to nine councillors for a three-year term.

Upon its establishment a temporary council of nominated representatives was installed by the State member for Middle Harbour Dr. Richard Arthur: George Alderton, of Frenchs Forest, George Brock, of Mona Vale, Thomas Gibbons, of Narrabeen, David Skene, of Brookvale, and Prof. Anderson, of Bayview (Who resigned on 9 June 1906 and was replaced by Herbert Sturman, of Mona Vale). The first meeting of this temporary council took place in the Narrabeen Progress Hall on 19 June 1906, with George Brock in the chair. The election of the first Warringah Shire Council took place on 24 November 1906, and the first meeting of the six elected councillors took place on 3 December, when Thomas Fisbourne was elected Shire President. The six councillors elected in November 1906 were Ellison Quirk and John Duffy for A Riding, Alexander Ralston and Thomas Fishbourne for B Riding, and E.A. Holden and William Hews, for C Riding.

The council first met in Narrabeen Progress Hall on 14 June 1906, and thereafter met in purpose-built chambers in Brookvale. However these proved to be too small and the council moved meetings from 1912 for the next 60 years to a new Shire Hall also in Brookvale.

=== Development ===

In the early 1920s, Warringah Shire initiated a process of electrifying the area, and the completion of the electricity supply and street-lighting of the area was officially marked on 29 March 1923 by Shire President Arthur George Parr. A tramline was established through the south-eastern area of the shire, running along Pittwater Road from Manly Lagoon eventually stretching all the way to the tramshed at Narrabeen in December 1913, with a later additional terminating line through Harbord to Freshwater Beach. This, coupled with the opening of the Spit and Roseville bridges in 1924 led to increased interest and travel to the area, which increased even further with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. Early subdivisions were usually given over for weekenders and holiday homes, and at the same time the surf clubs and rock pools on the beaches began to be developed. After World War II, urbanisation began to occur, with family homes beginning to be built in the area, especially near the beaches. Retail, light industry and improved public amenity soon followed. It was also around this time that the tram lines were progressively closed across Sydney, to give way to more lanes for motor vehicles.

The mid-1970s and late 1980s witnessed a rise in suburban expansion in the Northern Beaches area, prompting long term planning by Warringah Council, particularly during the term of Shire President Paul Couvret. Work began on a new Dee Why civic centre in 1971, designed by Sulman Prize-winning architect Colin Madigan, to replace the Shire Hall in Brookvale which had been in use for the past 60 years. The building was completed in 1972 and the council has remained there since 1973.

In November 1979, Warringah Council opened the Warringah Aquatic Centre at Frenchs Forest. The Aquatic Centre hosted the NSW and Australian Swimming Titles, as well as the 1992 Olympic trials.

The Glen Street Theatre was officially opened in July 1985 as part of the Forest Community Centre by the Shire President, Darren Jones.

=== Secession of Pittwater Council ===
From 1906 the council was divided into A, B and C Ridings and in 1977 these were reorganised, adding a new &#x27;D Riding&#x27; to that number. For many years, there was a sentiment held by some in A Riding, the northern Riding and the largest in Warringah, taking up more than 40% of Warringah&#x27;s land area, that they were being increasingly ignored and subject to what they considered inappropriate development and policies for their area. This culminated in 1991 when a non-compulsory postal poll of the residents of A Riding was taken over the question of a possible secession. This resulted in a 73.5% vote in favour of secession, however only 48.18% of residents took part in this vote. This vote was, however, 600 short of the total majority required.

The Minister for Local Government at the time, Gerry Peacocke, nevertheless announced the secession of A Riding from Warringah Council, considering that those who did not vote did not have any particular inclination to how they were governed, and thus Pittwater Council was created.

On 2 May 1992, The governor of New South Wales, Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, proclaimed the establishment of the Municipality of Pittwater, the area of which roughly followed the area formerly known as &#x27;A&#x27; Riding of the Warringah Shire.

Also on that day, the offices of Robert Dunn, Eric Green and Ronald Starr, former Warringah &#x27;A&#x27; Riding Councillors, were terminated with those persons forming, with others, a Provisional Council of the Municipality of Pittwater.

=== Renamed &quot;Warringah Council&quot; ===

Soon after the secession of Pittwater, the Local Government Act 1993 was passed, causing Warringah to drop the term &#x27;Shire&#x27; from its title, and the renaming of the Shire Clerk to General Manager and Shire President to Mayor. The remaining B, C and D Ridings were renamed the A, B and C Wards.

===Coat of arms and logo===

The traditional symbol of Warringah was the flannel flower, which is a common flower for the bushland and coastal areas on the Northern Beaches and was adopted by the council following its proclamation in 1906. On the council&#x27;s choice, prominent Sydney solicitor Ernest Henry Tebbutt, in &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot;, noted: 

The coat of arms used for Warringah Council was adopted in 1968 and as such appears on the mayoral chain and can also still be seen on council street signs installed prior to 1998. It features heraldic dolphin supporters, a wedge-tailed eagle rising from a mural crown as the crest, a flannel flower within a green shield, and the Latin motto, &quot;Arte et Labore&quot; (&quot;by Skill and Labour&quot;). Its heraldic design was spearheaded by Councillor Winston Gray MBE, who served on the council from 1968 to 1971. He was chairman of Mackellar County Council in 1970.

In 1994 the council changed its logo to a rectangle featuring the flannel flower. Designed by the council&#x27;s graphic designer, Bev Biram, it featured two of the flower petals overlapping the edge and introduced colour: a white flannel flower on a background of blue for the sea and green in the flower&#x27;s stem to represent the area&#x27;s bushland. This was replaced in 2013, when a new logo featuring a &quot;W&quot; was adopted, with the mayor Michael Regan noting that &quot;the flannel flower was the logo of several other councils, and also the Mental Health Council of Australia&quot;. Despite this, the flannel flower was retained as the official council seal and the official floral emblem.

=== Dismissals ===
The council was dismissed in 1967 following the jailing of two councillors for bribery. It was again dismissed in 1985 amid corruption allegations but subsequent inquiries resulted in no charges being laid and council was returned in 1987. In 2003, a public inquiry found the community had lost confidence in the council and an administrator was appointed.

====1967====
Warringah Shire Council was first dismissed in April 1967 by the Askin State Government and was triggered by the gaoling of two councillors for bribery. The councillors involved, Dennis Thomas and George Knight, were prosecuted under the &quot;Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1919 (NSW)&quot; for receiving bribes from a development company to influence planning and development decisions, and both received gaol sentences. C.J.Barnett, Department of Local Government, acted as administrator April to May 1967. R.H.Cornish, Department of Local Government, acted as administrator from November 1967 to December 1968.

====1985====
The council was dismissed again on 4 December 1985 by the Neville Wran state government amid allegations of bribery, and local dissatisfaction with the handling of development applications at Palm Beach and Mona Vale amid alleged &quot;discrepancies in council planning decisions&quot;. Warringah was placed under administration for 16 months with Daniel Kelly from the Department of Local Government acting as administrator from December 1985 until April 1986 and Richard Connolly, former chairman of the Metropolitan Waste Disposal authority from June 1986 to March 1987.

Administrator Kelly advised that despite an &quot;exhaustive examination&quot; of the Mona Vale development by Council staff and its advisers that would normally lead to its approval, it would be in the best interests of the community and the developer &quot;to have any doubts about the development to be settled once and for all&quot;. He subsequently sought legal advice from a leading authority on environmental law as to the merits of the application and the former council&#x27;s handling of it. Murray Tobias QC, subsequently advised that the council had not exceeded its powers in its handling of the development. Tobias also advised that in respect to certain deficiencies that rendered the granting of the building approval invalid, that the deficiencies &quot;were in all respects technical breaches of the Act committed without appreciation thereof by either Council, its Staff as well as the Developer and solely due to an oversight on the part of Council&quot;. He found that &quot;these resolutions were clearly valid...and that they therefore remedied the situation given by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales on 6 March 1986 and removed any point of continuing illegality.&quot;

The NSW Local Government Association, supported by more than 150 constituent NSW Councils, demanded that the State Government institute an Inquiry into the dismissal of Warringah Council. The NSW Ombudsman agreed to conduct his own Inquiry. Following the NSW Ombudsman&#x27;s challenge against the government for its repeated refusal to provide him with all relevant files, it was subsequently found that there had been no evidence of corruption to support the dismissal, and that &quot;the elected councillors were denied natural justice and were both unfairly and unlawfully dismissed&quot;. It was also revealed that the Cabinet, headed by Local Government Minister, Janice Crosio, had made the decision to sack the council while ignoring the advice of the Under-secretary of the Department of Local Government who had been pushing for a public inquiry before the dismissal.
Investigations into bribery allegations against councillors by the NSW Fraud Squad and the Ombudsman did not result in any charges being laid against any councillor or member of staff. Warringah Council was returned after elections in on 14 March 1987 (sixth month before the statewide local elections) and resulted in seven councillors from the previous council being returned to office, including the shire president, Ted Jackson.

====2003====
On 15 January 2003 the then Minister for Local Government, Harry Woods, announced a formal public inquiry into Warringah Council. Emeritus Professor Maurice Daly was appointed the commissioner by the Governor of New South Wales, Professor Marie Bashir.

The commissioner found that the majority of the community had lost confidence in the councillors&#x27; ability to fulfill their roles and he recommended their dismissal. It was recommended that extra measures be taken to eliminate conflicts of interest in council matters, as well as increasing ease of access to information held by council. The commissioner also recommended consideration of boundary changes or merger opportunities with the neighbouring councils of Manly and Pittwater.

The findings of the inquiry were criticised by the former mayor, Julie Sutton, who said she found the report to be &quot;very, very biased&quot; and the then New South Wales Opposition Leader, John Brogden, who warned that the dismissal should not be used as a back door for amalgamations on the northern beaches or to prevent the elections scheduled for March 2004.

Following the release of the report, Warringah Council was dismissed on 23 July 2003, and Dick Persson AM was appointed Administrator. In September 2004, the administrator requested that his term be extended beyond the next scheduled council elections on 1 August 2005, citing a number of important projects yet to be completed and establishing a change in culture amongst staff at the council. An extension was approved by the governor until the Local Government Elections in September 2008.

===Amalgamation, 2016===
A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Warringah Council merge with adjoining councils. The government considered three proposals. The first proposed a merger of Manly Council and Mosman councils and parts of Warringah to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 153,000. The second proposed a merger of Pittwater Council and parts of Warringah to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 141,000.

The third proposal, submitted by Warringah Council on 23 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Pittwater, Manly and Warringah councils. Of the 44,919 submissions lodged to the Boundaries Commission about all the local government proposals state-wide, 29,189 were from Northern Beaches residents (18,977 were submitted for the third proposal); this meant that the Northern Beaches proposals made up 65% of all submissions. Former Warringah mayor, Michael Regan, noted to the &quot;Manly Daily&quot; that this was an indication of the level of interest in the Northern Beaches over the future of their local government: &quot;given the choice of splitting the northern beaches or uniting it the community opted for unity&quot;, while former Manly mayor, Jean Hay, commented that this interest translated into the final result: &quot;Everyone is passionate about the area and we came out and let the powers-that-be know, [...] It must have made an impact because the minister and the premier looked at what the community told them and it was the majority decision to go with a single council.&quot;

On 12 May 2016, with the release of the &quot;Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016&quot;, the Northern Beaches Council was formed from Manly, Pittwater and Warringah councils. The first meeting of the Northern Beaches Council was held at Manly Town Hall on 19 May 2016.

==Awards==
In 2015 Warringah Council won the AR Bluett Award for the second time, Warringah Council first won the award in 1973. This award is known as &quot;The greatest accolade a council can achieve&quot;.

<doc id="597894" wikidata="Q268510" url="?curid=597894" title="Marilyn Waring">
<text>Dame Marilyn Joy Waring (born 7 October 1952) is a New Zealand public policy scholar, international development consultant, former politician, environmentalist, feminist and a principal founder of feminist economics.

In 1975, aged 23, she became New Zealand&#x27;s youngest member of parliament for the centre-right New Zealand National Party. As a member of parliament she chaired the Public Expenditure Committee. Her support of the opposition Labour Party&#x27;s proposed nuclear-free New Zealand policy was instrumental in precipitating the 1984 New Zealand general election, and she left parliament in 1984.

On leaving parliament she moved into academia; she is best known for her 1988 book &quot;If Women Counted&quot;, and she obtained a D.Phil in politics in 1989. Through her research and writing she is known as the principal founder of the discipline of feminist economics. Since 2006, Waring has been a professor of public policy at the Institute of Public Policy at AUT, focusing on governance and public policy, political economy, gender analysis, and human rights. She has taken part in international aid work and served as a consultant to UNDP and other international organisations.

She has outspokenly criticised the concept of gross domestic product (GDP), the economic measure that became a foundation of the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) following World War II. She criticises a system which &quot;counts oil spills and wars as contributors to economic growth, while child-rearing and housekeeping are deemed valueless&quot;. Her work has influenced academics, government accounting in a number of countries, and United Nations policies. Waring has had a long-time involvement with the Association for Women&#x27;s Rights in Development, a progressive feminist organisation that advocates inclusive feminism, and served on its board until 2012. In 2021 she was appointed by the World Health Organization as a member of the WHO Council on the Economics of Health For All.

== Early life ==
Marilyn Waring grew up at Taupiri, where her parents owned a butchery. Her great-grandfather Harry (Arthur Henry) Waring had emigrated to New Zealand from Hopesay in Herefordshire, England, in 1881, and established the family butchery business at Taupiri. In 1927 Harry Waring stood unsuccessfully for election to parliament in the Raglan seat for the Reform Party, the forerunner of the National Party. A talented soprano in her youth, her parents had hoped that she would become a classical singer. In 1973, Waring received an Honours BA in political science and international politics from Victoria University of Wellington.

== Career ==

=== Political career ===

Waring joined the National Party while still a student at Victoria University. She joined because she supported National MP Venn Young, who introduced a private member&#x27;s bill into parliament for homosexual law reform; this was opposed by Norman Kirk, the Labour Party Prime Minister. She quickly entered the Opposition Research Unit as a part-time advisor under George Gair, the Shadow Minister of Housing.

The 1972 to 1975 National Opposition had not had a single female member in its caucus. Exacerbated due to 1975 being International Women&#x27;s Year, it was to deep embarrassment among the National Party&#x27;s established figures that no women had been selected for any seats in the upcoming election. At age 22, Waring expressed some passing interest to Gair in standing for the party in the seat of Raglan, a very safe National seat that contained her hometown of Huntly. Gair anxiously called former Prime Minister Keith Holyoake to tell him about Waring&#x27;s interest and origins in the area itself. An overjoyed Holyoake personally arrived within the hour to Parliament House, and offered her the selection without even formally introducing himself. The two thereafter became very close, to the extent that on one occasion she kissed Holyoake on the lips in front of cameras. She is thought to have helped soften Holyoake&#x27;s ambivalent views on LGBT rights; after she was involuntarily outed by the &quot;New Zealand Truth&quot; in 1978, Holyoake worked with Prime Minister Robert Muldoon to quickly downplay the tabloid reports and to protect their friend.

Waring campaigned for selection by making house calls on party delegates, starting in her home town of Huntly, borrowing her mother&#x27;s car (and some of her clothes). She mentioned her opposition to sporting ties with South Africa. 26 of the 130 voting delegates were women; including Katherine O&#x27;Regan who became her electoral agent for eight years. The other candidates were men: a County Council chair, a Meat and Wool Section chair of Federated Farmers, a National Party Divisional councillor and a popular local farmer who had stood as an independent in the 1972 election. The selection meeting was held at Ngaruawahia High School assembly hall (she went there her first two years of secondary school). She was the last candidate to speak; each was given two sealed envelopes with the same subject to speak on. Party president George Chapman&#x27;s subject was agricultural incomes - &quot;not her strong suit&quot; - and Party leader Robert Muldoon&#x27;s was housing policy; a &quot;patsy&quot; question as he knew she was working on housing policy with Gair (as she pointed out to the meeting). 

When her selection was announced Waring thought there had been &quot;a dreadful mistake&quot; but there was a round of stand-up cheering and Jim Bolger from the neighbouring King Country electorate raced up and embraced her on stage. She was later told by a scrutineer that she was ahead from the first ballot, and slowly climbed to over 50%. Her selection reflected her &quot;obvious ability and ... well-articulated convictions&quot;, but was helped because the two best-known local candidates disliked each other, and when one was eliminated his support went to Waring to prevent the selection of the other. One family block voted for her because another candidate had sold them a horse with a saddle sore concealed by a blanket.

Muldoon said at the subsequent party caucus meeting in Wellington how pleased he was that she made it: &quot;We are going to win. I wanted a woman and I will help all I can&quot;. Holyoake agreed with Muldoon that &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like it in 40 years.&quot; Aged 23, she was the youngest member of parliament at the time of her election.

Waring and Colleen Dewe (elected to the Lyttelton &quot;swing&quot; seat then held by Labour) were the fourteenth and fifteenth women elected as Members of Parliament in New Zealand. Waring was one of only two women in the government caucus and one of only four women elected in 1975. After the 1978 election she was the sole female government MP until Ruth Richardson was elected in 1981. Both Waring and Richardson were members of the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby.

She fell out with Prime Minister Robert Muldoon almost immediately, and there were several episodes of conflict, although they also shared views on some issues such as welfare payments to single mothers, where Muldoon was a believer in the welfare state.

During her period in Parliament, she served as Chair of the Public Expenditure Committee, Senior Government Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and on the Disarmament and Arms Control Committee. The appointment to the Public Expenditure Committee after the 1978 election was a considerable achievement for a member of only three years&#x27; standing. According to Barry Gustafson,
:Waring recalled that she &#x27;just fell off my chair&#x27; when Muldoon, without any prior consultation, announced at caucus that she would be chairperson of the very influential Public Expenditure Committee. This was a major position for an MP of only three years&#x27; experience and even more so in light of Waring&#x27;s youth and controversial first term. Muldoon, however, knew that Waring had similar views and values on the economy to his own and that she had the intellectual capacity and drive to cope with complex investigation and analysis. He was also well aware that she would not be intimidated by ministers or senior officials.

She also served on the Select committee for Violent Offending, taking a particular interest in the Aroha Trust, formed by Black Power women. As a Member of Parliament, she was also the New Zealand Observer at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, and chaired the New Zealand Delegation to the OECD Conference on the Role of Women in the Economy in 1978.

The Raglan electorate was abolished in 1978: her home town of Huntly and Ngaruawahia were now in the Rangiriri electorate and Raglan was in the Waikato electorate. Waring moved to the Waipa electorate, one of the safest National seats in the country and including the wealthy rural town of Cambridge and parts of the King Country.

Waring had come especially to disagree with the National Party policy over the issue of a nuclear-free New Zealand and, on 14 June 1984, she informed the leadership that she would vote independently on nuclear issues, disarmament issues, and rape but would continue to support the Government on confidence. Since the National Party had only a one-seat majority, the government would be likely (though not certain) to lose on an issue Muldoon regarded as one of national security.

That evening Muldoon decided to call a snap election to be held on 14 July (a general election was due at the end of the year). The election was a disaster for the National Party. Waring told Muldoon&#x27;s biographer that she had deliberately sought to provoke Muldoon into this action. The nuclear-free New Zealand legislation was subsequently enacted by the new Labour government. In her autobiography, &quot;The Political Years&quot;, she described laughing as Muldoon berated her in a parliamentary office, and recounted eating an apple to taunt him as Muldoon drank and grew enraged.

Jim Traue of the Alexander Turnbull Library asked if they could archive her papers; they did not normally archive MP&#x27;s papers (only Ministers) &quot;but her collection would be different&quot;; there were close to 400 cartons.

=== Academic work ===
In 1984 Waring left politics and returned to academia, where her research has focused on feminist economics, well-being, human rights and on economic factors that influence legislation and aid.

In 1988 she published &quot;If Women Counted&quot; (originally published with an introduction by Gloria Steinem). The book has also been published as &quot;Counting for Nothing&quot;, but remains most widely known under the first title. It criticises the use of GDP as a surrogate for &quot;progress,&quot; and argues that lacking valuation of women and nature drive decisions in globalisation that have unintended but terrible consequences for the world. According to Julie A. Nelson,
:&quot;Marilyn Waring&#x27;s work woke people up. She showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems, and the damage this causes. Her book [...] encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways, both numerical and otherwise, of valuing, preserving, and rewarding the work of care that sustains our lives. By pointing to a similar neglect of the natural environment, she also issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time. In recent decades, the field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more.&quot;

A highly influential thinker and practitioner, her work has influenced both academia and United Nations policies. &quot;If Women Counted&quot; &quot;persuaded the United Nations to redefine gross domestic product, inspired new accounting methods in dozens of countries and became the founding document of the discipline of feminist economics.&quot; Waring has continued to challenge governments to adopt her work even though some countries such as Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Korea have recognised unpaid work and improved data collection and statistics to inform policy making.

In 1989 Waring gained a D.Phil. in politics from the University of Waikato with a thesis on the United Nations System of National Accounts, and in 1990 a University of Waikato Research Council grant to continue work on &quot;female human rights.&quot;

Between 1991 and 1994, Waring served as Senior Lecturer in Public Policy and the Politics of Human Rights with the Department of Politics at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

In May 2006, Waring was appointed Professor of Public Policy at the Institute for Public Policy (IPP) at AUT. Her research focuses on governance and public policy, political economy, gender analysis, and human rights. In 2010 Waring and Grant Gillon supervised the master&#x27;s thesis of former minister George Gair. Other notable students of Waring include Sue Bradford, Trish Bradbury, Shirley Jülich and Karanina Sumeo.

She was one of 16 prominent intellectuals invited to contribute to a French publication on human rights around the globe in 2007, along with Ken Loach, Maude Barlow, Walden Bello and Susan George.

In 2014, the anthology &quot;Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics&quot;, edited by Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay, was published. According to &quot;&quot;, the book explores &quot;a wide range of issues—including the fundamental meaning of economic growth and activity to consumption, health care, mortality, unpaid household work, mothering, education, nutrition, equality, and sustainability&quot; and reveals &quot;the breadth, depth, and substance that can grow from innovative ideas and critical analysis.&quot; Diane Elson argues that &quot;despite many valiant efforts, women do not as yet really count in the conduct of economic policy. This book is an imaginative contribution to an ongoing struggle.&quot;

According to &quot;Wired&quot;,
:&quot;Marilyn Waring is an extremely clear thinker about the disastrous consequences of using measures such as GDP as a surrogate for &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;wellbeing&quot; in a country. She has also analysed how economics as it is currently practised as a &quot;science&quot; is radically defective and that it drives decisions in globalisation that have unintended but terrible consequences for the world. We must realise that we can&#x27;t tackle the problems in health care, environmental issues, food security, democracy and women&#x27;s rights in isolation; they must be seen as a set of interrelated issues, and anyone who wants to make a difference in the human condition must look at all of these factors.&quot;

=== International aid work ===
Waring has led the Gender and Governance team for the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. She also led UNDP&#x27;s largest project in the Asia Pacific for the Gender and Economic Policy Management Initiative. She led the Commonwealth Secretariat teams on Unpaid Work and HIV/Aids and on Social Protection. She has also served as a technical expert on gender and poverty for both UNDP and AUSAid.

=== Other ===

She and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku contributed the piece &quot;Foreigners in our own land&quot; to the 1984 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

Waring speaks publicly on gay and lesbian rights, most recently in support of same-sex marriages. The &quot;New Zealand Truth&quot; tabloid newspaper &quot;outed&quot; her as a lesbian in 1976. She refused to comment at the time and the Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, moved swiftly to minimise publicity and protect her; the general attitude among politicians being that it was a private matter. Muldoon advised her &quot;The way to do this is not to say anything at all to anyone, do you understand? You don&#x27;t say anything, I don&#x27;t say anything, the Party doesn&#x27;t say anything – and there&#x27;s no story if we don&#x27;t talk. In the end, it will just go away. As for your future, that will be between you and your electorate.&quot; He refused to say anything to journalists; her electorate chairman and electorate Executive Committee told her she had their total support. An initial injunction against publishing the story arranged by Jim McLay had been overturned.

Waring&#x27;s strong pro-choice identification and vocal feminism overshadowed her lesbianism. Since she left Parliament in 1984, Waring has more openly acknowledged her sexual orientation.

== Appointments and affiliations ==
Waring was a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand from 2005 to 2009. She has been a consultant for, and a board member of, international organisations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), United Nations Development Programme, Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the International Development Research Centre (Ottawa, Canada) and the Association for Women&#x27;s Rights in Development.

== Farming ==
Since 1984 and in between her academic and activist engagements, Waring farmed angora goats and dry stock, latterly on her hill-farm north of Auckland. Her experiences of life on the farm, international questions, New Zealand politics, feminist issues, and women of influence, were recorded &quot;In the Lifetime of a Goat: Writings 1984–2000&quot;; her popular &quot;Listener&quot; columns &quot;Letters to My Sisters&quot; from 1984 to 1989, form the basis. She organised her farm for maximum simplicity and self-sufficiency. Waring gave up goat farming in 2003.

<text>The Saunders-Roe SR.53 was a British prototype interceptor aircraft of mixed jet and rocket propulsion developed for the Royal Air Force (RAF) by Saunders-Roe in the early 1950s. As envisaged, the SR.53 would have been used as an interceptor aircraft, using its rocket propulsion to rapidly climb and approach incoming hostile bombers at high speeds; following its attack run, the aircraft would then return to its base using jet propulsion.

Although the SR.53 proved to have promising performance during test flights, the requirement for such an aircraft had been overtaken by rapid advances in surface-to-air missile technology, leading to reconsideration of the aircraft&#x27;s purpose. In July 1960, the development programme was formally cancelled, by which time a total of 56 test flights had been performed. A pair of prototype SR.53 aircraft had been completed and used during flight tests. The second prototype was destroyed during one such test flight in June 1958. The first prototype has been preserved to this day. It rests on public display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Second World War had demonstrated the importance of strategic bombing to modern warfare, and as the emerging Cold War developed, the development of new and more effective air defences against large waves of hostile bomber aircraft armed with nuclear weapons became a priority for many nations. During the war, Nazi Germany had extensively developed its own rocket-powered aircraft to augment its interception capabilities, in the final two years of the war, it had been able to deploy aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Bachem Ba 349 which, via rocket propulsion, had been capable of unparalleled rates-of-climb, enabling them to (at least in theory) rapidly sortie to intercept enemy bombers before they reached their targets. As the performance of these aircraft had become increasingly well known to the Allies, RAF experts were eager to explore and understand the underlying technology.

In the aftermath of the war, German rocket technology was studied extensively by various members of the former Allied nations. Britain had quickly opted to commence a programme to develop liquid-propellant rockets with the aim of boosting aircraft during the take-off phase, known within the RAF as rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG), and during the climb-to-altitude phase of flight. In 1946, work began on a pair of new British-built rocket motors, the de Havilland Sprite with a maximum thrust of and the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler with of thrust; these rocket motors made use of different propellants, the Sprite used a high-test peroxide (HTP) monopropellant while the Snarler harnessed a methanol/water/liquid oxygen mix. During the early 1950s, both engines proceeded to the flight testing phase; however, some of the demand for their role to provide fighters with increased performance was soon being met by the increasing prevalence of conventional jet engines being equipped with reheat instead.

In May 1951, faced with reports on the increasingly potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation&#x27;s newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 was due to the anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as . Accordingly, a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation&#x27;s measures to counter this threat would need to be capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time.

The development of the Sprite and the Snarler had led to the possibility of a more powerful rocket engine being developed as the planned powerplant for a viable &quot;point defence&quot; interceptor. The requirements of O.R. 301 were considered onerous, including a ramp launch and landing on a skid, and with the compliance of the companies which had approached to tender, the amended Specification F124T allowed for a mixed powerplant configuration along with the adoption of a conventional undercarriage. On 21 February 1951, the revised Specification F124T was circulated to half a dozen of Britain&#x27;s various aircraft manufacturers to solicit their submissions.

===Submissions and selection===
Saunders-Roe had not been one of the companies who received the Specification; this is likely due to the Ministry of Supply not considering them to be relevant, as the firm had typically been involved in the production of flying boats. However, Saunders-Roe was in fact interested in the new requirement, having been already independently conducting studies into high-altitude and high-speed flight. Maurice Brennan, the company&#x27;s chief designer, had already directed members of the design team to study the prospects of rocket-propelled aircraft capable of flying at altitudes of up to and had published a report entitled &#x27;Investigation of Problems of Pure Rocket Fighter Aircraft&#x27; at the same time that the Ministry had issued Specification F124T. Saunders-Roe approached the Ministry on its failure to follow conventional policy in not dispatching the specification nor an invitation to tender to the firm; as a result, on 24 March 1951, the Ministry asked the company to submit its designs alongside the other competitors.

By the end of April 1951, Saunders-Roe submitted their detailed proposal. The proposed single-seat aircraft, designated as the &quot;SR.53&quot;, was capable of very high speeds, being projected as being capable of a top speed of when at an altitude of , and a rate of climb of per minute around an altitude of . An auxiliary disposable undercarriage could be used for takeoffs, along with cordite-based booster rockets. In the event of an emergency, the entire cabin would have originally been jettisoned as a means of providing the pilot with a means of escape; due to the work involved in developing this, it was instead replaced by a more standard ejection seat arrangement. The firm had quickly identified that the original unpowered &#x27;glide home&#x27; approach would be dangerous and expensive; they approached the Air Ministry with their concept of a secondary jet engine for the purposes of powering the aircraft&#x27;s journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all interested companies were asked to examine this arrangement.

The SR.53 was a sleek aircraft with a sharply-pointed nose, delta-like wing, and a T-tail. It was powered by a combination of a single Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine and de Havilland Spectre rocket engine, the exhausts of which were mounted one atop the other on the rear fuselage beneath the tail. Saunders-Roe had originally proposed to develop their own rocket motor to power the SR.53, having not been initially pleased with the performance of either the Spectre nor the Screamer; however, it was recognised that this would take substantial development work. By October 1952, the basic outline of the aircraft had been finalised, replacing the combined flap and ailerons of earlier proposed with slotted flaps, the Viper engine was relocated upwards and was to be fitted with a straight jet pipe rather than a one, the tailplane was also moved to a higher position at the top of the fin.

On 30 October 1952, the company received an Instruction to Proceed from the Ministry for the completion of three prototypes. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the concept led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337. The changes of the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, adopting the Blue Jay infrared-guided air-to-air missile, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of rockets. During the first four months of 1953, Saunders-Roe had to perform a structural redesign of the SR.53&#x27;s fuselage, wing, and undercarriage due to a determination by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) that the wing required a greater anhedral angle than had originally been designed for.

On 5 May 1953, an advisory design conference was hosted at the Ministry of Supply focusing on the SR.53; three days later, a formal contract for the production of the three prototypes was received. Due to doubts within the RAF and the Ministry over the correct fuel/motor to select for the aircraft in order to meet the Specification, it was decided to issue a modified specification, and later a development contract, to A.V. Roe, who commenced work on their own rocket-powered interceptor, designated as the Avro 720. Of the six companies that tendered proposals, two were selected for development contracts: A.V. Roe with their Avro 720 and Saunders-Roe with the SR.53.

===Issues and proposals===
Saunders-Roe, recognising that it would need to outdo the competing Avro 720 if the SR.53 was to be likely to survive, upon having been issued with the contract to build the three prototypes, set a schedule that called for a first flight to be conducted in July 1954, along with a projected service introduction date of 1957. However, Wood observes that this was far too ambitious as it did not leave time to address the complexity of the aircraft, nor did it accommodate room for delays in the supply of the separately-produced Spectre engine. Unresolved issues with elements of the design caused a series of setbacks, including one notable incident in the form of an explosion occurring during ground tests of the Spectre rocket engine. Construction of the first SR.53 prototype took longer than anticipated, in part due to de Havilland having problems delivering the Spectre engine on time, installing auxiliary equipment was also time-consuming. Accordingly, the maiden flight of the SR.53 began to fall further and further behind schedule.

The date of the first flight was first set back to March 1955, and then into 1957. Unique challenges were posed by the HTP fuel, including the development of suitable storage bags and the fuel flow proportioner. In January 1954, the Ministry reduced its order from three SR.53 prototypes to two, which were constructed side by side at Saunders-Roe&#x27;s Cowes facility. Development with the competing Avro 720 proceeded more smoothly; by 1956, its prototype was virtually complete and was viewed as being capable of flying up to a year ahead of the lagging SR.53.

By September 1953, the programme to develop these aircraft came under scrutiny due to a need to implement cost cuts; as a result, the contract for the Avro 720 was eventually cancelled. One of the reasons for preferring the SR.53 was although the aircraft was developmentally behind, its use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser was viewed as less problematic than the Avro 720&#x27;s use of liquid oxygen, which posed a fire hazard. According to Wood, there was a preference for the HTP approach, as used by the SR.53, alongside an unwillingness to continue to support the operation of two different fuel programmes. However, the validity of this reason is undermined somewhat by the fact that Avro had been proposing to switch to using HTP and the Spectre, the same engine that was used by the SR.53. Another factor that had influenced the cancellation was the hesitancy of the RAF to back either project, the service had apparently wanted to wait until after flight evaluations had been conducted before it was to make any determination on its preference.

During late 1953, Saunders-Roe commenced work upon a derivative design, which was designated the &quot;SR.177&quot;. Brennan considered the lack of an onboard radar on the SR.53 and the Avro 720 to have been a vital flaw despite it not being a requirement of the specification, leaving the pilot dependent on his own vision and direction being provided by ground-based radar control. Brennan had also been dissatisfied with the use of the turbojet engine; he believed that a larger jet engine should match the steady supersonic cruising speed of the aircraft, and that the rocket motor should be mainly used for high performance climbs, turns, and rapid acceleration instead. Accordingly, the SR.177 was a much larger and sophisticated aircraft that would provide for more range and overall superior performance to the SR.53. It was sized to be able to carry a useful airborne radar, which Brennan had deemed to be essential for interception at the high altitudes at which the new fighter was meant to operate. The new, larger aircraft was also to be developed into separate versions for maritime use by the Royal Navy and for West Germany as well as for the RAF. Saunders-Roe worked on both the SR.53 and SR.177, the latter being worked on by a newly formed High Speed Development Section.

==Operational history==

In October 1951, Saunders-Roe obtained facilities at RAF Hurn, Dorset, to support the site&#x27;s use as a base for test flights of the SR.53. This measure had been necessitated by a lack of suitable airfields on the Isle of Wight, where the company was based and typically conducted development from. To this end, the firm constructed a HTP storage facility at the Hurn site; specialised radio aids were also installed and initially tested using a specially-modified Gloster Meteor which had been lent by the Ministry of Supply. This setup would ultimately remain unused as flying trials were centered at RAF Boscombe Down instead.

On 28 June 1956, the completed first prototype, XD145, was dispatched for assembly by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Boscombe Down. On 16 January 1957, the first installed ground run of its Spectre engine was performed; on 16 April 1957, this was followed by the first installed ground run of its Viper engine. On 9 May 1957, XD145 conducted the type&#x27;s first ground taxiing trial.

On 16 May 1957, Squadron Leader John Booth DFC was at the controls of XD145 for the first test flight, following up with the maiden flight of the second prototype XD151, on 6 December 1957. Test results indicated &quot;...an extremely docile and exceedingly pleasant aircraft to fly, with very well harmonized controls&quot;. Both prototypes flew a total of 56 test flights, with Mach 1.33 speeds being obtained.

While testing at RAE Boscombe Down, XD151 crashed on 5 June 1958 during an aborted takeoff on its 12th flight. Running off the runway, the aircraft struck a concrete approach light, exploding on impact and killing its pilot, Squadron Leader Booth. The remaining prototype continued to fly with Lt Cdr Peter Lamb taking over the flight test programme.

==Cancellation==
It was 1957 before the first SR.53 took to the air, just over a month after the infamous 1957 Defence White Paper had been published outlining the British government&#x27;s policy to largely abandon piloted aircraft in favour of concentrating on missile development. At the same time, jet engine development had progressed a long way in the six years since the SR.53&#x27;s initial design. Combined with the fact that improvements in radar had meant that any incoming bomber threat could be detected much earlier, the need for an aircraft like the SR.53 had disappeared, and the project was cancelled on 29 July 1960, with the third prototype (XD153) never built.

<text>The Saunders-Roe SR.177 was a 1950s project to develop a combined jet- and rocket-powered interceptor aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy. It was an enlarged derivative of the Saunders-Roe SR.53, which was itself an experimental combined jet-and-rocket interceptor aircraft.

The SR.177 principally differed from the smaller SR.53 in its adoption of a nose-mounted aircraft interception radar unit, which allowed it to scan for and lock onto its own targets; a more powerful turbojet engine was also incorporated. In addition to British interests in the aircraft, the German Navy had also expressed their interest in the project and closely evaluated its progress with an eye towards its potential procurement. However, the SR.177 was ultimately cancelled as a result of changes in Britain&#x27;s military policies in 1957.

A much larger derivative of the SR.177 had been studied, which was designated as the SR.187, and was being developed with the intention of meeting the requirements of Operational Requirement F.155. However, this work was also cancelled in 1957. By the time of termination, approximately 90 per cent of the first prototype had been completed, while several other prototypes were in various states of completion. The prototypes were stored for several years while attempts were made to revive the project; while interest was present, including from Japan, nothing more came of the project and the remaining assets were broken up.

In 1952, Saunders-Roe had been awarded a contract to develop a combined rocket-and-jet-propelled interceptor aircraft, which was designated as the Saunders-Roe SR.53. However, as development work on the project progressed, the shortcomings of the design became increasingly evident. Most particularly, as with the German rocket-powered interceptors of the Second World War, the range and endurance of such an aircraft were limited by the high rate of fuel consumption by the rocket engine. However, as turbojet engines developed and became increasingly powerful and efficient, new powerplants were quickly becoming available that would make such aircraft more practical.

Maurice Brennan, the chief designer of the SR.53, had also become convinced of the necessity for an airborne radar unit to be carried by the aircraft, as the SR.53 was reliant upon on ground-based radar guidance and the pilot&#x27;s own vision to intercept aircraft. In particular, it was feared that pilots would be unable to focus their eyes properly at the altitude that the SR.53 was capable of. Out of a combined desire to equip the aircraft with a radar unit and to make greater use of turbojet power, a more ambitious design began to be drawn up. While it had begun as an advanced design concept for the SR.53, upon the issuing of a development contract by the Ministry of Defence in May 1955 (to meet specification F.155), the project was given its own designation as the SR.177.

As work continued on the SR.53, a separate High Speed Development Section was formed by Saunders-Roe to work on the SR.177. Initially, the SR.177 was a straightforward development of the SR.53, sharing much of the same configuration and equipment, and it was envisioned that the first test flight would take place during the first half of 1957. However, in February 1955, an extensive redesign of the SR.177, with the aim of making the type suitable for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy, was commenced. Of the changes made to the aircraft, major differences included the repositioning of the jet engine to the lower fuselage lobe, which was now fed with air via a large, chin-mounted intake; the wing was also enlarged and blown flaps were adopted. The turbojet engine selected was the de Havilland Gyron Junior, capable of generating of thrust.

===Project launch===
In September 1955, Saunders-Roe received instructions to proceed on the SR.177 from the British Ministry of Supply. The Ministry also gave instruction for the production of mock-ups, windtunnel tests, and the development of construction jigs for the manufacture of an initial batch of aircraft. From the onset, the SR.177 faced competition in the form of an enlarged derivative of the Avro 720, which had itself been devised as a competitor against the smaller SR.53. Avro promoted the 720 to the Royal Navy, hoping to win favour away from the SR.177, which had by this point reached the detail design phase. The Ministry ultimately opted to cancel all work on the Avro 720, primarily as a cost-saving measure, as well as to concentrate development work on HTP-based rocket motors, such as those powering the SR.53 and SR.177.

The most significant difference between the SR.53 and SR.177 was the latter&#x27;s use of a jet engine with nearly five times the thrust of the one adopted for the former. While the SR.53 had relied mostly on its rocket engine for climbing, the SR.177 would be able to add considerable endurance by conserving use of its rocket for the dash towards a target only. It was expected that the added endurance would allow the SR.177 to perform roles other than pure interception; these roles were expected to include strike and reconnaissance missions. The SR.53 design had been considerably enlarged to accommodate the new engine, and the original sleek lines were forfeited for the chin-mounted air intake.

Following the maiden flight of the SR.53 in May 1957, the development of the SR.177 became the main focus of activity at Saunders-Roe. At this point, the project was viewed as having considerable large scale potential, as both the RAF and Royal Navy appeared to be set to be customers for the SR.177. The RAF sought to operate it alongside the incoming English Electric Lightning interceptors while, according to aviation author Derek Wood, the Royal Navy also had considerable interest in the programme. When the development contract had been issued in May 1955, it reflected this dual interest. The Navy&#x27;s requirements were defined in NA.47 while the RAF&#x27;s requirements were specified in OR.337, which had been issued by the Ministry of Supply as Operational Requirement F.155. There was optimism that a joint aircraft for the two services could be developed, saving considerable expense, time, and effort.

Negotiations on the exact number of aircraft sought by either service were protracted; but it had been established that there was demand for an initial batch of 27 SR.177 aircraft, and that sufficient tooling should be produced to enable the programme to transition rapidly to full-rate production. By April 1956, a consensus had emerged that, in order for the first five SR.177s to be completed by January 1958, these aircraft would be produced without any A.I. radar or the ability to support armaments. In July 1956, funding was secured for 27 aircraft to be produced, the first of which being expected to fly by April (later postponed to October) 1958. On 4 September 1956, a formal contract for the 27 aircraft was issued, which was sub-divided into four batches of five, four, four, and fourteen respectively, although the final eighteen were subject to evaluation and were thus pending confirmation. During 1957, a development contract for the SR.177 was announced for its use with the Royal Navy.

By January 1957, the design of the main component jigs was 70 per cent complete while the component assembly jigs were almost 50 per cent complete; the manufacture of a quantity production batch was nearing, which would have likely been subcontracted to another aviation company due to the high level of workload at Saunders-Roe&#x27;s Cowes facility. Armstrong Whitworth, who had already taken over work on the basic wing design of the SR.177, had been selected as the second production outlet for the type. The selection of a production center for the SR.177 was complicated by a favourable event; interest in the programme from the West German government. Since 1955, the revived German Air Force had sought a suitable high performance aircraft to equip itself with, and there were hopes that the SR.177 could become the foundation of a collaborative European fighter programme.

The German Defence Ministry had first expressed interest in the SR.177 in October 1955; in February 1956, the British Government Committee on Security consented to discussions being held on the SR.177. The prospects of a large German order for as many as 200 aircraft, and for the SR.177 to be manufactured under licence in Germany by the recovering German aircraft industry, were soon being aired, of which the British government declared its openness towards. In January 1957, the Anglo-German Standing Committee on Arms Supply reported that General Kammhuber, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, was concerned that, due to a lack of available financing until April 1958, the delivery timetable may not be satisfactory. According to Wood, Germany was keen to issue an order as soon as possible by this point.

===Decline and cancellation===
During 1957, the fate of the SR.177 was to be subject to a massive re-thinking of air defence philosophy in Britain, being principally outlined in the 1957 Defence White Paper, which called for crewed combat aircraft to be replaced by missiles. Very shortly afterwards, OR.337 was cancelled and the prospects of an order from the RAF had evaporated. This was a serious blow, while it the Royal Navy and Germany remained potential customers for the SR.177, the confidence of both parties was shaken by the move.

Work on the SR.177 continued for a little longer, however, in the anticipation of continued interest from Germany. In September 1957, Aubrey Jones, the Minister of Supply, was keen to support the programme and had agreed to continue funding development of five of the six prototypes. However, according to Wood, the SR.177 was subject to political in-fighting between Aubrey Jones and Duncan Sandys, the minister who had been the prime advocate of the Defence White Paper. While Jones assured German officials that the SR.177 project was continuing, Sandys contacted them to inform them that the aircraft was effectively dead. These mixed messages led to considerable confusion and apprehension within the German Defence Ministry. Further difficulty was added when, in response to lobbying by Rolls-Royce Limited, the German government insisted that the Rolls-Royce RB.153 engine be used in place of the Gyron Junior, causing Saunders-Roe to work on a further hasty redesign of SR.177.

The German government also decided to change its priorities from seeking an interceptor aircraft to acquiring a strike fighter instead, leading Saunders-Roe to redesign the aircraft for this role. However, even with Heinkel preparing to manufacture the SR.177 locally under licence, Germany chose to withdraw support from the venture in December 1957. The Minister had visited the German government in November 1957 as the Germans wanted the arrangements to be between governments instead of between their government and Saunders-Roe.

Of the remaining aircraft under consideration, the West German Government chose to purchase a development of the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptor instead to meet the role of &quot;high-altitude reconnaissance machine, a tactical fighter-bomber, and an all-weather fighter&quot;, along with the majority of European governments. This Lockheed coup, known as the &quot;Deal of the Century&quot;, caused major political controversy in Europe and the West German Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss was almost forced to resign over the issue. During later investigation into Lockheed&#x27;s business practices, it was discovered that Lockheed had paid out millions of dollars in &quot;sales incentives&quot; in each of these countries in order to secure the deal. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands confessed to taking more than one million dollars in bribes from Lockheed to buy the F-104.

Following the withdrawal of German interest and there being no requirement for the SR.177 by the RAF, the existing Royal Navy requirement was considered not worthwhile to proceed with. Accordingly, the Ministry of Supply soon chose to cancel the project. On 24 December 1957, a letter from the Ministry was received by Saunders-Roe, announcing the decision to terminate. Saunders-Roe announced that it expected to make 1,000 workers redundant as a result of the termination. As the jigs and near-complete aircraft was disassembled during the New Year, it was decided that the aircraft assemblies themselves should be stored in the event of the project being revived.

In 1958, the SR.177 received one last burst of interest when Japan, which was interested in developing a rocket-jet fighter itself, approached Britain with a request for quotations for the purchase of the two prototype SR.53s along with the completion of two SR.177s. However, due to a lack of backing from the British government, this initiative did not come to anything; the Japanese ultimately turned to the F-104 as well. Woods summarises the cancellation of the SR.177 as: &quot;...it could ultimately have been built in hundreds or thousands. Due to ridiculous defence policies and a complete lack of Whitehall inter-departmental collaboration in the technology field, one of the most promising projects in a decade was destroyed&quot;.

<text>The French River (, ) is a river in Central Ontario, Canada. It flows from Lake Nipissing southwest to Georgian Bay. The river largely follows the boundary between the Parry Sound District and the Sudbury District, and in most contexts is considered the dividing line between Northern and Southern Ontario. The French River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1986.

==Geography==

The French River flows through typical Canadian Shield country, in many places exposing rugged glaciated rock but also through heavily forested areas on the upper portion. The mouth of the river contains countless islands and numerous channels which vary from narrow, enclosed steep-walled gorges, falls and rapids, to broad expanses of open water.

Tributaries of this river include the:
*Wanapitei River
*Pillow River
*Murdock River
*Wolseley River
*Little French River
*Pickerel River
*Restoule River
*Hall River

==History==
It was used as a transportation corridor by the Algonquian peoples of this region. The Ojibwa named it Emitigoozhii-ziibi. It became known to Europeans as the &quot;French River&quot; because it became associated with French explorers of the 17th century, including Étienne Brûlé, Samuel de Champlain and Pierre-Esprit Radisson, and missionaries.

Other explorers who later followed this route included Simon Fraser, Alexander Mackenzie and David Thompson.

Together with the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers, the French River formed part of the water highway from Montreal to Lake Superior in the days of the fur trade. It remained a major canoe route until about 1820. Around 1855, the Grand Trunk Railway provided newfound access to the area and the Georgian Bay. This led to increased exploration and interest for fishing and logging during the era of the Industrial Revolution. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, there was a boom in logging along with the creation of Lumber barons in the Great Lakes. The French River was &quot;ripe for the picking with its seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber and proximity to the American markets&quot;.

Near the end of the 19th century, logging became the primary activity in the area. It was later settled as a summer tourist and recreation area. For this reason, the French River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1985. Because of the rugged nature of the Canadian Shield country surrounding this river, large parts of this river remain relatively untouched and it is now a popular location for recreational canoeing, kayaking, photography, camping, fishing and boating.

Following bouts of overfishing, in 1994 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources placed a slot limit on fishing to protect prime breeding year classes and increase the trophy fish population in the French River.

==French River Waterway Provincial Park==

Most of the river&#x27;s shores from Lake Nipissing to the Georgian Bay, except for the land occupied by the Dokis First Nation between the Upper, Middle and Lower French River, have been protected and designated as a provincial waterway park. There are 230 undeveloped back-country campsites available in the park along the river. French River continues to attract vacationers and cottage owners who enjoy the clear water, superb fishing, rocky shores and pine growth forests.

<text>Stealers Wheel were a Scottish folk rock/rock band formed in 1972 in Paisley, Scotland, by former school friends Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty. Their best-known hit is &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;. The band broke up in 1975 and re-formed briefly in 2008.

==Biography==
Egan and Rafferty met as teenagers in Paisley, and became the core of Stealers Wheel. They were initially joined by Roger Brown, Rab Noakes and Iain Campbell in 1972. By the time the band was signed to A&amp;M Records later that year, Brown, Noakes and Campbell had been replaced by Paul Pilnick, Tony Williams and Rod Coombes.

This second line-up recorded &quot;Stealers Wheel&quot; (October 1972), produced by American songwriters and producers Leiber &amp; Stoller, and it was a critical and commercial success, reaching No. 50 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, with their hit single &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; coming from the album. On 7 November 1972 the band appeared on BBC 2&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, performing &quot;I Get By&quot; and &quot;Late Again&quot;.
By the time the first album was released, Rafferty had left the band; Luther Grosvenor filled in for him on tour. Tony Williams also left shortly afterwards, and DeLisle Harper joined on bass for the tour.

&quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; reached No. 6 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart in 1973, selling over one million copies worldwide, and was awarded a gold disc. With the album also selling well, Rafferty was persuaded to return. However, Grosvenor, Coombes, Pilnick, and Harper all left the band. The band officially became a duo with various backing musicians on guitar, bass, and drums. Later in 1973, the single &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Agreed That Everything Will Turn Out Fine&quot; had modest chart success, and in 1974, the single &quot;Star&quot; reached the top 30 of both the UK and US charts. Reviewing the single &quot;Star&quot;, David Middleton at PopRockNation wrote:
A catchy shuffle of the Lennonesque variety, &#x27;Star&#x27; is 3 minutes of pure shimmering acoustic-guitar pop loveliness and honey-throated vocal harmonies, punctuated with spikes of harmonica, kazoo, woodblock, and bawdy barrelhouse piano.

A second album, &quot;Ferguslie Park&quot;, was released in 1973, with the duo supported by nine musicians. The album, named after an area of Paisley, just barely reached the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was a commercial failure. With increasing tensions between Egan and Rafferty, and with Leiber &amp; Stoller also having business problems, Stealers Wheel went on a year and a half hiatus. By the time their third and final album &quot;Right or Wrong&quot; was released in 1975, they completely disbanded. Because of disagreements and managerial problems, it was produced by Mentor Williams. In 1978, A&amp;M released the compilation album &quot;Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan — Stuck in the Middle with You (The Best of Stealers Wheel)&quot;.

Another compilation album, &quot;Best of Stealers Wheel&quot;, was released in 1990. In 1992, director Quentin Tarantino used the track &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; on the soundtrack of his debut film &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; in which it was used in the iconic scene involving the torture of a police officer. A dance version of &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; was a UK top 10 hit for Louise in September 2001, with a music video that drew heavily on the original song&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;.

All three albums had been unavailable for many years, though in 2004 and 2005 the British independent record label Lemon Recordings, of Cherry Red, re-released them using vinyl sources rather than tapes.

After being contacted by iTunes and K-tel in California, Tony Williams briefly re-formed Stealers Wheel in Blackpool in 2008 with Rod Coombes and Paul Pilnick, together with close friend Tony Mitchell. On 10 November 2008, they started filming a music video for a re-recording of &quot;Stuck in the Middle&quot; on the Fylde coast. They also began writing new songs although they had no plans to tour, and disbanded again.

Gerry Rafferty died on 4 January 2011 of liver failure.

In early 2016, independent record label Intervention Records reissued both &quot;Stealers Wheel&quot; and &quot;Ferguslie Park&quot; on 180-gram vinyl.

In 2017, Caroline reissued all three in a mini-boxed set with three BBC bonus tracks on the first album. All were remastered.

Rab Noakes died on 11 November 2022, at the age of 75.

Joe Egan died on 6 July 2024 at the age of 77.

<text>Peter Warren (born 1941) is a Canadian investigative journalist, private investigator, former talk radio host and member of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Born in London, one of three sons, himself, Tim Warren and John Warren. Warren worked briefly as a junior sports reporter on Fleet Street after being expelled from Dulwich College and then completing his education at Reigate Grammar School. He then moved to Canada where he wrote for various newspapers including The Calgary Herald, The Toronto Telegram, The Winnipeg Tribune (columnist),The Saint John Telegraph-Journal (columnist), The New York Standard. He has also written for Maclean&#x27;s magazine, The Globe and Mail, The Manchester Guardian, TIME Magazine, and was a staff writer and columnist with The Hong Kong Star. He celebrated 50 years in Canada (all as a journalist) on Nov. 10, 2009.

Warren rose to fame as an &quot;open line&quot; radio talk show host, a career he would enjoy for 35 years, the longest such tenure in North America. Warren moderated the popular &quot;Action Line&quot; morning talk show on CJOB in Winnipeg, Manitoba from 1971 to 1998;. He moved to Victoria, British Columbia and hosted a syndicated weekend radio program, &quot;[Warren on the Weekend]&quot; from 1998 to 2006. In March 2006 he left radio to concentrate on his work as an investigative journalist probing cold cases and wrongful convictions. An outspoken critic of the Canadian justice system, Warren had in the past used his show to campaign on behalf of wrongfully convicted persons such as David Milgaard, Steven Truscott, James Driskell, Thomas Sophonow and on behalf of the families of victims of alleged serial killer Robert Pickton. The final edition of &quot;Warren on the Weekend&quot; aired on March 5, 2006.

==Career highlights and trivia==
Throughout his career, Warren has been noted for his bold editorials, aggressive interview style and nose for detective work. He has donated personal archives to the University of Manitoba judged to be of &quot;outstanding significance and national importance&quot; by the Canadian Cultural Property Board. He has interviewed seven Canadian Prime Ministers head-to-head. Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau once said that an interview with him &quot;was worse than Question Period.&quot;

*He has gone undercover as a prisoner in a federal penitentiary and as a patient in a psychiatric hospital for investigative purposes. In 1980, after establishing a daily world-exclusive radio interview with Iranian students holding 52 hostages in the American Embassy in Iran, Flora MacDonald, Canadian foreign affairs minister, telephoned and asked him not to air the following day&#x27;s scheduled broadcast—and, later, the world found out why: in what became known as &quot;the Canadian Caper,&quot; six American diplomats were smuggled out of the Canadian embassy with government-endorsed phony Canadian passports and whisked by air to Zurich.
After infiltrating a Ponzi (Pyramid) Scheme meeting at the Marlborough Hotel in Winnipeg, Warren produced a three-part series for The Winnipeg Tribune which resulted in the very first legislation against such practises in North America—for which he was later honored by the University of Mississippi journalism department.

*Four escaped convicts once gave themselves up to him on-the-air.
*In the 1980s, he carried on a lengthy correspondence with convicted child serial killer Clifford Olson.
*Child pornographer Robin Sharpe was a three-time guest on his show.
*His on-air demeanour was occasionally . &quot;Get on with it!&quot; became a trademark phrase he used to prod callers.
*In October, 1999 the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council found that Warren was in breach of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Code of Ethics when he stated on-air at CKNW that &quot;Born-again Christians are the scum of the earth.&quot;
*He is a former boxer and accredited boxing judge, and has interviewed Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.

Warren has also dabbled in stage acting and narration for film and television.

<doc id="597918" wikidata="Q3376953" url="?curid=597918" title="Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren, KB (10 March 1703 – 29 July 1752) was a Royal Navy officer and politician who sat in the British House of Commons representing the constituency of Westminster from 1747 to 1752. Warren is best known for his career in the British navy, which he served in for thirty-six years and participated in numerous naval engagements, including most notably the capture of the French fortress of Louisbourg in 1745.

Born in Ireland to an Irish Catholic family, Warren&#x27;s parents raised him as a Protestant in order to allow him to pursue a career at sea. In 1716, Warren enlisted in the Royal Navy, largely spending the next decade serving off the West African coast or in the Caribbean, participating in anti-piracy operations and confrontations with Spanish coast guard vessels. Eleven years later in 1727, Warren was promoted to the rank of post-captain.

From 1728 to 1745, Warren served almost continuously in the Americas. He commanded the &quot;Solebay&quot; off New York, where he married Susannah Delancey in 1731; they had six children together. During the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, he participated in failed attacks on St. Augustine and Cartagena. In 1745, Warren joined an expeditionary force to attack the fortress of Louisbourg, leading a blockade which led to the garrison capitulating on 28 June.

Warren participated in the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747, being made a Knight Companion, before returning to England to pursue a political career. He was elected to Parliament in the 1747 general election, attending several parliamentary committees in addition to opposing a clause in the 1749 Consolidation Act. Warren died in Dublin on 29 July 1752. The towns of Warren, Rhode Island and Warren, New Hampshire were named for him.

==Early life==

Peter Warren was born in Warrenstown, Ireland. He was the youngest son of Michael Warren, an Irish Army officer and his wife Catherine Aylmer, the only daughter of Sir Christopher Aylmer, 1st Baronet. Though his parents were both Irish Catholics, they raised Warren as a Protestant in order to allow him to pursue a career at sea; Catholics in Ireland were prevented from enlisting in the Royal Navy due to the Penal Laws.

In 1716, Warren followed in the footsteps of his brother Oliver and enlisted in the Royal Navy, serving on board the &quot;Rye&quot; at the rank of ordinary seaman under the patronage of his maternal uncle Matthew Aylmer. After a brief stint in Irish waters, Warren spent roughly the next decade serving off the West African coast and the Caribbean Sea, where he participated in anti-piracy operations and confrontations with Spanish coast guard vessels.

On 23 July, Warren was promoted to the rank of lieutenant while serving on board the &quot;Guernsey&quot; off the Liberian coast to replace a fellow naval officer. Three years later, he was placed in command of the &quot;Falkland&quot; when her previous captain died. In 1727, Warren was promoted to commander on 28 May before being promoted to post-captain on 19 June, and was given command over the &quot;Grafton&quot; in 1728, serving as part of the Baltic Fleet.

==Career in the Americas==

Warren spent only a short time in the Baltic before joining the Mediterranean Fleet. There he was given command of the &quot;Solebay&quot;, and used it to deliver news of the Treaty of El Pardo to Jamaica and Veracruz in 1728. From 1730 to 1732, he commanded the &quot;Solebay&quot; in North America, operating off the coasts of New York and South Carolina. In 1734, Warren started serving in the Western Squadron, commanding the &quot;Leopard&quot; until 1735.

By the next year, Warren was serving in New York again and was made captain of the &quot;Squirrel&quot;, holding that command until 1741. After the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear broke out, Warren participated in a failed attempt to capture St. Augustine in 1740. After the battle, he sailed for Jamaica to serve under Edward Vernon in a failed British expedition against Cartagena on 1741; by January 1742, he was commanding the &quot;Superb&quot;, again in New York.

On 1742, Warren suggested to the British Admiralty that a new squadron be formed from ships serving in North America to serve in the West Indies during the winter season. The Admiralty accepted his suggestion in August of that year, and appointed him as the commander of the new squadron, which operated off the Leeward Islands and distinguished itself by capturing numerous French prizes during the War of the Austrian Succession.

In 1745, Warren participated in an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg. Warren led his squadron to Canso in April 1745, where he joined forces with a British expeditionary force and proceeded towards Louisbourg, instituting a blockade of the fortress harbour. His fleet captured the &quot;Vigilant&quot; on 20 May and soon received reinforcements, which combined with a planned British assault led to the fortress surrendering on 28 June.

Warren received praise in Britain for his role in the capture, and was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral on 10 August 1745. He was also appointed as the first governor of Cape Breton Island, though Warren pleaded with to the Admiralty to find a replacement as he was attempting to secure the governorship of New York from George Clinton. Being relieved of the position in June 1746, Warren eventually returned to England after planning for an invasion of New France with Governor William Shirley which ultimately came to nothing.

==Later life and death==

Once he had arrived in England, Warren presented the Admiralty with a new scheme for an invasion of New France which he had planned out with Shirley. However, the Admiralty noted they could not undertake the scheme and have enough ships to maintain the ongoing British blockade of French ports; instead, they ordered Warren to lead an eight-ship squadron to reinforce the occupation of Louisbourg. However, they soon ordered him to take his flagship &quot;Devonshire&quot; and join a fleet under George Anson in the Bay of Biscay, which was cruising in the area for French warships.

In May 1747, Warren was part of the British fleet which encountered a French force under the command of the Marquis de la Jonquière off Cape Finisterre and defeated it. Warren was made a Knight of the Bath and given £31,496 in prize money as a reward for his actions. On June of that year, he was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral and given command of the Western Squadron, though he handed control of the squadron over to Edward Hawke in August due to an illness. In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed, which put an end to the ongoing conflict.

Warren now turned his attention towards political affairs, having been elected to the House of Commons in the 1747 British general election representing the constituency of Westminster. In Parliament, Anson alienated some of his supporters by opposing a clause in the 1749 Consolidation Act being put forth by Anson which stipulated that naval officers on half-pay would be subject to courts-martial on the same terms as serving officers. Warren convinced the Admiralty to remove the clause, though this led to his relationship with Anson to become irrevocably hostile.

In addition to naval affairs, Warren was also active in attending parliamentary committees, chairing several and delivering numerous proposed bills to the House of Lords himself. He also advocated for a stronger Royal Navy and alliances with other European nations to counter French ambitions, in addition to involving himself on discussions concerning British currency and overseas trade, fishing and boundary issues in Britain&#x27;s colonial empire. In 1747, Warren proposed new uniforms for the Royal Navy, specifically those worn by flag officers such as admiral and captains.

As his political career led him settling down in London, Warren purchased a home at 15 Cavendish Square. In 1752, he was elected against his wishes to the Court of Aldermen from the ward of Billingsgate; on 23 June, Warren sent a letter to the court requesting to be excused from serving his duties in exchange for paying a small fine, which was accepted. While on a visit to Dublin, Warren died of a fever on 29 July 1752 and was buried in Warrenstown. After his death, Louis-François Roubiliac was commissioned to sculpt a monument to Warren in Westminster Abbey.

==Personal life, family and legacy==

During his military career, Warren amassed over £127,405 in prize money, primarily from capturing French and Spanish ships during the War of the Austrian Succession. He spent his fortune on purchasing large amounts of land in both Britain and the Thirteen Colonies and running a moneylending business which operated in England, Ireland and North America. Warren also made money by transporting bullion owned by the South Sea Company while commanding the &quot;Falkland&quot; in 1726.

Warren owned lands in Hampshire, England, New York and Pennsylvania. In 1732, he invited his nephew William Johnson to manage his estates in the Mohawk Valley region, charging him with clearing the land and settling European tenant labourers, in addition to establishing trading relationships with local indigenous American tribes. On his American estates, Warren owned a number of slaves, purchasing over twenty enslaved labourers to work under Johnson in 1744.

In July 1731, Warren married Susannah Delancey, the daughter of Stephen Delancey; the couple would go on to have six children. His only son (along with a daughter) died in a smallpox epidemic in 1744, and when Warren was offered a baronetcy in the next year, he declined the offer as he no longer had a son to inherit it. Warren&#x27;s eldest daughter Anne married Charles FitzRoy on 27 July 1758, while his third daughter Charlotte married Lord Abingdon on 7 July 1768.

During and after his life, numerous locations in both England and North America were named after Warren. The towns of Warren, Rhode Island and Warren, New Hampshire were named after him, as were several streets in Charleston, South Carolina, London, Louisbourg and New York City. In addition, Warren&#x27;s involvement in the capture of Louisbourg has been credited as helping to inspire significant interest among the British public of North American affairs for the first time.

<text>Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut (; Vivaro-Alpine: &quot;Sant Sauvador de Montagut&quot;) is a commune of the Ardèche department in southern France.

The rivers Eyrieux, Glueyre and Auzène flow through the town.

==Sights==
Ruins of an early-medieval castle (which was used as a watch tower/outpost) on one of the hills are the main historical remnant of what is one of France&#x27;s most sparsely populated areas.

==Population==
==Culture==
Protestantism is strong in the town, with the town having both a Protestant temple and a Roman Catholic church.

==Economy==
Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut had quite a large textile industry, but in modern times there are hardly any factories left. However, a medium-sized plant nursery now exists, along with a nursing home, a mineral water producer, a comprehensive school and an ice-cream factory.

==Tourism==
In the summer months many tourists, mainly from the Netherlands, flock to the town where attractions such as &quot;la Plage&quot; (an artificial beach), a canoe-kayak centre and various paths for hiking/walking make the town a very good tourist spot. There are also two camp sites in the town, one in the outskirts and one in the small suburb of &quot;le Moulinon&quot;. There are also tourist cottages and other settlements such as the hamlet Maléon which also make up the town.

<doc id="597944" wikidata="Q847911" url="?curid=597944" title="Shehnai">
<text>The shehnai is a type of oboe from the Indian subcontinent. It is made of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end. It was one of the nine instruments found in the royal court. The shehnai is similar to South India&#x27;s nadaswaram.

== Characteristics ==
This tubular instrument gradually broadens towards the lower end. It usually has between six and nine holes. It employs one set of quadruple reeds, making it a quadruple reed woodwind. To master the instrument, the musician must employ various and intricate embouchure and fingering techniques.

The shehnai has a range of two octaves, from the A below middle C to the A one line above the treble clef (A3 to A5 in scientific pitch notation). A shehnai is often but not always made with a body of wood or bamboo and a flared metal end.

== Origin of the shehnai ==
The shehnai is thought to have been brought by the Mughal Empire as its use was most associated with the Mughal courts and it&#x27;s sound closely resembles the trumpet known as &quot;doira&quot; in modern day Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan which was the ancestral homeland of Mughals. The adaptation has been developed by improving upon the pungi (a woodwind folk instrument used primarily for snake charming).

The counterparts to the shehnai played in Western India and Coastal Karnataka are indigenous to the territory. Shehnai players were/are an integral part of Goan/Konkani region and the temples along the western coast and the players are called &quot;Vajantri&quot; and were allotted lands for services rendered to the temples.

== Music ==
It takes a lot of effort to play these instruments. The performance of the instrumentalist is essential, especially for a long and fast-paced song. In the Kannada film &quot;Sanaadi Appanna&quot; this instrument was used widely.

The shehnai is played during religious festivities and wedding celebrations.

<doc id="597946" wikidata="Q5622310" url="?curid=597946" title="Guy Hands">
<text>Guy Hands (born 27 August 1959) is an English financier and investor. He is most notable as the founder and former chairman of Terra Firma Capital Partners, one of the largest private equity firms in Europe. Hands also was chairman of the UK music company EMI.

Hands is well known for his frequently outspoken comments about the private equity industry. In April 2009, he moved from the UK to Guernsey where Terra Firma is based.

==Biography==
Hands was born in London, to South African parents, who had lived in Southern Rhodesia. As a small boy he attended Holy Trinity School, Cookham, where he was diagnosed as severely dyslexic. At the age of nine, he was sent to Ravenscroft, a prep school which had a specialist class for dyslexics, and in a Ravenscroft production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1970 he played the part of Lady Macbeth opposite Christopher Newbury as Macbeth. From there, he went on to The Judd School, at Tonbridge, where there is now a Guy Hands Library.

Hands studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Mansfield College, Oxford. While there, he held the office of Bursar of the Oxford Union and was also President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in Michaelmas Term 1980. Hands later provided funding for construction of the Hands Building at Mansfield College.

===Early career===
Before arriving at Oxford, Hands started a business selling pictures. Once he was there, it became known as &#x27;Artsake&#x27; and employed a number of his fellow students.

Hands started his City career in 1982 as a eurobond trader at Goldman Sachs. He was appointed Head of Eurobond trading in 1986 and later rose to become head of global asset structuring world-wide for Goldman&#x27;s European division in 1990. In 1994, Hands left Goldman to found Nomura&#x27;s Principal Finance Group, which focused on European private equity investments. Hands joined Nomura after three other banks, including Goldman, turned down his investment plan. At Nomura, Hands and his team completed over $20 billion of leveraged buyouts. By 2000, Hands was reported to have generated profits for the bank in excess of $1.9 billion, making him a star financier in London. Hands&#x27; most notable acquisitions at Nomura included Annington Homes, as well as William Hill, the bookmaker, and Angel Trains, the UK rolling stock company. As well, Hands effectively became the UK&#x27;s biggest pub landlord through a series of acquisitions in the 1990s. In 1996, Hands played a central role in the sale of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s 57,400 homes for military personnel and their families to Annington Homes, which had been established earlier that year as a shell company by Nomura, making Annington the largest owner of residential property in England and Wales.

===Terra Firma===

In 2002, Hands founded Terra Firma Capital Partners, as a spinout from Nomura, which he had built into one of the largest private equity investors in Europe. Terra Firma debuted with a €2 billion private equity fund, immediately making it one of the larger private equity investors in Europe.

The firm&#x27;s early investments, while still a division of Nomura, focused on housing (Annington Homes), leasing companies and pubs. Since 2002, the firm has made major investments in the waste management (Waste Recycling Group), energy (BGCL, East Surrey Holdings, Phoenix Natural Gas), aircraft leasing (AWAS), cinema (Odeon Cinemas/UCI) and music sectors (EMI). TFCP has also made significant investments in German residential housing (Deutsche Annington) and motorway services (Tank &amp; Rast).

Terra Firma is now also one of the world&#x27;s leading private equity investors in renewable energy. Its investments include the UK-based green energy business (Infinis), a US wind energy business (EverPower) and an Italian solar energy business (RTR).

Hands and Terra Firma are also known for the failed investment in British music company EMI, which was later taken over by Citigroup, the main lender in the investment. Citigroup took ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma on 1 February 2011, wiping out the firm&#x27;s investments and writing off £2.2 billion of debt. Despite implementing an operational turnaround, Terra Firma was reported to have lost $2.5 billion in the EMI transaction, representing roughly one-third of Terra Firma&#x27;s investor&#x27;s capital as well as more than 60% of Hands&#x27; personal net worth. Hands had spent much of 2010 engaged in litigation with Citigroup, claiming the bank engaged in fraud during its auction of EMI in 2007. The lawsuit went to trial in New York in late 2010 and resulted in a jury finding in favour of Citigroup. This verdict was however overturned in May 2013, after a US federal appeals court found that the American trial judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury on a point of English law.

A new, judge-led trial was heard by Mr Justice Burton in London in June 2016. After two days of evidence, during which Hands admitted on more than one occasion that he didn&#x27;t have &#x27;that memory anymore&#x27;, lawyers for Terra Firma withdrew the case with all costs to be borne by Terra Firma. Burton said: &quot;I’m sure this is the right result&quot;. Citi said: &quot;We have always maintained that the allegations made by Terra Firma were entirely baseless.&quot; Hands said the claims had been brought in good faith, but that documentation and memories of these events after nine years was no longer sufficient to meet the high demands of proof required, and that the matter is now closed.

In August 2023, it was announced that Hands was retiring from Terra Firma as Chairman and Chief Investment Officer in order to meet his long-term goal of retiring by his 64th birthday, as per the Beatles song. Hands remains involved in the Terra Firma portfolio businesses that are Hands family investments.

In 2024, the Financial Times reported that a number of Terra Firma employees, over the period 2002–2023, accused Hands of humiliating staff, raging at staff, and repeatedly telling sexually explicit stories at work.

===Other businesses===
Hands and his wife own Hand Picked Hotels, a chain of 21 English country house properties, which is run by Julia Hands.

In 2017, Guy and Julia Hands agreed to acquire McDonald&#x27;s Nordic operations. The Nordic countries consisted of approximately 435 restaurants, 95% of which are franchised. The deal would see Hands become the developmental licensee and master franchiser for McDonald&#x27;s in the region.

In December 2020, Hands took a stake in ROXi, as part of a £13 million fundraiser led by Sun Capital Partners, a company managed by Hugh Osmond, the former owner of PizzaExpress and Center Parcs. ROXi had been founded by Rob Lewis in 2014.

== Personal life ==
While at Oxford, Hands became a friend of William Hague, who in 1984 was best man at his wedding to Julia Caroline Ablethorpe. The couple have two sons and two daughters. His wife&#x27;s house in Kent, just outside Sevenoaks, was once presented to Winston Churchill, while their estate in Tuscany, Villa Saletta, produces wine and olive oil. The estate&#x27;s wines have won numerous international awards.

In April 2009, in protest at high British taxes, Hands moved to Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It was reported in February 2010 that since then he had not visited the United Kingdom, and that members of his family were travelling to Guernsey to see him. In 2014, the writer Malcolm Gladwell called the move to Guernsey an &quot;incredibly interesting pathology&quot;, viewing departure into tax exile as a significant reverse for Hands to set against the benefits of being immensely wealthy.

In May 2019, Hands admitted to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he had a food addiction to roast potatoes and gravy and that he had sought treatment from hypnosis to combat it.

In 2021, Hands published ‘The Dealmaker: Lessons from a Life in Private Equity’, a personal account of his experiences from childhood to dealmaking. &quot;The Times&quot; labelled it as ‘the only book about private equity to read like a thriller’.

Hands has been increasingly vocal about the risks associated with climate change continuing and the huge difficulties and costs involved in stopping it.

=== Philanthropy ===
Hands and his wife have donated millions of pounds to Mansfield College, Oxford since 1995. Mansfield hosts an annual Hands Lecture series. Since 2014, the Hands family has donated £2.2 million towards Mansfield&#x27;s Love Lane building, which will house the University&#x27;s new Institute of Human Rights.

Hands was named the 2018 Philanthropist of The Year at the annual Spear&#x27;s Wealth Management Awards for his contributions to a number of charities.

=== Honours and appointments ===
* 2000 - elected a &quot;Global Leader of Tomorrow&quot; of the World Economic Forum
* President of &quot;Access for Excellence&quot;
* Bancroft Fellow of Mansfield College, Oxford

<doc id="597949" wikidata="Q943454" url="?curid=597949" title="Ball (Iron Butterfly album)">
<text>Ball is the third studio album by the rock band Iron Butterfly, released on January 17, 1969. After the enormous success of &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;, Iron Butterfly modified its acid-rock sound somewhat and experimented with more melodic compositions. The band&#x27;s trademark heavy guitars, however, are still evident on such tracks as &quot;In the Time of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;. The album reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, making &quot;Ball&quot; more immediately successful than &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;. In Canada the album reached number 4. &quot;Ball&quot; was certified Gold in March 1969. It also spawned two minor hit singles: &quot;Soul Experience&quot; (b/w &quot;In the Crowds&quot;), an uncharacteristically uplifting song for the group, went to number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number 50 in Canada, and despite its nightmarish musical tones and morbid lyrics, &quot;In the Time of Our Lives&quot; (b/w &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;) managed to reach number 96 and number 81 in Canada. This is the second and final studio album to feature the famous lineup of Ingle, Bushy, Dorman and Brann.

In 1999, Collector&#x27;s Choice Music released &quot;Ball&quot; with two bonus tracks, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help But Deceive You Little Girl&quot; and &quot;To Be Alone&quot;, which were both recorded during the same era as &quot;Ball&quot; (although not necessarily during the same recording sessions) and were previously released as the two sides of a 7&quot; single. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help But Deceive You Little Girl&quot; had also been released on the 1993 compilation &quot;Light &amp; Heavy: The Best of Iron Butterfly&quot;.

<doc id="597956" wikidata="Q7034751" url="?curid=597956" title="Nikaya Buddhism">
<text>The term Nikāya Buddhism was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi as a non-derogatory substitute for Hinayana, meaning the early Buddhist schools. Examples of these groups are pre-sectarian Buddhism and the early Buddhist schools. Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term. The term Theravada refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the Pāli Canon.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Nikāya&quot; is a Pali word meaning &quot;group&quot; or &quot;assemblage&quot;, referring to the collection of early Buddhist schools or non-Mahayana schools.

== In Indian Buddhism ==
=== Overview ===
Early Buddhism in India is generally divided into various monastic fraternities, or nikāyas. Conventionally numbering eighteen, the actual count varied over time. The doctrinal orientation of each school differed somewhat, as did the number of piṭakas in their canon. An example of this is the Dharmaguptaka, which included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a Dhāraṇī Piṭaka.

=== In the Mahāsāṃghika branch ===
The Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas generally advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Therefore, for the Mahāsāṃghikas, the bodhisattva ideal and buddhahood was advocated over the ideal of becoming an arhat.

Avalokitavrata wrote of the Mahāsāṃghikas as using a &quot;Great Āgama Piṭaka&quot;, which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Prajñāparamitā&quot; and the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;. In the Caitika group of nikāyas, the Pūrvaśailas and the Aparaśailas each were known to have the &quot;&quot; in Prakrit. Bhāvaviveka also wrote of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Pūrvaśailas and Aparaśailas both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, implying organized collections of Mahāyāna texts within these Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas.

===In the Sthaviravāda branch===
In the Sthavira nikāya, the Sarvāstivādins were a major nikāya. The Sarvāstivādin &quot;&quot; is known to employ the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of three vehicles: Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna, and Bodhisattvayāna. References to the Bodhisattvayāna and the practice of the Six pāramitās are commonly found in Sarvāstivāda works as well.

The Theravada sect from Sri Lanka generally accepts the three vehicles, but categorizes these as three different types of bodhi, or enlightenment. The Theravada nikaya only uses the Pāli Canon, which has three piṭakas, and does not contain separate literature for bodhisattvas. Walpola Rahula writes of this, &quot;At the end of a religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three Bodhis - Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they wish according to their capacity.&quot;

== Relationship to Mahāyāna ==

Jan Nattier writes that there is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has similarly noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the Indian nikāyas, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to one of these nikāyas. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikāya in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda nikāya in Tibetan Buddhism.

==&quot;Hinayana&quot; and Nikaya Buddhism==
Many commenters on Buddhism have used the term Hīnayāna to refer to Nikāya Buddhism. However, that term is now generally seen as flawed:
* Hīnayāna, (literally &quot;inferior vehicle&quot;), is often regarded as an offensive or pejorative term.
* Hīnayāna was coined by the Mahāyāna, and has never been used by Nikāya Buddhists to refer to themselves.
* Hīnayāna as a technical term, indicated the vehicles of both the Sāvakabuddha and the pratyekabuddha, whereas as a division of Buddhism, it refers solely to the individuals who follow the former vehicle, towards the achievement of Savakabuddhahood, while the Mahāyāna in the sense of the bodhisattva path existed within the early schools already.
* It is sensible to use a terms for a division of population which is ideally used by themselves, and failing that, at least not offensive to them.

According to Robert Thurman, the term &quot;Nikāya Buddhism&quot; was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, as a way to avoid the usage of the term Hinayana. &quot;Nikaya Buddhism&quot; is thus an attempt to find a more neutral way of referring to Buddhists who follow one of the early Buddhist schools, and their practice.

The term Śrāvakayāna (literally, &quot;hearer vehicle&quot; or &quot;disciples&#x27; vehicle&quot;) is also sometimes used for the same purpose. Other terms that have been used in similar senses include sectarian Buddhism or conservative Buddhism. Note that nikāya is also a term used in Theravāda Buddhism to refer to a subschool or subsect within Theravada.

Like the term Hinayana Buddhism, the term Nikāya Buddhism focuses on the presumed commonality between the schools, and not on the actual schools themselves. This commonality is thought to be found in a certain attitude. The term &quot;Nikāya Buddhism&quot; tries to shift the attention to the more neutral issue of attitude concerning the authenticity of scriptures.

A concise analysis by the Tibetan Buddhist, Reginald Ray, summarises the mistaken and confusing use of the term &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; to refer to any contemporary extant schools:

<text>Chaudhri Muhammad Ali (15 July 1905 – 2 December 1982) was a Pakistani politician and statesman who served as the fourth prime minister of Pakistan from 1955 until his resignation in 1956. His government transitioned Pakistan from a British Dominion to an Islamic Republic.

He resigned from the position of Prime Minister in 1958, and from the Muslim League as well, when he failed at healing rifts with Muslim League, and a new party, named as Republican Party. His credibility is noted for promulgating the first set of the Constitution of Pakistan lost political endorsement from his party when failing to investigate the allegations on vote rigging and the secret defections in favour of the Republican Party.

==Biography==
Muhammad Ali was born in Jullundar, Punjab on 15 July 1905 into an Arain Punjabi Muslim family.

After his matriculation, Muhammad Ali showed great aptitude for science, first moving to attend the Punjab University in Lahore where he read and graduated with BSc degree in chemistry in 1925. In 1927, Muhammad Ali attained MSc in chemistry from Punjab University, and lectured at the Islamia College until 1928.

In 1928, Muhammad Ali went to join the Indian Civil Service, first working as an accountant at the Audit and Accounts Service and was deputed to audit the Bahawalpur state. In 1936, Muhammad Ali was moved as Private Secretary to James Grigg, the Finance Minister of India, who later appointed him as the First Indian financial adviser when Grigg was appointed as the War Secretary in 1945. In 1946–47, Muhammad Ali was selected to serve as one of two secretaries to the Partition Council presided over by Lord Mountbatten, later appointed as Finance Secretary at the Ministry of Finance. Over this issue of partition, Muhammad Ali worked with H.M. Patel and Walter Christir to prepare a document titled &quot;The Administrative Consequences of Partition&quot;.

At the time of the India&#x27;s partition in 1947, Muhammad Ali opted for Pakistan.

After the establishment of Pakistan in 1947, Muhammad Ali was moved as the Finance Secretary under Finance Minister Sir Ghulam Muhammad, along with Victor Turner, but this appointment lasted until 1948 due a cabinet reshuffle. He was appointed as the Federal Secretary at the Establishment Division, and aided greatly in setting up the civil bureaucracy and preparing the nation&#x27;s first federal budget presented by Finance Minister Sir Ghulam Muhammad in 1951.

== Premiership ==
In 1951, Muhammad Ali was appointed as the Finance Minister by Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin and was announced to be kept in the Finance ministry in Bogra&#x27;s Talent ministry in 1953.

On 11 August 1955, Muhammad Ali was appointed as the Prime Minister of Pakistan by then-Governor-General Iskandar Mirza, upon the dismissal of the Bogra&#x27;s Talent administration. Prime Minister Ali placed a great emphasis on drafting the Constitution of Pakistan, and implemented the One Unit scheme despite regional opposition.

He favored French architect Michel Ecochard over Greek architect Constantinos Doxiadis for the planning of the new capital in 1955, though the project nonetheless went Doxiadis in the 1960s.

It was during his term that the first Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated, on 23 March 1956, where the nation-state was declared as Islamic republic with a parliamentary form of government. His premiership was endorsed by President Iskandar Mirza and the three-party coalition government composing of Awami League, Muslim League and the Republican Party at the National Assembly. In 1955, Prime Minister Ali took over the party presidency.

In July 1956, Muhammad Ali met with the Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru of India in an attempt to settle the key issue that was preventing the normalization of relations between Pakistan and India. This was the issue of Kashmir that had been divided between India and Pakistan in 1948. That issue remains unsettled to this day.

Despite his feat, Prime Minister Muhammad Ali proved to be a poor politician who failed to maintain control over his party when he reached a compromise to dismissed the cabinet members of his own party in favor of appointing the cabinet composing of Republican Party and Awami League in 1955–56. After appointing Abdul Jabbar Khan as the Chief minister of West-Pakistan who subsequently helped in secret trading in favor of Republican Party that made the Republicans in majority in the National Assembly, the Muslim League demanded its president to investigate the matter but Prime Minister Ali refused to support the parliamentary resolution in the National Assembly by believing that &quot;he was responsible only to the Cabinet and the Parliament, not the party.&quot;

On 8 September 1956, the parliamentary leaders of the Muslim League under A.Q. Khan, successfully brought the motion of no confidence at the National Assembly that effectively removed him from the party&#x27;s presidency. Despite support from President Mirza, Prime Minister Ali eventually resigned when Huseyn S. Suhrawardy gained support from the Muslim League for the premiership.

==Post resignation==
After his resignation, Ali joined the National Bank as an advisor. He tried playing a role in national politics in the 1960s, but was ostracized by the Muslim League due to his political role played in 1950s.

His son, Khalid Anwer, served as the law and justice minister in Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s administrations while his younger son, Amjad Ahsan Ali, is a medical doctor. In 1967, he wrote his memoir, &quot;The Emergence of Pakistan&quot;. He died due to a cardiac arrest on 2 December 1982 in estate in Karachi where he was buried.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium (, , PTB; , , PVDA; ) is a Marxist and socialist political party in Belgium. It is the only Belgian party represented in parliament that is a fully national party, representing both Flanders and Wallonia. Having historically been a small party, the PTB-PVDA has gained momentum since the 2010s, continuously scoring better at the elections, particularly in Wallonia and working-class communities in Brussels. It has 2 MEPs that sit in The Left group alongside other socialist parties.

== History ==
The Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium originated in the student movement at the end of the 1960s. Students (organized in the student union &quot;SVB&quot; – &quot;Studenten VakBeweging&quot;), mainly from the Catholic University of Leuven, turned towards the working-class movement. They considered the politics of the existing Communist Party of Belgium to be revisionist, i.e. too much turned toward social-democratic politics (represented in Belgium by the Belgian Socialist Party). They were influenced by the ideas of the Communist Party of China, guerrilla movements in Latin America, the movement against the Vietnam War, and the Leuven-Vlaams movement, all perceived as aspects of a worldwide struggle against colonial or neo-colonial oppression and for civil or workers&#x27; rights.

Their support and participation in an important strike in the coalmines turned the movement into a political party. They founded a periodical, AMADA (&quot;Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders&quot; – All Power To The Workers), which became the first name of their party. In 1979 the first congress was held, which adopted a Maoist programme and changed the name into PVDA-PTB. Ludo Martens became the first president, and remained an important ideologist of the party until his death in 2011.

The PTB-PVDA used to host the International Communist Seminar until 2014 which had become one of the main worldwide gatherings of communist parties.

Following its electoral defeat in 2003, the PVDA-PTB fundamentally changed its working methods and communication. On one hand, the PVDA-PTB said it would refocus on working with factory workers as well as on field work in the communities where it operates. On the other hand, the PVDA-PTB said it would officially break with what it calls its sectarian past to get closer to the concrete demands of citizens. This is reflected particularly by the demands put forward on very concrete issues, e.g. lower prices for medication, the reduction of VAT on energy products from 21% to 6%, an increase of the minimum pension, better control of rents or the lower cost of trash bags.

In preparation for the Belgian elections of June 2007, the &quot;Solidarity&quot; newspaper and the website of the party were merged in order to reach a wider public. The structures have also been &quot;open&quot; to a broader layer of activists.

On 2 March 2008, the work of the Eighth Congress of the PVDA-PTB was completed with a closing meeting at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This Congress was conducted with the theme of &quot;party renewal.&quot; A new Central Committee was elected, which in turn elected a new Bureau of the Party. 
This &#x27;shift&#x27; seems to have produced some positive results, such as an increase in membership and a rebound of the electoral score of the PVDA-PTB in recent elections. The last elections in May 2019 showed more progress: a breakthrough was realised at the Flemish and European level. Since 2018 the party is also represented in the municipal councils of larger cities in Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.

In September 2014, the party had more than 8,000 members, in 2020 the number had grown to 20,000. Its monthly publication &quot;&quot;Solidaire&quot; / &quot;Solidair&quot;&quot; has between 3,000 and 5,000 subscribers. COMAC, its youth movement, is active in all the universities in Belgium and in secondary schools (in Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels). The PVDA-PTB is also known for its 11 &quot;Medicine for the people&quot; medical centres, which provide free access to primary health care.

The newspaper &quot;Solidarity&quot;, and &quot;Medicine for the People&quot; organize &quot;ManiFiesta&quot;, a yearly festival of solidarity between the communities and the left in Belgium. The first edition was held in Bredene (by the sea) on 25 September 2010 and brought together 6,000 people from both North and South of Belgium. The fourth edition in 2013 attracted 10,000 people.

== Ideology and positions ==

The party is variously described as socialist and/or Marxist, with sources also variously describing it as left-wing or far-left. It is the furthest left party represented in the Belgian Federal Parliament.

The party advocates for strengthening workers&#x27; rights, increasing pensions, and decreasing the retirement age to 65, and supports expanding social programs and the welfare state. It supports increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations. It is opposed to austerity and neoliberalism.

A central part of the party&#x27;s program is the &quot;social climate revolution&quot;, which seeks to combat both climate change and social inequality. 

Although the party is in favor of greater ecological policies, the party has been in opposition to restrictions on individual car use, including opposing low emissions zones in Antwerp city center, paid parking in Schaerbeek, and increased fines for illegal parking in Liège. Despite this, the party also advocates for expanding public transit and making public transit free.

Elected representatives and full-time staff observe a pay cap indexed to the wages of a &quot;skilled worker&quot;, and the excess is donated to the party.

=== Foreign policy ===
The party abstained from the vote condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in the Chamber of Representatives. According to PTB MP Nabil Boukili, &quot;the diplomatic way is the only possible way to avoid a war&quot;. Party spokesman Raoul Hedebouw said he condemns the invasion of Ukraine but does not think NATO should be part of the solution.

According to political scientist Steven Van Hecke, in terms of foreign policy, parties such as the PVDA have both a pacifist and a socioeconomic agenda. For its socioeconomic aganda the PVDA often looks back nostalgically to Soviet communism, where the emphasis was on respect for the working class and rejection of market capitalism. Radical opposition parties tend to be dogmatic and reluctant to change course, according to Van Hecke, because they like to present themselves as principled. For example the PVDA has difficulty distancing itself from China.

=== Historical ===
Historically the party supported Marxism–Leninism and Maoism, although the party dropped references to Lenin and Mao, as well as references to other communist party governments, in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Political scientist Pascal Delwit claimed in 2014 that the PVDA still maintains a Marxist-Leninist line internally, but not to the outside world.

==Election results==
The general elections of 2007 saw the party obtaining 0.88% in the Flemish electoral district and 0.81% in Wallonia.

In the regional elections in 2009, the PVDA-PTB gained 1.04% of the vote in Flanders (+0.48%) and 1.24% of the vote in Wallonia (+0.62%). For the European elections on the same day, the results were: 0.98% in the Dutch-speaking electoral college (+0.37%) and 1.16% in the French-speaking electoral college (+0.35%).

In the general elections of June 2010, the party saw further growth. In Flanders it now represents 1.3% (+0.4%) of the votes for the Chamber of Representatives and 1.4% (+0.5%) for the Senate. Especially in the cities progress was noted with high scores in Antwerp (4.1%) and Liège (4.2%). The highest scores were gained in the cantons of Herstal (9.8%), Assenede (7.5%) and Seraing (7.3%); all places where the PVDA-PTB traditionally is strong.

The municipal and provincial elections in 2012 were considered a breakthrough on a local level for the PVDA-PTB. The party won 52 seats in total; 31 in municipal councils, 4 in provincial councils, and 17 in the district councils.

The federal and regional elections in 2014 saw further success for the party. They elected two deputies to the Chamber of Representatives, two others to the Walloon Parliament, and finally four to the Brussels Parliament.

An opinion poll released in July 2017 suggested the party was the most popular party in Wallonia at the time, with 25% of respondents indicating they intended to vote for the party. The second-most popular party was the Mouvement Réformateur, part of the governing coalition, with 23%. The poll indicated that the Workers&#x27; Party would win 26 seats in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives if the next federal election were held immediately, putting it in tied first place with the Flemish N-VA.

The party generally increased its vote share in the 2018 local elections, and won over 15% of the vote in several French-speaking cities.

In the 2019 Belgian federal election, the party scored well and gained 10 seats. The party did well in Wallonia (13.8% overall there), scoring over 16% in Liège Province, over 15% in Hainaut Province, and also over 12% in Brussels-Capital Region. It achieved at least 22% of the votes in both Charleroi and La Louvière cities. Its strongest showing in Flanders was 12.71% in Antwerp city, while in Wallonia, it&#x27;s strongest showing was in Herstal with 27.55% of the votes. The PTB was also the fourth largest party in the European election the same day in the Francophone areas, winning 14.59% and giving it one seat.

<text>Lamont Coleman (May 30, 1974February 15, 1999), known professionally as Big L, was an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Emerging from Harlem in New York City in 1992, Big L became known among underground hip-hop fans for his freestyling ability. He was eventually signed to Columbia Records, where, in 1995, he released his debut studio album, &quot;Lifestylez ov da Poor &amp; Dangerous&quot;. On February 15, 1999, he was fatally shot nine times in a drive-by shooting in Harlem.

Big L was noted for his use of wordplay, and writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX, and &quot;The Source&quot; have praised him for his lyrical ability. Henry Adaso described him as &quot;one of the most talented poets in hip-hop history.&quot;

In an interview with Funkmaster Flex, Nas claimed Big L &quot;scared me to death. When I heard [his performance at the Apollo Theater] on tape, I was scared to death. I said, &#x27;Yo, it&#x27;s no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.

== Early life ==
Coleman was born on May 30, 1974, in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He was the third and youngest child of Gilda Terry (d. 2008) and Charles Davis. Davis left the family while Coleman was a child. He had two older half-siblings: Donald and Leroy Phinazee (d. 2002). Coleman received the nicknames &quot;Little L&quot; and &quot;Mont-Mont&quot; as a child. His elder brother, Donald Phinazee, took Coleman to a Run-DMC concert at the Beacon Theatre when Coleman was about 7 years old. According to Phinazee, Coleman was awed by the performance which sparked his interest in rapping. By age 12, Coleman became a big hip-hop fan and started freestyling with other people in his neighborhood.

Coleman began writing rhymes in 1990. He also founded a group known as Three the Hard Way in 1990, but it was quickly broken up due to a lack of enthusiasm among the members which consisted of Coleman, Doc Reem, and Rodney. No projects were released, and after Rodney left, the group was renamed Two Hard Motherfuckers. Around this time, people started to refer to Coleman as &quot;Big L&quot;. In the summer of 1990, Coleman met Lord Finesse at an autograph session in a record shop on 125th Street. After he did a freestyle, Finesse and Coleman exchanged numbers.

Coleman attended Julia Richman High School and graduated in 1992. While in high school, Coleman freestyle battled regularly; in his last interview, he stated, &quot;In the beginning, all I ever saw me doing was battling everybody on the street corners, rhyming in the hallways, beating on the wall, rhyming to my friends. Every now and then, a house party, grab the mic, a block party, grab the mic.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1992–1995: First recordings and record deal ===
In 1992, Coleman recorded various demos, some of which were featured on his debut album &quot;Lifestylez ov da Poor &amp; Dangerous&quot;. On February 11, Coleman appeared on &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; with Lord Finesse to help promote Finesse&#x27;s studio album &quot;Return of the Funky Man&quot;. Coleman&#x27;s first professional appearance came on &quot;Yes You May (Remix)&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Party Over Here&quot; (1992) by Lord Finesse, and his first album appearance was on &quot;Represent&quot; off of Showbiz &amp; A.G.&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Slave&quot; (1992).

During this time, he won an amateur freestyle battle hosted by Nubian Productions which consisted of about 2,000 contestants. In 1993, Coleman signed to Columbia Records. In 1991, He joined Lord Finesse&#x27;s Bronx-based hip hop collective Diggin&#x27; in the Crates Crew (DITC) which consisted of Lord Finesse, Sun Kiss, Party Arty, D-Flow ,DJ Premier, Diamond D, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G. In 1993, Coleman released his first promotional single, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Son&quot;, and later said it was one of the first horrorcore singles, influencing others. He said he wrote the song because &quot;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of horror flicks. Plus the things I see in Harlem are very scary. So I just put it all together in a rhyme.&quot; However, he said he preferred other styles over horrorcore.

Coleman founded the Harlem rap group Children of the Corn (COC) with Killa Cam (Cam&#x27;ron), Murda Mase (Ma$e), legendary producer Six Figga Digga, Big Twan, Trooper J, Mike Boogie, Buddah Bless, MC Terra, Bloodshed (Blood Debiasi) and Herb McGruff in 1993. On February 18, 1993, he performed live at the Uptown Lord Finesse Birthday Bash at the 2,000 Club, which included other performances from Fat Joe, Nas, and Diamond D. In 1994, he released his second promotional single &quot;I Shoulda Used a Rubba&quot; (&quot;Clinic&quot;). On July 11, 1994, Coleman released the radio edit of &quot;Put It On&quot;, followed up by the release of the music video three months later. In 1995, the music video for the single &quot;No Endz, No Skinz&quot; debuted. It was directed by Brian Luvar.

His debut studio album, &quot;Lifestylez ov da Poor &amp; Dangerous&quot;, was released in March 1995. The album debuted at number 149 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 22 on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. &quot;Lifestylez&quot; would go on to sell over 200,000 copies as of 2000. Three singles were released from the album; the first two, &quot;Put It On&quot; and &quot;M.V.P.&quot;, reached the top 25 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Rap Tracks and the third &quot;No Endz, No Skinz&quot; did not chart.

=== 1996–1999: independent release ===
In late 1996, Big L was dropped from Columbia mainly because of a dispute with the label over artistic differences and he signed with D.I.T.C. to Tommy Boy Records.
 He stated, &quot;I was there with a bunch of strangers that didn&#x27;t really know my music.&quot;

In 1997, he started working on his second studio album, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;. COC folded when Bloodshed died in a car accident in New York on March 2, 1997. Later that year, DITC appeared in the July issue of &quot;On The Go Magazine&quot;. Coleman then appeared on O.C.&#x27;s single &quot;Dangerous&quot; from O.C.&#x27;s second album &quot;Jewelz&quot;. That November, he was the opening act for O.C.&#x27;s European Jewlez Tour.

In 1998, Big L formed his own independent label, Flamboyant Entertainment. According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, it &quot;planned to distribute the kind of hip-hop that sold without top 40 samples or R &amp; B hooks.&quot; That same year, Coleman released the single &quot;Ebonics&quot;. The song, based on African-American Vernacular English, was called one of the top five independent singles of the year by &quot;The Source&quot;. In May 1998, DITC released their first single, &quot;Dignified Soldiers&quot;. That September, Big L was featured in XXL&#x27;s iconic A Great Day in Hip Hop photograph, a replica of A Great Day in Harlem.

Following the release of &quot;Ebonics&quot;, Big L caught the eye of Damon Dash, the CEO of Roc-A-Fella Records. Dash offered to sign him to Roc-A-Fella, but Big L wanted his crew to sign as well. On February 8, 1999, Coleman, Herb McGruff, C-Town, &amp; Stan Spit started the process to sign with Roc-A-Fella as a group called &quot;The Wolfpack&quot;.

== Murder and aftermath ==
On February 15, 1999, Coleman was killed in a drive-by shooting at 45 West 139th Street in his native Harlem. He was hit nine times in the face and chest. Gerard Woodley, one of Coleman&#x27;s childhood friends, was arrested three months later for the crime. &quot;It&#x27;s a good possibility it was retaliation for something Big L&#x27;s brother did, or Woodley believed he had done,&quot; said a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department. Woodley was later released due to lack of evidence, and the murder case remains a cold case.

Woodley was fatally shot in the head on June 24, 2016. Woodley&#x27;s family maintains his innocence in Coleman&#x27;s killing. Rapper Cam&#x27;ron, who was a close friend of Coleman and Woodley, posted a video to Instagram claiming Coleman had attempted to murder Woodley a week before his death.

In 2017, Lou Black, Gerard Woodley&#x27;s cousin, published &quot;Ethylene: The Rise and Fall of The 139th St. NFL Crew&quot;. The book details Black&#x27;s first hand interactions with the NFL crew and Big L. In the book, Black claims Leroy &quot;Big Lee&quot; Phinazee, Coleman&#x27;s eldest half-brother and leader of the NFL crew, violated his probation when he was found to be in possession of an illegal weapon and was sentenced to prison. According to Black, while in prison, Phinazee met and contracted a hitman from Brooklyn to murder three members of the NFL gang including Woodley. Phinazee had tasked Big L to identify the targets to the hitman. On the day when the murder was planned, Woodley noticed the hitman following him and successfully scared him off. As Big L had been seen multiple times with the alleged hitman days prior, Woodley assumed Big L had taken part in the attempted shooting. Approximately a week after the attempted shooting of Woodley, Big L was killed. Black did not specify if Woodley personally killed Big L.

Big L is buried at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.

== Posthumous releases ==
The tracks &quot;Get Yours&quot;, &quot;Way of Life&quot;, and &quot;Shyheim&#x27;s Manchild&quot; b/w &quot;Furious Anger&quot; were released as singles in 1999 for DITC&#x27;s self-titled album (2000) on Tommy Boy Records. The album peaked at number 31 on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 141 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Coleman&#x27;s first posthumous single was &quot;Flamboyant&quot; b/w &quot;On the Mic&quot;, which arrived on May 30, 2000. The single peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and topped the Hot Rap Tracks, making it Coleman&#x27;s first and only number-one single.

Coleman&#x27;s second and final studio album, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, was released on August 1, 2000, and featured Fat Joe, Tupac Shakur, Guru of Gang Starr, Kool G Rap, and Big Daddy Kane among others. &quot;The Big Picture&quot; was put together by his manager and partner in Flamboyant Entertainment, Rich King. It contains songs that he had recorded and a cappella recordings that were never used, completed by producers and guest emcees that Coleman respected or had worked with previously.

&quot;The Big Picture&quot; debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number two on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and sold 72,549 copies. The album was certified gold a month later for shipments of 500,000 copies by the RIAA. &quot;The Big Picture&quot; was the only music by Big L to appear on a music chart outside of the United States, peaking at number 122 on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Children of the Corn: The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, a compilation album containing COC songs, was released in 2003. Big L&#x27;s next posthumous album, &quot;139 &amp; Lenox&quot;, was released on August 31, 2010. Issued by Rich King on Flamboyant Entertainment, it contained previously unreleased and rare tracks. The follow-up album, &quot;Return of the Devil&#x27;s Son&quot; (2010), peaked at number 73 on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Coleman&#x27;s next release was &quot;The Danger Zone&quot; (2011).

== Legacy and influence ==
Henry Adaso, a music journalist for About.com, called him the 23rd-best MC of 1987 to 2007, claiming &quot;[he was] one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip hop history.&quot; &quot;HipHopDX&quot; called Coleman &quot;the most underrated lyricist ever&quot;.
Many tributes have been given to Coleman. The first was by Lord Finesse and the other members of DITC on March 6, 1999, at the Tramps. &quot;The Source&quot; has done multiple tributes to him: first in July 2000, and then in March 2002.
&quot;XXL&quot; also did a tribute to Coleman in March 2003. On February 16, 2005, at SOB&#x27;s restaurant and nightclub in Manhattan, a commemoration was held for him. It included special guests such as DITC, Herb McGruff, and Kid Capri. All the money earned went to his estate.

In 2004, Eminem paid tribute to Coleman in the music video for his single &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot;. In an interview with MTV, Jay-Z stated: &quot;We were about to sign him right before he passed away. We were about to sign him to Roc-a-Fella. It was a done deal…I think he was very talented…I think he had the ability to write big records, and big choruses.&quot; Rapper Nas also said on MTV, &quot;He scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I said, &#x27;Yo, it&#x27;s no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.&#x27;&quot;

In 2017, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; said he believed Coleman would have been a &quot;top 3&quot; rapper all time if he had not been killed so prematurely. In 2019, Funkmaster Flex said &quot;People can get mad at me for saying this, but he was the best lyricist at the time. He was a better lyricist than Biggie and Jay-Z. He just didn&#x27;t have the marketing and promotion. Let me go on the record and say that. It&#x27;s the truth.&quot; In 2022, the 140th Street and Lennox Avenue intersection in Harlem was co-named Lamont &quot;Big L&quot; Coleman Way.

=== Style ===

Coleman is often credited in helping to create the horrorcore genre of hip hop with his 1992 song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Son.&quot; However, not all his songs fall into this genre. For example, in the song &quot;Street Struck,&quot; Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime. Idris Goodwin of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language&quot;, with his song &quot;Ebonics&quot; being the best example of this.

Coleman was notable for using a rap style called &quot;compounding&quot;. He also used metaphors in his rhymes. M.F. DiBella of Allmusic stated Coleman was &quot;a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire&quot;. On the review of &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, she adds, describing &quot;the Harlem MC as a master of the punch line and a vicious storyteller with a razor blade-under-the-tongue flow.&quot; Trent Fitzgerald of Allmusic said Coleman was &quot;a lyrically ferocious MC with raps deadlier than a snakebite and mannerisms cooler than the uptown pimp he claimed to be on records.&quot;

=== Documentary ===
A documentary &quot;Street Struck: The Big L Story&quot; was set to be released in 2017. Directed by a childhood friend and independent film director, Jewlz, approximately nine hours of footage was brought in, and the film&#x27;s planned runtime was said to be 90 to 120 minutes long.

<doc id="597982" wikidata="Q545271" url="?curid=597982" title="Pungi">
<text>The pungi, also known as bīn or Murli, is a musical instrument that originates from the Indian subcontinent. The instrument consists of a reservoir into which air is blown and then channelled into two reed pipes. It is played with no pauses, as the player employs circular breathing. In street performances, the pungi is used for snake charming.

==History==
The pungi is a Hindu folk music reed pipe instrument that is mostly played by cobra charmers in Sindh and Rajasthan. The instrument is made from a dry hollowed gourd with two bamboo attachments. It is also a double-reed instrument. The pungi is played by Jogi in the Thar desert.

It is in particular played by snake charmers, mostly in the Terai and Nepal, to arouse snakes to dance.

The instrument has a high, thin tone and continuous low humming.

It has been an important instrument in Indian folk culture and is known by various names in different parts of India. In northern India, it is known as the been, tumbi, and bansi; in the southern India, it is known as the magudi, mahudi, pungi, and pambaattikulhal.

==Construction==

The pungi is constructed from a solid coconut cover, to which pieces of bamboo are joined, and has two components: a hollow vessel constructed from a gourd, and two pipes, each with a free-beating single reed (jivala).

The player blows air through the top tube-like portion of the instrument. One pipe makes drone-like sounds. and the other produces the melody. The pipe that produces the melody has seven holes and a range of one octave. The drone pipe only has one hole. Traditionally, both sounds are played simultaneously using circular breathing to create a hypnotic effect.

The pungi is usually played solo, as it is difficult to play it with other instruments.

=== Ban on snake charming ===
The instrument was often used to entertain the public with snake charming. However, this practice was eventually banned throughout the country in 1991, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

<text>Eurychoromyia mallea, the broad-headed fly, is a species of flies in the subfamily Eurychoromyiinae.

In 1903, C. A. W. Schnuse, collecting at Sarampiuni in the foothills of the Bolivian Andes, took 4 specimens, all female, of a fly with a strange broad, flat head. These were described as a new species &quot;Eurychoromyia mallea&quot; 
(&quot;ευρυς&quot; — broad; &quot;χορος&quot; — field; &quot;μυια&quot; — fly; &quot;malleus&quot; — hammer) by the Austrian entomologist Friedrich Georg Hendel. No specimens have been seen or collected since. Two of the specimens now reside in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. The other two specimens are in the Staatliches Museum für Tierkunde in Dresden. Hendel rated the species as &quot;an isolated group of acalyptrate muscids&quot;. His judgement has been sustained, and they are now recognised as belonging to a distinct family Eurychoromyiidae. No other specimens have ever been identified as belonging to this family. Classification has proved difficult, the absence of any male specimens adding to the difficulties. Following Hennig (1958) they are here tentatively included in the superfamily Lauxanioidea. In 2010 Gaimari &amp; Silva placed then as a subfamily within Lauxaniidae and added further genera, 5 of them new to science.

&quot;E. mallea&quot; is a shiny, peach-brown insect, in length, with a head wide. The immature stages and male specimens have not been seen.

<doc id="597991" wikidata="Q689408" url="?curid=597991" title="Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle">
<text>The Armstrong Whitworth A.W.41 Albemarle was a twin-engine transport aircraft developed by the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth and primarily produced by A.W. Hawksley Ltd, a subsidiary of the Gloster Aircraft Company. It was one of many aircraft which entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War.

The Albemarle had been originally designed as a medium bomber to fulfil Specification B.9/38 for an aircraft that could be built of wood and metal without using any light alloys; however, military planners decided to deemphasise the bomber role in favour of aerial reconnaissance and transport missions, leading to the aircraft being extensively redesigned mid-development. Performing its maiden flight on 20 March 1940, its entry to service was delayed by the redesign effort, thus the first RAF squadron to operate the Albemarle, No. 295 at RAF Harwell, did not receive the type in quantity until January 1943. As superior bombers, such as the Vickers Wellington, were already in use in quantity, all plans for using the Albemarle as a bomber were abandoned.

Instead, the Albemarle was used by RAF squadrons primarily for general and special transport duties, paratroop transport and glider towing, in addition to other secondary duties. Albemarle squadrons participated in Normandy landings and the assault on Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. While the Albemarle remained in service throughout the conflict, the final examples in RAF service were withdrawn less than a year after the war&#x27;s end. During October 1942, the Soviet Air Force also opted to order 200 aircraft; of these, only a handful of Albemarles were delivered to the Soviets prior to the Soviet government deciding to suspend deliveries in May 1943, and later cancelling the order in favour of procuring the American Douglas C-47 Skytrain instead.

==Development==
===Background===
The origins of the Albemarle can be traced back to the mid-1930s and the issuing of Specification B.9/38 by the British Air Ministry. This sought a twin-engine medium bomber of wood and metal construction, without the use of any light alloys, in order that the aircraft could be readily built by less experienced manufacturers from outside the aircraft industry. Furthermore, the envisioned aircraft had to be engineered in a manner that would allow it to be divided into relatively compact subsections, all of which had to fit on to a standard Queen Mary trailer to facilitate the adoption of a dispersed manufacturing strategy. At the time, the Air Ministry was particularly concerned that, in the event of a major conflict arising, there would be restrictions on the supply of critical materials that could undermine mass production efforts.

Several aircraft manufacturing firms, including Armstrong Whitworth, Bristol and de Havilland, were approached to produce designs to meet the specification. Bristol proposed two designs – a conventional undercarriage and an wingspan capable of 300 mph and a tricycle undercarriage design with span with a maximum speed of . Both designs, known as the Type 155, used two Bristol Hercules engines. The rival Armstrong Whitworth AW.41 design used a tricycle undercarriage and was built up of sub-sections to ease manufacture by firms without aircraft construction experience. The AW.41 was designed with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in mind, but also with provisions for the use of Bristol Hercules as an alternative powerplant.

In June 1938, mock-ups of both the AW.41 and Bristol 155 were examined, while revised specifications B.17/38 and B.18/38 were drawn up for the respective designs; de Havilland opted against submitting a design. The specification stipulated at economical cruise while carrying of bombs. Bristol was already busy with other aircraft production and development and stopped work on the 155. Changes in policy made the Air Staff reconsider the Albemarle as principally a reconnaissance aircraft capable of carrying out bombing. Among other effects, this meant more fuel to give a range. An upper dorsal turret and a (retractable) ventral turret for downward firing were added.

===Into production===
In October 1938, 200 aircraft were ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot; (i.e. without producing a prototype). The aircraft had a positive reputation and there were initially high hopes for its performance, however it never quite lived up to expectations. Furthermore, according to aviation author Oliver Tapper, the brief was a relatively difficult one for any company to fulfil. Initially, physical work centred around the construction of a pair of lead aircraft, which were to be test flown prior to the commencement of full-rate manufacture of the type. The first Albemarle, serial number &quot;P1360&quot;, was assembled at Hamble Aerodrome by Air Service Training; the aircraft performed its maiden flight on 20 March 1940.

This first flight had actually been unintended, the test pilot having picked up too much speed during a ground taxi run, and had only taken off with the barest margin after traversing the entire runway. Months later, &quot;P1360&quot; was damaged after a forced landing during the test flight programme, but was promptly repaired. Early flights of the type by test pilots typically described it as being relatively average and being free of flaws. A number of modifications were made to the design during this late stage of development, including the extensive redesign of the aircraft&#x27;s structure by Lloyd at Coventry. Further measures were made to improve the Albemarle&#x27;s take-off performance, such as the adoption of a wider span wing, and the thickening of the rudder&#x27;s trailing edge to correct a tendency to over-balance. Occurrences of the engines overheating were never fully resolved, the main change in this area being the raising of the maximum permissible operational temperature from 280C to 300C.

The Albemarle&#x27;s production run was principally undertaken by A.W. Hawksley Ltd of Gloucester, a subsidiary of the Gloster Aircraft Company, which was specifically formed to construct the Albemarle. Originally, Gloster was to have undertaken this work itself at its Brockworth facility. Both Gloster and Armstrong Whitworth were member companies of the Hawker Siddeley group, one of the largest aircraft manufacturing interests in Britain. Individual parts and sub-assemblies for the Albemarle were produced by in excess of 1,000 subcontractors. Amongst the companies that were subcontracted were MG Motor, to produce the forward fuselage, Rover, which constructed the wing centre section, and Harris Lebus, which built the tailplane units. Production of the Albemarle was terminated during December 1944, by which point 602 aircraft had been completed.

==Design==
The Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with twin fins and rudders. The fuselage was built in three primary sections; the structure being composed of unstressed plywood over a steel tube frame, including four circular steel longerons; most elements were bolted together via gusset plates. The structure was intentionally divided in order that it might readily permit individual sections to be removed and replaced in the event of battle damage being sustained. The centre section of the wing was a single piece that ran through the fuselage, being built around a steel tube girder; it formed the attachment points for the central and nose fuselage sections, as well as the engines, main undercarriage legs, and extension wings. Aside from a portion of the leading edge that used light alloys, the majority of the wing was covered in plywood. The extension wings were almost entirely made of wood, save for the bracing of the two spars by steel tubing; the Frise-type ailerons and tailplane were also composed of wood. The structure of the forward section used stainless steel tubing as to reduce interference with magnetic compasses.

The Albemarle featured a Lockheed-designed hydraulically-operated, retractable tricycle undercarriage, the main wheels retracting back into the engine nacelles, and the nose wheel retracting backwards into the front fuselage, while the tail wheel was fixed in position, albeit semi-concealed by a &quot;bumper&quot; configuration. It was one of the particularly notable design features of the Albemarle, according to Tapper, it was the first British-built aircraft with a retractable nose-wheel to be built in quantity for the Royal Air Force. Power was provided by a pair of Bristol Hercules XI air-cooled radial engines, each capable of 1,590 hp and driving a three-blade de Havilland Hydromatic propeller unit. Fuel was typically stored in four tanks, two in the center fuselage and two within the wings centre section; in circumstances where extended range would be required, a maximum of additional auxiliary tanks could be installed within the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay. This sizable bomb bay was equipped with hydraulically-operated doors and spanned from just aft of the cockpit to roughly halfway between the wings and the tail.

The two pilots sat side by side in the forward portion of the cockpit, while the radio operator was seated behind the pilots. The navigator&#x27;s position was in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, and thus was forward of the cockpit. The bomb aimer&#x27;s sighting panel was incorporated into the crew hatch in the underside of the nose. In the rear fuselage, several glazed panels were present so that a &quot;fire controller&quot; could help coordinate the aircraft&#x27;s defensive turrets against attackers. The dorsal turret was a Boulton-Paul design, which was electrically operated and originally armed with four Browning machine guns. A fairing forward of the turret automatically retracted as the turret rotated to fire forwards. The original bomber configuration of the Albemarle required a crew of six including two gunners; one in the four-gun dorsal turret and one in a manually operated twin-gun ventral turret but only the first 32 aircraft, the &quot;Mk I Series I&quot;, were produced in such a configuration.

As a bomber, the Albemarle was commonly considered to be inferior to several other aircraft already in RAF service, such as the Vickers Wellington; according to aviation author Ray Williams, the type was only used ever used as a bomber on two occasions. Accordingly, later built aircraft were configured as transports, called either &quot;General Transport&quot; (GT) or &quot;Special Transport&quot; (ST). Amongst the modifications made was the elimination of the ventral turret, while the dorsal unit was downgraded to a manually-operated twin gun arrangement; the internal space was heavily altered by the elimination of bomb-aiming apparatus and the rear fuselage tank. Additions also included a quick-release hook, installed at the rearmost part of the fuselage for the towing of gliders. When used as a paratroop transport, a maximum of ten fully armed troops could be carried; these paratroopers were provided with a dropping hatch in the rear fuselage along with a single large loading door in the starboard side of the fuselage.

==Operational history==
Ambitions to use Albemarle in the bomber role were dropped almost immediately upon the type reaching service; this was due to it not representing an improvement over current medium bombers (such as the Vickers Wellington) and possessing inferior performance to the new generation four-engined heavy bombers that were also about to enter service with the RAF. However, the aircraft was considered to be suitable for general reconnaissance and transport duties, and thus was re-orientated towards such missions.

The Soviet Air Force placed a contract for delivery of 200 Albemarles in October 1942. An RAF unit – No. 305 FTU, at RAF Errol near Dundee – was set up to train Soviet ferry crews. During training, one aircraft was lost with no survivors. The first RAF squadron to operate the Albemarle was No. 295 at RAF Harwell in January 1943. Other squadrons to be equipped with the Albemarle included No. 296, No. 297 and No. 570. The first operational flight was on 9 February 1943, in which a 296 Squadron Albemarle dropped leaflets over Lisieux in Normandy.

A Soviet-crewed Albemarle flew from Scotland to Vnukovo airfield, near Moscow, on 3 March 1943, and was followed soon afterwards by eleven more aircraft. Two Albemarles were lost over the North Sea, one to German fighters and the other to unknown causes. Tests of the surviving Albemarles revealed their weaknesses as transports (notably the cramped interior) and numerous technical flaws; in May 1943, the Soviet government suspended deliveries and eventually cancelled them in favour of abundant American Douglas C-47 Skytrains. The Soviet camp at Errol Field continued until April 1944: apparently the Soviet government had hoped to secure de Havilland Mosquitos. Tapper speculated that a major reason for the Soviet&#x27;s interest in the Albemarle had been its Bristol Hercules engines, which were reverse engineered and subsequently copied by Soviet industries.
From mid-1943, RAF Albemarles took part in many British airborne operations, beginning with the invasion of Sicily. The pinnacle of the aircraft&#x27;s career was a series of operations for D-Day, on the night of 5/6 June 1944. 295 and 296 Squadrons sent aircraft to Normandy with the pathfinder force, and 295 Squadron claimed to be the first squadron to drop Allied airborne troops over Normandy. On 6 June 1944, four Albemarle squadrons and the operational training unit sent aircraft during Operation Tonga; 296 Squadron used 19 aircraft to tow Airspeed Horsas; 295 Squadron towed 21 Horsas, although it lost six in transit; 570 Squadron sent 22 aircraft with ten towing gliders; and 42 OTU used four aircraft. For Operation Mallard on 7 June 1944, the squadrons towed 220 Horsas and 30 Hamilcars to Normandy. On 17 September 1944, during Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, 54 Horsas and two Waco Hadrian gliders were towed to the Netherlands by 28 Albemarles of 296 and 297 squadrons; 45 aircraft were sent the following day towing gliders. Of the 602 aircraft delivered, 17 were lost on operations and 81 lost in accidents.

The final RAF unit to operate the Albemarle was the Heavy Glider Conversion Unit, which replaced its examples with Handley Page Halifaxes during February 1946, at which point the type was formally retired from all operational units.

==Variants==
Over the course of its production life, a number of variants of the Albemarle were built:
* ST Mk I – 99 aircraft
* GT Mk I – 69
* ST Mk II – 99
* Mk III – One prototype only.
* Mk IV – One prototype only.
* ST Mk V – 49
* ST Mk VI – 133
* GT Mk VI – 117

Most Marks were divided into &quot;Series&quot; to distinguish differences in equipment. The ST Mk I Series 1 (eight aircraft) had the four gun turret replaced with hand-operated twin-guns under a sliding hood. As a special transport, a loading door was fitted on the starboard side and the rear fuel tank was removed. The 14 ST Mk I Series 2 aircraft were equipped with gear for towing gliders. The Mk II could carry ten paratroops and the Mk V was the same but for a fuel jettison system. All production Albemarles were powered by a pair of Bristol Hercules XI radial engines. The Mk III and Mk IV Albemarles were development projects for testing different powerplants; the former used the Rolls-Royce Merlin III and the latter used the Wright Double Cyclone.

<doc id="597998" wikidata="Q619985" url="?curid=597998" title="Multinomial theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the multinomial theorem describes how to expand a power of a sum in terms of powers of the terms in that sum. It is the generalization of the binomial theorem from binomials to multinomials.

==Theorem==
For any positive integer and any non-negative integer , the multinomial theorem describes how a sum with terms expands when raised to the th power:
formula_1
where
formula_2
is a multinomial coefficient. The sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative integer indices through such that the sum of all is . That is, for each term in the expansion, the exponents of the must add up to .

In the case , this statement reduces to that of the binomial theorem.

===Example===
The third power of the trinomial is given by
formula_3
This can be computed by hand using the distributive property of multiplication over addition and combining like terms, but it can also be done (perhaps more easily) with the multinomial theorem. It is possible to &quot;read off&quot; the multinomial coefficients from the terms by using the multinomial coefficient formula. For example, the term formula_4 has coefficient formula_5, the term formula_6 has coefficient formula_7, and so on.

===Alternate expression===
The statement of the theorem can be written concisely using multiindices:

:formula_8

where

:formula_9
and
:formula_10

===Proof===
This proof of the multinomial theorem uses the binomial theorem and induction on .

First, for , both sides equal since there is only one term in the sum. For the induction step, suppose the multinomial theorem holds for . Then

: formula_11

by the induction hypothesis. Applying the binomial theorem to the last factor,

:formula_12
:formula_13

which completes the induction. The last step follows because

:formula_14
as can easily be seen by writing the three coefficients using factorials as follows:

:formula_15

==Multinomial coefficients==
The numbers
:formula_16
appearing in the theorem are the multinomial coefficients. They can be expressed in numerous ways, including as a product of binomial coefficients or of factorials:
:formula_17

===Sum of all multinomial coefficients===
The substitution of for all into the multinomial theorem
:formula_18
gives immediately that 
:formula_19

===Number of multinomial coefficients===

The number of terms in a multinomial sum, , is equal to the number of monomials of degree on the variables :
:formula_20

The count can be performed easily using the method of stars and bars.

===Valuation of multinomial coefficients===
The largest power of a prime that divides a multinomial coefficient may be computed using a generalization of Kummer&#x27;s theorem.

=== Asymptotics ===
By Stirling&#x27;s approximation, or equivalently the log-gamma function&#x27;s asymptotic expansion, formula_21so for example,formula_22

==Interpretations==

===Ways to put objects into bins===
The multinomial coefficients have a direct combinatorial interpretation, as the number of ways of depositing distinct objects into distinct bins, with objects in the first bin, objects in the second bin, and so on.

===Number of ways to select according to a distribution===
In statistical mechanics and combinatorics, if one has a number distribution of labels, then the multinomial coefficients naturally arise from the binomial coefficients. Given a number distribution on a set of total items, represents the number of items to be given the label . (In statistical mechanics is the label of the energy state.)

The number of arrangements is found by 
*Choosing of the total to be labeled 1. This can be done formula_23 ways.
*From the remaining items choose to label 2. This can be done formula_24 ways.
*From the remaining items choose to label 3. Again, this can be done formula_25 ways.

Multiplying the number of choices at each step results in:
:formula_26

Cancellation results in the formula given above.

===Number of unique permutations of words===
The multinomial coefficient 
:formula_27
is also the number of distinct ways to permute a multiset of elements, where is the multiplicity of each of the th element. For example, the number of distinct permutations of the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI, which has 1 M, 4 Is, 4 Ss, and 2 Ps, is
:formula_28

===Generalized Pascal&#x27;s triangle===
One can use the multinomial theorem to generalize Pascal&#x27;s triangle or Pascal&#x27;s pyramid to Pascal&#x27;s simplex. This provides a quick way to generate a lookup table for multinomial coefficients.
