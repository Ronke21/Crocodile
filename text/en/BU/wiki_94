<text>Guard mounting, changing the guard, or the changing of the guard, is a formal ceremony in which performing ceremonial guard duties at important institutions are relieved by a new batch of sentries. The ceremonies are often elaborate and precisely choreographed. They originated with peacetime and battlefield military drills introduced to enhance unit cohesion and effectiveness in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

The guard mounting ceremony is held every Saturday and Sunday in the afternoon and evening.

===Barbados===
In Barbados, the Changing of the Sentry is an event that takes place in front of the 1804 Main Guard or Clock Tower. The guardsmen from the Barbados Defence Force are known today as The Main Guard. The sentries are drawn from members of the Barbados Legion, other retired personnel, and the Barbados Regiment.

In Minsk, Post #1 at Victory Square is the area where guard duty is carried out by members of the armed forces, including soldiers of the Honor Guard of the Armed Forces and cadets of the Military Academy of Belarus. Other organizations that also support guard duties at the square includes members of the Belarusian Republican Youth Union, the Border Guard Service Institute of Belarus, and students of general education schools and vocational schools of the city of Minsk. Post #1 was initiated on 3 July 1984, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Minsk.

===Canada===

Public duties in Ottawa, Canada&#x27;s national capital, is formally the responsibility of two regiments of foot guards, the Canadian Grenadier Guards, and the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards; with one of their main tasks being the provision of sentries for guard mountings for official state functions in support of the Government of Canada in Ottawa. 

The Canadian Army also operates a summer public duties detachment known as the Ceremonial Guard, which assumes public duties in Ottawa from late-June to late-August. The Ceremonial Guard is made up of regulars or reservists of the Canadian Army, although its membership is also augmented by regulars and reservists of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy. The Ceremonial Guard mount the guard at the National War Memorial, Rideau Hall, and Parliament Hill. Members of the Ceremonial Guard wear the uniforms of the Canadian foot guards, as they have historically staffed the summer public duties detachment, before membership in the Ceremonial Guard was opened to the entire Canadian Armed Forces. The Ceremonial Guard are considered an &quot;ad hoc&quot; detachment, as its members are drawn from various units of the armed forces, and does not constitute a permanent unit in the Canadian Forces&#x27; order of battle.

The Canadian Armed Forces also maintains a National Sentry Program, where its members perform guard mountings for its sentries at the National War Memorial from early-April to 10 November, the day before Remembrance Day. The program formally falls under the command structure of the Ceremonial Guard, although its volunteers may wear the full dress uniform of their respective units/service.

Guard mountings are also carried out at the Citadelle of Quebec in Quebec City, a military installation, and secondary residence of the Monarch and Governor General. The Royal 22nd Regiment mounts the guard at the Citadelle from late-June to Labour Day (the first Monday of September). The regiment has carried out guard mountings at the Citadelle since 1928, excluding a brief hiatus from 1939 to 1945, due to the Second World War. Guard mountings have also been performed in other Canadian cities outside Ottawa and Quebec City, with guard mountings having been performed at various provincial capitals, typically at the legislature, or the official residences of the lieutenant governors. However, public duties in Ottawa and Quebec are the only regularly scheduled guard mountings in the country.

Several non-military organizations also perform reenactments of past and historical guard mountings ceremonies in New Brunswick, and at Citadel Hill in Halifax.

===United Kingdom===
The King&#x27;s Guard (called Queen&#x27;s Guard when the reigning monarch is female) are the names given to the fully operational infantry and cavalry contingents of soldiers charged with guarding royal residences in the London District and Edinburgh. As a result, Guards are mounted at Buckingham Palace, St James&#x27;s Palace, the Tower of London, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The British Army&#x27;s Household Division, which consists of the Foot Guards and the Household Cavalry are normally responsible for mounting the King&#x27;s Guard.

The original King&#x27;s Guard predating the English Restoration consisted of the Troops of Horse Guards and Foot Guards, which have since evolved and from the reign of King Charles II have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign&#x27;s palaces. The ceremony originally took place at the Palace of Whitehall until 1689, when it was moved to St James&#x27;s Palace. After Queen Victoria moved into Buckingham Palace in 1837, The Queen&#x27;s Guard remained at St James&#x27;s Palace, while a detachment was moved to the new residence.

Outside the Foot Guards, the King&#x27;s Colour Squadron of the RAF, the Brigade of Gurkhas and the Royal Marines also periodically mount the guard. In November 2017, the Royal Navy mounted the guard for the first time in since its establishment with a company-sized detachment formed of volunteers from 45 ships and shore establishments. for two weeks, the first time that the Royal Navy had formed the Queen&#x27;s Guard in its own right (rather than being represented by the Royal Marines).

In 2000, the Australian Federation Guard performed public duties in London while being led by the first ever female guard commander in history. In 2008, the 1st Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment became the first country where the British Sovereign is not head of state to mount the guard.

===United States===

A permanent guard is mounted at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. This is performed by a single member of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment. There is a meticulous routine which the Tomb Guard follows during a march when watching over the Tomb. The Guard:

# Marches 21 steps down the black mat behind the Tomb.
# Turns, faces east for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces north for 21 seconds.
# Takes 21 steps down the mat.
# Repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the Changing of the Guard.

After each turn, the Guard executes a sharp &quot;shoulder-arms&quot; movement to place their M14 rifle on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the Guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat. Twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowed—the 21-gun salute.

Each turn the guard makes is precise and is instantly followed by a loud click of the heels as he snaps them together. A guard has been on duty at the site continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, since July 2, 1937. The watch has been maintained even in cases of inclement weather or terrorist attack.

During the day in summer months from April 1 to September 30, the guard is changed every half-hour. During the winter months, from October 1 to March 31, the guard is changed every hour. After the cemetery closes to the public (7 p.m. to 8 a.m. April through September, and 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. October through March), the guard is changed every 2 hours. The ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever Arlington National Cemetery is open.

The guard change is very symbolic, but also conducted in accordance with Army regulations. The relief commander or assistant relief commander, along with the oncoming guard, are both required for a guard change to take place. The relief commander orders the guard being relieved to &quot;pass on your orders&quot; to the oncoming guard. The guard being relieved will say to the oncoming guard, &quot;Post and orders, remain as directed.&quot; The oncoming guard&#x27;s response is always, &quot;Orders acknowledged.&quot; During changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony, the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain &quot;silent and standing&quot; throughout the entire event.

While the guards are all members of the United States Army, the soldier &quot;walking the mat&quot; does not wear his or her rank insignia, so as not to outrank the Unknowns, whatever their ranks may have been. Non-commissioned officers (usually the Relief Commander and Assistant Relief Commanders) do wear the insignia of their rank when changing the guard only. They have a separate uniform (without rank) that is worn when they actually guard the Unknowns or are &quot;Posted&quot;.

The tomb guards have often been replicated by other organizations all over the country. Professional units such as the Chicago Police Department (CPD) Honor Guard and the Tulsa Civil Air Patrol have a tradition of mounting a ceremonial guard similar to the tomb guards in Arlington. The Humble High School JROTC program has since 2007 reenacted the changing of the guard during its Veteran&#x27;s Day ceremony with cadets enrolled.

===Vietnam===
The Changing of the Guards in Hanoi, Vietnam takes place at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum which is guarded by the special guard of honor battalion of the Ministry of Defense of Vietnam. It is one of two such formations in the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. The mausoleum contains the preserved body of Ho Chi Minh and is at the north end of Hanoi&#x27;s Ba Đình Square, exactly on the spot where he read the Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945. Unlike its Chinese counterpart, guard of honour battalion&#x27;s area of responsibility (AOR) is limited to Hanoi, particularly to the area around Ba Đình Square. The battalion is a public duties unit. Personnel assigned to the guard wear a white full-dress uniform with a peaked cap and gold belt buckle.

<doc id="608644" wikidata="Q6818913" url="?curid=608644" title="Meredith College">
<text>Meredith College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college and coeducational graduate school in Raleigh, North Carolina. As of 2021 Meredith enrolls approximately 1,500 women in its undergraduate programs and 300 men and women in its graduate programs.

==History==

Chartered by the First Baptist Church, the college first opened as the Baptist Female University in 1891 in a facility in downtown Raleigh. In 1904, the school&#x27;s name was first changed to Baptist University for Women. In 1909, the school adopted its current name, Meredith College, to honor Thomas Meredith who was the founder of the Baptist newspaper &quot;The Biblical Recorder&quot;.

In 1997, the college moved away from a direct connection with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.

Meredith began construction at the current location on Hillsborough Street near North Carolina State University in 1924, and students began attending classes there in 1926. The campus covers and is located close to both Raleigh-Durham International Airport and Research Triangle Park.

In 1980 an angel was chosen as the school sports mascot, but in the summer of 2007 this was changed to the &quot;Avenging Angels&quot;.

In April 2022, the school renamed Joyner Hall, named for white supremacy advocate James Yadkin Joyner, as part of its anti-racism initiatives.

==Academics==
38 majors are offered at Meredith, as well as licensure, graduate, and pre-professional programs. According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; the most popular majors are Psychology, Biology/Biological Sciences, Business Administration and Management, Child Development and Social Work.

Upon completion of an undergraduate major, students can receive a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Social Work. The John E. Weems Graduate School is coeducational.

Undergraduate students who wish to study engineering can participate in a five-year dual-degree program, whereby they can receive degrees from both Meredith and North Carolina State University&#x27;s College of Engineering. To do this, students must major in either chemistry, computer science or mathematics at Meredith. Through this arrangement, students receive a B.A. from Meredith in chemistry, computer science or mathematics and a B.S. from NCSU in engineering.

The college&#x27;s Undergraduate Research Program supports student/faculty partnerships for the purposes of academic research and creative activity in all fields. College funds support these projects and underwrite travel costs for students presenting their work at conferences. The college hosts an annual one-day research conference in April to present work of Meredith students.

==Student life==
Meredith College is noted for its traditions, which range from the Honor Code to Cornhuskin&#x27;, a yearly weeklong festival encouraging competition between graduating classes. Meredith College also celebrates its Founder&#x27;s Day every year. During each college generation, faculty perform &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; for students, keeping their involvement in the production a secret up until the students see them on stage.

==Rankings and classifications==

As of 2021, Meredith College was ranked #136 in the category of Best Liberal Arts Colleges by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report &quot;, was ranked #119 by &quot;Forbes&quot; among &quot;In The South&quot;, and was categorized by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; in the Best Southeastern category.

Meredith College was ranked fifth among regional colleges in the South in the 2016 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; rankings. Meredith College is not included in this ranking as a southern regional university.

==Athletics==
 Meredith athletes compete in basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field and volleyball. In August 2014 Meredith College announced the addition of track and field and in September 2019 announced the addition of golf as well as field hockey.

A member of the USA South Athletic Conference since 2007, Meredith has claimed 26 USA South championships, made 15 NCAA appearances, and had 300 student-athletes named all-conference and 670 to USA South All-American.

<text>The president of the Community of Madrid is the highest-ranking officer of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and the head of the executive branch. The office is currently held by Isabel Díaz Ayuso of the People&#x27;s Party.

== Origins and election ==

In the process of the democracy restoration in Spain between 1975–1978, the nationalist and regionalist parties pressed to grant home rule to parts of Spain. Finally, the Constitution stated that any province or group of provinces could form an autonomous community and thus be granted partial home rule. The Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spanish &quot;Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid&quot;) was created in 1982, and since then regional elections are held every 4 years.

The citizens of the Autonomous Communities of Spain do not elect a person for presidency of their community: but rather they elect the regional legislature, and that legislature elects the regional president. A candidate needs a majority (that is supposed to be loyal to him/her during the whole term) to be elected, but the top-voted party can be denied the right to form the government. This situation, though infrequent in nationwide elections, often happens in local/regional legislatures throughout Spain: the most usual coalition is between the Socialist Party (PSOE) and the United Left (IU).

In Madrid, such a coalition was formed in the 2nd term, in which the incumbent Socialist Joaquín Leguina obtained the most vote but not a majority, once more in the 3rd term, allowing him to remain in office even after having obtained fewer votes than the People&#x27;s Party (PP), and once more in the 6th term, by the PSOE candidate Rafael Simancas. However, this last coalition ultimately failed due to the dissidence of two PSOE Assembly Members, which denounced the pact with IU as being too wide and unrepresentative of the people&#x27;s will due to the planned power balance. Elections were repeated after a few weeks and Partido Popular won, then by absolute majority.

Since then, the People&#x27;s Party victories by absolute majority were repeated in 2007 and 2011&#x27;s regional elections. After the resignation of President Esperanza Aguirre, nominally due to personal matters in late 2012, her deputy president Ignacio González held the post. The People&#x27;s Party obtained the most votes in 2015 but lost its absolute majority. Its candidate Cristina Cifuentes was invested president after an agreement with Citizens.
She was replaced by her deputy Ángel Garrido when she resigned after evidence of both a fake master&#x27;s degree and petty shoplifting came out.

<doc id="608655" wikidata="Q6246319" url="?curid=608655" title="John Macmurray">
<text>John Macmurray (16 February 1891 – 21 June 1976) was a Scottish philosopher. His thought both moved beyond and was critical of the modern tradition, whether rationalist or empiricist. His thought may be classified as personalist, as his writings focused primarily on the nature of human beings. He viewed persons in terms of their relationality and agency, rather than the modern tendency to characterize them in terms of individualism and cognition.

He made contributions in the fields of political science, religion, education, and philosophy in a long career of writing, teaching, and public speaking. After retirement he became a Quaker.

==Life==
Macmurray was born on 16 February 1891 in Maxwelltown in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, into a strict Presbyterian family. His father was employed by the Inland Revenue Department as an excise officer. In 1899 the family moved to Aberdeen, where the young Macmurray attended Aberdeen Grammar School (1903 to 1905) and Robert Gordon&#x27;s College (1905 to 1909). He was educated at the University of Glasgow, earning First-class honours in Classics and was awarded a Snell Exhibition to attend Balliol College, Oxford in 1913. His tutor at Balliol was A. D. Lindsay.
When war with Germany was declared in 1914, Macmurray enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In August 1915 he was sent to France with the 58th Field Ambulance as part of the 19th (Western) Division of the British Expeditionary Force. In June 1916 he was awarded a commission as Second Lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders and was sent to the Battle of the Somme. Macmurray married Elizabeth Hyde Campbell in London during a three-day leave in October 1916. He was seriously wounded in battle near Arras on 28 March 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry.

While on leave recovering from a broken ankle in 1917, Macmurray was invited to give a sermon in an unidentified North London church. He preached on the importance of preparing for post-war reconciliation with the enemy rather than exacting vengeance. The sermon was coldly received by the congregation and Macmurray saw their reaction as indicating a lack of true Christianity in the institutional churches. Because of this experience, Macmurray determined not to be a member of any church, while continuing to maintain his strong Christian convictions.

After the war, Macmurray completed his studies at Balliol, obtaining a distinction in the Shortened Honours Course of Literae Humaniores in 1919, as well as winning in the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the same year. He worked as a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Manchester from 1919 to 1920, followed by two years as Chair of Philosophy at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. In 1922 he returned to Balliol as a Fellow and Tutor, succeeding his former tutor A.D. Lindsay as Jowett Lecturer in Philosophy. He left Oxford to become Grote Professor of Mind and Logic at University College London, the position he held from 1928 to 1944. He then moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he held the Chair of Moral Philosophy until his retirement in 1958.

Macmurray and his wife had no children. After his retirement, they moved to the village of Jordans, Buckinghamshire, where they both joined the Society of Friends. In 1970 they returned to Edinburgh, where Macmurray died on 21 June 1976.

==Philosophy==

The main themes in Macmurray&#x27;s philosophy are the primacy in human life of action over theory, and the essentially relational nature of human beings. These themes are the basis for his Gifford Lectures delivered in 1953 and 1954 at the University of Glasgow, and entitled &quot;The Self as Agent&quot; and &quot;Persons in Relation&quot; respectively. The overall title given to the two lecture series was &quot;The Form of the Personal&quot;. Macmurray summed up his philosophy in the introduction to &quot;The Self as Agent&quot;: &quot;The simplest expression that I can find for the thesis I have tried to maintain is this: All meaningful knowledge is for the sake of action, and all meaningful action for the sake of friendship&quot;.

Macmurray rejected mind–body dualism and argued that the nature of human beings is personal, rather than mechanical or organic. He argued for the importance of emotion as motivating action, and looked to infancy and early childhood for evidence of the universal desire for relationship. He distinguished between society and community, with society being for organizations to achieve particular purposes, while community is an end in itself.

In dismissing the Cogito and its legacy of the primacy of thought over action, Macmurray saw himself as breaking with the western philosophical tradition. However, he acknowledged the influence of Kant and Marx on his thinking, along with Christianity. On the other hand, he had no sympathy for, and did not engage with, the type of academic philosophy that was dominant during the latter part of his career.

==Broadcasting and other work==

His friendship with the educator Kenneth C. Barnes resulted in his becoming a governor of Wennington School.

He was well known in Britain before World War II for his BBC radio broadcasts on philosophy, some of which were published in his first book, &quot;Freedom in the Modern World&quot; (1932).

==Influence==

Macmurray&#x27;s work has been largely neglected in academic philosophy. However, he has been influential in other fields, including theology and psychology. The twenty first century has seen the publication of the first full-length biography and a book-length critical study of his religious philosophy, as well as volumes of selections from his works and books and articles about his work. Tony Blair contributed the foreword to one of the anthologies, in which he described Macmurray&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;immensely modern... in the sense that he confronted what will be the critical political question of the twenty-first century: the relationship between individual and society&quot;.

<doc id="608656" wikidata="Q3443493" url="?curid=608656" title="Shaw University">
<text>Shaw University is a private historically black university in Raleigh, North Carolina. Founded on December 1, 1865, Shaw University is the oldest HBCU to begin offering courses in the Southern United States. The school had its origin in the formation of a theological class of freedmen in the Guion Hotel. The following year it moved to a large wooden building, at the corner of Blount and Cabarrus Streets in Raleigh, where it continued as the Raleigh Institute until 1870. In 1870, the school moved to its current location on the former property of Confederate General Barringer and changed its name to the Shaw Collegiate Institute, in honor of Elijah Shaw. In 1875, the school was officially chartered with the State of North Carolina as Shaw University.

The main campus resides on 24 acres in the East Raleigh-South Park Historic District in downtown Raleigh. Shaw also owns and operates a 35-acre farm located on Rock Quarry Rd. Historical buildings, which either currently (Estey Hall) or previously (Shaw Hall) reside on campus, were designed by the famed Raleigh architect George S. H. Appleget and feature a Second Empire and Italianate architectural styles. Other architectural styles present on campus are Leonard Hall, a twin-turret Romanesque Revival style building, and several buildings featuring Brutalist style architectures.

Along with Howard University, Hampton University, Lincoln University and Virginia Union University, Shaw was a co-founding member of the NCAA Division II&#x27;s Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Conference, the oldest African American athletic association in the U.S. The university has won CIAA championships in Football, Basketball (women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s), Tennis (women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s) and volleyball.

==History==
===Foundation to the 1920s===
The school was founded by the American Baptist Home Mission Society and the pastor Henry Martin Tupper in 1865 

In 1867 the school consisted of two buildings, a large two-story structure and one cabins. In 1870, it was renamed Shaw Collegiate Institute after Elijah Shaw who donated a sum of $5,000 ($110,897 in 2021) to partially fund the $13,000 ($288,331 in 2021) necessary to purchase 12 acres of land formally held by General Barringer (where Tupper and his wife once hid in the cornfields from a KKK lynch mob) and erect Shaw Hall, the first building on campus. Shaw Hall was built with a 165-foot frontage, four stories high and possessing a tower, was the most commodious school building in all of North Carolina at that time. It provided instruction services, a library, and lodging.

In 1873, Estey Hall was built in honor of Deacon Jacob Estey and sons of Brattleboro, Vermont, who gave $8,000 ($187,365 in 2021) toward its construction. Estey Hall was the first building constructed in the U.S. for the higher education of African-American women. Estey Hall was devoted to training women in cooking, sewing, music, and the like. Henry Martin Tupper bought the material from which the women made garments and he himself sold the garments in an effort to pay for the cost of the material and other expenses.

In 1879, a third major building was erected – a chapel and dining hall called the Greenleaf Building. It was named for Orick H. Greenleaf of Springfield, MA, a yearly liberal contributor. The upper part of the building was accessible by stairs. Doors on either side of the tower provided entrance to the dining room. At the right of the chapel was a small room and at the left a library. A storeroom existed under the stairway. Funds saved from tuition and board were used to build this structure at a total cost of $6,000. These were augmented by contributions from O.H. Greenleaf, Captain Ebenezer Morgan of Groton, CT, and Deacon O.B. Grant of Stonington, CT.

In 1866 when the Raleigh Institute was first being developed, Tupper had hoped to open a medical school; in 1882, $5,000 was donated from the Leonard family to establish the Leonard Medical School and the Leonard School of Pharmacy with significant contributions made by Dr. Nathan Bishop, William A. Caldwell, Joseph B. Hoyt, O. H. Greenleaf, Timothy Merrick, and Colonel Levi K. Fuller. The medical school complex, which housed both departments, consisted primarily of three structures – a four-story, 34 bed medical dormitory built to accommodate 60 men and erected in 1881 when the trustees approved the establishment of a medical department; the Leonard Medical Building, erected in the summer and fall of 1881 and containing lecture rooms, dissecting rooms, an amphitheater, and opened for its first session on November 1, 1881; the Leonard Medical School Hospital, a 25-bed hospital which opened for the reception of patients on January 10, 1885. It was the first four-year medical school to train African-American doctors in the South. and the first medical school in the state to offer a four-year curriculum. The school closed in 1918 after being given a scathing evaluation by the Flexner Report that the Negro school &quot;was in no position to make any contribution of value&quot; but recommended Howard and Meharry medical schools remain open.On December 11, 1888 the university opened the Shaw University Law School, the first of its kind for African-Americans in the country. The Law School curriculum focused on &quot;the subjects of International and Constitutional Law, the various branches of the Common Law, Equity, and Admiralty&quot;. It was also the only black law school that had a course in legal shorthand. The course was offered on the premise that such a skill would broaden the opportunities for a black lawyer to work in a legal firm in a clerical position or as an office assistant should discrimination impede their ability to practice law. Shaw University graduated fifty-seven law students before it closed in 1916. It graduated fifty-four law students between 1891 and 1914. North Carolina politician John S. Leary was an important figure in the founding of the law school and served as its dean starting in March 1890. He was followed as dean by Edward A. Johnson, who was the law school&#x27;s first graduate and later the first African-American member of the New York State Assembly. By 1900, Shaw University had trained more than 30,000 black teachers.

=== 1920s to 1980s ===
In 1968, Shaw University became the first black college to own a radio station. At first, the station used an antenna on top of a building on the downtown campus, but in the late 1990s a new tower was built in southeast Raleigh near Interstate 40. WFSS in Fayetteville, North Carolina, moved from 89.1 FM to 91.9 FM to allow WSHA to increase power. The university sold the station to Educational Media Foundation effective July 26, 2018, who subsequently renamed it WRKV.

==== U.S. Civil Rights Movement ====
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was one of the organizations of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It emerged from a student meeting organized by Ella Baker that was held at Shaw University in April 1960. SNCC grew into a large organization, gaining many supporters in the North as well as in the South. It led grassroots organizing for voter education and registration in Mississippi, among other initiatives. They are best known for their support of sit-ins, including in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. They were also involved in the Freedom Rides.

===1980s to present===
By the mid-1980s, enrollment declined and the university was deeply in debt. President Talbert O. Shaw (1988–2003) (not related to the namesake) increased the student body from 1,600 to 2,700, restructured debt and created the Raleigh Business and Technology Center.In the 1990s, Shaw ran a successful capital campaign to renovate historic buildings and construct new campus facilities, including the Talbert O. Shaw Center for Teachers&#x27; Education.

In 2005, Shaw University Divinity School (SUDS) received a 10-year accreditation from the Association for Theological Schools. The university also began construction on the Center for Early Childhood Education, Research and Development.

In 2009, the university&#x27;s Institute for Health, Social, and Community Research was awarded a $4.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health – National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD) to implement The Shaw NCMHD Research Infrastructure in Minority Institutions (RIMI) Project. The RIMI Program is designed to establish a research capacity-building infrastructure program, with benchmarks for training students, and developing a cadre of clinical, biomedical and behavioral research scientists who possess the skills, knowledge and abilities to engage in leading, cutting-edge and innovative research and training that will ultimately contribute to reducing and eliminating health disparities in the United States.

During the tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011, the university was struck by a damaging tornado, resulting in the school cancelling classes for a semester. As a result of the storm, two dormitories, the student union, and the roof of Estey hall were severely damaged. There were minor injuries but no one was seriously hurt.

====Study of World War II service of black veterans====
Shaw University led a research study to investigate why not a single African-American soldier who served in World War II had been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. The study concluded that racial discrimination had contributed to the military&#x27;s overlooking the contributions of black soldiers. The 272-page study recommended ten soldiers whose military records suggested they deserved the Medal of Honor. All ten had been awarded lesser medals during the war for actions the study&#x27;s authors concluded merited the Medal of Honor. In January 1995, the team&#x27;s findings were sent to the United States Department of Defense. In April 1996, officials at the Defense Department agreed that seven of the ten soldiers recommended in the report, should be awarded the Medal of Honor. President Bill Clinton awarded the Medals of Honor on January 13, 1997.

The department&#x27;s decision in response to Shaw&#x27;s study marked only the third time that the military re-evaluated military records to award the Medal of Honor. Only one of the seven nominees, 1st Lt. Vernon Baker of St. Maries, Idaho, was alive to receive his medal. Those who were awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously were: 1st Lt. Charles L. Thomas of Detroit, Michigan; Pvt. George Watson of Birmingham, Alabama; Staff Sgt. Edward A. Carter Jr. of Los Angeles, California; 1st Lt. John R. Fox of Boston, Massachusetts; Pfc. Willy F. James Jr. of Kansas City, Kansas; and Staff Sgt. Ruben Rivers of Tecumseh, Oklahoma. Their families received the medals.

<doc id="608668" wikidata="Q1201019" url="?curid=608668" title="Proof of concept">
<text>A proof of concept (POC or PoC), also known as proof of principle, is an realization of a certain idea or method in order to demonstrate its feasibility or viability. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete, but aims to demonstrate in principle that the concept has practical potential without needing to fully develop it.

A proof of value (PoV) is sometimes used along proof of concept, and differs by focusing more on demonstrating the potential customer use case and value, and is usually less in-depth than a proof of concept.

==Usage history==
The term has been in use since 1967. In a 1969 hearing of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, &quot;proof of concept&quot; was defined as following:

One definition of the term &quot;proof of concept&quot; was by Bruce Carsten in the context of a &quot;proof-of-concept prototype&quot; in his magazine column &quot;Carsten&#x27;s Corner&quot; (1989):

The column also provided definitions for the related but distinct terms &#x27;breadboard&#x27; (a term used since 1940), &#x27;prototype&#x27;, &#x27;engineering prototype&#x27;, and &#x27;brassboard&#x27;.

==Examples==

=== Filmmaking===
&quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;300&quot;, and &quot;Sin City&quot; were all shot in front of a greenscreen with almost all backgrounds and props computer-generated. All three used proof-of-concept short films. In the case of &quot;Sin City&quot;, the short film became the prologue of the final film.

Pixar sometimes creates short animated films that use a difficult or untested technique. Their short film &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; used techniques for animation of cloth and of human facial expressions later used in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Similarly, Pixar created several short films as proofs of concept for new techniques for water motion, sea anemone tentacles, and a slowly appearing whale in preparation for the production of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.

=== Engineering===
In engineering and technology, a rough prototype of a new idea is often constructed as a &quot;proof of concept&quot;. For example, a working concept of an electrical device may be constructed using a breadboard. A patent application often requires a demonstration of functionality prior to being filed. Some universities have proof of concept centers to &quot;fill the &#x27;funding gap&#x27;&quot; for &quot;seed-stage investing&quot; and &quot;accelerate the commercialization of university innovations&quot;. Proof of concept centers provide &quot;seed funding to novel, early stage research that most often would not be funded by any other conventional source&quot;.

=== Business development===
In the field of business development and sales, a vendor may allow a prospect customer to try a product. This use of proof of concept helps establish viability, isolate technical issues, and suggest an overall direction, as well as provide feedback for budgeting and other forms of internal decision-making processes.

In these cases, the proof of concept may mean the use of specialized sales engineers to ensure that the vendor makes a best-possible effort.

=== Security===
In both computer security and encryption, &quot;proof of concept&quot; refers to a demonstration that in principle shows how a system may be protected or compromised, without the necessity of building a complete working vehicle for that purpose. Winzapper was a proof of concept which possessed the bare minimum of capabilities needed to selectively remove an item from the Windows Security Log, but it was not optimized in any way.

=== Software development===
In software development, the term &#x27;proof of concept&#x27; often characterizes several distinct processes with different objectives and participant roles: vendor business roles may utilize a proof of concept to establish whether a system satisfies some aspect of the purpose it was designed for. Once a vendor is satisfied, a prototype is developed which is then used to seek funding or to demonstrate to prospective customers.

The US General Services Administration has a checklist for defining an Agile software proof of concept, which includes clear definitions of the problem, pre-POC input required, and output criteria (including success criteria).

The key benefits of the proof of concept in software development are:

*The possibility to choose the best technology stack for the software (application or web platform)
*A higher probability of investors&#x27; interest in the future software product
*The ability to simplify and improve the ease of testing and validating ideas for the software&#x27;s functionality
*Receiving valuable feedback of a target audience (users) even before building a full-scope system
*Onboarding first clients before an official software release

A &#x27;steel thread&#x27; is technical proof of concept that touches all of the technologies in a solution. By contrast, a &#x27;proof of technology&#x27; aims to determine the solution to some technical problem (such as how two systems might integrate) or to demonstrate that a given configuration can achieve a certain throughput. No business users need be involved in a proof of technology.

A pilot project refers to an initial roll-out of a system into production, targeting a limited scope of the intended final solution. The scope may be limited by the number of users who can access the system, the business processes affected, the business partners involved, or other restrictions as appropriate to the domain. The purpose of a pilot project is to test, often in a production environment.

Tech demos are designed as proof of concept for the development of video games. They can demonstrate graphical or gameplay capabilities crucial for particular games.

=== Drug development===

Although not suggested by natural language, and in contrast to usage in other areas, &quot;proof of principle&quot; and &quot;proof of concept&quot; are not synonymous in drug development. A third term, &quot;proof of mechanism&quot;, is closely related and is also described here. All of these terms lack rigorous definitions and exact usage varies between authors, between institutions and over time. The descriptions given below are intended to be informative and practically useful.

The underlying principle is related to the use of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in early clinical trials. In early development it is not practical to directly measure that a drug is effective in treating the desired disease, and a surrogate endpoint is used to guide whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with further testing. For example, although it cannot be determined early that a new antibiotic cures patients with pneumonia, early indicators would include that the drug is effective in killing bacteria in laboratory tests, or that it reduces temperature in infected patients—such a drug would merit further testing to determine the appropriate dose and duration of treatment. A new anti-hypertension drug could be shown to reduce blood pressure, indicating that it would be useful to conduct more extensive testing of long-term treatment in the expectation of showing reductions in stroke (cerebrovascular accident) or heart attack (myocardial infarction). Surrogate endpoints are often based on laboratory blood tests or imaging investigations like X-ray or CT scan.

* &quot;Proof of mechanism&quot; or PoM relates to the earliest stages of drug development, often pre-clinical (i.e., before trialling the drug on humans, or before trialling with research animals). It could be based on showing that the drug interacts with the intended molecular receptor or enzyme, and/or affects cell biochemistry in the desired manner and direction.
* &quot;Proof of principle&quot; or PoP relates to early clinical development and typically refers to an evaluation of the effect of a new treatment on disease biomarkers, but not the clinical endpoints of the condition. Early stage clinical trials may aim to demonstrate Proof of Mechanism, or Proof of Principle, or both. A decision is made at this point as to whether to progress the drug into later development, or if it should be dropped.
* &quot;Proof of concept&quot; or PoC refers to early clinical drug development, conventionally divided into the phases of clinical research Phase I (&quot;first-in-humans&quot;) and Phase IIA.

Phase I is typically conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers who are given single doses or short courses of treatment (e.g., up to 2 weeks). Studies in this phase aim to show that the new drug has some of the desired clinical activity (e.g., that an experimental anti-hypertensive drug actually has some effect on reducing blood pressure), that it can be tolerated when given to humans, and to give guidance as to dose levels that are worthy of further study. Other Phase I studies aim to investigate how the new drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted (ADME studies).

Phase IIA is typically conducted in up to 100 patients with the disease of interest. Studies in this Phase aim to show that the new drug has a useful amount of the desired clinical activity (e.g., that an experimental anti-hypertensive drug reduces blood pressure by a useful amount), that it can be tolerated when given to humans in the longer term, and to investigate which dose levels might be most suitable for eventual marketing.

A decision is made at this point as to whether to progress the drug into later development, or if it should be dropped. If the drug continues, it will progress into later stage clinical studies, termed Phase IIB and Phase III.

Phase III studies involve larger numbers of patients—commonly multicenter trials—treated at doses and durations representative of marketed use, and in randomised comparison to placebo and/or existing active drugs. They aim to show convincing, statistically significant evidence of efficacy and to give a better assessment of safety than is possible in smaller, short-term studies.

A decision is made at this point as to whether the drug is effective and safe, and if so an application is made to regulatory authorities (such as the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency) for the drug to receive permission to be marketed for use outside of clinical trials.

Clinical trials can continue after marketing authorization has been received, for example, to better delineate safety, to determine appropriate use alongside other drugs or to investigate additional uses.

<doc id="608675" wikidata="Q2275601" url="?curid=608675" title="30 Hudson Street">
<text>30 Hudson Street, also known as Goldman Sachs Tower, is a , 42-story building in Jersey City, New Jersey. It is the second tallest building in New Jersey. Completed in 2004, the tower was designed by César Pelli, and was the tallest building in the state for 14 years. It houses offices, a cafeteria, a health unit, and a full-service fitness facility including a physical therapy clinic.

The building is in the Exchange Place area close to a PATH station and is accessible by the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail at the Essex Street and Exchange Place stops.

The tower sits on the waterfront overlooking the Hudson River and Lower Manhattan and is visible from all five of the New York City boroughs. On a clear day, the building may be visible from Highlands, New Jersey to the south and from Bear Mountain, New York to the north, away.

Originally intended to be a dedicated use building for Goldman Sachs&#x27; middle and back office units, lower than projected staffing levels at the bank following the global financial crisis forced Goldman to seek occupancy from other tenants to avoid forgone rental income. Royal Bank of Canada currently shares the space, with plans for other professional service firms to take occupancy as well in the near future. Since 2020, the building also houses the headquarters of Organon International., AIG &amp; Lord Abbett.

== History ==

Originally the tower was meant to be the centerpiece of an entire Goldman Sachs campus at Exchange Place, which was to include a training center, a university, and a large hotel complex. Many of the company&#x27;s Manhattan-based equity traders refused to move away from Wall Street, delaying the occupation of the building&#x27;s top 13 floors, which remained vacant until early 2008.

Once a derelict and mostly industrial part of Jersey City, the Exchange Place area forms part of New Jersey&#x27;s Gold Coast, a revitalized strip of land along the formerly industrial west bank of the Hudson. Economic development in the 2000s spurred large-scale residential, commercial, and office development along the waterfront.

Although the location was largely rejected by the company&#x27;s financial executives, 4,000 Goldman Sachs employees made the move to the building, including much of the company&#x27;s real estate, technology, operations, and administrative departments. The building is certified under LEED-NC Version 2.0 of the U.S. Green Building Council. The building has been surrounded by pedestrian protective scaffolding since 2010.

The company completed construction of another tower in 2010 to house the bulk of their sales and trading departments. It is located at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan just north of Brookfield Place (originally the World Financial Center), almost directly across the water from 30 Hudson. Under their &quot;Venice strategy&quot;, Goldman Sachs launched a ferry service between the two buildings in 2013, operated by the Billybey Ferry Company.

== In media ==

The building was used by the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign to symbolize Goldman Sachs and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s ties to the company.

The building can briefly be seen in &quot;The Avengers&quot; when Iron Man prevents New York City from being struck by a missile, and in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, when Tony Stark is about to revoke Peter Parker&#x27;s Spider Man suit.

The building, along with its surrounding skyscrapers, is the background image for the recorded audio for Markus Schulz&#x27;s Global DJ Broadcast World Tour recorded in Barcode in nearby Elizabeth.

<text>Owens Park was a large hall of residence located in the Fallowfield district of the city of Manchester, England. The site is owned by the University of Manchester and housed 1,056 students. Owens Park is a significant part of the Fallowfield Campus of the University of Manchester. The terms &#x27;Owens Park&#x27; and &#x27;Fallowfield Campus&#x27; are sometimes used interchangeably. The first phase was completed in 1964 and the second in 1965.

The tower was vacated in 2021 and demolition began in 2024.

== History ==
The hall, designed by Building Design Partnership, and built in 1964–66, is most notable for its tower, which is a local landmark. It has a fibreglass relief, &quot;Cosmos I&quot;, by Mitzi Cunliffe, at the base.

A 2001 plan by the University of Manchester to demolish the tower in 2004 was subsequently abandoned as a result of protests by current and past residents. In 2005 a refurbishment programme was planned. It was announced in 2014 that Owens Park is due to be demolished as part of the plans to redevelop the Fallowfield Campus with brand new student accommodation.

In 2021, the halls closed as part of a wider ongoing regeneration of the Fallowfield Campus, with the halls delisted for incoming students beginning that year. In early 2024, planning permission for the £400m redevelopment was given the green light, and it was confirmed that Owens Park would be demolished.

==Organisation==

Owens Park comprised five main residential blocks (Tower, Tree Court, Green Court, Little Court, and the Mall), an entertainment block (referred to as &quot;The OP&quot;), where the weekly Owens Park BOP (&#x27;Big Old Party&#x27;) used to take place, and an administration/library block. It also contained a computer cluster available to all students of the University.

The residential blocks were internally sub-divided into &#x27;houses&#x27;, each housing approximately 30-40 students. In the past, Tree Court was exclusively female, whilst the other blocks housed only male students. All block were of mixed sex, though any given floor in a house was single sex with exception to the tower. Each house had a supervising tutor and a common room. Each floor in a house had its own bathroom and kitchen. The halls were catered during the week.

There were generally rivalries between adjacent houses and other halls of residence, these were contested in sporting events such as football as each halls of residence generally have a team. Football matches are held each Wednesday and the occasional Saturday (for cup matches).

Owens Park Students&#x27; Association (OPSA) organised leisure and sporting activities, and was run by a committee formed of students who lived the hall.

==Notable residents==
Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien was a resident during his time at university in Manchester, as was Rik Mayall. The Chemical Brothers played their first gig at the Owens Park BOP. The comedian Jack Whitehall also lived in the Tower, where also the actor Benedict Cumberbatch stayed. Other residents included Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith who formed Van der Graaf Generator in 1967 while living there.

==The BOP==
Prior to September 2009 Owens Park BOP (Big Old Party) was a night held in Owens Park every Friday in the Owens Park tower&#x27;s ballroom for students of the University of Manchester. The BOP generally had a theme and from September 2008 charged £1 entry to residents, which had caused some outrage amongst residents as previously it had been free. It had a charge of £3.50 for all other entrants. Only students were allowed to enter the BOP and a student card must have been presented upon entry.

The BOP was a popular student night out due to its low cost of drinks and transport as most of the BOP&#x27;s customers were residents of local student halls of residence. However, Owens Park residents had been known to have become disgruntled both at the terrible music often played by the DJs and the students from other halls of residence coming to the event with the large queues this created to gain access.

The BOP usually had a theme each week such as a western theme or a dead celebrity theme causing large numbers of students to dress up for the occasion.

The BOP was set out very much like a classic school disco except with the inclusion of the sale of alcohol. As a customer entered they were greeted with the main tower bar with its own DJ and a vast amount of seating; however, the main draw of the BOP lay in the large hall upstairs. Upstairs there was a second bar and a foyer-like drinking area, and next door there was a large conference hall. The large hall had a disco-like atmosphere and professional DJ on the stage, with small amounts of seating at the sides. The BOP was generally open from 8 pm till around 2 am; however, times had been known to vary.

The BOP was run by the Owens Park Student&#x27;s Association Executive Committee (OPSA). The Committee is also in charge of running all other hall activities such as the pub quiz, karaoke, sports, and hall pub and club outings.

The BOP is known on a larger scale for being the venue of the Chemical Brothers&#x27; first gig.

After its 2009 move to a pub outside Fallowfield, the Jabez Clegg, attendances steadily declined. Following many rumours, the last BOP took place on 25 January 2013, bringing an end to its 25-year run.

<text>Gary Frank (born 1969) is a British comics artist, notable for pencilling on &quot;Midnight Nation&quot; and &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, both written by J. Michael Straczynski. He has also worked with author Peter David on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot;. He had a creator-owned series, &quot;Kin&quot;, which he wrote himself, published by Top Cow Productions in 2000.

Writer Geoff Johns, who has collaborated with Frank, has opined that Frank&#x27;s rendition of Superman is the best of his generation and that the only other artist in the same league with Frank in this regard is Curt Swan.

==Comics career==
===1990s===
Gary Frank began his professional career in 1991, illustrating covers and interior short stories for publications such as &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and &quot;Toxic!&quot;. After illustrating the comic elements of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;HeroQuest&quot; tie-in HeroQuest A Marvel Winter Special in 1991 he became a regular series artist in 1992 on &quot;Motormouth &amp; Killpower&quot;. It was on that series that he began a long-running collaboration with inker Cam Smith, who would continue to ink Frank&#x27;s work for many years. In 1992, Frank was recruited by Marvel Comics to illustrate covers for &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, beginning with issue No. 400. Shortly thereafter, he was hired as the series&#x27; ongoing artist beginning with issue No. 403 (March 1993) and ending with No. 425 (Jan. 1995).

During his initial time at Marvel, Frank contributed covers, interiors and pin-up illustrations for various series, such as &quot;X-Men Unlimited&quot;, the &quot;Sabretooth Special&quot;, &quot;X-Men Classic&quot;, &quot;X-Men Prime&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme&quot;, among others. He drew covers for Acclaim Comics&#x27; &quot;Ninjak&quot; and Harris Comics&#x27; &quot;Vampirella&quot;.

In 1996, Frank and Smith were hired as the art team on DC Comics&#x27; new &quot;Supergirl&quot; ongoing series, which re-teamed Frank with writer Peter David. Frank&#x27;s run as penciller ended with issue No. 9 (May 1997), although he continued to provide covers for the series until issue No. 21. Other assignments for DC included a &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; one-shot and the DC/Marvel Amalgam Comics one-shot, &quot;Bullets and Bracelets&quot;.

In 1997, Frank and Smith moved to Image Comics, where they, along with writer John Arcudi, were hired as the new creative team on the Wildstorm title &quot;Gen13&quot;, beginning with the epilogue story in issue No. 25. Their run on the series was praised for its dark, realistic style in both writing and art; however, the drastic change in tone and style alienated many longtime fans who had grown accustomed to the more fantastical and cartoonish approach of the Brandon Choi/J. Scott Campbell run. The Arcudi/Frank/Smith tenure on the series lasted two years, until issue No. 41 (July 1999). It was during this run, in 1998, that Wildstorm head Jim Lee moved his studio and all its properties to DC Comics. Therefore, issues No. 25–36 were published by Image and issues No. 37–41 were published by DC/Wildstorm.

===2000s===
In 2000, Frank worked on various assignments for both DC and Marvel, including issue No. 7 of &quot;Tom Strong&quot; under DC&#x27;s America&#x27;s Best Comics imprint and writing and penciling a two-page X-Men story in &quot;X-Men: Millennial Visions&quot;, his final collaboration to date with inker Cam Smith. &quot;Kin&quot;, a six-issue miniseries created, written and penciled by Frank, was published under Image&#x27;s Top Cow imprint. The story tells of a secret government agency named S.I.A. who discovers that a race of neanderthal men exists in the mountains of Alaska and proceed to eliminate them to obtain their technology, which developed differently from that of the rest of the world. The book&#x27;s protagonist, S.I.A. agent Trey McAloon, is opposed to the agency&#x27;s plans and confronts them about it, while the book&#x27;s other main character, Alaskan Park Ranger Elizabeth Leaky, establishes contact with one of the neanderthals.

The miniseries&#x27; conclusion was open-ended, with questions left unanswered, but so far no sequel or continuation of the story has been announced. The trade paperback collection of &quot;Kin&quot; entitled &quot;Kin: Descent of Man&quot; includes six pages of additional story that were not featured in the original issues.

In 2000, Frank began his first collaboration with J. Michael Straczynski, the television writer and creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Frank served as penciller on Straczynski&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Nation&quot;, a 12-issue limited series published by Top Cow from 2000 to 2002 under their now-defunct Joe&#x27;s Comics imprint. The first issue of the series included a five-page interview with Frank and Straczynski. One of the inkers on the series was Jon Sibal, with whom Frank would begin a long-running artistic collaboration that continues to this day.

On 16 July 2002, it was announced that Frank had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel. His first work under this contract was a two-issue story arc on &quot;The Avengers&quot; issues No. 61–62, written by Geoff Johns and inked by Jon Sibal. In 2003, Frank re-teamed with Straczynski on &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, a revamp of Marvel&#x27;s superhero team Squadron Supreme, published under their mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint. With its realism and mature storytelling, the series became Marvel&#x27;s first MAX title to sell over 100,000 copies, making it their best-selling mature-readers series of all time. The series ran for 18 issues from October 2003 to October 2005.

During his run on &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, Frank provided covers for a diverse number of Marvel series such as &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; No. 7; &quot;Wolverine/Punisher&quot; No. 2; &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; No. 75; issues No. 4 and 6 of the &quot;Supreme Power&quot; spin-off miniseries, &quot;Doctor Spectrum&quot;; &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 515 and 517; &quot;Black Panther&quot; No. 10; and numerous others, as well as two pages of interior art for the &quot;Avengers: Finale&quot; one-shot.

On 10 May 2007, having worked several years on a Marvel exclusive contract, Frank signed a new one with DC Comics. He served as the artist on &quot;Action Comics&quot; with writer Geoff Johns. The creative team produced the &quot;Brainiac&quot; storyline in which Superman&#x27;s adopted father Jonathan Kent was killed. Frank and Johns continued to work on Superman in the &quot;&quot; six-issue mini-series. The story features what Johns and DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio called a &quot;definitive&quot; telling of the origin story of Superman, dealing with his life in Smallville, his first adventure with the Legion of Super-Heroes as Superboy, and his arrival in Metropolis and at the Daily Planet.

===2010s===
In 2012, Frank and Johns collaborated on &quot;&quot;, an original graphic novel set on Earth-one of the DC Multiverse. The novel is the first in a series of graphic novels that redefines Batman. Since 2017, Johns and Frank have worked together on &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, a limited series featuring Superman and Doctor Manhattan.

===2020s===
On 12 October 2023, Frank and a group of colleagues announced at the New York Comic Con that they were forming a cooperative media company called Ghost Machine, which would publish creator-owned comics, and allow the participating creators to benefit from the development of their intellectual properties. The company publishes its books through Image Comics, and its other founding creators include Geoff Johns, Brad Meltzer, Jason Fabok, Bryan Hitch, Francis Manapul, and Peter J. Tomasi, all of whom would produce comics work exclusively through that company. Frank&#x27;s inaugural work for the company was drawing &quot;Geiger: Ground Zero&quot;, a two-issue series written by Johns that serves as a prequel to their 2021 miniseries of the same name. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the book centers upon a man named Tariq Geiger who lost his family and his humanity in a nuclear war, when he was transformed into the Glowing Man, a being who can absorb radiation but struggles to contain it. &quot;Ground Zero&quot; would be followed by an ongoing &quot;Geiger&quot; series.

==Work in other media==
In 1990, prior working in the comics industry, Gary Frank produced a book titled &quot;Rovers: Portrait of a Football Team&quot;, which featured caricatures of a number of Bristol Rovers F.C. players from the 1989–90 season. He wrote it in conjunction with then-Rovers player Geoff Twentyman.

Frank&#x27;s artwork was featured during the finale of the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot; when the character Chloe Sullivan is shown reading a Superman comic book to her son.

<doc id="608685" wikidata="Q180844" url="?curid=608685" title="Gulf of Carpentaria">
<text>The Gulf of Carpentaria () is a sea off the northern coast of Australia. It is enclosed on three sides by northern Australia and bounded on the north by the eastern Arafura Sea, which separates Australia and New Guinea. The northern boundary is generally defined as a line from Slade Point, Queensland (the northwestern corner of Cape York Peninsula) in the northeast, to Cape Arnhem on the Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory (the easternmost point of Arnhem Land) in the west.

At its mouth, the Gulf is wide, and further south, . The north-south length exceeds . It covers a water area of about . The general depth is between with a maximum depth of . The tidal range in the Gulf of Carpentaria is between . The Gulf and adjacent Sahul Shelf were dry land at the peak of the last ice age 18,000 years ago when global sea level was around below its present position. At that time a large, shallow lake occupied the centre of what is now the Gulf. The Gulf hosts a submerged coral reef province that was only recognised in 2004.

==History==
Yulluna (also known as Yalarnga, Yalarrnga, Jalanga, Jalannga, Wonganja, Gunggalida, Jokula) is an Australian Aboriginal language. The Yulluna language region includes the local government boundaries of the Shire of Cloncurry.

Kayardild (also known as Kaiadilt and Gayadilta) is a language of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Kayardild language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mornington Shire Council.

The first European explorer to visit the region (and Australia) was the Dutch Willem Janszoon (whose name is also written as Jansz) in his 1605–06 voyage. His fellow countryman, Jan Carstenszoon (or &quot;Carstensz&quot;), visited in 1623 and named the gulf in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, at that time the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Abel Tasman also explored the coast in 1644. The region was later explored and charted by the English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802 and 1803.

The first overland expedition to reach the Gulf was the Burke and Wills expedition, led by Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke and William John Wills which left Melbourne, Victoria in August 1860 and reached the mouth of the Bynoe River in February 1861. However, both men died on the return journey.

==Geography==
The land bordering the Gulf is generally flat and low-lying. To the west is Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt, the largest island in the Gulf. To the east is the Top End of the Northern Territory, including the Cape York Peninsula, and the Torres Strait which joins the Gulf to the Coral Sea. The area to the south (like the Cape York Peninsula, part of Queensland) is known as the Gulf Country.

The Gulf Country supports the world&#x27;s largest intact savanna woodlands as well as native grasslands, known as the Carpentaria tropical savanna. The woodlands also extend up the west and east coast of the Gulf. They are dominated by Eucalyptus and Melaleuca species from the family Myrtaceae.

The climate is hot and humid with two seasons per year. The dry season lasts from about April until November and is characterized by very dry southeast to east winds, generated by migratory winter high pressure systems to the south. The wet season lasts from December to March. Most of the year&#x27;s rainfall is compressed into these months, and during this period, many low-lying areas are flooded. The Gulf is prone to tropical cyclones during the period between November and April. The gulf experiences an average of three cyclones each year that are thought to transport sediments in a clockwise direction along the Gulf&#x27;s coast.

In many other parts of Australia, there are dramatic climatic transitions over fairly short distances. The Great Dividing Range, which parallels the entire east and south-east coast, is responsible for the typical pattern of a well-watered coastal strip, a fairly narrow band of mountains, and then a vast, inward-draining plain that receives little rainfall. In the Gulf Country, however, there are no mountains to restrict rainfall to the coastal band and the transition from the profuse tropical growth of the seaside areas to the arid scrubs of central Australia is gradual.

In September and October the Morning Glory cloud appears in the Southern Gulf. The best vantage point to see this phenomenon is in the Burketown area shortly after dawn.
==Coral reefs==
The Gulf of Carpentaria is known to contain fringing reefs and isolated coral colonies, but no near-surface patch or barrier reefs exist in the Gulf at the present time. However, this has not always been the case. Expeditions carried out by Geoscience Australia in 2003 and in 2005 aboard the revealed the presence of a submerged coral reef province covering at least in the southern Gulf. The patch reefs have their upper surfaces at a mean water depth of , were undetected by satellites or aerial photographs, and were only recognised using multibeam swath sonar surveys supplemented with seabed sampling and video. Their existence points to an earlier, late Quaternary phase of framework reef growth under cooler-climate and lower sea level conditions than today.

== Major rivers ==
In the Top End, the Roper River, Walker River and Wilton River flow into the Gulf. The Cox River, Calvert River, Leichhardt River, McArthur River, Flinders River, Norman River and the Gilbert River drain the Gulf Country. A number of rivers flow from the Cape York Peninsula into the Gulf, including Smithburne River, Mitchell River, Alice River, Staaten River, Mission River, Wenlock River, and Archer River.

== Industry ==
Extensive areas of seagrass beds have allowed commercial shrimp operations in the Gulf. Zinc, lead and silver is mined from the McArthur River zinc mine and exported via the Gulf. Another zinc mine, Century Zinc is in the gulf on the Queensland side of the border. It exports its product through the port facility at Karumba. The cattle industry is also a very important part of the regional economy in the gulf.

According to the then Chairman of the Gulf of Carpentaria&#x27;s Commercial Fisherman&#x27;s Organisation, Gary Ward, the number of sightings of Indonesian vessels fishing illegally in the gulf&#x27;s waters increased in early 2005. By 2011, the numbers of illegal fishing boat interceptions had declined significantly with the cause attributed to enforcement efforts and education programs in Indonesia.

===Major port plan===
In 2012, a major new port located to the west of Karumba and rail connection to the North West Minerals Province was proposed by Carpentaria Rail. The advantages of a port at Karumba compared to Townsville was that it was three or four days closer to Asia via shipping routes. Additionally, expansion is taking place of the Bing Bong Port which services the McArthur River zinc mine, awarded the Northern Territory Earth award.

== Physiography ==
The Gulf is one of the distinct physiographic sections of the larger (and surrounding) Carpentaria Basin province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Basins physiographic division.

<doc id="608687" wikidata="Q1195559" url="?curid=608687" title="USS John S. McCain (DDG-56)">
<text>USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; (DDG-56) is the sixth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer currently in the service of the United States Navy. She is part of the Destroyer Squadron 23 within the Third Fleet, and has her homeport at Naval Station Everett in Everett, Washington.

The destroyer was involved in a collision with the tanker ship &quot;Alnic MC&quot; on 21 August 2017 off the coast of Singapore, which resulted in the deaths of 10 of her crew, and left another five injured. The damage put the ship out of operational status for over two years, with completion in October 2019.

==Naming==
This warship was originally named after John S. McCain Sr., and John S. McCain Jr., both admirals in the United States Navy. John S. McCain Sr. commanded the aircraft carrier , and later the Fast Carrier Task Force during the latter stages of World War II. John S. McCain Jr. commanded the submarines and during World War II. He subsequently held a number of posts, rising to commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Command, before retiring in 1972. These men were, respectively, the grandfather and father of Vietnam War Navy captain and later Senator John S. McCain III.

On 11 July 2018, at a rededication ceremony, Senator John McCain was added as a namesake, along with his father and grandfather.

The ship&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Big Bad John&quot;, and has the motto &quot;Fortune Favors the Brave&quot;.

==Service history==
===Construction and commissioning===

&quot;John S. McCain&quot;″s keel was laid down on 3 September 1991, at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. She was launched on 26 September 1992, sponsored by Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain III, and was commissioned on 2 July 1994, at the Bath Iron Works with Commander John K. Ross as the first commanding officer. The former President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, was the ceremony&#x27;s principal speaker. Her maiden deployment was from 10 November 1995 to 10 May 1996 to the 5th and 7th fleets with visits to Kochi, India, Fremantle and Newcastle Australia and Suva, Fiji.
After the ship returned to her home port in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she shifted to the forward-deploy port in Yokosuka, Japan, in June 1997. In October 1997, she visited the port of Qingdao China, the first visit to Communist China other than Hong Kong, in 15 years.

===2000s===
In January 2003, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf. She launched 39 Tomahawk missiles in support of the invasion of Iraq and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her service. &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was awarded the Navy Battle E for DESRON 15 in 2003 and again in 2004. On 16 February 2007, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle Effectiveness Award.

On 11 June 2009, a Chinese submarine reportedly collided with the towed sonar array of &quot;John S. McCain&quot; near Subic Bay, Philippines. The incident caused damage to the array, but was described as an &quot;inadvertent encounter&quot;.

In June 2009, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; pursued the North Korean cargo ship toward Burma in enforcement of the new United Nations resolution of an arms export embargo against North Korea. The vessel was suspected of carrying arms for the Burmese junta government. &quot;Kang Nam 1&quot; returned to North Korea without delivering her cargo to Burma.

In July 2009, the destroyer berthed at Yokohama&#x27;s international passenger terminal on a goodwill tour. The ship was opened to the public on 22 July 2009.

===2010s===
In March 2011, in company with the aircraft carrier , the ship was deployed off northeastern Honshu, Japan, to assist with relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. During that time, the ship may have been exposed to leaking radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents.

In April 2013, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was sent to South Korea during escalating tensions between the Koreas. In June 2014, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was sent to Subic Bay to perform in CARAT (Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training) exercises.

On 2 October 2016, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; and made the first port visit by U.S. Navy ships to Cam Ranh Bay since end of the Vietnam War in 1975. In August 2017, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; sailed within of Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, exercising a claim to freedom of navigation. China, claiming sovereignty over the reef, expressed its &quot;strong dissatisfaction&quot; in response to the action. A US Navy representative reported that a Chinese frigate had sent at least 10 radio messages warning that the &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was in Chinese waters, to which the US ship replied that it was &quot;conducting routine operations in international waters.&quot;

===2017 MV &quot;Alnic MC&quot; collision===

At 5:24 am on 21 August 2017, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was involved in a collision with the Liberian-flagged &quot;Alnic MC&quot; off the coast of Singapore and Malaysia, east of the Strait of Malacca. According to a United States Navy press release, the breach &quot;resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms.&quot; Ten US Navy sailors died as a result of the crash, which prompted the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore to start a multi-agency SAR effort as the agency responsible for coordinating air-sea rescue operations within Singapore&#x27;s Maritime Search and Rescue Region (MSRR). The Singapore Transport Safety Bureau (TSIB) also launched a marine safety investigation following the collision in accordance with the International Maritime Organisation&#x27;s Casualty Investigation Code in Singapore&#x27;s capacity as a coastal state, and published its final report on 8 March 2018. The U.S. Navy announced on 24 August 2017 that it had suspended search-and-rescue efforts for survivors in the open sea to focus on the recovery of the remains of the missing sailors still inside the flooded compartments of the ship. By 27 August U.S. Navy and Marine Corps divers had recovered the remains of all 10 sailors. On 12 September 2017, the United States&#x27; chargé d&#x27;affaires Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath expressed thanks for Singapore&#x27;s support during the SAR operations.

Throughout 2018, she was under repair in drydock and by November 2018, the ship left drydock and was transferred to a pier to continue her repairs. The repairs were completed in October 2019.

Investigation into the collision showed that an overly complex touchscreen system used for throttle control and training deficiencies had contributed to a loss of control of the ship just before it crossed paths with a merchant ship in the Singapore Strait, prompting a decision by the Navy to revert ships of this class to mechanical throttle controls fleetwide.

===2020s===
While conducting a Freedom of Navigation exercise in Peter the Great Bay, in the Sea of Japan on 24 November 2020, the Russian Navy destroyer demanded that &quot;John S. McCain&quot; leave the bay, which Russia claims as their territorial waters, or they would be &quot;rammed&quot;. While Russian news agency TASS claims that the Russian Navy chased the US destroyer out of the bay, a spokesperson for the U.S. 7th Fleet claims that &quot;John S. McCain&quot; left bay of their own accord, after completing the exercise. The US further claims that they were in international waters at all times, which was the purpose of the exercise.

On 17 September 2021, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; departed her previous home port Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan as part of a scheduled shift to her new homeport at Naval Station Everett in Everett, Washington with 24 years of forward deployed service.

On 6 August 2023, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; and three other destroyers responded to a joint Chinese-Russian patrol in international waters near Alaska. The Chinese-Russian flotilla left without incident.

On 4 September 2024, the US Navy relieved the captain of the &quot;John S. McCain&quot; of duty because of a loss of confidence in his ability to lead after a steering issue led to a near miss in the Middle East. Earlier a picture of the captain of &quot;John S. McCain&quot; firing a rifle, whose scope was mounted backwards, went viral on social media.

<text>Central Michigan University (CMU) is a public research university in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States. It was established in 1892 as a private normal school and became a state institution in 1895. CMU is one of the eight research universities in Michigan and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It has more than 15,000 students on its Mount Pleasant campus. CMU offers 200 academic programs at the undergraduate, master&#x27;s, specialist, and doctoral levels. The Central Michigan Chippewas compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference in six men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s sports.

== History ==
CMU opened in 1892 as the Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute. Prof. Charles F. R. Bellows, a University of Michigan graduate, became the founding principal of the school in June 1892.

For the first year, 31 students attended classes in the Carpenter Building in downtown Mount Pleasant. Bellows surveyed the future location of the campus and was involved in the construction of the original Main Building, which opened in September 1893. Within the first two years, land was acquired, and a $10,000 school building was constructed.

During Bellows&#x27; tenure, he organized a separate Conservatory for Music through his own funds, which became incorporated into the Normal in 1900. He continued to teach as a professor and spoke to teacher groups throughout the State. Bellows also led an advertising effort for the school in order to gain more students.

In 1895, the Michigan State Board of Education assumed control of the school, renaming it Central Michigan Normal School. Bellows resigned from Central in the following year. He returned to Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1902 to join the faculty of the Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University).

By 1918, the campus consisted of 25 acres with five buildings. On June 1, 1959, with 40 buildings now standing on the 235-acre campus and an enrollment of 4,500 students, Central was renamed Central Michigan University. The designation reflected growth in the complexity of the school&#x27;s academic offerings as well as its physical growth in the post-war period. Enrollment tripled over the next 10 years.

In response to the need for doctors to practice in rural areas, CMU opened its medical school in 2010.

==Student life==
===Residence life===
Central Michigan University is home to 21 on-campus residence halls, arranged in four areas throughout the campus. In 2006, the 21st and 22nd residence halls on campus opened in the East complex. In 2019, the university decommissioned and demolished Barnes Hall, which was the oldest serving residence hall and the only one not physically connected to any other. In 2022, the university closed the North Residence Halls.

*North Residence Halls: Larzelere, Trout, Calkins, Robinson 
*South Residence Halls: Beddow, Merrill, Thorpe, Sweeney
*East Residence Halls: Saxe, Herrig, Woldt, Emmons; Celani and Fabiano
*The Towers: Carey, Cobb, Troutman and Wheeler (&quot;The Original Towers&quot;), Campbell, Kesseler and Kulhavi (&quot;The New Towers&quot;)
It was announced by the university on March 3, 2022, that Larzelere, Trout, Calkins, and Robinson would be closed during the 2022 Fall semester due to semester enrollment estimates.

The majority of CMU residence hall rooms are two-bedroom suites designed for 4 or 5 people. Three of the Original Towers (Cobb, Troutman and Wheeler), nine-story high-rise residence halls designed primarily for freshmen, feature one-bedroom suites for three or four people. The fourth of the Original Towers, Carey, was renovated to double-occupancy rooms in 2020 as a means of managing decreased enrollment. The New Towers, as well as Fabiano and Celani, are designed primarily for upperclassmen, and are four-bedroom suites. Residents of Robinson, Carey, Celani, Fabiano, Campbell, Kesseler and Kulhavi pay an additional charge over the standard room and board rate.

Each district is connected to one of four Residential Restaurants. The Towers features the RFoC, or Real Food on Campus, and the East Complex features the Fresh Food Company. Each area also has an after hours snack shop.

Some residence halls are designated as official Living Learning Communities, associated with a particular academic department, allowing students who choose to live there opportunities for study and collaboration with other students from similar programs.

*Beddow Hall – Business
*Herrig Hall – Music
*Emmons Hall – Health Professions
*Woldt Hall – Science and Engineering
*Sweeney Hall – Education and Human Services
*Thorpe Hall – Honors Program
*Calkins Hall – Leader Advancement Scholars &amp; Public Service Residential Community
*Troutman Hall – Multicultural Advancement/Cofer Scholars
*Cobb Hall – Public Service
*Kulhavi Hall – Transfer Students

CMU offers only co-ed residence halls, with Sweeney Hall the last to convert, from females only, in the fall of 2010.

Construction began on two more buildings, Celani and Fabiano, near the East Quad in the spring of 2005. The buildings are somewhat similar in design to the New Towers which opened in 2003. On December 1, 2005, one of the buildings was named The Ben and Marion Celani Residence hall to recognize the generosity of Detroit area businessman Thomas Celani and his wife Vicki. On April 20, 2006, the remaining building was named the Fabiano Family Residence Hall, recognizing their contribution to the school. John S. Fabiano served on the board of trustees 1999–2004, and also owns the Fabiano Brothers Inc, an alcohol distribution company. These two new halls opened for the fall semester of 2006, along with a new Residential Restaurant to serve the residents of the six East Area halls.

===Greek life===
CMU recognizes academic, social, and professional Greek organizations which comply with university rules and regulations such as its anti-hazing policies. Currently, in the social realm, there consists of 12 fraternities and 12 sororities. Other Greek life organizations that pertain to honoCe, degrees, and multicultural backgrounds have formed as well throughout the years. Each is unique to their own roots, and provides a great networking opportunity for students at the university.

===Campus safety===
On March 2, 2018, 19-year-old student James Eric Davis Jr. shot and killed his mother and father when they came to campus to take him home for spring break. After the shooting, Davis fled and the campus was placed on lockdown. Around 15 hours later, police arrested him and took him to a local hospital. The incident disrupted the travel plans of students and campus activities for several days. Davis was charged with two counts of murder and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm used to commit murder, and was later determined to be not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a psychiatric institution.

===Media===
The campus&#x27; student-run newspaper is &quot;Central Michigan Life&quot;. The paper is published every Thursday during the academic year and www.cm-life.com, which receives 1 million page views per year, is updated daily. &quot;CM Life&quot; was named one of the top three non-daily newspapers in the nation for 2007, 2018, 2019 by the Society of Professional Journalists. It also was named the best college newspaper in Division I in Michigan eight of the past 10 years. &quot;CM Life&quot; has been named winner of the National Pacemaker Awards by Associated Collegiate Press in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1989, 1990, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, 2019. It also was a finalist for the first time for an online Pacemaker in 2010. 
CM-Life has come in first place for the Best College Media Company in the nation seven years in a row (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) by College Media Business and Advertising Managers organization.

There are also two student-run college radio stations, FM 91.5 WMHW-FM and FM 101.1, a student produced newscast, News Central 34, and a student-run college television station MHTV. In 2005, a student-operated music label called Moore Media Records (MMR) was established.

In addition, the university owns and operates WCMU-TV, the region&#x27;s PBS station, and WCMU-FM, the NPR affiliate. Both stations serve most of Northern Michigan, including the eastern Upper Peninsula, through a network of repeater stations.

Also established in 2003 is White Pine Music, the recording label of the CMU School of Music.

On February 2, 2008, Central Michigan University&#x27;s online magazine, Grand Central Magazine, was launched. Currently updated weekly, the magazine is run through CMU&#x27;s Department of Journalism and features magazine style features from the world of sports, entertainment, style, technology and travel.

In September 2022, Central Michigan University&#x27;s Department of Fashion Merchandising and Design launched Verge Magazine, a fashion and lifestyle magazine that is entirely run by Central Michigan students. The magazine is offered in a digital format through the Verge Magazine website, as well as physical copies that are available for purchase. As of December 2023, Verge magazine has released seven issues and over five hundred physical copies have sold.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s athletics programs are affiliated with NCAA Division I. CMU was a member of the Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1950 to 1970. Almost all Central Michigan teams compete in the Mid-American Conference; the one exception until recently was the women&#x27;s lacrosse team, newly elevated from club to full varsity status for the 2015–2016 school year. It competed in the Southern Conference for a time, but joined the MAC for the 2021 season.

The football program is known for producing players such as Antonio Brown and Joe Staley. Before moving up to Division I, the football team won its second NCAA Division II national championship in 1974 by defeating the Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens 54 to 14. Notable Division I years include 1994, 2006, 2007, and 2009 when they won the MAC Football Championship Game. In 2009, they finished the season ranked #23 in the final AP Poll and #24 in the final Coaches Poll marking the first time that a CMU football team had ever ended the season ranked in the Top 25 at the NCAA Division I-FBS level. Since 2014, the football program has made a college bowl game, and continues to see its players set MAC records yearly.

Frequently defeating both the Michigan Wolverines and the Michigan State Spartans in dual meets, CMU&#x27;s wrestling team won its 10th straight MAC championship and seventh straight conference tournament title in 2008. The Chippewas tied for seventh at the NCAA Championships, scoring a school-record 69 points. Four individuals earned All-America honors.

The women&#x27;s basketball program has excelled to new levels. In 2018, the team made its way to the sweet sixteen of the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The team beat the LSU Tigers and Lady Tigers and the Ohio State Buckeyes in the first two rounds, only to lose to the Oregon Ducks in the third.

In 1958, the men&#x27;s swimming and diving team was runner-up to the North Central at the second annual NAIA national meet, which was held in Muncie, Indiana.

In May 2020, the university discontinued its men&#x27;s track and field program as part of budget cuts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In June of the same year, CMU announced it had received a waiver from the NCAA Division I Council that would allow the football program to remain in the Football Bowl Subdivision and give the school two years to bring the total number of men&#x27;s programs up to FBS compliance.

<text>Grignolino () is a red Italian wine grape variety commonly grown in the Piedmont region. It makes light colored wines and rosés with very fruity aromas, strong acidity and tannins. The name Grignolino derives from the word &quot;grignole&quot; which means &quot;many pips&quot; in the local Piedmontese dialect of the Asti region. The abundance of pips, or seeds, contributes to the strong, bitter tannins associated with the wine. Modern winemakers try to avoid the excess tannins with gentle and slow pressings. Grignolino has three &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOCs) that produce wine from it - Asti, Monferrato Casale, and Piemonte Grignolino.

==History==
Ampelographers believe that the grape is native to the Monferrato hills located between the towns of Asti and Casale. The name Grignolino derives from the word &quot;grignole&quot; which means &quot;many pips&quot; in the local dialect of the region.

==Wines==
Producers in the Asti region try to model Grignolino on the wines of Beaujolais and those made from the Dolcetto grape in the Cuneo. These light bodied, pale colored wines are made to be consumed young and while waiting for the brawnier, Nebbiolo and Barbera based wines of the region to age. While the grapes are relatively low in alcohol at around 11–12% ABV, they do have a significant amount of tannins due to the abundance of pips, or seeds. Modern winemaking techniques try to minimize the amount of tannin extraction by utilizing slow and gentle pressings. Wines made from Grignolino can have noticeably strong acidity and fruity aroma with alpine notes.

Grignolino is highly prone to mutation, creating a significant amount of clonal variation. These different clones of Grignolino can impart different aromas and flavor characteristics ranging from green herbal, leafy notes and vegetable stock to raspberry and fruit. The grape is also highly reflective of its &quot;terroir&quot; and the different types of vineyard soils that it may be planted in. Grignolino is also prone to millerandage, with clusters (or even grapes within a single cluster) at different stages of ripening. The severity of the millderandage varies from year to year and can dramatically affect the quality and yield totals of any given vintage.

===Wine regions===
Grignolino is primarily planted in the Asti province of Piedmont and is rarely found outside this region. One notable exception is the California producer Heitz Wine Cellars that grows a limited amount in their Napa Valley vineyard. Grignolino is also grown in the Santa Clara Valley at Guglielmo Winery in Morgan Hill. Guglielmo produces a dry Grignolino rose and also a red wine, both 100% Grignolino. Additionally, Grignolino is grown and blended with Dolcetto by Ripken Vineyards and Winery in Lodi, CA.

==Synonyms==
Grignolino is also known under the synonyms Arlandino, Balestra, Barbesino, Barbesinone, Barbezina, Barbisone d&#x27;Espagne, Barbosina de Bologne, Girodino, Girrodino, Grignolino Comune, Grignolino Fino Nero, Grignolino Grosso Nero, Grignolino Rosato, Grignolino Rosso, Grugnolino, Grugnolino Pisano, Nebbiolo Rosato, Neretto di Marengo, Pollasecca, Rosetta, Rossello, Rossetto, Rossetto Cites, and Verbesino.

<doc id="608705" wikidata="Q180175" url="?curid=608705" title="Grüner Veltliner">
<text>Grüner Veltliner (Green Veltliner) ) is a white wine grape variety grown primarily in Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The leaves of the grape vine are five-lobed with bunches that are long but compact, and deep green grapes that ripen in mid-late October in the Northern Hemisphere.

In 2008, Grüner Veltliner plantations in Austria stood at , and it accounts for 32.6% of all vineyards in the country, almost all of it being grown in the northeast of the country. Thus, it is the most-planted grape variety in Austria. Some is made into sparkling wine in the far northeast around Poysdorf. Along the Danube to the west of Vienna, in Wachau, Kremstal and Kamptal, it grows with Riesling in terraces on slopes so steep they can barely retain any soil. The result is a very pure, mineral wine capable of long aging, that stands comparison with some of the great wines of the world. In recent blind tastings organized by the Austrian Wine Marketing Board, Grüner Veltliners have beaten world-class Chardonnays from the likes of Mondavi and Maison Louis Latour.

Outside of Austria, Grüner Veltliner is the second most widely grown white grape variety in the Czech Republic, encompassing approximately and resulting in approximately 11% of Czech wine production. In recent years a few US wineries have started to grow and bottle Grüner Veltliner, including wineries and vineyards in Massachusetts, Blenheim Vineyards in Charlottesville, Virginia, at Hazy Mountain&#x27;s Little North Mountain Vineyard in Swoope, Virginia (Shenandoah Valley AVA)), Oregon, Maryland, the North Fork of Long Island AVA and Finger Lakes AVA regions of New York State, Napa Valley, Clarksburg AVA, Monterey AVA and Santa Ynez Valley AVA in California, Ashtabula County, Ohio, Southern New Jersey&#x27;s Bellview Winery, Pennsylvania, and along the Lake Michigan Shore AVA of Southwest Michigan. Gruner Veltliner is also planted in Australia, particularly in the Adelaide Hills wine region in South Australia, as well as the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada.

Some ampelographers (such as Hermann Goethe in his 1887 handbook of ampelography) have long assumed that Grüner Veltliner is not related to the other varieties with &quot;Veltliner&quot; in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related. A first DNA analysis in the late 1990s secured Savagnin (Traminer) as one parent of Grüner Veltliner, but was not able to identify the other parent among the candidates studied. The other parent was later found to be an originally unnamed variety of which only a single, abandoned, very old and weakened vine was found in Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge outside Eisenstadt in Austria. The grape is therefore referred to as &quot;St. Georgener-Rebe&quot; or &quot;St. Georgen-vine&quot;.

Grüner Veltliner has a reputation of being a particularly food-friendly wine and is a popular offering on restaurant wine lists. It is made into wines of many different styles - much is intended for drinking young in the Heuriger (bars serving new wine) of Vienna, a little is made into sparkling wine, but some is capable of long aging. The steep vineyards of the Danube (Donau) west of Vienna produce very pure, mineral Grüner Veltliners intended for laying down. Down in the plains, citrus and peach flavors are more apparent, with spicy notes of pepper and sometimes tobacco.

==History==

Grüner Veltliner has been believed to date back to Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians have yet to find a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document for the first time in 1855; before that time it was known as &quot;Weißgipfler&quot;. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War, it was regarded as just another Austrian grape, but after the introduction of Lenz Moser&#x27;s &quot;Hochkultur&quot; system of vine training, it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria&#x27;s most planted variety.

In recent years, Grüner Veltliner has seen an uptick in interest following the results of a 2002 wine tasting organized by Masters of Wine Jancis Robinson and Tim Atkin. Here Grüner Veltliner from Austria beat out several highly acclaimed white &quot;Grand cru&quot; wines from Burgundy.

===Pedigree===

In 2007, DNA analysis confirmed that Grüner Veltliner was a natural crossing of Savagnin (Traminer) and an obscure Austrian grapevine from the village of Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge located outside Eisenstadt in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria. The vine was first found in 2000 in an overgrown part of a pasture in a location where there had not been any vineyard since the late 19th century, and is assumed to have been the last vine in this location for over a century. Local experts were not able to determine the variety of the vine. Only when it was threatened to be ripped out in 2005 additional samples were taken and later analyzed at Klosterneuburg. Genetic analysis in the following years by Ferdinand Regner was able to determine that &quot;St. Georgener-Rebe&quot; is a parent variety to Grüner Veltliner.

St. Georgener-Rebe was once known under the synonym &quot;Grüner Muskateller&quot; but appears to have no direct relationship to the Muscat family of grapes. In February 2011, the single surviving vine of St. Georgener-Rebe, thought to be over 500 years old, was vandalized and severely cut in several places by an unknown assailant. The vine survived with the Austrian government designating the vine as a protected natural monument. Ampelographers are currently propagating cuttings of the vine for vineyard plantings and commercial cultivation.

===Relationship to other grapes===
Through its parent, Savagnin, Grüner Veltliner is a half sibling of Rotgipfler and is either a grandchild or a half-sibling to Pinot noir which has a parent-offspring relationship with Savagnin. The nature of this relationship is unclear since DNA profiling has not yet determined between Pinot and Savagnin which grape is the parent and which grape is the offspring.

Despite having the name &quot;Grüner Veltliner&quot;, the grape has no known connection to other Veltliner grapes including Roter Veltliner and Frühroter Veltliner. The grey-berried vine &quot;Grauer Veltliner&quot; (also known as Veltliner Grau) was once thought to be a distinct grape variety but DNA evidence in 1996 showed that it was a color mutation of Grüner Veltliner.

==Viticulture==

Grüner Veltliner is a mid-ripening grape variety that usually does not have an issue achieving physiological ripeness in most of the northern European wine regions where it is grown. The vine can be very fruitful and high yielding producing small, yellowish-green berries. Grüner Veltliner is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildews as well as infestation from a species of rust mites that feed on grape leaves.

While Grüner Veltliner can grow on a variety of vineyard soils, wine expert Oz Clarke notes that the grape tends to thrive on soils with high loess content. While newer vineyards have been experimenting with a variety of vine training systems, in Austria Grüner Veltliner has been historically trained in the Lenz Moser style developed in the 1920s. Known as the &quot;high culture&quot; or &quot;Hochkultur&quot; method because of how relatively high () the vine trunk is allowed to grow, the goal is to reduce vine density by spacing the vines in wide rows that are 3.5 meters (11.5 ft) apart.

==Wine regions==
Grüner Veltliner is most closely associated with Austria where it is the most widely planted grape variety in the country, covering almost a third of all Austrian vineyards, with 17,034 hectares (42,092 acres) in cultivation in 2012. The grape is authorized in five &quot;Districtus Austriae Controllatus&quot; (DAC) regions—the Weinviertel where it is the only permitted grape variety; Leithaberg where it can be made as a varietal or blended with Pinot blanc, Chardonnay and Neuburger; Traisental, Kremstal and Kamptal where it is planted with Riesling. The grape is also found in the Donauland (now known as the Wagram region) and in the Wachau region of Lower Austria. Along the Danube river warm air currents come in from the Pannonian Basin to the east and blow westward, warming the vines. This area tends to produce more full bodied wines with peach flavor notes.
The Weinviertel region in the northeast, along the border with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, is home to more than half of all Austrian Grüner Veltliner with reported in 2012. Here the grape can achieve very high yields (up to 100 hectoliters/hectare or 5.7 tonnes/acre) and can produce simple, quaffing wines with fresh acidity and crisp fruit as well as base wine for sparkling &quot;sekt&quot;. But in vineyards on favorable locations where the yields are restricted, wine producers can make examples of full-bodied, dry Grüner Veltliner that has pepper, mineral and citrus notes that can develop Burgundian wine traits as they age.

In the vineyard area around Lake Neusiedl along the border with Hungary there is 1,272 hectares (3,143 acres) of Grüner Veltliner planted along the east side of the lake and 882 hectares (2,179 acres) planted in the Neusiedlersee-Hügelland &quot;hill country&quot; on the west side. Here some sweet &quot;Auslese&quot; and botryized &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; styles of Grüner Veltliner can be produced.

In Krems-Hollenburg, located just east of Krems an der Donau, one of the oldest vineyards in Austria still being used for commercial wine production is home to old vines of Grüner Veltliner that are more than 150 years old.

===Other European wine regions===
Grüner Veltliner is known as &quot;Veltlinske Zelené&quot; in Slovakia where it is the most widely planted white grape variety in the country. The grape&#x27;s 3,805 hectares (9,402 acres) represent almost one-fifth of all grape plantings in the country. Across the border in the Czech Republic, the local synonym for Grüner Veltliner is similar, &quot;Veltlinské zelené&quot;, with 1,713 hectares (4,233 acres) in production as of 2011.

In Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol wine region of north east Italy, along the border with Austria, virtually any grapevine with &quot;Veltliner&quot; in its name (particularly &quot;Veltliner bianco&quot;) is likely to be Grüner Veltliner. At one point Frühroter Veltliner was planted in old vineyards of the Alto-Adige but most of those vines have been uprooted and replaced with other varieties. Grüner Veltliner is a permitted variety in the &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) wines of Valdadige DOC and Valle Isarco DOC.
In Germany, Grüner Veltliner is the grape behind the historic Hansenwein produced in the village of Plochingen located outside Stuttgart in the Württemberg wine region. In France, the grape is not permitted in any &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) wine however there are a few hectares of Grüner Veltliner being cultivated on an experimental basis in the country.

There is of Grüner Veltliner planted in Hungary where the grape is known as &quot;Zöld Veltlini&quot;. The majority of these plantings are found in the western wine regions around Lake Balaton, the northern vineyards in the foothills of the Mátra mountains and the southern wine regions of Tolna County and Kunság. Some plantings of Grüner Veltliner can also be found in Bulgaria.

===In the New World===
In recent years, plantings of Grüner Veltliner have been expanding in the New World wine regions of Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. In New Zealand, the grape was first planted in the Gisborne region on the North Island where the first commercial bottle of the wine was released by Coopers Creek Vineyard in 2008. From here plantings of Grüner Veltliner spread to the South Island wine regions of Marlborough and Central Otago. It is grown in Central by Ata Mara vineyards one of the southernmost vineyards in the world. The first bottle of Gruner Veltliner was produced by Ata Mara in 2013. Central Otago has a climate similar to the region of Wachau in Austria with hot day time temperatures and cool nights.

In Canada, Grüner Veltliner is found in British Columbia. Across the border in the United States, the grape is planted on a small scale in California, Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, and New York. In Oregon, the grape is found in the American Viticultural Areas of the Chehalem Mountains, Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley and Umpqua Valley. In the Umpqua Valley, Reustle Prayer Rock Vineyards is believed to be the first winery in the United States to produce a commercial Grüner Veltliner with their 2005 release. Other notable Oregon Growers include Chehalem Winery, Raptor Ridge Winery, and Illahe Vineyards. New York State&#x27;s Finger Lakes AVA is home to some small plantings of Grüner Veltliner due to the cool climate and proximity to the glacially formed Finger Lakes which help mitigate excessive cold in the early spring and the winter. Lamoreaux Landing is one of a few notable Finger Lakes wineries that produces Grüner Veltliner.

Additional American plantings of Grüner Veltliner are found in Maryland, Virginia, in the Outer Coastal Plain AVA of New Jersey and in the Lehigh Valley AVA of Pennsylvania. American Grüner Veltliners tend to be medium bodied, lightly fruity with high acidity and spice notes.

In California, one of the early plantings of Grüner Veltliner was in the Diamond Mountain District AVA of Napa Valley. In 2006, the 1/3 acre planting of the grape at Von Strasser Winery in Diamond Mountain was the only recorded planting of Grüner Veltliner in the state of California.
In Australia, Grüner Veltliner has seen an increase of interest and plantings which has led wine expert James Halliday to speculate that the grape may be &quot;the next big thing&quot; in Australian wine. One of the earliest Grüner Veltliner plantings in the country was in the Adelaide Hills wine region in the state of South Australia in 2008 by Hahndorf Hill Winery. The grape planting is part of an extensive effort of Adelaide Hills grower, chaired by Henschke&#x27;s viticulturist, Prue Henschke, to make Grüner Veltliner a signature variety for the region. Here the region&#x27;s large diurnal temperature variation allow the grape to build sugar levels during the warm days but maintain a balance of acidity during the cool nights.

The first varietal bottling of Grüner Veltliner in Australia was released in 2009 by the Canberra winery Lark Hill followed by Hahndorf Hill in 2010.

==Styles==
Grüner Veltliner can be produced in a variety of styles from simple jug wine meant to be consumed soon after the vintage to ageworthy wine that can continue to develop in the bottle. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Grüner Veltliner is usually not very aromatic in its youth, developing more tertiary aromas with age. Instead the grape often shows white pepper, lentil and celery note with some examples showing citrus notes and more full bodied examples having what Clarke describes as a &quot;honeyed weight&quot; to them.

Despite many believing that white pepper aromatics (Rotundone) is a signature feature of Gruner Veltliner, it has been regularly noted in articles by wine expert Jancis Robinson and other writers on Ms. Robinson&#x27;s web pages, that this is not the case. In recent decades, Ms Robinson has observed that this white pepper characteristic has become less noticeable and nowadays, more often than not, is absent in many classic examples of this variety.

According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, Grüner Veltliner is often lightly fruity with noticeable spice and characteristic white pepper note. Well-made examples from favorable vintages can have a similarity to Chardonnay produced in Burgundy. And, like Chardonnay, the variety can be made in an overly oaky and &quot;fat&quot; style. Unoaked examples can exhibit a minerality similar to Riesling.

Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that Grüner Veltliner is usually produced dry with spicy, peppery notes. It is often full-bodied and with age can take on aromas and flavors similar to white Burgundies.

In 1924, he and his brothers, Joseph and Archie, took over their father&#x27;s leather business; he helped run the tanneries until 1962 when he retired to devote his time to philanthropic work. In 1925, Kivie Kaplan married Emily Rogers, whom he was married to until his death. They had three children, Sylvia, Jean, and Edward.

==NAACP==

Kaplan joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1932 and was elected to the National Board in 1954. In 1966, he was elected its President and held that post until his death. As president, Kaplan spoke throughout the United States on the organization&#x27;s behalf and sought financial contributions. Kaplan was a trustee of two black colleges, Lincoln University and Tougaloo College, and treasurer of &quot;The Crisis&quot; magazine.

==Philanthropic activities==
Kaplan was also involved in Jewish affairs and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. He contributed substantial sums of money to the Jewish Memorial Hospital in Boston and Brandeis University. He received numerous awards and honorary degrees, including the Amistad Award of the American Missionary Association and honorary degrees from Wilberforce University, Hebrew Union College, and Lincoln University.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Emily, fought for civil rights for all. He was one in a long line of American Jews who held a leadership role in African American civil rights groups.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a POSIX-compliant Unix system call that maps files or devices into memory. It is a method of memory-mapped file I/O. It implements demand paging because file contents are not immediately read from disk and initially use no physical RAM at all. The actual reads from disk are performed after a specific location is accessed, in a lazy manner. After the mapping is no longer needed, the pointers must be unmapped with codice_2. Protection information—for example, marking mapped regions as executable—can be managed using codice_3, and special treatment can be enforced using codice_4.

In Linux, macOS and the BSDs, codice_5 can create several types of mappings. Other operating systems may only support a subset of these; for example, shared mappings may not be practical in an operating system without a global VFS or I/O cache.

==History==
The original design of memory-mapped files came from the TOPS-20 operating system. codice_5 and associated systems calls were designed as part of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of Unix. Their API was already described in the 4.2BSD System Manual, even though it was neither implemented in that release, nor in 4.3BSD. Sun Microsystems had implemented this very API, though, in their SunOS operating system. The BSD developers at University of California, Berkeley unsuccessfully requested Sun to donate its implementation; 4.3BSD-Reno was instead shipped with an implementation based on the virtual memory system of Mach.

== File-backed and anonymous ==
&quot;File-backed mapping&quot; maps an area of the process&#x27;s virtual memory to files; that is, reading those areas of memory causes the file to be read. It is the default mapping type.

&quot;Anonymous mapping&quot; maps an area of the process&#x27;s virtual memory not backed by any file, made available via the codice_7/codice_8 flags. The contents are initialized to zero. In this respect an anonymous mapping is similar to malloc, and is used in some malloc implementations for certain allocations, particularly large ones.

== Memory visibility ==
If the mapping is &quot;shared&quot; (the codice_9 flag is set), then it is preserved when a process is forked (using a codice_10 system call). Therefore, writes to a mapped area in one process are immediately visible in all related (parent, child or sibling) processes. If the mapping is &quot;shared&quot; and backed by a file (not codice_7) the underlying file medium is only guaranteed to be written after it is passed to the codice_12 system call. In contrast, if the mapping is &quot;private&quot; (the codice_13 flag is set), the changes will neither be seen by other processes nor written to the file.

A process reading from, or writing to, the underlying file will not always see the same data as a different process that has mapped the file, since segments of the file are copied into RAM and only periodically flushed to disk. Synchronization can be forced with a call to codice_12.

Using mmap on files can significantly reduce memory overhead for applications accessing the same file; they can share the memory area the file encompasses, instead of loading the file for each application that wants access to it. This means that mmap(2) is sometimes used for Interprocess Communication (IPC). On modern operating systems, mmap(2) is typically preferred to the System V IPC Shared Memory facility.

The main difference between System V shared memory (shmem) and memory mapped I/O (mmap) is that System V shared memory is persistent: unless explicitly removed by a process, it is kept in memory and remains available until the system is shut down. mmap&#x27;d memory is not persistent between application executions (unless it is backed by a file).

== Example of usage under the C programming language ==

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;err.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

/* This example shows how an mmap of /dev/zero is equivalent to
 using anonymous memory (MAP_ANON) not connected to any file.
 N.B. MAP_ANONYMOUS or MAP_ANON are supported by most UNIX
 versions, removing the original purpose of /dev/zero.
/* Does not work on OS X or macOS, where you can&#x27;t mmap over /dev/zero */
int main(void)
 const char str1[] = &quot;string 1&quot;;
 const char str2[] = &quot;string 2&quot;;
 pid_t parpid = getpid(), childpid;
 int fd = -1;
 char *anon, *zero;

 if ((fd = open(&quot;/dev/zero&quot;, O_RDWR, 0)) == -1)
 err(1, &quot;open&quot;);

 anon = (char*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED, -1, 0);
 zero = (char*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

 if (anon == MAP_FAILED || zero == MAP_FAILED)
 errx(1, &quot;either mmap&quot;);

 strcpy(anon, str1);
 strcpy(zero, str1);

 printf(&quot;PID %d:\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s\n&quot;, parpid, anon, zero);
 switch ((childpid = fork())) {
 case -1:
 err(1, &quot;fork&quot;);
 /* NOTREACHED */
 case 0:
 childpid = getpid();
 printf(&quot;PID %d:\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s\n&quot;, childpid, anon, zero);
 sleep(3);

 printf(&quot;PID %d:\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s\n&quot;, childpid, anon, zero);
 munmap(anon, 4096);
 munmap(zero, 4096);
 close(fd);
 return EXIT_SUCCESS;

 sleep(2);
 strcpy(anon, str2);
 strcpy(zero, str2);

== Usage in database implementations ==
The mmap system call has been used in various database implementations as an alternative for implementing a buffer pool, although this created a different set of problems that could realistically only be fixed using a buffer pool.

<text>The Newport Tower (also known as Newport Office Center II and 525 Washington Boulevard) in Newport, Jersey City, New Jersey is the seventh tallest building in Jersey City, and eighth tallest in New Jersey. It has 37 floors, is 531 ft (162 m) tall, and is connected to a mall (called the Newport Centre Mall) within the complex. The mall is one of the few enclosed, regional shopping facilities in Hudson County. The building was developed by Melvin Simon &amp; Associates in 1990. The Newport Tower is next to the Hudson River and is almost exactly across the river from the World Financial Center in Manhattan. The Newport Tower is a modern-style building. It is similar in appearance to the Willis Tower, (formerly known as &quot;Sears Tower&quot;) in Chicago, Illinois.

The tower received a facelift in the summer of 2005; wooden panels have been installed on the lobby walls, and LCD advertisement screens added to the elevators. The colonnade in front of the building has been removed in July 2008. A new elevator management system, Schindler ID, was installed in the building in September 2009.

On October 19, 2011, Multi-Employer Property Trust purchased the Newport Tower from Brookfield Properties for $377.5 million. Brookfield Properties took ownership of the Newport Tower in June 2006 after the $4.8 billion acquisition of Trizec Properties.

<doc id="608718" wikidata="Q629515" url="?curid=608718" title="Stimulant psychosis">
<text>Stimulant psychosis is a mental disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, paranoid ideation, delusions, disorganized thinking, and grossly disorganized behaviour. It typically occurs following an overdose or several day binge on psychostimulants, although it can occur in the course of stimulant therapy, particularly at higher doses. One study reported occurrences at regularly prescribed doses in approximately 0.1% of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine or methylphenidate therapy. Methamphetamine psychosis, or long-term effects of stimulant use in the brain (at the molecular level), depend upon genetics and may persist for months or years. Psychosis may also result from withdrawal from stimulants, particularly when psychotic symptoms were present during use.

The most common causative agents are substituted amphetamines, including substituted cathinones, as well as certain dopamine reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine and phenidates.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of stimulant psychosis vary depending on the drug ingested, but generally involve the symptoms of organic psychosis such as hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. Other symptoms may include mania, erratic behavior, agitation and/or aggression.

==Cause==
===Substituted amphetamines===

Drugs in the class of amphetamines, or substituted amphetamines, are known to induce &quot;amphetamine psychosis&quot; typically when chronically abused or used in high doses. In an Australian study of 309 active methamphetamine users, 18% had experienced a clinical level psychosis in the past year. Commonly abused amphetamines include methamphetamine, MDMA, 4-FA, as well as substituted cathinones like α-PVP, MDPV, and mephedrone, though a large number of other closely related compounds have been recently synthesized. Methylphenidate is sometimes incorrectly included in this class, although it is nonetheless still capable of producing stimulant psychosis.

The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis include auditory and visual hallucinations, grandiosity, delusions of persecution, and delusions of reference concurrent with both clear consciousness and prominent extreme agitation. A Japanese study of recovery from methamphetamine psychosis reported a 64% recovery rate within 10 days rising to an 82% recovery rate at 30 days after methamphetamine cessation. However it has been suggested that around 5–15% of users fail to make a complete recovery in the long term. Furthermore, even at a small dose, the psychosis can be quickly reestablished. Psychosocial stress has been found to be an independent risk factor for psychosis relapse even without further substituted amphetamine use in certain cases.

The symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis are very similar to those of the acute phase of schizophrenia although in amphetamine psychosis visual hallucinations are more common and thought disorder is rare. Amphetamine psychosis may be purely related to high drug usage, or high drug usage may trigger an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia. There is some evidence that vulnerability to amphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia may be genetically related. Relatives of methamphetamine users with a history of amphetamine psychosis are five times more likely to have been diagnosed with schizophrenia than relatives of methamphetamine users without a history of amphetamine psychosis. The disorders are often distinguished by a rapid resolution of symptoms in amphetamine psychosis, while schizophrenia is more likely to follow a chronic course.

Although rare and not formally recognized, a condition known as Amphetamine Withdrawal Psychosis (AWP) may occur upon cessation of substituted amphetamine use and, as the name implies, involves psychosis that appears on withdrawal from substituted amphetamines. However, unlike similar disorders, in AWP, substituted amphetamines reduce rather than increase symptoms, and the psychosis or mania resolves with resumption of the previous dosing schedule.

===Cocaine===
Cocaine has a similar potential to induce temporary psychosis with more than half of cocaine abusers reporting at least some psychotic symptoms at some point. Typical symptoms include paranoid delusions that they are being followed and that their drug use is being watched, accompanied by hallucinations that support the delusional beliefs. Delusional parasitosis with formication (&quot;cocaine bugs&quot;) is also a fairly common symptom.

Cocaine-induced psychosis shows sensitization toward the psychotic effects of the drug. This means that psychosis becomes more severe with repeated intermittent use.

===Phenidates===

Methylphenidate and its analogues (such as ethylphenidate, 4F-MPH, and isopropylphenidate) share similar pharmacological profiles as other norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Chronic abuse of methylphenidate has the potential to lead to psychosis. Similar psychiatric side effects have been reported in a study of ethylphenidate. No studies regarding psychosis and 4F-MPH or isopropylphenidate have been conducted, but given their high DAT binding and cellular uptake activity, the possibility of stimulant psychosis remains.

===Caffeine===

There is limited evidence that caffeine, in high doses or when chronically abused, may induce psychosis in normal individuals and worsen pre-existing psychosis in those diagnosed with schizophrenia.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Though less common than stimulant psychosis, stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines as well as the dissociative drug phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust) may also cause a theorized severe and life-threatening condition known as excited delirium. This condition manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and hysterical strength. Despite some superficial similarities in presentation excited delirium is a distinct (and more serious) condition than stimulant psychosis. The existence of excited delirium is currently debated.

==Transition to schizophrenia==
A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Murrie et al. found that the pooled proportion of transition from amphetamine-induced psychosis to schizophrenia was 22% (5 studies, CI 14%–34%). This was lower than cannabis (34%) and hallucinogens (26%), but higher than opioid (12%), alcohol (10%) and sedative (9%) induced psychoses. Transition rates were slightly lower in older cohorts but were not affected by sex, country of the study, hospital or community location, urban or rural setting, diagnostic methods, or duration of follow-up.

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of supportive care during the acute intoxication phase: maintaining hydration, body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate at acceptable levels until the drug is sufficiently metabolized to allow vital signs to return to baseline. Atypical and typical antipsychotics have been shown to be helpful in the early stages of treatment, especially olanzapine over haloperidol. The benzodiazepines temazepam and triazolam at 30 mg and 0.5 mg (prescribed independently from olanzapine and haloperidol), are highly effective if aggression, agitation, or violent behaviour is apparent. In the instance of persistent psychosis after repeated stimulant use, electroconvulsive therapy has been beneficial in some cases. This is followed by abstinence from psychostimulants supported with counselling or medication designed to assist with preventing a relapse and the resumption of a psychotic state.

<text>Mauzac or Mauzac blanc is a white variety of grape used for wine, of the species &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. It is mainly grown in the Gaillac and Limoux regions in southwest France. Total French plantations of Mauzac stood at in the year 2000.

Gaillac&#x27;s aromatic wines are blended with Len de l&#x27;El to create mildly sweet and sparkling white blended wines. Since the late 1980s, some Gaillac producers have created an interest in Mauzac by producing better wines. In Limoux, Mauzac is a compulsory part of the Blanquette de Limoux, where it may be blended with Chenin blanc and Chardonnay. However, in Limoux, plantations of Mauzac are decreasing as it is losing ground to Chardonnay. The grape is also one of the seven permitted white varieties in Bordeaux wine.

Mauzac buds and ripens late, and was traditionally picked quite late, when temperatures had dropped in Limoux. This allowed for slow fermentation preserving residual sugar for a &quot;natural&quot; second fermentation in the spring, creating a sparkling wine. Today, it is more common to pick Mauzac earlier, giving a more crisp wine with higher acidity, but also without much of its particular aromas.

==Other colors==

While Mauzac almost always refers to Mauzac blanc there are also Mauzac varieties with other skin colors; Mauzac rose and &quot;Mauzac noir&quot;. Both of these are very rare in cultivation. While Mauzac rose is a color mutation of Mauzac blanc, Mauzac noir is a distinct variety whose relationship to Mauzac is unclear. Some further distinguish other variants of Mauzac blanc, including Mauzac vert (green Mauzac), Mauzac roux (russet Mauzac), and Mauzac jaune (yellow Mauzac).

==Synonyms==
Mauzac blanc, or wine made with substantial proportions of it, is known under the following synonyms: Aiguillon, Becquin, Bekin, Bequin, Blanc Lafitte, Blanquette, Blanquette Aventice, Blanquette de Limoux, Blanquette Sucrée, Caspre, Clairac, Feuille Ronde, Gaillac, Gaillade, Gamet blanc, Manzac, Maousac, Mausac, Maussac, Mauza, Mauza blanca, Meauzac, Moisac, Moissac, Moysac, Mozac, Mozak Belyi, Peron, Perrond, Pied Rond, Plant de Gaillac, Primard, Queue Fort, Queue Roide, and Sudunais.

<doc id="608721" wikidata="Q4561075" url="?curid=608721" title="1921 in Greece">
<text>At the end of 1920, the death of King Alexander, the fall of Eleftherios Venizelos, and the return of King Constantine I to the throne brought Greece once more to the fore in international politics. Although &quot;unrecognized&quot; by the great Allied Powers, King Constantine I resumed his interrupted reign amidst frantic acclamations of the population, a wave of anti-Venizelist reprisals, and dark war clouds in Anatolia where the Turkish Nationalist leader, Mustafa Kemal Pasha, was daily increasing his following.

==Incumbents==
*Monarch: Constantine I
*Prime Minister: 
** until 6 February: Dimitrios Rallis 
** 6 February–8 April: Nikolaos Kalogeropoulos 
** starting 8 April: Dimitrios Gounaris

==Opening of the Chamber of Deputies==
On January 4, 1921, King Constantine inaugurated his reinstatement in his constitutional rights and duties by opening the newly elected Chamber of Deputies. In his speech from the throne the king expressed his intention of continuing the campaign in Asia Minor, and declared the Chamber to be a National Assembly. One of the features of the opening ceremony was the absence of all Liberal or Venizelist members. The anti-Venizelist campaign, in spite of all statements to the contrary, did not appear to have died down. On January 5, Athens was the scene of another wanton act of political vendetta - the murder of Colonel Fatseas, a prominent Venizelist officer.

==Resumption of war==
The intention declared in the royal speech at the opening of the Chamber of resuming the war against Kemal was supported by an official report issued on January 10 of a renewal of the Greek offensive to the northeast of Smyrna and in the Brussa area, and the same day the Greeks occupied Belejik. On the following day the Greek Liberal organ &quot;Patris&quot; published a letter from Nice, where Venizelos was residing at the time, confirming the Greek statesman&#x27;s final decision to retire from politics. This decision was naturally not displeasing to the supporters of King Constantine, who a little later found another cause for jubilation when the king of Italy received the newly appointed Greek minister to Rome (January 13). Thus Italy was the first among foreign Allied and neutral powers to recognize King Constantine. But the enthusiasm was soon damped by the joint representations made on the 20th to the Greek government by the British and French ministers in Athens on the transformation of the Chamber into a National Assembly. This action by the two Allied governments was declared to be based on the rights of the powers in question as guarantors of the constitution of Greece, rights which they considered as still existent, since the Treaty of Sèvres, in which they were surrendered, had not yet been ratified by all the signatories. Early in February the Allied Supreme Council invited the Greek and Turkish governments to attend a conference to be held in the latter part of the month in London with the object of bringing about peace between the two countries. The invitation was coldly received in Athens, and was the cause of a split in the Dimitrios Rallis cabinet on the score of wounded personal vanities. Dimitrios Gounaris, minister of war, the real leader of the Constantino faction, who, in deference to Allied public opinion, which had stigmatized him as a pro-German, had after the defeat of the Venizelists been compelled to renounce his claims to the premiership in favor of the less compromised Rallis, after being also refused the presidency of the Greek delegation to the London conference, resigned, bringing about a ministerial crisis.

==New government==
The Rallis cabinet was succeeded by a new government with Nikolaos Kalogeropoulos, of no outstanding political ability, but having the reputation of an Entente-phile, as premier and minister of foreign affairs, Gounaris resuming his post as minister of war, Petros Protopapadakis - finance and supplies, Th. Zaimis - education, Petros Mavromichalis - agriculture and national economy, Tsaldaris - interior and communications, Theotokis - justice, Rallis Jr. - marine. Apparently Gounaris continued to press his claims to be chief Greek delegate at the London conference, but according to the Greek press, &quot;on learning the unfavorable impression created in London by the reports of his intention to represent Greece&quot;, he agreed to the nomination of Kalogeropoulos. Meanwhile, the promises held out to the Greek masses by the Constantinists in the course of their electoral campaign, for the early cessation of hostilities and of mobilizations, the reduction of taxation, and the regulation of the labor question on lines proposed by the Socialist Party, which supported the anti-Venizelist campaign, not having been redeemed, internal unrest among the urban proletariat began to manifest itself in a series of industrial strikes (gas, electric light, tramway and electric railway workers) in Athens, and threatened to develop into a general stoppage of work all over the country (February 12). The Liberal Party which had up until then held itself aloof from politics decided, as the fate of Greece and of her new territorial acquisitions were in the balance in London, to renounce its attitude of passive opposition, and in all matters of national importance which possessed an international aspect, to join the &quot;united national front&quot;. This, together with certain declarations made by Venizelos to the foreign press in which he declared his wholehearted support of the national aspirations, gave birth to rumors regarding a rapprochement between the ex-premier and King Constantine. But the rumors were short-lived, for Venizelos, on February 16, denied their truth.

==London conference==
On February 18 the Greek delegation, headed by the premier Kalogeropoulos, and including a number of economic and military experts, arrived in London. The conference opened on the 21st, and the Supreme Council heard the Greek delegation. The Greek premier declared that Greece was prepared and willing to clear Anatolia of the Turkish Nationalists.

After also hearing Turkish delegations both from Constantinople and Angora, the Supreme Council proposed the dispatch of an international commission of inquiry to study on the spot the general situation in Smyrna and Thrace. Kalogeropoulos referred this proposal to Athens, where it was rejected by the National Assembly. As Kalogeropoulos appeared not to be invested with full powers to bind his self on behalf of the Greek government, the Supreme Council demanded the dispatch to London of a new Greek plenipotentiary. After protracted negotiations as to his being accepted as &quot;persona grata&quot; by the Allies, Gounaris arrived in London on March 9. Three days later the Supreme Council formulated proposals for the solution of the Greco-Turkish difficulty and for a modification of the Sèvres Treaty. It was proposed that the demilitarized zone of the Straits should be reduced to the following lines: on the European side - Gallipoli peninsula and the coast along the Sea of Marmora as far as Rodosto; on the Asiatic side - from a point opposite the isle of Tenedos to Kara-Bigha (west of Panderma), including the islands in the Sea of Marmora and the European and Asiatic shores of the Bosporus; the expression &quot;demilitarized&quot; zone was to mean that whereas the Allies might send troops to this zone, both Greece and Turkey should be deprived of this right; the east coast of the Sea of Marmora was excluded from the demilitarized zone; the Allied troops occupying Constantinople were to be withdrawn, after the Allies had satisfied themselves of the &quot;bona-fide&quot; peaceful intentions of the Turks; Turkey was to have an equal voice on the international committee established to control the Straits, receiving two votes instead of one; and if Turkey&#x27;s attitude on the whole proved satisfactory, she would, in all probability, be offered the honorary presidency of the commission. Turkey was also to receive a place on a voting basis instead of in an advisory capacity on the financial commission; Thrace was not to be internationalized, and as for the Smyrna area it was considered desirable to leave the Greek and Turkish inhabitants in their own districts; the sovereignty of the sultan over the vilayet of Smyrna was to be restored, the city of Smyrna to be occupied by Greek troops, but elsewhere in the vilayet order should be maintained by local gendarmes under Allied officers; a Christian governor should be appointed, chosen by the League of Nations; a revision of this status to be granted after five years if applied for to the League of Nations; Turkey should be included in the League of Nations if she consents to ratify a modification of the Sèvres Treaty on the above lines.

==After London==
The Greek and Turkish delegations on receiving these proposals from the Supreme Council left London to submit them to their respective governments. Simultaneously with the departure of the Greek delegation from London a royal decree called up the 1913, 1914, and 1915 classes of Greek reservists, and King Constantine issued a proclamation declaring Greece&#x27;s intention to continue the war against the Kemalists in order to ensure the pacification of the Orient. On March 23 a New Greek offensive was launched in Asia Minor. The Hellenic troops advancing in two separate lines in the neighborhood of Ushak and Brussa, compelled the Turkish forces to retreat. The Greek offensive continued successfully, and on March 27 and 28 the Greeks occupied two important strategical points, Afium-Karahissar and Eskişehir.

On April 1 Gounaris, emboldened by the fact of his being &quot;officially&quot; recognized by the Allies in London, at last assumed the premiership on the resignation of Kalogeropoulos, who received the portfolio of finance. Some time previously Kalogeropoulos had ceded the portfolio of foreign affairs to Georgios Valtatzis, who remained foreign minister under Gounaris. Immediately upon the reconstruction of the cabinet King Constantine left for the front accompanied by the prince Andrew and prince Nicholas. A further mobilization of officers of the 1910-13 classes was ordered. The Turks showed stubborn resistance to the east of Eskishehr, and on April 4 it was reported that the Greeks had suffered a severe check. By this time the renewed outbreak of hostilities on a large scale in Anatolia convinced the Allies that no replies to the proposals of the Supreme Council were to be expected from the Greek and Turkish governments.

==Internal situation==
The internal situation in Greece, notwithstanding all official assurances to the contrary, continued to be serious, particularly in Macedonia, Salonica, and Crete, and consequently on April 12 martial law was proclaimed and a censorship of the press reintroduced. During the month of May the military situation in Anatolia remained indefinite, the Greeks suspending their offensive in order to prepare for a renewal of operations on a larger scale. On May 18 the Allied high commissioners issued a proclamation regarding the neutrality of Constantinople and the Straits. By the beginning of June the preparations for the new Greek offensive were near completion, and on the 11th King Constantine once more left for Smyrna accompanied by the Diadoch, Prince Nicholas and Prince Andrew, the premier, Gounaris, the minister of war, Theotokis, and General Dousmanis, chief of the general staff. On June 20 the Allies despatched a note to Greece renewing their offer of intervention between the two warring parties. The Greek government, after having submitted its decision to King Constantine in Smyrna for approval, replied by a note dated June 25 in which it in effect refused the proffered negotiations. Preparations for the new offensive were continued. The Greeks in the meantime evacuated Ismidt, thus considerably weakening the defensive of the Kemalists. In the early part of July the Greeks made some progress in their offensive, occupying Nicaea and advancing from Brussa to Yenisher, reoccupying by July 15 Afium Karahissar, evacuated in the spring retreat, and three days later Kutahia, an important key position. The battle of Kutahia ended in a rout of the Kemalist forces with a great haul of booty and prisoners for the Greeks, the fall of Eskishehr, and the general retreat of the Turks.

==Renewal of offensive==
About the middle of August the Greeks renewed the offensive in the direction of Angora and Koniah. The Greek troops crossed the river Sakaria where they met with strong resistance from the Turks, and by the middle of September the Turks were able to check the Greek onslaught. On September 4 it was officially announced that owing to ill-health King Constantine was obliged to move from Eskishehr to Brussa. This was the first veiled intimation of a reverse suffered by the Greek forces, and it was followed, five days later, by the further announcement that the general staff had decided for the time being &quot;to suspend the efforts of the Greek armies&quot;, a decision which was followed by the complete withdrawal of Greek troops to the west of the Sakaria river. A statement to the effect that the Greek government had requested Lord Robert Cecil to invite the mediation of the League of Nations between Greece and Turkey was officially repudiated, but at the same time Greek government circles did not deny that Greece had informed Britain of the conditions on which she was prepared to make peace with Angora (September 20). Gounaris actually contemplated visiting London in connection with the possibility of Britain consenting to act as mediator.

==The National Assembly==
On October 3 Nikolaos Stratos, one of the chiefs of the opposition and leader of the National Reformist Party, had an audience of the king, and demanded the convocation of the National Assembly so that the latter should take a responsible decision regarding the general political situation and the desirability of requesting foreign mediation in the Turkish-Greek conflict. The National Assembly was hurriedly convened on October 16, and after hearing a statement by the premier, granted Gounaris a vote of confidence and endorsed his decision to visit London and Paris. After meeting with a cold reception in Paris, Gounaris and Valtatzis (the foreign minister) arrived in London on October 27 and saw the Marquess Curzon at the British Foreign Office. At the suggestion of the British foreign secretary a meeting of the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy to be held at a future date was proposed to discuss the Near Eastern questions. As Gounaris&#x27; mission to London had failed to bring about any definite results the Greek premier and foreign minister left London for Rome, where lately a less hostile attitude to Greece had been noticeable.

In the meantime internal party strife continued in Greece, and great excitement was caused in Athens by the election in Constantinople in December as Ecumenical Patriarch of Mgr. Meletios Metaxakis, the ex-archbishop of Athens, deposed in 1920 in consequence of his Venizelist sympathies. On December 21 an attempt was made in Athens to assassinate Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, the ex-regent and prominent Venizelist.

==End of the year==
The year 1921 closed for Greece with the same indefinite conditions as at its opening. The war waged for over two years in Asia Minor was as far from a conclusion as ever; and the internal political and economic situation was once more critical. It is intelligible, therefore, that rumors of King Constantine&#x27;s second (this time voluntary) abdication should have found currency in Greece.

<text>The Swedish Space Corporation, SSC, also registered as Svenska rymdaktiebolaget, is a Swedish space services company. SSC operations consist of launches of sounding rockets and stratospheric balloons, tests of future generation rocket engines and new rocket fuels, operation and maintenance of space and aviation systems, as well as satellite communications through the use of SSC ground stations deployed around the world. SSC is also working on developing its Space Surveillance Tracking (SST) and Space Traffic Management (STM) programs with the aim to identify, assess and minimize risks of collisions and disruptions associated with space debris.

In January 2023, Spaceport Esrange, a new establishment of Esrange Space Center was inaugurated – the first facility on EU mainland  with the capability of launching satellites. The first satellite launch is expected to take place in 2024.

SSC operations in Sweden are located in Solna, Kiruna and Ågesta. The company also has operations in Australia, Chile, the Netherlands, Thailand, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. SSC has roughly 630 employees and an MSEK 1,263 turnover in 2022.

== Business areas ==

=== Development of space systems ===
SSC has more than fifty years of experience in helping space agencies, companies, commercial actors and research institutes gain access to space. The company designs, develops and tests various types of space systems, rocket systems, subsystems and experimental equipment for research, in space or near-space environments. Common areas of application are microgravity experiments, atmospheric research and testing and validation of space-related systems.

SSC has specialist competence in satellite communications, rocket and balloon systems, launching of rockets and balloons, and provides consulting services for satellite operators.

=== Satellite communications ===
SSC has one of the world&#x27;s largest and most active civilian networks of ground stations that communicate with various types of satellites. SSC&#x27;s worldwide network of ground stations uses the group&#x27;s own as well as contracted satellite stations around the world. SSC has its own ground stations in Sweden, US, Canada, Chile, Thailand and Australia. The company also has partnering ground stations in Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Antarctica, India and Japan.

Most scientific satellites, as well as many Earth observation satellites, orbit the Earth&#x27;s poles. The strategic location of Esrange Space Center, above the Arctic Circle, allows for regular contact with satellites as they pass within range several times a day. Esrange is today one of the world&#x27;s most used satellite stations.

Through the company&#x27;s subsidiaries LSE in Germany and Aurora Technology in the Netherlands, SSC offers consulting services in satellite control. A third subsidiary, GlobalTrust in Great Britain, offers analysis of satellite data.

=== Esrange ===
Esrange Space Center, the world&#x27;s most versatile space center and a hub for SSC operations, is located outside Kiruna in northern Sweden, above the Arctic Circle (68°N, 21°E). In addition to the infrastructure that forms the base site, there is also access to a large, unpopulated impact and recovery area covering an area twice the size of Luxembourg (about 5,200 km2). The facility has been in operation since 1966 and was initially part of the European Space Agency (ESA) before becoming a part of SSC as the company was founded in 1972.

From Esrange, SSC launches sounding rockets and stratospheric balloons for research in various research disciplines. The base also houses a satellite communications station which forms the hub of SSC&#x27;s global network of ground stations, with around 30 antennas on site.

The newest facility within the base, Spaceport Esrange, was inaugurated on 13 January 2023 by H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Spaceport Esrange is the first facility on EU mainland with the ability to launch satellites into orbit. The facility will also be used for Europe’s program for the development of reusable rockets, Themis, which is run by Ariane Group on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA). The facility will also be used for test launches of the next generation of sounding rockets.

Future European rocket technology is also tested at the base&#x27;s test beds. There, various space actors develop reusable, more sustainable and cost-effective rocket technology.

=== Space Situational Awareness ===
The number of satellites in near-Earth space is expected to reach nearly 10,000 within the next few years. In that same area of space, large amounts of space debris are also in orbit. It is estimated to be more than 130 million objects, some as small as a millimeter, traveling at high speed around the Earth.

The increasing number of objects in orbit around the Earth increases the risk of collisions. SSC&#x27;s is therefore expanding its initiative in the area of Space Situational Awareness (SSA), which aims to detect, predict and assess the risks of spacecraft launches and re-entry.

The SSC has started a program whose task is to track and catalog the objects in orbit around the Earth – so-called Space Traffic Management (STM) – a communication system to avoid potential collisions during launch and for satellites in orbit in the future.

== Customers ==
SSC&#x27;s largest customers in space systems development and launch services are the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Satellite operation services and satellite consulting services are performed on behalf of satellite owners, satellite operators and space agencies worldwide. Tests of space and flight systems are conducted for both Swedish and foreign companies as well as the armed forces.

== History ==
Rymdbolaget was established by the Swedish government in 1972 to be the executive body for the State Delegation for Space operations, now under the name of Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA). The company was formed in 1972 by Esrange Space Center and Rymdtekniska Gruppen in Solna, Stockholm. During the period 1966–1972, Esrange was an ESA owned facility but in 1972 the ownership passed into Swedish ownership in connection with the formation of Rymdbolaget. Today, SSC has no official duties, and the company is 100 percent owned by the Swedish state.

Since the turn of the millennium, the company has expanded and now has operations in Australia, Chile, the Netherlands, Thailand, Germany, the US and the UK. For instance, in 2000, SSC acquired Universal Space Network, USN, a company founded by space pioneer and astronaut Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad, Jr. He was the third human to walk the Moon. The acquirement of USN, nowadays known as SSC Space US, marks the starting point in which SSC began establishing a global ground station network which today is one of the biggest civilian networks in the world. The acquisition is also reflected in today&#x27;s growth into the lunar market.

Over the years, SSC has also designed and built satellites, developed airborne ocean surveillance systems used by coastguard organizations worldwide, as well as assisted the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, FMV, with the operation, maintenance, and development of test systems at the Vidsel test site. All of these businesses have today been divested.

<text>Worship and Tribute is the second studio album by American post-hardcore band Glassjaw, released on July 9, 2002, through I Am and Warner Bros. Records. As with their first full-length album, &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; was produced by Ross Robinson and mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser.

&quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; debuted at number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained on the chart for three weeks. It is their only entry on the chart to date. It has since been recognized as one of the greatest post-hardcore albums and one of the greatest albums of the 2000s.

==Production and style==
Vocalist Daryl Palumbo has stated that while Glassjaw&#x27;s debut album was filled with negativity, &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; is much more optimistic in tone. Regarding the album title, Palumbo expressed how the bands that influenced Glassjaw have shaped their musical identity and are therefore being honored through Glassjaw&#x27;s music:
:&quot;You are only a sum of all of your influences and that&#x27;s what we are. . . I think that we&#x27;re original and I think that what we&#x27;re doing is different and that&#x27;s something I always knew we had on our side, but no matter how original you are you&#x27;re still just a sum of your influences.&quot;

Guitarist Todd Weinstock has regarded continuity as the biggest difference between Glassjaw&#x27;s debut album and &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;, noting &quot;&quot;EYEWTKAS&quot; was just kind a bunch of songs written over years and when we got signed we were like &#x27;okay we got some songs we can throw together.&#x27; With &quot;Worship&quot; we went into it with the intentions of writing an album that made sense as a unit as opposed to a bunch of songs, some of which may have even been written four years earlier!&quot; He also noted that, due to the fact that the album was written around the time of the September 11 attacks, its tone was affected by the tragedy.

Originally, &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; was to have twelve songs with the last song entitled &quot;Convectuoso.&quot; The band, however, had recorded the song with their previous label, Roadrunner Records, for the &quot;Ry Ry&#x27;s Song&quot; single. Since Glassjaw abruptly ended their contract to sign with Warner Bros., Roadrunner retained the rights to that song and refused to let the newly rerecorded &quot;Convectuoso&quot; be released on the final album despite being on promotional copies. In 2022, after Roadrunner was absorbed into Warner Music Group, Glassjaw reached out to Warner Bros. to put &quot;Convectuoso&quot; as the final track on the vinyl release of &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; featured in the band&#x27;s &quot;20+ Year Anniversary Collection&quot;, as was initially intended.

==Promotion and touring==
Dave Allen joined Glassjaw as bassist following the recording of &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;. The band then toured extensively, including festival tours such as Warped Tour, Ozzfest and SnoCore, and an appearance at Skate and Surf Fest. In April and May 2002, the band toured with Converge, Reach the Sky, and Stalemate. They embarked on a co-headlining US tour with Poison the Well in May 2002; both acts were supported by Vex Red and Recover. In June, the band went on a brief tour of the east coast with the Juliana Theory and Piebald. Following this, Glassjaw toured as part of Warped Tour and Ozzfest between July and September 2002. &quot;Cosmopolitan Bloodloss&quot; was released to Active rock radio on September 27, 2002.

Daryl Palumbo&#x27;s Crohn&#x27;s disease brought heavy burden onto Glassjaw&#x27;s touring schedule in promotion of &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;. On October 1, 2002, he was rushed to a Paris hospital and Glassjaw&#x27;s European tour schedule was postponed for December. In October and November, the band went on a headlining US tour with American Nightmare, the Blood Brothers, and Open Hand. On December 5, as Glassjaw returned from a US flight, Palumbo relapsed and was again rushed to a London hospital and forced the cancellation of the rescheduled dates. Later in December, the band appeared at Gainesvillefest. In February and March, the band toured across the US with Hot Water Music and Sparta as part of the 2003 Sno-Core Tour. &quot;Ape Dos Mil&quot; was released to Modern rock radio on February 11, 2003; the song&#x27;s music video was posted online five days later. The European dates were rescheduled for a second time in April 2003. From June to August, the group went on the 2003 edition of Warped Tour.

The band were due to perform the album in full at the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth on the 10th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, but the event was cancelled.

==Packaging==
The original 2002 CD release of the album did not include a front insert, but rather a clear film sheet that had a picture of a record player arm. The disc itself was designed to look like a vinyl record, and the inside tray included a picture of a record player. The overall product is supposed to look like a vinyl record being played on a record player. The album was reissued for the first time on vinyl format in 2011 for Record Store Day. The record was packaged in a clear plastic sleeve with a picture of a record player arm printed on the front of the sleeve. It also included a sheet with the picture of the record player printed on it. This first pressing is known for its PVC sleeve which caused a chemical reaction and damaged the record within it. The vinyl version was reissued again in 2014, with 1,000 copies pressed on clear vinyl.

==Critical reception==

Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann gave &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; a positive review, noting &quot;Cosmopolitan Bloodloss&quot; an AMG Track Pick. He described Glassjaw as &quot;more interesting than their metal peers&quot; and reflected &quot;Glassjaw can pound it out like the best of them, but the fun comes in never knowing what variation the band will throw in next.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called the album &quot;innovative.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; referred to &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; as a &quot;genre-defining work.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; declared &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; to be &quot;the greatest ‘underground breakthrough’ album since Deftones.&quot; The Long Island Press called it &quot;the album that helped rethink, reshape, and expand the boundaries of the genre&quot;. Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters noted &quot;&quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; addressed many of these lyrical flaws [of Glassjaw&#x27;s debut album] and introduced a wider palette of sounds to the band’s arsenal; in so doing, however, it lost sight of much of the momentum and focus that made the band notable in the first place.&quot; Adrien Begrand, also of PopMatters, gave an in-depth review where he acknowledged the band&#x27;s talent in select songs but also stressed the poor quality of &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; as a whole: &quot;They&#x27;ve shown they&#x27;re a smart band, both musically and lyrically, but on &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;, listeners are stuck with 40 percent inspiration, 60 percent filler.&quot;

The January 2008 issue of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; (AP #234) included &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; on its &quot;10 Essential Albums We’re Waiting For Follow Ups to.&quot; The issue also hyped the oncoming Head Automatica album. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Ape Dos Mil&quot; at number 60 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

===Awards===
*Nominated for a Best Recording Package Grammy in 2003.
*In 2007, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; an &quot;album you must own.&quot;

==Track listing==
All music written by Glassjaw; all lyrics written by Daryl Palumbo.
* &quot;Two Tabs of Mescaline&quot; ends at 6:12. After 1 minute and 30 seconds of silence, at 7:42, an untitled hidden track begins. The hidden track is kept on track 11, even on the Japanese version where the bonus track, &quot;El Mark&quot;, follows. However, on the advance CD, &quot;Two Tabs of Mescaline&quot; is only 6:12, while the hidden track is placed at the end of &quot;Convectuoso&quot; (5:45).

==B-Sides==
There are 7 B-sides from &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;:
* &quot;Convectuoso&quot; ends at 5:45. The hidden track follows it, beginning at 7:15.
* The song &quot;Neo Tokyon&quot; was recorded for the album. The band played it live before the album came out and it hadn&#x27;t been heard since. While the band did some 2016 touring, it made its way back into their setlist as &quot;Neo&quot; before finally being released under the name &quot;Citizen&quot; on their 2017 album Material Control.

<text>Tromsø Midnight Sun Marathon is the northernmost Association of International Marathons and Distance Races certified marathon in the world. The Midnight Sun Marathon is hosted annually by the Norwegian city of Tromsø in June each year.

==History==
The Midnight Sun Marathon first started in 1990 and has runners from most of the world, attracted by its special feature of running in the midnight sun. The race starts and finishes at the city centre. The runners are facing the Tromsø Bridge after 2 km; an uphill from 6 to 43 meters over sea level. After running about 20 km the runners recross the bridge, and return through the city centre. The field record of the marathon is 2:38:22 for women and 2:20:56 for men.

The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

==Course records==
*Male: 2:20:03 - Ebrahim Abdulaziz (Norway) 2022
*Female: 2:38:08 - Yngvild Kaspersen (Norway) 2023

<doc id="608737" wikidata="Q4356777" url="?curid=608737" title="Swedish Institute of Space Physics">
<text>The Swedish Institute of Space Physics (, IRF) is a Swedish government agency. The institute&#x27;s primary task is to carry out basic research, education and associated observatory activities in space physics, space technology and atmospheric physics.

==Foundation==
The IRF was founded in 1957 and the first Kiruna-designed satellite experiment was launched in 1968. The institute has about one hundred employees and has its head office in Kiruna. Other offices are situated in Umeå, Uppsala and Lund.

IRF, originally the Kiruna Geophysical Observatory, began as a department within the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It has been a public research institute since 1973, under the auspices of the Swedish Ministry of Education and Culture.

==Satellite experiments==

IRF participates in several international satellite projects. At present, data from satellite instruments are being analysed to help us better comprehend the plasma-physical processes in the solar wind and around comets and planets. For example, the Swedish Viking and Freja satellites, with equipment from IRF on board, have greatly increased our knowledge of the auroral processes in the Earth’s magnetosphere, as have the microsatellites Astrid 1 and 2, launched in 1995 and 1998. IRF&#x27;s own nano-satellite Munin (at 6 kg (13 lb) the smallest-ever research satellite) was launched in 2000. An IRF-built instrument on board the Indian satellite Chandrayaan-1 (launched 2008) collected data from the Moon and new techniques for making particle measurements in space were tested on the Swedish satellite mission Prisma (launched 2010). 

IRF has instruments on board for example the following on-going satellite projects:

*Cluster (2000) is an ESA project with 4 satellites in formation to study the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere.
*Mars Express (2003) is an ESA mission to study Mars.
*Swarm (2013) is an ESA project with 3 satellites to study the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.
*BepiColombo (2018), a combined JAXA/European Space Agency mission to Mercury.
*Solar Orbiter (2020) is an ESA mission to study the solar wind and the Sun.
*JUICE (launched 2023), a European Space Agency mission to Jupiter and its icy moons.
Completed missions: 
*Cassini (launched 1997), a combined NASA/ESA (European Space Agency) mission to Saturn and its moon Titan.
*Rosetta (2004) is one of ESA&#x27;s cornerstone projects and has been studying comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since 2014. The mission ended in late September 2016.
*Venus Express (2005) is an ESA satellite to study Venus and completed its mission in December 2014.
IRF in space 1968 -&gt;

==Continuous measurements ==
Continuous measurements of the following are made at IRF
*the magnetic field of the Earth
*aurora
*cosmic radio noise
*ionospheric parameters

==Ground-based auroral research==

Experiments are conducted with research radars, such as those of the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) with transmitters in Tromsø and on Svalbard. These are used for example to study the processes which cause the aurora. The three-dimensional structure of the aurora is studied with ALIS (Auroral Large Imaging System), a multi-station imaging system which uses tomographic reconstruction techniques, artificial intelligence and advanced IT.

==Atmospheric research==
Atmospheric research at IRF focuses on studies of
*ozone in the stratosphere
*strato- and mesospheric clouds
*strato- and mesospheric winds
*coupling between different atmospheric layers (e.g. transport between troposphere and stratosphere) - propagation of mechanical waves

Radar, optical methods, sounding rockets and balloons are used for atmospheric studies. Continuous measurements are made of:
*atmospheric trace gases (including ozone) 
*atmospheric winds
*infrasonic waves.

== IRF SpaceLab ==
The IRF SpaceLab test facility at IRF in Kiruna, Sweden, offers industry and research groups an extensive opportunity to test and qualify space-related hardware for satellites, rockets, balloons and ground-based technology. IRF has been developing instruments for satellites, rockets and balloons since the 1960s and has all the necessary equipment to simulate the harsh environment these instruments face.

<doc id="608740" wikidata="Q25720" url="?curid=608740" title="Johnny Damon">
<text>Johnny David Damon (born November 5, 1973) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1995 to 2012. During his MLB career, Damon played for the Kansas City Royals (1995–2000), Oakland Athletics (2001), Boston Red Sox (2002–2005), New York Yankees (2006–2009), Detroit Tigers (2010), Tampa Bay Rays (2011) and Cleveland Indians (2012). He also played for the Thailand national baseball team and was a member of the squad for the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifiers.

==Early years==
Damon was born in Fort Riley, a U.S. Army post in Kansas. His mother, Yome, is a Thai immigrant to the United States and his father, Jimmy, is an American of Croatian and Irish descent. They met while his father, a staff sergeant in the United States Army, was stationed in Thailand. Damon spent much of his infancy as an &quot;Army brat,&quot; moving to several posts including Okinawa, Japan and West Germany before his father was discharged from the Army. The Damon family settled in the Orlando, Florida, area while Johnny was a pre-schooler.

Damon was a quiet child, largely on account of a stutter. &quot;My thoughts just raced ahead of my tongue,&quot; Damon said of his problem. &quot;I&#x27;d sing songs as therapy, and I got better, but I still just kept quiet most of the time.&quot; He played in South Orange Little League as a child. He played for the Walker Jr. High baseball team before attending Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando where, during his senior year in 1992, he was rated the top high school prospect in the country by &quot;Baseball America&quot;, was named to &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; High School All-America team and was the Florida Gatorade Player of the Year. Damon also ran track at Dr. Phillips where his senior year he was runner up in the 200m dash. Damon also played football in high school, once getting hit by Warren Sapp and sustaining the first concussion in his life.

==Playing career==

===Kansas City Royals (1995–2000)===
Damon was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the first round (35th overall) of the 1992 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on August 12, 1995, after playing the previous season with the minor league Wichita Wranglers. He played for the Royals from 1995 to 2000. He scored 104 runs in 1998 and 101 runs in 1999. One of his best seasons came in 2000 when he led the American League in runs with 136 and stolen bases with 46, and he was second in hits (214), at bats (655), and plate appearances (741).

===Oakland Athletics (2001)===
Damon spent 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. In a three-way trade involving the A&#x27;s, Royals, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the A&#x27;s received Damon along with pitcher Cory Lidle from the Devil Rays and second baseman Mark Ellis from the Royals. He was third in the league in at bats (644) and seventh in runs (108).

===Boston Red Sox (2002–2005)===
On December 21, 2001, Damon signed a four-year, $31 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.

In 2002, he led the league in triples (11) and was third in infield hits (25), becoming the first player selected by the fans in the inaugural American League All-Star Final Vote.

On June 27, 2003, Damon became only the second player in MLB history since 1900 to record three base hits in an inning, when he did so against the Florida Marlins. During Game 5 of the 2003 American League Division Series, Damon collided head-on with teammate Damian Jackson while both players were attempting to chase down a pop fly. Damon suffered a severe concussion and had to be removed from the field on a stretcher. Jackson was also concussed, but was able to walk off the field with assistance.

In 2004, Damon was second in the league in runs (123) and began to re-establish himself among the premier lead-off hitters and center fielders in the game. In arguably his best season in the Major Leagues, Damon batted .304 with 20 home runs and 94 RBIs and showed improved patience at the plate. According to his autobiography, he was only the fourth leadoff batter in the history of Major League Baseball to drive in more than 90 runs in a season. Damon batted a torrid 7-for-15 during that year&#x27;s Division Series against the Angels but struggled in the ALCS against the Yankees, going only 3-for-29 from the plate through the first six games. In Game 7, Damon hit two home runs, one of which was a grand slam, to lead the Red Sox to the pennant. In the World Series, he also hit a home run as the Red Sox won the series against the St. Louis Cardinals in a four-game sweep. This was the first Red Sox World Series championship since 1918, effectively terminating the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s 86-year &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; World Series drought.

Through his four-year career with the Red Sox (2002–2005), Damon appeared in 597 games (590 in center field and seven as a designated hitter) and hit 56 home runs. Of his 2,476 at bats, 2,259 were as leadoff hitter. Damon batted second in the lineup for 156 at-bats in 2002, accounting for nearly all of the rest except for occasional pinch hit. He started two games as the third hitter in 2004, and in 2005, he had 624 at-bats, and all but three as the lead-off hitter. He also earned his second All-Star selection, starting as the American League&#x27;s center fielder. He led the AL with 35 infield hits, and matched the 35 doubles he had hit in 2004.

===New York Yankees (2006–2009)===
On December 20, 2005, Damon signed a four-year, $52 million contract with the New York Yankees. The Red Sox stood firm on a three-year contract and chose not to negotiate against a five-year deal proposed by agent Scott Boras.

Damon&#x27;s signing with the Yankees led to his being subsequently vilified by many Red Sox fans because of his previously professed loyalty to the city and Red Sox organization, including his now infamous statement in May 2005, where he claimed, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I can go play for the Yankees, but I know they&#x27;re going to come after me hard. It&#x27;s definitely not the most important thing to go out there for the top dollar, which the Yankees are going to offer me. It&#x27;s not what I need.&quot;

As the Yankees have a strict dress code for players forbidding both long hair and facial hair beyond neat mustaches (the latter requirement being relaxed in 2025), Damon had his shoulder-length &quot;cave man&quot; hair cut and beard shaved on December 22. Damon, who had a clean-cut appearance until his third season with the Red Sox, had been planning on cutting his hair and shaving his beard off even if he didn&#x27;t sign with the Yankees, but waited until after he signed with them in order to prevent speculation.

The following season, in a pivotal five game series in August between the Yankees and Red Sox at Fenway Park, Damon went 3-for-6 in each of the first three games, including a doubleheader on August 18, and a game on August 19. Damon hit two home runs, drove in eight runs, and scored eight runs in the first three games as the Yankees won by a combined score of 39–20 and dealt a severe blow to the Red Sox 2006 playoff aspirations.

In 2006, Damon finished third in runs (115) and ninth in stolen bases (25) in the AL, while hitting 24 home runs, his career high. He also tied his mark of 35 doubles from the previous two seasons. He was only one of 4 players in the major leagues to hit at least 24 home runs and steal at least 24 bases.

On June 7, 2008, Damon went 6-for-6 in the Yankees 12–11 win over the Kansas City Royals, including a walk-off ground-rule double, which had bounced over the wall. He is the first Yankee to have six hits in a 9 inning game since Myril Hoag accomplished the feat in 1934. Damon said in a post-game on-field interview that this was his first walk-off as a Yankee.

The Yankees placed Damon on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his MLB career on July 6, 2008, with a bruised AC joint in his left shoulder. The injury occurred a day earlier when Damon collided with the outfield wall in an attempt to catch a triple. At that time, Damon was one of only three active major league ballplayers who had played at least 10 years in the majors without going on the disabled list. He returned to active duty, and hit 27 doubles for the season. Damon hit 53 home runs in his three complete seasons with the Yankees.

On July 27, 2009, Damon hit his 200th career home run against the Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; Brian Shouse. For the 2009 season, he batted .282 and tied for the lead among AL left fielders in errors (with 5), while he was fourth in the league in runs scored (107).

Damon hit a home run in Games 3 and 4 of the 2009 ALCS, defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in six games. When the Yankees went on to play the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series, Damon got credit for stealing two bases in one play when the Phillies defense was shifted against batter Mark Teixeira. Damon got his second championship ring as the Yankees would eventually defeat the Phillies in six games.

Damon, after winning his second World Series, entered free agency after the 2009 season despite expressing his desire to return to the Yankees. He insisted that the Yankees not even make him an offer, however, unless they pay him at least the $13 million he earned for the past four years. As a result of his contract demands, the Yankees signed 1B/DH Nick Johnson to a one-year/5.5MM deal, despite Damon lowering his salary demands at the last minute. The Yankees then signed outfielder Randy Winn to a one-year $2 million deal which essentially closed the door on Damon&#x27;s return to the Bronx.

===Detroit Tigers (2010)===

On February 20, 2010, Damon agreed to a one-year, $8 million deal with the Detroit Tigers. On April 14, 2010, he recorded his 1,000th career RBI against the Kansas City Royals. On May 1, he hit a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher Scot Shields at Comerica Park to win the game 3–2. On July 6, Damon recorded his 2,500th career hit off Jake Arrieta of the Baltimore Orioles, and hit a walk-off home run off David Hernandez, giving the Tigers a 7–5 win. For the season, he batted .271 with eight home runs and 51 RBI. He became a free agent at the end of the season.

===Tampa Bay Rays (2011)===

On January 21, 2011, Damon agreed to a one-year, $5.25 million deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. The Rays also signed his former Boston Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez in a package deal suggested by agent Scott Boras. Also reunited with Damon was former Red Sox player Kelly Shoppach.

Manager Joe Maddon said he expected the 37-year-old Damon to often be replaced by Sam Fuld during the season late in games that the Rays are leading. After Ramirez&#x27;s abrupt retirement, this would be moot as Damon primarily would play as the designated hitter.

On April 16, 2011, Damon had the game-winning hit for the fifth consecutive game for the Rays, two of which were walk-off hits. On June 29, 2011, Damon tied Ted Williams for 71st on the all-time hit list with 2,654 hits. The hit came at Tropicana Field in the bottom of the sixth inning. On July 2, 2011, Damon went 4-for-4 and his first-inning single moved him past Ted Williams on the all-time hit list. He would finish the season 57th all-time with 2,723 career hits.

In Game 1 of the ALDS, Damon hit a two-run home run in the second inning off Texas Rangers starting pitcher C. J. Wilson to give his team an early 2–0 lead. The Rays won the game 9–0, however they eventually lost the best-of-five divisional series 3–1.

===Cleveland Indians (2012)===
On April 12, 2012, Damon signed a one-year minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians for $1.25 million (and an additional $1.4 million in incentives). On May 1, Damon was called up to Cleveland. He made his debut on May 2, batting leadoff against the Chicago White Sox. He finished the game 0–3 with a walk. Indians manager Manny Acta dropped Damon to seventh in the batting lineup after going 4–29 in the leadoff position, including 2 hits in his last 18 at-bats. On June 26, in a game against the Yankees, Damon became the 52nd player in MLB history to amass 2,750 career hits. Heading into the All-Star break, Damon had 35 hits in 163 official at-bats and was hitting .215 in 50 games. On July 20, Damon tied a season-high with three hits versus the Baltimore Orioles.

Damon was designated for assignment on August 3, 2012. He was released by the Indians, along with pitchers Derek Lowe and Jeremy Accardo, on August 9.

Damon finished his career with 2,769 hits, placing him 54th on the MLB all-time career hits leaders.

His first year of eligibility for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum came in 2018 where he joined a notable group of first-time candidates, including Chipper Jones, Jim Thome and Omar Vizquel. Damon only received eight votes (1.9% of the voting ballot) and was thus dropped from future consideration.

===Free agency (2013–2015)===
Damon hoped to be signed for 2013, and offered the Yankees the opportunity to sign him to a contract for the league&#x27;s minimum salary as a replacement for the injured Curtis Granderson, also expressing a willingness to be released once Granderson returned. The Yankees indicated that they were not interested in signing Damon. Damon remained unsigned for all of 2013, and did not play.

In late 2013 and early 2014, Damon indicated a desire to keep playing, in part to have the opportunity to attain 3,000 hits (he needed 231 to reach that goal). He told members of the media that he has stayed in good physical condition and hoped to receive invitations to spring training.

Damon did not receive any offers prior to the start of the 2014 season. In a May 2014 interview while in Boston to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Red Sox 2004 World Series championship, Damon indicated that he has no plans to officially announce his retirement, even though he acknowledged that he will likely not play in the major leagues again. He also stated that he still wants to play, has continued to stay in good physical condition, and could play if given the opportunity, saying &quot;I feel like if a team calls me, I can be ready. If I play tonight, I&#x27;ll hit a homer.&quot; On June 22, 2014, he played in his first New York Yankees Old-Timers&#x27; Day.

A July 2014 press report indicated that Damon still hoped to play again in the major leagues. According to the story, in June Damon completed an impromptu session with a batting practice pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, who was impressed enough to suggest that the Phillies should consider signing him.

On August 4, 2014, Damon gave an interview with the WEEI-FM radio show &quot;Middays with MFB&quot; and indicated that while he wants to still play, no teams have expressed an interest, and &quot;those days are over&quot;.

According to press accounts in December 2014, Damon hoped to play in 2015, and his agent told a reporter &quot;If you ask Johnny, he&#x27;d love to come back.&quot;

Armstrong is a bass-baritone singer and has released three studio albums.

==Ancestry and early life==
===Ancestry===
Descended from a North East landowning family, a distant ancestral relation William Armstrong was created Baron Armstrong in 1887, and his maternal grandparents were economist Lucius Thompson-McCausland, High Sheriff of Hertfordshire, and Helen Laura McCausland (6 April 1903 – February 2000), granddaughter of Captain Conolly Thomas McCausland (13 May 1828 – 25 June 1902), High Sheriff of County Londonderry, by his wife the Hon. Laura St John (12 June 1842 – 21 October 1919), daughter of the 15th Baron St John of Bletso. His McCausland ancestors held land at Drenagh in Limavady, County Londonderry from the 18c.

===Early life===
Alexander Henry Fenwick Armstrong was born at Rothbury Community Hospital in Rothbury, Northumberland, on 2 March 1970, and grew up in Longframlington, the youngest of three children, to physician Henry Angus Armstrong and Emma Virginia Peronnet (née Thompson-McCausland). He was educated at Mowden Hall School in Stocksfield, and St Mary&#x27;s Music School in Edinburgh, where he was a chorister at St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral from the age of 11 to 13. He attended Durham School and Trinity College, Cambridge, on music scholarships. He played the piano – which has been seen in several &quot;The Armstrong &amp; Miller Show&quot; sketches – and the cello, the latter which he dropped in favour of the &quot;much more masculine&quot; oboe.

At Cambridge, Armstrong read English, graduating with a third-class degree (BA), and sang bass baritone as a choral scholar with the college choir. Armstrong joined the Footlights in his final year as part of the writing team for the 1992 revue and was &quot;Spooks&quot; creator David Wolstencroft&#x27;s comedy partner.

==Career==
After graduating in 1992, Armstrong moved to London with friends to pursue a career in acting and comedy. While waiting for acting roles, he worked in several north London bars and restaurants. He was eventually introduced to Ben Miller, who had also moved to London, through Jez Butterworth. In 1996, Armstrong and Miller performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and were nominated for the Perrier Award.

===Comedy===
Armstrong and Miller co-starred in four series of &quot;Armstrong and Miller&quot; from 1997 to 2001, while also performing sketches in &quot;The Sunday Format&quot;. The duo decided to take a break and split for several years to forge their own solo careers. Armstrong renewed his partnership with Miller for the award-winning &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot; in 2007. &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Book&quot; was released in October 2010.

Armstrong appeared in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Very World of Milton Jones&quot;, broadcast between 1998 and 2001. He narrated the animated cartoon series &quot;The Big Knights&quot; in 1999; it first appeared on BBC1 that Christmas. That same year he also starred as Prince Charming in ITV&#x27;s Christmas pantomime, alongside Ben Miller, Samantha Janus, Paul Merton, Harry Hill, Frank Skinner and Ronnie Corbett. Between early 2000 and early 2001, Armstrong starred as a misanthropic, animal-hating vet in the BBC One sitcom &quot;Beast&quot;, and he has also been the star of a series of TV commercials for Pimm&#x27;s.

On BBC Radio 4, Armstrong played John Weak in the office sitcom &quot;Weak at the Top&quot;. He also played Martin Baine-Jones for the Times Online&#x27;s &quot;Timeghost&quot; podcast. Between September and November 2010, Armstrong took &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot; on tour in the UK, completing 62 dates. This was the second time &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot; had toured, the first tour being in autumn 2001.

===Television presenting===
On 1 September 2006, Armstrong was chairman of the short-lived Channel 4 panel show &quot;Best of the Worst&quot; which featured team captains David Mitchell and Johnny Vaughan. Armstrong presented the short-lived ITV1 quiz series &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Stupid&quot;, in which mismatched celebrities taught each other a subject they are passionate about before facing a studio quiz on their new topic. He has been a frequent guest host on the BBC&#x27;s satirical &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, having appeared 32 times; he has, to date, made the most appearances of any guest, whether as host or panellist. In 2008, he was the presenter and narrator for &quot;When Were We Funniest?&quot; and was the only person to feature in all 12 episodes. Armstrong in &quot;The Independent&quot; was reported to not want to be &quot;d&quot; as a presenter, preferring to focus on acting and comedy.

Armstrong has been the presenter of the BBC One game show &quot;Pointless&quot;, initially with former Cambridge University friend Richard Osman, since it began in 2009. He also presented a documentary, &quot;Alexander Armstrong&#x27;s Very British Holiday&quot;, for the BBC on 8 November 2009 about the history of the &quot;great British summer holiday&quot; and his attempts to explore its modern version. On 30 May 2011, Armstrong hosted the pilot for a new panel show, &quot;Alexander Armstrong&#x27;s Big Ask&quot; for Dave with Dave Lamb, Katy Brand, Griff Rhys Jones and Robert Webb. After a positive response to the pilot, Dave commissioned the first series, which first aired on 6 February 2012. In July 2011, Armstrong became a co-presenter on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Great British Weather&quot;. In August 2011, he began presenting &quot;Epic Win&quot; on BBC One.

In 2012–2013, Armstrong co-hosted ITV series &quot;Prize Island&quot; with Emma Willis. On 3 January 2015, Armstrong and Rochelle Humes co-hosted entertainment special &quot;Frank Sinatra: Our Way&quot; on BBC One.

On 1 June 2015, Armstrong presented a documentary, &quot;Rome&#x27;s Invisible City&quot;, which used 3D scanning technology to discover the underground spaces below the city. Subsequently, it was announced he would be making a three-part series exploring the lost and hidden sites of Florence, Naples, and Venice.

In 2015, Armstrong presented a three-part factual series for ITV, called &quot;Alexander Armstrong in the Land of the Midnight Sun&quot;, in which he travelled half-way round the Arctic Circle meeting its inhabitants and exploring their ways of life. In January 2016, he guest-presented &quot;Bruce&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot; on BBC One.

In 2017, he presented &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Ask Britain&quot; and &quot;Teach My Pet to Do That&quot;, both on ITV.

===Singing and music===
After over a decade in television and comedy, Armstrong returned to his musical roots and put together his own cover band, which plays a wide range of music from jazz to rock to pop classics. A classically trained bass baritone, he is the vocalist and is backed up by Harry the Piano on keyboards, Simon Bates on woodwind, Jeff Lardner on drums and Dave Swift on bass. The band&#x27;s first tour ran from 19 September to 6 November 2013.

Armstrong mainly sang at his local parish church services or at weddings, away from the public eye. Armstrong impersonated Susan Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; rendition of &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; in the show &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot; and surprised the judges by singing in falsetto. He sang &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; during the celebrities Christmas special of &quot;Pointless&quot; and &quot;No Rhyme for Richard&quot; from &quot;Blondel&quot; in BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Tim Rice: A Life in Song&quot; and collaborated with the Sixteen to record the single &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; to raise funds for the charity Crisis.

Since September 2014, Armstrong has presented the Saturday afternoon programme on the classical radio station Classic FM. He now also presents the mid-morning show on weekdays between 10 am and 1 pm.

Armstrong participated in &quot;VE Day 70: A Party to Remember&quot; on 9 May 2015, a televised commemorative concert from Horse Guards Parade in London, where he sang &quot;We Must All Stick Together&quot; by Ralph Butler and Raymond Wallace, and &quot;London Pride&quot;, a patriotic song by Noël Coward.

On 6 November 2015, Armstrong released his debut solo vocal album, &quot;A Year of Songs&quot;, on Warner Music Group&#x27;s East West Records label. It reached number six on the UK Albums Chart in its first week and topped the UK Classical Chart, the first time a comedian/actor has reached number 1 in that chart. In January and February 2016 he carried out a 9-date UK tour with his band.

In June 2016 he began recording his second album, &quot;Upon a Different Shore&quot;, which was released on 28 October. It reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart.

In 2002, Armstrong provided the voice for the character Horse in the English dub of the series &quot;A Town Called Panic&quot;.

In 2009, Armstrong portrayed the British microcomputer innovator Clive Sinclair in the BBC docu-drama &quot;Micro Men&quot;. Set in the early 1980s, the film focused on the semi-broken friendship and rivalry between Clive Sinclair and Acorn Computers head Chris Curry when both companies were angling for the lucrative BBC computer literacy deal. &quot;Micro Men&quot; was directed by Saul Metzstein, and starred Armstrong opposite Martin Freeman as Chris Curry.

A book based on Armstrong&#x27;s show &quot;Pointless&quot;, titled &quot;The 100 Most Pointless Things in the World&quot; was published in the UK by Coronet, an imprint of Hodder &amp; Stoughton, in October 2012. It was written by Armstrong and his &quot;Pointless&quot; co-host, Richard Osman.

In February 2011, Armstrong became President of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, launching a million-pound appeal at a special gala event. He is a patron of several charities, including Family Links, the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust and Just A Drop.

==Politics==
In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; in March 2012, Armstrong spoke of his support for the rural campaigning organisation the Countryside Alliance, saying: &quot;I&#x27;d like people to be honest about what they don&#x27;t like about country sports because if it&#x27;s actually the people you don&#x27;t like, then I&#x27;d much rather they would actually just say that.&quot; He has appeared in their advertisements and magazine to promote countryside shooting. He said that his family had traditionally voted for the Liberal Democrats. Armstrong described himself as a &quot;floating voter&quot;, stating &quot;I&#x27;m not greatly impressed by party politics, but I am by individual people. I&#x27;m a centrist, and very suspicious of any tribalism.&quot;

In August 2014, Armstrong was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In 2017, Armstrong urged the UK Government to do more to support music education and therapy, saying &quot;in the weft and weave of politics I think these sorts of human stories get shoved to one side, but we have to make sure they are right up front and centre. It&#x27;s not all about Brexit.&quot;

In 2020, Armstrong signed a letter in support of the LGB Alliance, to &quot;stand in solidarity&quot; with JK Rowling.

<doc id="608748" wikidata="Q1125771" url="?curid=608748" title="Congo (novel)">
<text>Congo is a 1980 science fiction novel by Michael Crichton, the fifth under his own name and the fifteenth overall. The novel centers on an expedition searching for diamonds and investigating the mysterious deaths of a previous expedition in the dense tropical rainforest of the Congo. Crichton calls &quot;Congo&quot; a lost world novel in the tradition founded by Henry Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, featuring the mines of that work&#x27;s title.

==Plot summary==
The novel starts in 1979, with an abrupt end to an expedition sent by Earth Resource Technology Services Inc (ERTS). In the dense rainforests of the Virunga region, the heart of the Congo, the team is suddenly attacked and killed by unknown creatures – all contact with them is immediately lost. The expedition, which was searching for deposits of diamonds, discovered the fictional lost city of Zinj. A video image taken by a camera there, and transmitted by satellite to the base station in Houston, shows a peculiar race of grey-haired gorillas to be responsible for the murders.

Another expedition, led by Karen Ross, is launched to find out the truth and to find the Lost City of Zinj, where there are believed to be deposits of a certain diamond, the type IIb, which are naturally boron-doped and thus useful as semiconductors, though worthless as gemstones. This time, the searchers bring along the famous half-White and half-Indian African mercenary Charles Munro, as well as a female mountain gorilla named Amy, who has been trained to communicate with humans using sign language, and her trainer Peter Elliot.

Time is of the greatest essence, as a rival consortium from corporations in Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands are also searching for the diamonds, turning the entire expedition into a race to the city of Zinj. Unfortunately for Ross and her team, the American expedition encounters many delays along the way, including plane crashes, native civil wars, and jungle predators.

Eventually, Ross and her expedition reach the Lost City of Zinj and discover the consortium&#x27;s camp, like the original expedition&#x27;s camp, in ruins and devoid of life. Ross and her team then encounter killer gorillas and are attacked. A brief battle ensues and several gorillas are killed.

After studying the corpses and performing a rudimentary field autopsy, Elliot comes to the conclusion that these animals are not &quot;true&quot; gorillas by modern biological standards, nor kakundakari (an African primate cryptid), but gorilla/chimpanzee/human hybrids: their mass and height is closer to humans than gorillas, their skull is greatly malformed (the &quot;ridge&quot; that makes gorilla heads look &quot;pointy&quot; is nearly nonexistent) and their pigmentation is on the border of albinism: light gray fur and yellow eyes. They also exhibit behavior unlike normal gorillas: they are highly aggressive, ruthless and partially nocturnal, as well as extremely social, forming troops of over a hundred, compared to a mere dozen formed by silverbacks. Elliot intends to name them &quot;Gorilla elliotensis&quot; after himself.

Afterwards, Ross, Elliot, Munro, and their team explore the ruins and discover mysterious bas reliefs. With help from Elliot’s computer technician Richard Seaman from California. The relief’s paintings are revealed through digital reconstruction, and show that the killer gorillas were bred by the ancient inhabitants of Zinj to serve as guards to protect the diamond mines from intruders, and were taught a form of sign language to communicate with one another. As well as given unique, stone paddles to use as weapons (one was left by the gorillas when one of munro’s men was taken from the camp &amp; killed) After several more attacks and the loss of contact with the ERTS HQ due to a massive solar flare, Elliot, with the help of Amy, finds a way to translate the language of the mysterious gorillas (she refers to them as &quot;bad gorillas&quot;) and piece together three messages (&quot;go away&quot;, &quot;no come&quot;, &quot;bad here&quot;); Which are used by Amy, who’d comes to Peter’s rescue when he stumbles down into the gorilla’s valley. The apes stop fighting the humans and become confused, leaving the camp alone.

Their victory is cut short by the eruption of the nearby volcano (accelerated by explosives placed by Ross for her geological surveys to uncover more diamonds) which buries the city, the diamond fields and all proof of the &quot;new&quot; species under 800 meters of lava. Ross, Elliot, Munro, and the rest of the team&#x27;s survivors are forced to run for their lives. The team manages to find a hot air balloon in a crashed consortium cargo aircraft and uses it to escape.

In an epilogue, it is revealed that Munro was able to retrieve 31 carats of the valuable diamonds and sold them to Intel for use in a revolutionary new computer processor, while Amy was reintroduced into the wild and was later observed teaching her offspring sign language.

==Adaptations==
Crichton wanted to produce a modern-day version of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox who bought the film rights before the story had even been written. This rapid development resulted in Crichton suffering writer&#x27;s block, which he treated by spending time in an isolation tank. Crichton received a $1.5 million advance for the novel, screenplay and as a directing fee. He had never worked that way before, usually writing the book then selling it. He eventually managed to finish the book and it became a best seller. Crichton started writing the screenplay in 1981 after completing the film &quot;Looker&quot;. He had enjoyed working with Sean Connery on &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; and wrote &quot;Congo&quot; hoping to make the film version with Connery in the lead and Crichton to direct. In 1987 he was still hoping to make the film with Connery and Crichton himself directing but this did not happen. Connery did go on to play Allan Quatermain - the character who provided the inspiration for Munro - in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;.

In 1995, a film version of &quot;Congo&quot; was released, directed by Frank Marshall and starring Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Tim Curry, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, and Shayna Fox as the voice of Amy. It received negative reviews from critics, and was nominated for several Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture.

In 1984, Telarium released a graphic adventure video game based on &quot;Congo&quot;. Because Crichton had sold all adaptation rights to the novel, he set the game—named &quot;Amazon&quot;—in South America, and Amy the gorilla became Paco the parrot.

==Influences==
The use of language by gorillas was inspired in part by the efforts of Dr. Penny Patterson to teach American Sign Language to Koko.

<doc id="608751" wikidata="Q3241787" url="?curid=608751" title="Pinealocyte">
<text>Pinealocytes are the main cells contained in the pineal gland, located behind the third ventricle and between the two hemispheres of the brain. The primary function of the pinealocytes is the secretion of the hormone melatonin, important in the regulation of circadian rhythms. In humans, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus communicates the message of darkness to the pinealocytes, and as a result, controls the day and night cycle. It has been suggested that pinealocytes are derived from photoreceptor cells. Research has also shown the decline in the number of pinealocytes by way of apoptosis as the age of the organism increases. There are two different types of pinealocytes, type I and type II, which have been classified based on certain properties including shape, presence or absence of infolding of the nuclear envelope, and composition of the cytoplasm.

==Types of pinealocytes==

===Type 1 pinealocytes===
Type 1 pinealocytes are also known as light pinealocytes because they stain at a low density when viewed under a light microscope and appear lighter to the human eye. These Type 1 cells have been identified through research to have a round or oval shape and a diameter ranging from 7–11 micrometers. Type 1 pinealocytes are typically more numerous in both children and adults than Type 2 pinealocytes. They are also considered to be the more active cell because of the presence of certain cellular contents, including a high concentration of mitochondria. Another finding consistent with Type 1 pinealocytes is the increase in the amount of lysosomes and dense granules present in the cells as the age of the organism increases, possibly indicating the importance of autophagocytosis in these cells. Research has also shown that Type 1 pinealocytes contain the neurotransmitter serotonin, which later is converted to melatonin, the main hormone secreted by the pineal gland.

===Type 2 pinealocytes===
Type 2 pinealocytes are also known as dark pinealocytes because they stain at a high density when viewed under a light microscope and appear darker to the human eye. As indicated by research and microscopy, they are round, oval, or elongated cells with a diameter of about 7–11.2 micrometers. The nucleus of a Type 2 pinealocyte contains many infoldings which contain large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. An abundance of cilia and centrioles has also been found in these Type 2 cells of the pineal gland. Unique to the Type 2 is the presence of vacuoles containing 2 layers of membrane. As Type 1 cells contain serotonin, Type 2 cells contain melatonin and are thought to have similar characteristics as endocrine and neuronal cells.

==Synaptic ribbons==

Synaptic ribbons are organelles seen in pinealocytes using electron microscopy. Synaptic ribbons are found in pinealocytes in both children and adults, but are not found in human fetuses. Research on rats has revealed more information about these organelles. The characteristic protein of synaptic ribbons is RIBEYE, as revealed by light and electron microscopy. In lower vertebrates, synaptic ribbons serve as a photoreceptive organ, but in upper vertebrates, they serve secretory functions within the cell. The presence of proteins such as Munc13-1 indicates that they are important in neurotransmitter release. At night, synaptic ribbons of rats appear larger and slightly curved, but during the day, they appear smaller and rod-like.

==Evolution of pinealocytes==
A common theory on the evolution of pinealocytes is that they evolved from photoreceptor cells. It is speculated that in ancestral vertebrates, the pinealocytes served the same function as photoreceptor cells, such as retinal cells; in many non-mammalian vertebrates, pineal cells in the retina are still actively photoreceptive, although these cell do not contribute to a visual image. Structural, functional, and genetic similarities exist between the two cell types. Structurally, both develop from the area of the brain designated the diencephalon, also the area containing the thalamus and hypothalamus, during embryological development. Both types of cells have similar features, including cilia, folded membranes, and polarity. Functional evidence for this theory of evolution can be seen in non-mammalian vertebrates. The retention of photosensitivity of the pinealocytes of lampreys, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds and the secretion of melatonin by some of these lower vertebrates suggests that mammalian pinealocytes may have once served as photoreceptor cells. Researchers have also indicated the presence of several photoreceptor proteins found in the retina in the pinealocytes in chicken and fish. Genetic evidence demonstrates that phototransduction genes expressed in the photoreceptors of the retina are also present in pinealocytes.

More evidence for the evolution of pinealocytes from photoreceptor cells is the similarities between the ribbon complexes in the two types of cells. The presence of the protein RIBEYE and other proteins in both pinealocytes and sensory cells (both photoreceptors and hair cells) suggests that the two cells are related to one another evolutionarily. Differences between the two synaptic ribbons exist in the presence of certain proteins, such as ERC2/CAST1, and the distribution of proteins within the complexes of each cell.

==Melatonin ==

===Regulation===
Regulation of melatonin synthesis is important to melatonin’s main function in circadian rhythms. The main molecular control mechanism that exists for melatonin secretion in vertebrates is the enzyme AANAT (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase). The expression of the AANAT gene is controlled by the transcription factor pCREB, and this is evident when cells treated with epithalone, a peptide which affects pCREB transcription, have a resulting increase in melatonin synthesis. AANAT is activated through a protein kinase A system in which cyclic AMP (cAMP) is involved. The activation of AANAT leads to an increase in melatonin production. Though there are some differences specific to certain species of vertebrates, the effect of cAMP on AANAT and AANAT on melatonin synthesis remains fairly consistent.
Melatonin synthesis is also regulated by the nervous system. Nerve fibers in the retinohypothalamic tract connect the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN stimulates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve fibers from the superior cervical ganglia that synapse with the pinealocytes. Norepinephrine causes the production of melatonin in the pinealocytes by stimulating the production of cAMP. Because the release of norepinephrine from the nerve fibers occurs at night, this system of regulation maintains the body’s circadian rhythms.

===Synthesis===
Pinealocytes synthesize the hormone melatonin by first converting the amino acid tryptophan to serotonin. The serotonin is then acetylated by the AANAT enzyme and converted into N-acetylserotonin. N-acetylserotonin is converted into melatonin by the enzyme hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), also known as acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT). Activity of these enzymes is high during the night and regulated by the mechanisms previously discussed involving norepinephrine.

<text>In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is a process-unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. 

File descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate &quot;no value&quot; or error conditions.

File descriptors are a part of the POSIX API. Each Unix process (except perhaps daemons) should have three standard POSIX file descriptors, corresponding to the three standard streams:

==Overflow==

In the traditional implementation of Unix, file descriptors index into a per-process &#x27; maintained by the kernel, that in turn indexes into a system-wide table of files opened by all processes, called the &#x27;. This table records the &quot;mode&quot; with which the file (or other resource) has been opened: for reading, writing, appending, and possibly other modes. It also indexes into a third table called the inode table that describes the actual underlying files. To perform input or output, the process passes the file descriptor to the kernel through a system call, and the kernel will access the file on behalf of the process. The process does not have direct access to the file or inode tables.

On Linux, the set of file descriptors open in a process can be accessed under the path codice_1, where PID is the process identifier. File descriptor codice_2 is codice_3, codice_4 is codice_5, and codice_6 is codice_7. As a shortcut to these, any running process can also access &quot;its own&quot; file descriptors through the folders codice_8 and codice_9.

In Unix-like systems, file descriptors can refer to any Unix file type named in a file system. As well as regular files, this includes directories, block and character devices (also called &quot;special files&quot;), Unix domain sockets, and named pipes. File descriptors can also refer to other objects that do not normally exist in the file system, such as anonymous pipes and network sockets.

The FILE data structure in the C standard I/O library usually includes a low level file descriptor for the object in question on Unix-like systems. The overall data structure provides additional abstraction and is instead known as a &quot;file handle.&quot;

==Operations on file descriptors==
The following lists typical operations on file descriptors on modern Unix-like systems. Most of these functions are declared in the codice_10 header, but some are in the codice_11 header instead.

*, , (Linux, takes a single epoll filedescriptor to wait on many other file descriptors)
* (for Linux)
* (for BSD-based systems).
*, (for Linux)

===Operations on the file descriptor table===
The function is used to perform various operations on a file descriptor, depending on the command argument passed to it. There are commands to get and set attributes associated with a file descriptor, including and .
* (BSD and Solaris only; deletes all file descriptors greater than or equal to specified number)
* (for Linux)
* (duplicates an existing file descriptor guaranteeing to be the lowest number available file descriptor)
*, (Close fd1 if necessary, and make file descriptor fd1 point to the open file of fd2)

===Operations that modify process state===
* (sets the process&#x27;s current working directory based on a directory file descriptor)
* (maps ranges of a file into the process&#x27;s address space)

===File locking===
* and 

===Sockets===
*
* (creates a new file descriptor for an incoming connection)
*
*
* (shuts down one or both halves of a full duplex connection)

===Miscellaneous===
* (a large collection of miscellaneous operations on a single file descriptor, often associated with a device)

==codice_12 suffix operations==
A series of new operations has been added to many modern Unix-like systems, as well as numerous C libraries, to be standardized in a future version of POSIX. The codice_12 suffix signifies that the function takes an additional first argument supplying a file descriptor from which relative paths are resolved, the forms lacking the codice_12 suffix thus becoming equivalent to passing a file descriptor corresponding to the current working directory. The purpose of these new operations is to defend against a certain class of TOCTOU attacks.

==File descriptors as capabilities==
Unix file descriptors behave in many ways as capabilities. They can be passed between processes across Unix domain sockets using the codice_15 system call. Note, however, that what is actually passed is a reference to an &quot;open file description&quot; that has mutable state (the file offset, and the file status and access flags). This complicates the secure use of file descriptors as capabilities, since when programs share access to the same open file description, they can interfere with each other&#x27;s use of it by changing its offset or whether it is blocking or non-blocking, for example. In operating systems that are specifically designed as capability systems, there is very rarely any mutable state associated with a capability itself.

A Unix process&#x27; file descriptor table is an example of a C-list.

<text>The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority is a body based in London, Ontario, Canada. It was created in 1947. It was responsible for the construction of the Fanshawe Dam, completed in the 1950s, to control flooding from the Thames River, which runs through London. During the last ice age, the site of London was the terminus of a large glacier. When the region warmed at the end of the ice age, the glacier melted and receded North, leaving behind a drainage ditch and features such as Sifton Bog. As such, the Thames is a watershed for most of Western Ontario, and is therefore highly susceptible to seasonal flooding. In 1937, such flooding had devastating consequences, destroying over 1,000 homes, and causing millions of dollars in damage.

Today, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority is mainly a not-for-profit agency which monitors flora and fauna welfare in the area and gives tours to local kids on school field trips. As of 2023, the current headquarters for the UTRCA is next to Fanshawe Lake at the Fanshawe Conservation Area. 

==Conservation areas==
The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority manages three conservation areas:

*Fanshawe Conservation Area
*Pittock Conservation Area
*Wildwood Conservation Area

==Wetlands==
* Ellice Swamp is a Class 2 Provincially Significant wetland and largest wetland in the watershed.
* Dorchester Swamp, is a Class 1 wetland east of London attached to the Dorchester Mill Pond. It is a designated as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) and a Carolinian Canada site. This swamp is 548 hectares is size.
* Sifton Bog, which is a Class 2 wetland within the City of London, is considered the most southerly intact bog in Canada.
* Golspie Swamp, northwest of Woodstock, is one of the largest remaining wooded areas in Oxford County.

<doc id="608772" wikidata="Q316681" url="?curid=608772" title="Gareth Southgate">
<text>Sir Gareth Southgate (born 3 September 1970) is an English professional football manager and former player, who played as a defender and midfielder. He was the manager of the England men&#x27;s national team from 2016 until 2024.

Southgate began his career with Crystal Palace, making his debut in 1990, and was appointed club captain in 1993, winning the First Division championship that season (1993–94). Having made over 150 appearances for Palace, he was signed by Aston Villa in 1995, winning the League Cup in 1996 and reaching the 2000 FA Cup final, before departing for Middlesbrough, where he won another League Cup in 2004 and reached the 2006 UEFA Cup final. Internationally, Southgate made 57 appearances for the England team between 1995 and 2004. He played every game of England&#x27;s campaign in UEFA Euro 1996, though his penalty miss sent England out in the semi-final; he also featured in both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. He retired in 2006 at the age of 35, having made more than 500 league appearances across his three clubs.

Immediately following his retirement, Southgate was appointed manager of Middlesbrough, staying in the role until his dismissal in 2009. He also managed the England under-21 team from 2013 to 2016, before succeeding Sam Allardyce as the senior team&#x27;s manager in 2016. He led England to the 2018 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, the UEFA Euro 2020 final, the 2022 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals, and the UEFA Euro 2024 final. In 2018 and 2021 he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award.

==Early life and education==
Gareth Southgate was born on 3 September 1970 in Watford, Hertfordshire. He attended Padnell Infant School in Cowplain, Hampshire, along with Pound Hill Junior School and Hazelwick School in Crawley, West Sussex. As a schoolboy he supported Manchester United and his football hero was Bryan Robson. He left school with eight O-Levels at grades between A and C. He studied at Croydon College between 1987 and 1989, successfully completing a City &amp; Guilds Certificate in Recreation and Leisure Industries as part of The Footballers Further Education &amp; Vocational Training Society Youth Training Scheme.

==Club career==
===Crystal Palace===
Southgate played as a youth for two and a half years for Southampton before being released as a thirteen-year-old. He subsequently joined Crystal Palace, making his professional debut as a substitute in a Football League Cup tie against Southend United in October 1990. His league debut came against Liverpool in March 1991. Southgate became a regular in the first team during the 1991–92 season, making 39 appearances. 

Southgate became captain at the age of 23 and led the club to the 1993–94 First Division title, scoring nine goals from central midfield. After the South London club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 1995, Southgate moved to Aston Villa for a fee of £2.5 million.

Southgate&#x27;s nickname at Palace was &quot;Nord&quot;, given to him because his precise way of speaking reminded coach Wally Downes of Denis Norden&#x27;s vocal delivery.

===Aston Villa===
Southgate made 191 appearances for Aston Villa over six seasons. At the club, Southgate was converted into a centre-back and was part of a formidable defence. In his first season, he lifted the League Cup and Aston Villa qualified for the UEFA Cup. Southgate played in every Premier League game during the 1998–99 season. He continued to play for Villa in the 1999–2000 season as the club reached the FA Cup final, but handed in a transfer request just before playing for England at Euro 2000, saying that &quot;if I am to achieve in my career, it is time to move on.&quot;

===Middlesbrough===
On 11 July 2001, Southgate signed for Middlesbrough for a £6.5 million fee. He joined on a four-year deal and was the first signing by Steve McClaren, whom he knew as an England coach.

In July 2002, after Paul Ince left for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southgate was appointed the new Middlesbrough captain. On 29 February 2004, he became the first Boro skipper in their 128-year history to lift a trophy, as they defeated Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final at the Millennium Stadium.

Southgate rejected media rumours that he was set to move to Manchester United following Rio Ferdinand&#x27;s ban for missing a drug test in January 2004. He later committed his final playing years to Middlesbrough, signing until 2007. His final appearance as a professional player was in the 2006 UEFA Cup final against Sevilla, which Middlesbrough lost 4–0 at the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven.

==International career==
Southgate made his debut for England as a substitute against Portugal in December 1995 under the management of Terry Venables, heading the ball against the crossbar with his first international touch. Southgate played every minute of their matches as hosts England reached the semi-final of UEFA Euro 1996, in which they faced Germany. The match was determined in a penalty shoot-out; Southgate&#x27;s penalty was saved, and England were eliminated when Andreas Möller scored the next German penalty. Southgate managed to make light of his blunder later that year by appearing in an advert for Pizza Hut, also featuring Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle, who had missed crucial penalties at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

Southgate also played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. His 50th cap came in a 1–1 draw with Portugal at Villa Park in September 2002. On 11 June 2003, he played the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 Euro 2004 qualifying win over Slovakia at his club ground of the Riverside Stadium, competing against Middlesbrough&#x27;s striker Szilárd Németh.

Southgate was capped 57 times for England and scored twice. His first goal came on 14 October 1998 against Luxembourg in a Euro 2000 qualifier, his second on 22 May 2003 against South Africa in a friendly. He is Aston Villa&#x27;s most capped England player, having played 42 of his 57 internationals whilst with Villa.

==Managerial career==
===Middlesbrough===
====2006–07 season====
Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren left the club in June 2006 to replace Sven-Göran Eriksson as the manager of the England national team. Although Martin O&#x27;Neill was initially the favourite for the new vacancy, Southgate was chosen by chairman Steve Gibson to succeed McClaren, committing to a five-year contract. As Southgate did not have the required coaching qualifications (the UEFA Pro Licence) to manage a top-flight club, he could only be appointed initially for twelve weeks, but he was allowed to stay on as manager after receiving a special dispensation from the Premier League board in November 2006. Middlesbrough successfully argued that, because Southgate had recently been an international player, he had had no opportunity to undertake the coaching courses. Southgate subsequently went on to complete his coaching qualifications.

Upon his appointment, Southgate was tasked with rebuilding a side that had sold several players at the end of the previous league campaign, including key players such as Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Doriva. His first signing as a manager came on 12 July, when Herold Goulon signed from Lyon for an undisclosed fee. He brought in four defensive additions to the squad, with Julio Arca arriving from local rivals Sunderland, Robert Huth from Chelsea and Jason Euell from Charlton Athletic on permanent deals, whereas Jonathan Woodgate joined on a season-long loan from Real Madrid. After playing eleven games in their pre-season campaign, Southgate&#x27;s managerial reign kicked off on 19 August 2006, the first day of the Premier League season, where his side lost 3–2 away at Reading. Despite a disappointing start, they redeemed themselves when hosting reigning champions Chelsea at the Riverside Stadium, the game ending in a 2–1 victory.

During Southgate&#x27;s first season in charge, the side secured some promising victories, but lost away from home to all three newly promoted sides. Furthermore, it took until January for the team to register their first away win of the season, a 3–1 victory at an out-of-form Charlton Athletic, their first away success since April of the previous year. Their highest-scoring victory of the season was a 5–1 win over Bolton Wanderers. Southgate&#x27;s side finished the Premier League season sat in twelfth position. That season also saw the club eliminated from the League Cup at the earliest possibility, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Notts County in the first round. In the FA Cup, the club had a replay in every round they participated in. They were eventually eliminated by Manchester United in the sixth round of the competition, suffering a 3–2 aggregate loss. Due to every possible match going to a replay, Middlesbrough actually played more competition matches than the previous season&#x27;s champions Liverpool.

====2007–08 season====
Middlesbrough were very active during both transfer windows, with Jonathan Woodgate being the first signing during the summer, arriving from Real Madrid for a £7 million transfer fee; Woodgate had previously played for the club during the previous league campaign on loan. The club went on to break their personal transfer record, for the first time since 2002, when Afonso Alves arrived from Heerenveen for €20 million.

In December 2007, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger suggested Southgate as one of several English managers who were &quot;all good enough&quot; to manage the national team. Southgate had faced some criticism earlier on that season, after his side suffered a spell in the relegation zone, but Middlesbrough managed to pull clear of the bottom three. Southgate would go on to guide his side to a thirteenth-place finish in the Premier League; their final game of the league campaign saw them secure an 8–1 victory against Manchester City at home, the club&#x27;s biggest victory in the Premier League era, and Southgate&#x27;s largest margin of victory in management.

====2008–09 season: Relegation and dismissal====
The pre-season build-up ahead of the 2008–09 season was disappointing for the club. Due to heavy spending during the previous season, the club&#x27;s net spending was almost nil. Furthermore, club legend Mark Schwarzer left the club after eleven years, joining Premier League rivals Fulham on the expiration of his contract. Furthermore, key players such as George Boateng and Lee Cattermole also left the club, once again leaving Southgate with a rebuilding challenge to change Middlesbrough&#x27;s fortunes. Despite the negative events during pre-season, Middlesbrough secured two victories out of a possible three, resulting in Southgate being named the Premier League Manager of the Month for August. This made Southgate the second person, after Stuart Pearce, to achieve both the Player and Manager of the Month awards, and he became the first Middlesbrough manager to win the award since Terry Venables in January 2001.

In November 2008, Southgate took Middlesbrough up to eighth place in the league, following an away win against an in-form Aston Villa, another former playing club of Southgate&#x27;s; however, Middlesbrough then went fourteen games without a win, until they beat Liverpool at home 2–0 on 28 February 2009. After an away defeat against Stoke City, some of the travelling supporters were calling for his dismissal, having only achieved a single win in eighteen games and survival from relegation looking highly unlikely. On 24 March, chairman Steve Gibson spoke out on the manager&#x27;s future, stating that sacking Southgate &quot;would not help the situation&quot;.

Due to results elsewhere, Middlesbrough&#x27;s status as a Premier League club went down to the final day: they needed relegation rivals Newcastle United and Hull City to lose, with them needing a five-goal swing to the latter in goal difference. Middlesbrough faced West Ham United away from home; the game ended in a 2–1 defeat, confirming Middlesbrough&#x27;s relegation to the Championship after eleven consecutive seasons in the top flight, as a 19th-place finish was confirmed. Following their relegation, Southgate expressed his determination to achieve instant promotion back up to the Premier League, praising the supporters and showing his sorrow for them in the process.

Middlesbrough&#x27;s Championship campaign started strongly, putting them in contention for an immediate return to the Premier League. However, on 20 October 2009, shortly after a 2–0 victory over Derby County and with the club in fourth place, Southgate was dismissed as manager. His dismissal was controversial as he had taken Middlesbrough to within one point of the top position, though chairman Gibson stated that he had made the decision weeks previously in the best interests of the club. He was replaced by Gordon Strachan, who was unable to take the club back to the Premier League. Middlesbrough would have to wait until 2016 to achieve promotion to the Premier League, under the management of Aitor Karanka.

===England===
====2013–2016: Tenure with the under-21s====
After four years out of football, Southgate returned to management after he signed a three-year contract to succeed Stuart Pearce as the manager of the England under-21 team on 22 August 2013. Senior team manager Roy Hodgson had taken charge for the team&#x27;s 6–0 victory over Scotland in the interim period prior to Southgate&#x27;s appointment. His first game in charge saw the Young Lions defeat Moldova 1–0 in a UEFA European Championship qualification match, thanks to a goal from striker Saido Berahino.

Southgate went on to lead his team to qualify for the finals of the 2015 European Championship; their good fortune could not continue, however, as they finished bottom of their narrow-pointed group, therefore being knocked out of the competition. Their only victory during the competition came when Jesse Lingard scored the singular goal in their 1–0 success over Sweden, who went on to qualify for the competition&#x27;s knockout phase.

In June 2016, Southgate said that he did not want to fill the England senior team position left vacant by Hodgson.

====2016–2017: Promotion to senior team role====
Southgate was put in temporary charge of the senior England team on 27 September 2016, when Sam Allardyce resigned. England were in the early stages of qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. After winning his first game in charge 2–0 against Malta, under Southgate&#x27;s leadership, England went on to draw 0–0 with Slovenia, beat Scotland 3–0, and in his last game in temporary charge, drew 2–2 with Spain, despite leading 2–0 and conceding goals in the 89th and 96th minutes. Southgate&#x27;s spell as caretaker manager ended on 15 November, with him appointed on a permanent basis when he penned a four-year contract two weeks later.

====2018 World Cup====

The England team qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 5 October 2017 after a 1–0 home win over Slovenia. The Football Association confirmed in December that Southgate would remain as England manager even if the team did not progress beyond the group stage of the tournament, describing their expectations as &quot;realistic&quot; and the tournament as &quot;a really important staging post for our development&quot;.

After wins against Tunisia and Panama saw England qualify behind Belgium in their group, Southgate&#x27;s England beat Colombia 4–3 on penalties in the round of 16 after a 1–1 draw on 3 July 2018 to claim his nation&#x27;s first ever World Cup penalty shoot-out victory and a place in the quarter-finals. England then defeated Sweden 2–0 in the quarter-finals on 7 July, with Southgate becoming the first England manager to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup since Bobby Robson in 1990. This success bought Southgate significant admiration from England fans. For the semi-final with Croatia, fans dressed up in waistcoats in tribute to Southgate&#x27;s iconic waistcoat, which he wore during England&#x27;s matches: retailer Marks &amp; Spencer reported a 35% increase in sales of waistcoats, and the hashtag &#x27;WaistcoatWednesday&#x27; trended on Twitter.

On 11 July 2018, Southgate&#x27;s England side suffered a 2–1 defeat to Croatia during extra time in the semi-finals. Kieran Trippier opened the scoring for England with a free kick, before a goal from Ivan Perišić sent the tie into extra time. Mario Mandžukić scored the winner for Croatia in the second half of extra time. With England trailing, the match also saw England play the final ten minutes of extra time with ten men as Trippier suffered an injury after Southgate had already made his permitted substitutions. Following a 2–0 defeat to Belgium in the third place play-off, England ended the World Cup in fourth place. Harry Kane, a striker and the England team captain, won the Golden Boot as the tournament&#x27;s top goal-scorer.

A week after the end of the tournament, Southgate tube station in Enfield, London, was renamed &quot;Gareth Southgate&quot; for two days in recognition of Southgate&#x27;s achievement. Southgate was also lauded for personal qualities shown in the World Cup, including consoling Colombia&#x27;s Mateus Uribe, whose missed penalty had seen England win.

====2018–19 UEFA Nations League====
In 2019, Southgate managed England to third place in the inaugural UEFA Nations League. They did so after finishing top of a group containing Spain and Croatia. Their 3–2 victory away against the Spanish was their first victory in Spain for 31 years. They lost 3–1 to the Netherlands in the semi-final but then beat Switzerland 6–5 in a penalty shootout after the third-place match finished goalless. It was England&#x27;s first third-place finish in a major international tournament since UEFA Euro 1968.

====UEFA Euro 2020====
At UEFA Euro 2020, England finished top of Group D which included Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic, beating Croatia 1–0 to start the European Championship with a win for England for the first time, drawing Scotland 0–0, and winning against the Czech Republic 1–0, with forward Raheem Sterling scoring both goals. In the round of 16, England defeated Germany 2–0 at Wembley Stadium with two late goals from Sterling and Kane, their first knockout phase win at the European Championships (as their only previous victory was defeating Spain on penalties in UEFA Euro 1996). This was also their first win over Germany in a knockout match since the 1966 FIFA World Cup final. 

In the quarter-final tie, Southgate&#x27;s England team beat Ukraine 4–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to reach the semi-finals of a major competition for the fifth time. In the semi-final, England beat Denmark 2–1 at Wembley Stadium and reached the final of the European Championships for the first time. It was only the second time that England had reached any major tournament&#x27;s final. In the final at Wembley Stadium, an early goal from defender Luke Shaw saw England lead 1–0, before Italy&#x27;s Leonardo Bonucci levelled the match in the 67th minute. With the scores unchanged after extra time, England ultimately lost the match 3–2 on penalties.

==== Build up to 2022 World Cup ====
In September 2021, England tied their highest FIFA ranking position at 3rd. In November 2021, Southgate led England to World Cup qualification following a 10–0 win over San Marino. A week later he signed a new contract which meant he would remain the England manager until December 2024. In June 2022, Southgate led England into the UEFA Nations League. England drew three of their matches in the competition and lost the other three, which included a 4–0 defeat to Hungary on 14 June 2022. This was the country&#x27;s worst home defeat since 1928. On 23 September 2022, following a 1–0 defeat to Italy, England were relegated to League B.

==== 2022 World Cup ====
England won their group at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with wins against both Iran and Wales, and a goalless draw with the United States. In the round of 16, England beat Senegal 3–0, advancing to the quarter-finals, where they lost 2–1 to France. In the immediate aftermath of this defeat, Southgate expressed doubts about continuing as England manager. On 18 December 2022, the FA confirmed Southgate would remain in post until after the UEFA Euro 2024.

====UEFA Euro 2024 and departure====

On 17 October 2023, England secured qualification to UEFA Euro 2024 with two games remaining. During the qualification campaign, England recorded their first home and away victories over Italy since 1977 and 1961 respectively. England finished top of their qualification group, as they remained unbeaten throughout the calendar year.

During the tournament, England won Group C with 5 points, qualifying for the knock out rounds. Despite qualifying with a game to spare, Southgate and his team were criticised by fans and pundits, particularly after a 1–1 draw with Denmark in the second game; Southgate said that he blanked out criticism. A goalless draw with Slovenia in the last group game saw England top their group, but the team were booed, and Southgate was struck with objects from the crowd; he said that he understood fans&#x27; frustration but felt that the negativity was harming the players.

In the round of 16, England beat Slovakia by equalising through a Jude Bellingham overhead kick in added time, before Harry Kane headed the winner in the first minute of extra time. After the game, Declan Rice said that the team were committed to each other and the manager, and Southgate said that the team were &quot;putting plasters over things&quot;. England&#x27;s quarter-final against Switzerland ended in a 1–1 draw before England scored all five of their attempts in the penalty shootout. In the post-match press conference, Southgate said &quot;Every now and then there has to be some enjoyment in this job and if you can&#x27;t enjoy that moment, the whole thing is a waste of time. I can&#x27;t deny when [the criticism] is as personal as it has been, on a human level it&#x27;s difficult but we&#x27;re fighting and we&#x27;re not going to stop fighting.&quot;

In the semi-final against the Netherlands, Xavi Simons scored after seven minutes to put the Dutch team ahead, while Harry Kane scored a penalty equaliser after being fouled by Denzel Dumfries; substitute Ollie Watkins scored a late winner for England. England lost the final 2–1 to Spain after a late winner from Mikel Oyarzabal. After the game, Southgate did not answer if he would renew his contract, set to expire in December. Former England captain Alan Shearer said that Southgate could leave &quot;with his head held high&quot;, having improved England&#x27;s results since the nadir of elimination by Iceland at UEFA Euro 2016, but that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t quite able to get the best out of this team in Germany, and that was the difference between us reaching another final and winning one&quot;. 

Two days after the final, Southgate resigned as England manager. In a statement, Southgate said: &quot;As a proud Englishman, it has been the honour of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all. But it&#x27;s time for change, and for a new chapter&quot;. He managed 102 games in total for England.

==Other roles==
In 2003, Southgate and his close friend Andy Woodman co-wrote &quot;Woody &amp; Nord: A Football Friendship&quot;. This book describes an enduring friendship forged in the Crystal Palace youth team that has survived Southgate and Woodman&#x27;s wildly differing fortunes in the professional game. The book won the Sports Book of the Year award for 2004 from the National Sporting Club (now the British Sports Book Awards). He wrote a further book, &quot;Anything Is Possible: Be Brave, Be Kind &amp; Follow Your Dreams&quot;, published in November 2020.

Southgate was also a co-commentator for ITV Sport at the 2006 World Cup, covering group games alongside Clive Tyldesley. Due to commitments of managing Middlesbrough, he attended for only the first two weeks of the four-week tournament. He resumed a role as pundit and co-commentator after he finished his tenure at Middlesbrough in 2010, working on FA Cup and UEFA Champions League matches for ITV as well as acting as a pundit on England games.

In January 2011, Southgate was appointed as the FA&#x27;s head of elite development, to work with Trevor Brooking. He left the post in July 2012, and ruled himself out of consideration for the role of technical director, for which he had been a leading candidate.

Southgate is an Ambassador for The Prince&#x27;s Trust and Patron of Help for Heroes.

After stepping down as England manager, Southgate was appointed a visiting lecturer at Harvard Business School. His third book, &quot;Dear England: Lessons on Leadership&quot;, will be published in October 2025.

==Style of management==
Southgate&#x27;s style of management whilst in charge of England has been described as embodying principles of &quot;empowering coaching&quot; and elements of &quot;transformational leadership&quot;. He has been praised for his man management and for creating a &quot;cohesive, positive culture&quot; within the England squad. He is also credited for the promotion of players from England&#x27;s youth squads into the senior international team.

As England manager, Southgate has often adapted the team&#x27;s formation depending on the opposition, using the 4–3–3, 4–2–3–1, 3–4–3 and 3–5–2 formations. The formation used at the 2018 World Cup has been described as both a 3–5–2 and, alternatively, a &quot;unique 3–3–2–2&quot;.

Southgate has been criticised for his team&#x27;s perceived &quot;pragmatic&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; style of play, as well as for his in-game management. He has also been criticised for selecting out of form players, with some commentators accusing him of &quot;favouritism&quot;.

==Personal life==
Southgate married Alison Bird in July 1997 at St Nicholas Church in Worth; the couple have two children. Southgate and his family have resided in the spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, since the early 2000s, owning many homes in and around the town, including a grand Victorian townhouse on the Duchy Estate, before settling in a £3.75 million country house 8 miles from the town centre.

Southgate was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to football. 

On 13 November 2019, Southgate was named an Honorary Yorkshireman by Welcome to Yorkshire. The honour is given to &#x27;inspirational individuals who have made a big impact on Yorkshire, despite being born outside the county lines&#x27;.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Southgate agreed to take a 30% salary cut.

In December 2024, Southgate was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2025 New Year Honours.

==In popular culture==
Beginning with the 2018 World Cup, England supporters adapted the chorus of the 2001 hit single &quot;Whole Again&quot; by English pop girl group Atomic Kitten as a chant for Southgate. The song had previously been adapted by Celtic fans earlier in the 2017–18 season in honour of defender Mikael Lustig.

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Looking back on when we first met
I cannot escape and I cannot forget
Southgate, you&#x27;re the one – you still turn me on
&quot;Football&#x27;s coming home again&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

During the World Cup before England&#x27;s quarter-final against Sweden, Atomic Kitten member Natasha Hamilton shared a video of herself on Twitter singing the alternate lyrics. On 3 July 2021, Hamilton and fellow member Liz McClarnon then returned to perform the song with reworked lyrics including the existing alternate ones before chanting England fans at a watch party at Boxpark Croydon for the Euro 2020 quarter-final against Ukraine. On 6 July 2021, the day before England&#x27;s semi-final against Denmark, the group released an official full-length version of the adapted song called &quot;Southgate You&#x27;re The One (Football&#x27;s Coming Home Again)&quot; via Columbia Records UK. Member Jenny Frost rejoined the band for the first time since 2008 for the remix/re-recording.

In 2023, &quot;Dear England&quot;, a play about Southgate, appeared in London&#x27;s National Theatre. Written by James Graham, Joseph Fiennes appears as Southgate.

<text>My Sister Sam is an American television sitcom starring Pam Dawber and Rebecca Schaeffer that aired on CBS from October 6, 1986, to April 12, 1988.

==Synopsis==
The sitcom follows the lives of a 29-year-old San Francisco freelance photographer named Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Russell and her 16-year-old sister Patti. Sam&#x27;s life is turned upside down when Patti, who has been living with the sisters&#x27; Aunt Elsie and Uncle Bob in rural Oregon after the death of the girls&#x27; parents, shows up on Sam&#x27;s door step and announces that she is going to live with Sam.

The supporting cast includes Sam&#x27;s neurotic agent Jordan Dylan &quot;J.D.&quot; Lucas, Sam&#x27;s sarcastic assistant Dixie Randazzo and Jack Kincaid, Sam&#x27;s womanizing photojournalist neighbor who frequently stops by her apartment.

==Cast==
*Pam Dawber as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Russell
*Rebecca Schaeffer as Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Russell
*Joel Brooks as Jordan Dylan &quot;J.D.&quot; Lucas
*Jenny O&#x27;Hara as Dixie Randazzo
*David Naughton as Jack Kincaid

==Production==
The series was created by Stephen Fischer and was developed by Pam Dawber&#x27;s production company, Pony Productions (in association with Warner Bros. Television). Dawber and her Manager, Mimi Weber, spent three years searching for the most ideal television series project for their company to co-produce, but after screening several of them, Dawber had not found one that truly spoke to her. In the midst of this search, she and Weber produced a few TV movies under the Pony Productions nameplate, in which Dawber played lead roles.

By late 1985, Stephen Fischer and Diane English submitted their screenplay to Dawber and Weber, one centering on the life and times of a young photographer on the fast track who takes in her teenage sister, titled &quot;Taking the Town&quot; (based on the phrase &quot;taking the town by storm&quot;). At last, Dawber found a fulfilling script, and the creative team (she, Weber, Fischer and English) had the pilot successfully pitched to CBS. The network gave it a berth on its successful Monday night sitcom lineup for its 1986-87 fall schedule, originally as &quot;Taking the Town&quot;, with the title changing to &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; as summer pre-promotions ramped up.

The series was initially intended to be a starring vehicle for Dawber, who found success on television opposite Robin Williams in the ABC sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. Dawber later said that she wanted the focus of the show to be on the cast as a whole, stating, &quot;I am not a comedian. I&#x27;m a reactor to all the zany people who revolve around me.&quot;

&quot;My Sister Sam&quot; was executive produced by Diane English and Mimi Weber and filmed at The Burbank Studio.

===Theme song===
The series&#x27; theme song, &quot;Room Enough for Two&quot;, was written by Steve Dorff and John Bettis and performed by Kim Carnes. Dorff won a BMI TV Music Award in 1987 for his work on the series.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1986–87)===
===Season 2 (1987–88)===
== Release ==
&quot;My Sister Sam&quot; premiered on October 6, 1986, scheduled between &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;, both hit shows for CBS. The series earned solid ratings and was ranked #21 by the end of its first season. Due to its success, CBS renewed the series for a second season. CBS then moved &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; to Saturday nights opposite &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, which was a part of NBC&#x27;s successful Saturday night comedy lineup. By the end of October 1987, the show&#x27;s audience had dwindled to one of the lowest on network TV ranking at #71. The series was put on hiatus in November 1987 but remained in production while the network decided its fate.

CBS brought the series back to the air on March 15, 1988, due in part to letters from fans and the
1988 Writers Guild of America strike which affected the production of other television series for CBS and the other two major television networks (NBC, ABC). CBS chose to move &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; yet again to Tuesday nights. By April, ratings had failed to improve and the series was again pulled from the lineup. CBS announced the series&#x27; cancellation in May 1988, leaving 12 episodes of the second season unaired.

=== Syndication ===
After the series was canceled by CBS, the USA Network picked up syndication rights and eventually aired all 44 episodes, including those never shown on CBS.

=== Home media ===
The show&#x27;s pilot episode appeared on the bonus disc &quot;Warner Bros. 50 Years of TV Commemorative: Volume 2&quot;. It was packaged with some releases of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; Season 1 DVD set

==Reception==

=== Awards and nominations ===
==Rebecca Schaeffer&#x27;s death==
On July 18, 1989, more than a year after &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; had been canceled, series cast member Rebecca Schaeffer was fatally shot in the doorway of her Los Angeles apartment building by Robert John Bardo, an obsessed fan from Tucson, Arizona who had been stalking her for three years. The following month, Pam Dawber, Joel Brooks, David Naughton and Jenny O&#x27;Hara reunited to film a public service announcement for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Schaeffer&#x27;s honor.

<text>SES Sirius, formerly called Nordic Satellite AB (NSAB) was the owner and operator of the two Sirius satellites, which provide the Nordic countries and the Baltic states, with TV, radio, data and communications solutions. The company is today entirely owned and controlled by SES and has no independent existence.

The 2004 SES Annual Report states that 16.4 million homes received broadcast and broadband services from the Sirius system, 1.5 million from the satellites directly and another 14.9 million from cable networks distributing content via Sirius.

==History==
In 1982 the governments of Sweden and Norway formed NSAB as part of a wide-ranging partnership for the purpose of &quot;telecommunication satellite cooperation&quot;. In 1989 the two governments agreed to end their partnership, the Swedish government assumed full ownership with the acquisition of Norway&#x27;s 15% share.

On April 2, 1989 NSAB&#x27;s first satellite, the Aérospatiale built Tele-X, was launched on an Ariane 2 rocket from French Guiana. The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) was contracted to operate the TELE-X system and in 1993 the company acquired the Swedish government&#x27;s shares, becoming the sole owner.

In late 1993 NSAB acquired Marco Polo 1, a Hughes 376 geostationary communications satellite, from British Sky Broadcasting. Marco Polo 1 was built for and operated by British Satellite Broadcasting. However following that company&#x27;s collapse it merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. In this &quot;merger&quot; Sky was the dominant force and their system of transponder lease from SES&#x27; Astra satellites was maintained. Marco Polo 1 (and its sister satellite) were gradually withdrawn from service.

In February 1994 Teracom acquired a 50% share of NSAB. The same month Marco Polo 1 re-entered service as Sirius 1 at 5°E. In July 1994 NSAB agreed the purchase of Sirius 2 from Aérospatiale (later Alcatel Space). The satellite was successfully launched on November 12, 1997 by Ariane 4 rocket. Shortly after launch SES signed a lease agreement for all transponders on the satellite.

In 1996 Tele Danmark acquired a 25% share in NSAB from Teracom.

In May 1997 NSAB ordered a Hughes 376HP. The Sirius 3 satellite was successfully launched on October 5, 1998, again by Ariane 4 rocket.

In October 2000 SES acquired the shares of Tele Danmark and Teracom to become 50-50 joint owner with SSC. SES increased its shareholding to 75% in December 2003, and renamed the company to SES Sirius on December 1, 2005. In January 2008, SES further increased its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90%.

In March 2010 SES (as then subsidiary SES Astra) took full control and in June 2010 the company was renamed SES Astra and the only fully operational satellite, Sirius 4, renamed Astra 4A.

<doc id="608785" wikidata="Q7785741" url="?curid=608785" title="This Hour Has Seven Days">
<text>This Hour Has Seven Days was a CBC Television public affairs program that ran from 1964 to 1966, offering viewers in-depth analysis of the major social and political stories of the previous week.

The show, inspired by the BBC and NBC-TV satire series &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, was created by Patrick Watson and Douglas Leiterman as an avenue for a more stimulating and boundary-pushing brand of television journalism. CBC executives believed the controversial show went beyond the limits of journalistic ethics and cancelled the show, leading to allegations of political interference.

The show set new standards of broadcast journalism in Canada and the United States, and many of its elements inspired the tabloid talk show genre in later decades.

==Overview==

=== Hosts and contributors ===
&quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; was initially hosted by John Drainie, Laurier LaPierre, and Carole Simpson (not to be confused with the now-retired ABC weekend news anchor of the same name); Simpson was soon replaced by Dinah Christie, and Watson himself replaced Drainie in the show&#x27;s second season when Drainie (who died in 1966) was too ill to continue with the series.

It had a production staff of as many as 40 people, with a roster of producers responsible for separate segments.

Contributing personalities—known at various times as story editors, writers, directors, and producers—included Charles Backhouse, Donald Brittain, Cecily Burwash, Jim Carney, Roy Faibish, Beryl Fox, Allan King, Tom Koch, Heinz Kornagel, Sam Levene, Brian Nolan, Charles Oberdorf, Peter Pearson, Alexander Ross, Warner Troyer, Jack Webster, and Larry Zolf.

=== Content ===
&quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; debuted on October 4, 1964, replacing the Cliff Solway-produced series &quot;Background&quot;. The show used a one-hour news format which combined satirical songs (performed by Simpson or Christie) and sketches with hard news interviews, reports, and documentaries. It also played a major role in bringing to public attention issues that had been suppressed or made taboo both in television and society as a whole.

Leiterman and Watson divided the show into different components, which varied in length and weight from broadcast to broadcast. As a review of the week&#x27;s events, &quot;Seven Days&quot; would rely on film reports, linked with contexts and updates from the studio hosts.

&quot;Seven Days&quot; combined two types of public affairs television. Following the first type, the show employed the direct-cinema techniques of contemporary documentary filmmaking to cover issues of public interest in depth through hour-long film essays. Second, the show invigorated discussions with public policymakers, and helped establish television as a medium of public accountability. Interviews were drawn from the latter style of broadcast, and were labelled the &quot;Hot Seat,&quot; proposed as a &quot;tough encounter with a prominent guest who is hot in the news and prepared to be grilled.&quot; The &quot;Small World&quot; segment added the element of a studio audience for interview sessions.

The producers also planned to include background commentary by a range of Canadian and foreign broadcasters and writers; among them they proposed Alistair Cooke, James Reston, Blair Fraser, Rebecca West, Gérard Pelletier, James Wechsler, Simone de Beauvoir, and future Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

Once each month, &quot;Seven Days&quot; was replaced by &quot;Document&quot; (1964–66), a single-item documentary series, also produced by Leiterman and Watson. One documentary commissioned by &quot;Document&quot;, Fox&#x27;s Vietnam War film &quot;The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam&quot;, winner of Film of the Year at the Canadian Film Awards, became one of the most famous documentary films ever produced about the war, with editing by Don Haig. Earlier, the creative team of Fox and Haig, along with cameramen Richard Leiterman, John Foster and Grahame Woods, had gone to Mississippi to cover Freedom Summer following the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in August 1964. The result, known as &quot;Summer in Mississippi&quot;, won a Canadian Film Award for Best TV Information and was shown on &quot;Seven Days&quot;.

One of the most dramatic techniques was to ambush politicians and other figures at their homes or on their way to work and ask them difficult questions.

==== Select episodes and issues covered ====
As an example of the broad scope of each episode of &quot;Seven Days&quot;, consider the one that aired on the January 1, 1966 episode. It featured: Brian Nolan&#x27;s interview with surrealist artist Salvador Dalí; Ken Lefolii&#x27;s interview with reporter Richard Dudman, who was blamed for upsetting peace negotiations in North Vietnam; Robert Hoyt and Douglas Leiterman&#x27;s interview with Washington columnist Max Freedman concerning President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s performance in the latest peace offensive; a comedy sketch by Stan Daniels and Barry Baldaro portraying future events in Rhodesia; a report on increased U.S. usage of chemical and biological weapons; a satirical report on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s gubernatorial candidacy in California accompanied by film clips from some of his films; Dinah Christies&#x27; interview with actor Peter Ustinov, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and writer Stan Freburg, regarding the 1960s; Larry Zolf&#x27;s man-in-the-street interviews in London gauging public recognition of Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson; and finally a round table discussion with Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp who discusses public life, federal-provincial relations, foreign ownership and Canada&#x27;s economic condition.

The show was also instrumental in news coverage of the Munsinger Affair, a 1966 sex scandal involving former federal Minister of Defence Pierre Sévigny. When Zolf showed up on Sévigny&#x27;s doorstep in pursuit of the story, Sévigny whacked Zolf on the head with his cane.

Among other controversies inspired by the show, LaPierre was once shown wiping away tears on the air after a filmed interview pertaining to the Steven Truscott case, a report on the Miss Canada pageant was criticized as journalistic &quot;poaching&quot; because the rival CTV Television Network had exclusive coverage rights to the event, and an interview with members of the Ku Klux Klan was deliberately engineered to provoke an on-air reaction when a black civil rights activist was brought in, unannounced, to join the interview partway through.

== History ==
Created by Patrick Watson and Douglas Leiterman, &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; debuted on October 4, 1964, with a studio audience, unheard of for a news show at the time. The debut episode featured music by Dinah Christie, who sang original tunes based on the news of the week, and an interview with Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.

The show was initially hosted by John Drainie, Laurier LaPierre, and Carole Simpson (not to be confused with the now-retired ABC weekend news anchor of the same name); Simpson was soon replaced by Christie.

In the show&#x27;s second season, Watson himself replaced Drainie as co-host, after the latter (who died in 1966) was too ill to continue with the series. This would leave Leiterman as the sole executive producer.

===Cancellation===
Concerned about the show&#x27;s approach to the news, the CBC fired hosts Watson and LaPierre in April 1966, just before the end of the TV season; Lapierre&#x27;s tears following the Truscott report, purportedly betraying a bias in his reporting, were cited as the pretext for the firing. This resulted in a public outcry for weeks as viewers organized demonstrations, wrote letters and made angry phone calls, CBC staff threatened to resign, newspaper editorials fulminated about political interference in the decision, and politicians demanded a parliamentary inquiry.

A parliamentary committee hearing was convened, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson appointed &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; publisher Stu Keate as a special investigator. CBC president Alphonse Ouimet told the committee that CBC management had been battling the show&#x27;s producers for two years, and that the show had consistently ignored CBC policies.

Following two weeks of mediation, Keate said it was clear that there had been &quot;mistakes made on both sides&quot; and recommended that the CBC board of directors do a better job of explaining to the public its decision to fire Watson and LaPierre. CBC directors immediately reaffirmed the firing of Watson and LaPierre, while admitting that the way they were fired had been a mistake.

The dispute heated up again in July, leading producer Douglas Leiterman to halt work on a new season of programs. Leiterman said he was told by CBC that his contract for the show would only be renewed if he signed a pledge to behave himself, and that he believed that Bud Walker—the CBC vice-president who had fired Watson and LaPierre—had been given a promotion to oversee all CBC English programming. The CBC denied that Walker had been promoted, fired Leiterman and cancelled the show.

==Legacy==

&quot;Seven Days&quot; set new standards of broadcast journalism in Canada and the United States. Shortly after it ended, the rival CTV Television Network launched a similar program called &quot;W5&quot;, which continues to air to this day (Watson contributed to this series on occasion). &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; were two others shows that debuted within fewer than 10 years of &quot;Seven Days&quot;&#x27; cancellation. It later also inspired the Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, which took both its name and a comedic variation on &quot;Seven Days&quot;-style ambush interviews from the earlier show.

Watson continued to produce programming for the CBC, including the 1988 documentary series &quot;The Struggle for Democracy&quot;. He also produces and narrates &quot;The Heritage Minutes&quot;, which are made for the Historica Foundation and given to all broadcasters who want them (receiving some 50,000 showings per year across Canada). In 1989, he was named chairman of the CBC, a position he held until 1994.

LaPierre, who also continued to produce CBC programming and authored a number of books on Canadian history, was named to the Senate in 2001. He died in Ottawa in December 2012.

Christie continued to work as a singer and comedic actress.

In 2001, the CBC reaired a number of old episodes of &quot;Seven Days&quot; as a summer series.

In 2002, the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada honoured &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; as a MasterWorks recipient.

In 2014, the October 24, 1965 episode of the series was screened at the Canadian International Television Festival in Toronto. This episode featured the Ku Klux Klan segment noted above, as well as an invitation to political party leaders to appear on the show as part of the 1965 election campaign, a report on the shooting death of a policeman in Sudbury, an election &quot;poll&quot; of homeless men, interviews with Bob Guccione and Orson Welles, a feature profile on boxer George Chuvalo, and a comedic sketch mocking Prime Minister Lester Pearson and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s negotiations to have the Canadian government purchase military aircraft from the United Kingdom.

<text>Horst Dassler (12 March 1936 – 10 April 1987) was a German businessman. The son of Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler, founder of Adidas. Horst Dassler founded Arena, a swimwear company, and became chairman of Adidas, and at the time of his death it was the world&#x27;s largest sporting goods manufacturer with affiliates in 40 nations. Horst himself was known as the father of sports sponsorship as a result of his separate business of managing rights for the world governing bodies of football and the Olympics.

Horst was also the nephew of Rudolf Dassler, founder of Puma.

==Career at Adidas==
Dassler joined his father&#x27;s firm in 1960 and founded an Adidas affiliate in Alsace that later became the dominant sporting goods manufacturer in France. Among Dassler&#x27;s achievements was the founding of the Arena line of swimwear in 1973. Dassler had been impressed by the performance of Mark Spitz at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Having developed an ultra-light fabric, Dassler persuaded Australian swimmer Shane Gould to enter a sponsorship agreement to promote the Shane Gould Female Swimsuit Collection. Dassler continued to sign athletes to sponsorship deals and by the 1976 Montreal Olympics the &quot;Arena Elite Team&quot; included Mark Spitz, Novella Calligaris, Steve Furniss, David Wilkie, Shirley Babashoff, Gary Hall Sr., Klaus Dibiasi, Ulrika Knape and Maxine “Miki” King. Beyond signing individual athletes, Dassler led Adidas&#x27;s pioneering drive to sign national sports federations and Olympic committees to exclusive shoe and apparel contracts. Although Adidas lost a considerable share of this business after Dassler&#x27;s death, even five years later Adidas had ties with about 100 companies.

After the death of his father in 1978, Dassler&#x27;s mother Käthe Dassler became chairman of the company and Dassler returned to Germany to take his place in the top management of the firm. When his mother died in 1984, Dassler assumed the office of chairman, a position he retained until his death.

On assuming control, Dassler was immediately faced with the challenge of increasing competition for sports shoeware: Nike, Inc. was eroding Adidas&#x27;s market share in the United States and Japan, and Puma SE, a company founded by Dassler&#x27;s uncle after a dispute with his father, had increased its sales of athletic footwear by 35% the previous year. Dassler responded to the challenge by installing a professional management team at company headquarters to replace family members. In the United States, where Adidas&#x27;s sales had slipped to one third of Nike&#x27;s, Dassler attempted to diversify distribution channels and respond to a shift in consumer demand from athletic to casual footwear, a shift that Adidas had failed to satisfy.

==Career as sports marketer==
Horst Dassler was known as the father of sport sponsorship. In the mid-1970s, Dassler formed arguably the first sports marketing firm with British advertising executive Patrick J. Nally. The two approached newly elected FIFA President João Havelange, who believed that the soccer body was not maximizing revenues. Dassler proposed obtaining corporate sponsorships for the World Cup and other activities of FIFA. It took the two 18 months of high-pressure salesmanship to persuade Coca-Cola to become FIFA&#x27;s first corporate sponsor, committing $8 million. Coca-Cola thus became the first exclusive worldwide sponsor of a sport. Dassler and Nally continued acquiring sponsorships from blue-chip companies like McDonald&#x27;s and Levi Strauss. Dassler&#x27;s business practices had few limits and David Yallop in his book &quot;How they Stole the Game&quot; says his relationship with Havelange was &quot;Drahtzieher.&quot; Dassler was the &quot;puppetmaster.&quot; In the 1982, Dassler broke with Nally and established ISL Marketing A.G. (ISL), a firm which continued marketing FIFA rights but also added television rights to the advertising package which it bought up en masse from FIFA.

In May 1985, ISL was selected to manage the corporate sponsorship program of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The highly lucrative contract was awarded without competitive bidding, and even without providing the opportunity to Nally&#x27;s rival marketing company, West Nally, Ltd., to make an alternative proposal. Many suspected that personal relations between Adidas and the IOC were behind the private arrangement. IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch denied any impropriety, and Dassler, claiming to be motivated solely by good will for the Olympics movement, denied he had a conflict of interest. According to British sports journalists Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings, Dassler and ISL were largely responsible for turning the Olympics into a hugely successful revenue-generating enterprise. Dassler used his contacts to obtain Olympic sponsorship by Coca-Cola and other important companies, and obtained Olympic financing from Monte Carlo banks. Years later, Samaranch was the main eulogist at Dassler&#x27;s funeral.

Years after Dassler&#x27;s death, in May 2001 ISL filed for bankruptcy, with a stated net debt of $300 million.

==Death==
Horst Dassler died on 10 April 1987 from complications due to cancer. He left behind his wife Monika and two children, Suzanne and Adi.

<doc id="608796" wikidata="Q313737" url="?curid=608796" title="Drusus Julius Caesar">
<text>Drusus Julius Caesar (7 October – 14 September AD 23), also called Drusus the Younger, was the son of Emperor Tiberius, and heir to the Roman Empire following the death of his adoptive brother Germanicus in AD 19.

He was born at Rome to a prominent branch of the &quot;gens Claudia&quot;, the son of Tiberius and his first wife, Vipsania Agrippina. His name at birth was Nero Claudius Drusus after his paternal uncle Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Elder). In AD 4, he assumed the name &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; following his father&#x27;s adoption into the Julii by Augustus, and became Drusus Julius Caesar.

Drusus first entered politics with the office of quaestor in AD 10. His political career mirrored that of Germanicus, and he assumed all his offices at the same age as him. Following the model of Augustus, it was intended that the two would rule together. They were both popular, and many dedications have been found in their honor across Roman Italy. Cassius Dio calls him &quot;Castor&quot; in his &quot;Roman History&quot;, likening Drusus and Germanicus to the twins, Castor and Pollux, of Roman mythology.

Drusus died suddenly on September 14th 23 AD. Ancient historians, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, claim that he died amid a feud with the powerful Sejanus, Praetorian prefect of Rome. They allege that Drusus was murdered. In their account, Sejanus had seduced Drusus&#x27;s wife Livilla, and, with the help of a doctor, she had poisoned Drusus. Despite the rumors, Tiberius did not suspect Sejanus and the two remained friends until Sejanus&#x27;s fall from grace in AD 31.

==Early life and family==

He was born around 14 BC in Rome with the name Nero Claudius Drusus. He is often referred to by historians as &quot;Drusus II&quot;, &quot;Drusus the Younger&quot; or &quot;Drusus Minor&quot; to distinguish him from his paternal uncle, Nero Claudius Drusus, the younger brother of Tiberius after whom Drusus was named. Drusus was the maternal grandson of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a close friend of Augustus, and his first wife Caecilia Attica.

As a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was a close relative of all five Julio-Claudian emperors. His father was emperor, and his adoptive grandfather was the founder of the Roman Empire, Augustus. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the cousin of Caligula, a paternal cousin of Claudius, and a first cousin once removed of Nero – all future emperors of Rome.

Before Tiberius, the heirs of Augustus were the sons of Julia the Elder and Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They advanced through their careers at the same pace and were going to rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.

Later that year, Drusus was married to his paternal cousin, Livilla, to bring him closer to the Julians. Tacitus says she was unattractive as a child, but grew up to be beautiful. Their daughter Julia was born not long after the marriage, and they had twin sons: Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus in 19, the latter of whom died while still an infant in 23. The birth of his sons was commemorated on coins.

Just as Agrippa&#x27;s sons were, Drusus was about the same age as Germanicus, and both of them also followed parallel careers. Drusus and Germanicus held all their offices at the same age, and progressed through the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; at the same pace. Both held the office of quaestor at the same age, both were exempted from holding the praetorship, they held their first and second consulships at the same age, and both were given proconsular &quot;imperium maius&quot; when they were sent to govern Germania and Illyricum respectively.

==Career==

Drusus&#x27; first office was that of quaestor in AD 10. Being politically inclined, he was made a permanent member of the committee Augustus had founded in AD 13 to draw up the Senate&#x27;s daily business.

In August of 14 his adoptive grandfather Augustus died. In his honor, Drusus read a eulogy before the rostra at his funeral. The next month, on 17 September, the senate met to confirm his father as &quot;princeps&quot;. Among his first acts as emperor, Tiberius instituted the &quot;Sodales Augustales&quot;, a priesthood of the cult of Augustus which members of the imperial family, such as Drusus, joined. This was not his first religious post though, as he had been a &quot;pontifex&quot; since AD 7/8 - an important step to the prestigious &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. Since 14 May AD 14, he was a member of the &quot;Fratres Arvales&quot; as well.

Drusus had little time to mourn the death of Augustus or celebrate the ascendance of his father Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular &quot;imperium maius&quot; upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.

===The revolt in Pannonia===
The three legions in Pannonia (VIII Augusta, XIX Hispana, and XV Apollinaris) were under the command of Junius Blaesus, who allowed his men a rest from military duties to mourn the death of Augustus. There was a breakdown in discipline, and the soldiers stopped obeying orders as a result. They soon became restless and lashed out against their officers, including Blaesus and a prefect named Aufidienus Rufus. Having been dispatched with two Praetorian cohorts, Drusus and Praetorian prefect Sejanus reached the Pannonian legions at Emona on 26 September.

The soldiers met with him upon his arrival and let Drusus into their entrenchments. The soldiers were rowdy, but as Tacitus says:

Their demands were: a discharge from military service after only sixteen years (down from twenty), a reward for service, an increase of pay to one denarius a day, and that the veterans not be detained under a standard. However, negotiations broke down and the soldiers began stoning members of Drusus&#x27; party. Next morning, a lunar eclipse before dawn convinced the soldiery that their mutiny was doomed, and order was restored by daybreak as a result. Drusus was allowed into the camp by Blaesus before an assembly of the troops in which Drusus commended the controlled behavior of the soldiery and promised to write a letter to his father addressing their demands. If Drusus&#x27; letter was dispatched on 28 September, it should have reached Rome by 3 or 4 October.

Having gained control of the soldiers, his next move, according to Tacitus, was executing the leaders of the mutiny. He sent out a search party into the surrounding forest to kill those leaders not present for the assembly. Having settled these matters, Drusus returned to Rome.

===First consulship and command of Illyricum===

In AD 15 he held the consulship alongside Gaius Norbanus Flaccus. It was this year that he hosted the gladiatorial games in his and Germanicus&#x27; name, which he enjoyed in such excess that it disturbed the other spectators. He reportedly carried out his duties as consul well, although he was prone to violence and earned the nickname &quot;Castor&quot; from fighting an equestrian. There was also an incident at a theater between the Praetorians and &quot;claqueurs&quot; (&quot;actors&quot;) in which Drusus reportedly sided with the actors, preventing the Praetorian Guard from punishing unruly actors. In &quot;Annals&quot; 1.77, Tacitus says the unruly behavior of actors and the crowds were later addressed by the Senate which passed measures allowing the praetors to punish riotous spectators. Such were his excesses that Tiberius decided to make him governor of Illyricum the following year, both to give him experience in war and bolster his popularity with the troops - perhaps also to keep him away from the indulgences of city life.

For those reasons, Drusus was sent to Illyricum with proconsular &quot;imperium maius&quot;, and would be governor there from AD 17 to 20. Since Germanicus had left the Rhine in AD 16, the German tribes that formerly fought alongside each other against the Romans had turned on each other. The two major forces in the region, the Marcomanni under king Maroboduus and the Cherusci under Arminius clashed and, after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew to the heart of his kingdom in the forests of Bohemia. Before that, two tribes (the Semnones and Langobardi) had defected to Arminius.

Realizing his situation, Maroboduus requested Roman aid. It had been two years since the Marcommani refused to help the Romans against the forces of Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus&#x27; expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and that it was a good time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force into the heart of the Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.

===Heir to the Principate===

While Drusus was in Illyricum, his adoptive brother Germanicus had died in Syria of illness or poison on 10 October 19. The death of Germanicus made Drusus the new heir, for which Germanicus&#x27; wife Agrippina suspected murder. She believed Tiberius had her husband murdered to allow Drusus to become his heir. Historian Barbara Levick says this is unlikely given the advancement of her son Nero&#x27;s career the following year.

Also on 10 October 19, his wife Livilla had given birth to twin sons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus, whom he named after his adoptive brother. Their birth was celebrated by his father who claimed that never before in the history of Rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as Drusus, and the event was commemorated on the reverse of coins. Tiberius had hoped that Drusus would keep the imperial family together and entrusted him with the guardianship of Germanicus&#x27; sons, Nero and Drusus.

He returned to Rome in December, and was present in 20 March when Agrippina arrived with Germanicus&#x27; ashes. He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of &quot;maiestas&quot; (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies would both be inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the &quot;libellus&quot; (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate the devotion of Drusus for his adoptive brother in a show of &quot;pietas&quot; (piety).

Several changes affected his father&#x27;s reign following the death of Germanicus. In addition to losing his adoptive son and heir, Tiberius lost a friend: Gnaeus Piso, whose family had been close supporters of the principate since the early days of Augustus. The loss of Germanicus and the trial of Piso dealt a significant blow to Tiberius&#x27; popularity, and he came to resent the role of princeps.

===Second consulship===

Maintaining the same interval of three years between Germanicus&#x27; and Drusus&#x27; first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father. The hardship of the last two years on his father had made him reclusive. For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius&#x27; retreat lasted about twenty months.

As consul he took part in a number of Senate debates. His first chance to shine in the Senate came in the dispute between ex-praetor Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbulo at a gladiatorial show, and the incident sparked a debate between the rights of age and the defenders of tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an external force (the &quot;auctoritas&quot; of Drusus)--the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (&quot;lex Oppia&quot;).

Drusus then settled an incident involving the abuse of the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor&#x27;s images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only a member of the imperial family could speak on such a delicate issue. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman &quot;equites&quot;, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of &quot;maiestas&quot;. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius&#x27; authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.

Meanwhile, there had been a rebellion in Gaul led by Sacrovir and Florus, Gauls with Roman citizenship, but the rebellion was settled by Gaius Silius (commander of the legions of the Lower Rhine) without the intervention of Tiberius or Drusus. After praising the loyalty of the legions in Gaul, Tiberius defended the statement he had made in 14, that neither he nor Drusus should have to &quot;quit the capital&quot; in response to every minor revolt in the empire.

Thus the consulship of Drusus was successful, but at the end of the year he fell ill. His illness prompted the equestrian, Clutorius Priscus, believing his life to be in jeopardy, to write his elegy. Priscus had previously written an elegy for Germanicus for which he was paid. He thought that he would be rewarded again, and so recited his elegy before an audience in preparation for Drusus&#x27; death. An unamused informer brought the matter before the Senate, and it was voted that he be executed. His execution was decreed and carried out without first consulting the emperor. This induced Tiberius to introduce a law where the Senate must wait 10 days after such condemnations before making such decrees public as to allow him to learn of their decisions first.

The following year, Tiberius asked the Senate of Rome to grant Drusus &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power), which they responded to elatedly. The Senate decreed statues, shrines, temples, an arch, and other &quot;customary honors&quot; upon the princeps and his son. Thus in the spring of AD 22 Drusus received &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;, a distinction no senator could then aspire to, as the honor was reserved exclusively for the emperor and his immediate successors. Only two men had been honored this way by Augustus—first Marcus Agrippa and then Tiberius himself—but Tiberius had never bestowed the power on Germanicus. It was then that Drusus shared the symbol of supreme power with his father.

===Downfall===
While it was officially Drusus who was the heir to Tiberius, in practice, it was the Praetorian prefect Sejanus who was the second man in the empire. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to strengthen his ties to the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented when the boy accidentally died a few days later of asphyxiation. Regardless, his ambition to further expand his power was clear.

By AD 23, Sejanus had come to exert considerable influence over the emperor. Such was his relationship with the emperor that he was referred to by Tiberius as &quot;Socius Laborum&quot; (&quot;my partner in my toils&quot;). Sejanus&#x27; influence and position allowed him to be elevated to the rank of praetor, a position rarely attained by members of the equestrian order. His supporters in the Senate were given advancement in their offices, and statues were being erected in his honor, such as the one in the Theatre of Pompey.

By this time the enmity between Drusus and Sejanus had reached a critical point: Drusus had struck the prefect with his fist, and openly lamented that &quot;a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor&#x27;s son was alive&quot;. According to Levick, there is nothing to suggest bad relations between the two before this point, especially not as far back as 14, during their expedition to Pannonia. She says, however, it may have been the clash between theatrical &quot;claqueurs&quot; and the Praetorian Guard in 15 that began the quarrel, but not enough is known to say for certain. Of more concern to Drusus was, perhaps, that in 20 his father mentioned Sejanus to the Senate in terms that treated him as his partner in power. For Drusus, the heir of that exact position, this was a legitimate cause for concern. At the time, Tiberius was in his sixties, so there was a realistic possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. In the account of Tacitus, Sejanus began plotting against Drusus in secrecy to secure his position.

After seducing Drusus&#x27; wife Livilla, Sejanus convinced her that he loved her and went as far as to divorce his own wife, Apicata. They involved Livilla&#x27;s physician, Eudemus, whom they met in secret for some time. With the help of Livilla, Drusus was poisoned and died of what passed as natural causes. Cassius Dio says the actions of Sejanus were revealed in a letter by Apicata following his death in 31 October.

==Post mortem==

Unlike Germanicus, Drusus was given a full funeral, and his body was interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus, alongside other deceased members of the imperial family. Like Germanicus, stories of poison abounded, with Sejanus as the murderer. Modern historians like Ronald Syme believe that he may simply have died of illness.

His death not only devastated Tiberius
but also challenged the future of the principate. Tiberius still trusted Sejanus and had no suspicion. Since Drusus&#x27; son was too young, Tiberius adopted his grandchildren by Germanicus, Nero and Drusus, and recommended them to the Senate. Nero was given the office of quaestor five years in advance and was married to Julia Livia, the daughter of Drusus, to combine the families of both possible successors. However, neither would live to succeed Tiberius.

By 26, the emperor had withdrawn from politics altogether and moved to Capri, leaving the management of the empire to Sejanus who then began eliminating other members of the imperial family. In 28/29, Nero was exiled to the island of Ponza as an enemy of the state. Germanicus&#x27; son Drusus was imprisoned within the dungeon under the Imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, where he starved to death not long after. Nero died in exile in 33.

Sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in 31 October, the exact reasons for which remain unclear. On 26 October 31, just eight days after his death, his wife Apicata committed suicide. According to Cassius Dio, she left a message for the emperor: his son had been murdered by his wife Livilla and her lover, Sejanus. The story should be read with caution. Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect and the end of his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, he says it is even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children&#x27;s future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.

The deaths of Germanicus&#x27; oldest sons elevated his third son, Gaius Caesar (Caligula), to successor and he became &quot;princeps&quot; when Tiberius died in AD 37. Drusus&#x27; son Tiberius Gemellus was summoned to Capri by his grandfather Tiberius, where he and Gaius Caligula were made joint heirs. When Caligula assumed power, he made Gemellus his adopted son, but Caligula soon had Gemellus killed for plotting against him.

He features under the name Castor in the novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves, and in its BBC adaptation (in which he was played by Kevin McNally).

He was also portrayed in the 1968 TV series &quot;The Caesars&quot; by William Corderoy.

He is associated with the gourmand Apicius. Under Apicius&#x27; influence he disdained a certain vegetable of the cabbage family, earning a reprimand from Tiberius. Drusus is also recorded as using bitter almonds (five or six at a time) as a prophylactic against drunkenness.

<doc id="608798" wikidata="Q635908" url="?curid=608798" title="List of Major League Baseball single-game home run leaders">
<text>In baseball, a home run occurs when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the &quot;inside-the-park&quot; home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.

Eighteen players have hit four home runs in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game, which writers of &quot;Sporting News&quot; described as &quot;baseball&#x27;s greatest single-game accomplishment&quot;. The most recent to accomplish the feat to date is J. D. Martinez with the Arizona Diamondbacks against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 4, 2017. No player has done this more than once in his career. In the pre-professional era, Lipman Pike also hit five home runs in 1866. No player has ever hit four home runs in a postseason game; that record is three, first accomplished by Babe Ruth in of the 1926 World Series.

According to the Society for American Baseball Research, Oil Cities catcher Jay J. Clarke went 8–8 with eight home runs, a single-game professional record. However, Clarke&#x27;s total is disputed, reported by some newspapers as three homers and eight runs scored, but there is no surviving box score to help confirm or deny his feat.

Bobby Lowe was the first to hit four home runs in a single game, doing so on May 30, 1894, for the Boston Beaneaters. Fans were reportedly so excited that they threw $160 in silver coins ($ today) onto the field after his fourth home run. Of all players to achieve the feat, Lowe hit the fewest career home runs, with a total of 71. Two years after Lowe&#x27;s feat, Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies became the second player to hit four home runs in a game. Two other Phillies players have achieved the feat, Chuck Klein in 1932 and Mike Schmidt in 1976. Two other current franchises, the Atlanta Braves (with three) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (with two), have had multiple four-homer games in their history and share the distinction of having one four-homer game in each city they have called home (for the Braves, Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta; for the Dodgers, Brooklyn and Los Angeles). Five current franchises – the Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and Oakland Athletics – share the record of having surrendered two four-homer games over their histories. Thirteen of the 30 franchises (as of 2021) have achieved at least one four-homer game, and 12 franchises have surrendered at least one. Eleven have never been involved in a four-homer game at all, although only three of these (Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins) date back to before the 1960s expansion era.

Despite Delahanty&#x27;s achievement on July 13, 1896, the Phillies lost to the Chicago Colts, one of only two occasions when a player hit four home runs but was on the losing team. The other such occasion took place in 1986, when Bob Horner had four home runs for the Braves, but the Montreal Expos emerged victorious. Following Delahanty&#x27;s four-home run game in 1896, no other player would accomplish the feat for nearly 36 years, the longest gap between such occurrences. The shortest interval took place in 2002, when Mike Cameron hit his four on May 2, 2002, and Shawn Green repeated the feat 21 days later, on May 23. This was the first time two players had achieved a four-homer game in the same season; this would occur again in 2017 when Scooter Gennett and J. D. Martinez achieved the feat in June and September respectively. Cameron was also the first and only player to hit four solo home runs in one game, accounting for the minimum of 4 RBIs when accomplishing the feat. When Martinez struck his four home runs for the Arizona Diamondbacks against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he became the first player with a four-homer game to hit more homers than his opponents gained base hits.

These games have resulted in other MLB single-game records due to the extreme offensive performance. Mark Whiten tied Jim Bottomley for the most runs batted in in a single game with 12 in his four-homer game. Shawn Green hit a double and a single along with his four home runs for 19 total bases, an MLB record. It surpassed Joe Adcock&#x27;s mark of 18, which also came from a four-homer game. Carlos Delgado is the only player to make four plate appearances in a game and hit a home run each time. Warren Spahn pitched the ball which Gil Hodges hit for the first of his four, the only Hall of Fame pitcher faced during a four-home-run game. Of the 14 players eligible for the Hall of Fame who have hit four home runs in a game, six have been elected. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons and have been either retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave three players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons and one (Seerey) who did not play 10 seasons in MLB.

<text>Alexander Moiseevich Gorodnitsky (born March 20, 1933) is a Soviet and Russian bard and poet.

He is the author of over 60 books, poems, songs, and other literary works. His song &quot;Atlantes Hold the Heavens&quot; is the official anthem of the Hermitage Museum and considered as unofficial anthem of Saint Petersburg.

Professionally, he is a geologist and oceanographer. Gorodnitsky is an author of over 250 scientific publications on geophysics and tectonics of ocean bottom.

Asteroid No. 5988 and a pass in the Sayan Mountains were named after Alexander Gorodnitsky.

==Early life==
Gorodnitsky was born on 20 March 1933 in Leningrad to a Russian Jewish family originated from Mogilev. His father — Moisey Afroimovich Gorodnitsky (1908–1986) — was an engineer who worked in the printing industry. His mother — Rakhil Moiseevna Gorodnitskaya (1908–1981), — in her youth, was a school maths teacher, then worked as corrector and editor of sailing directions.

Gorodnitsky survived the Siege of Leningrad during Second World War. In 1951, he graduated from high school №254 and entered the Faculty of Geophysics of the Leningrad Mining Institute, which he graduated in 1957 with specialist degree.

== Academic career ==
From 1957 until 1972 Gorodnitsky worked in the Research institute for Geology of Arctic (its current name is &quot;All-Russian Research Institute for Geology and Mineral Resources of the World Ocean named after academician I.S. Gramberg&quot;). He has participated in many geological expeditions. Gorodnitsky is one of the discoverers of the Igarskoye copper deposit (1962).

Since 1962, he has participated in maritime geophysical expeditions. Gorodnitsky is one of the authors of new ocean&#x27;s electric field measurement method (1967). In collaboration with V.D. Fedorov and A.N. Paramonov he discovered the bioelectric effect of phytoplankton (1967). In 1968, he became a Candidate of Sciences (thesis on &quot;The application of magnetometry and electrometry for the ocean bottom exploration&quot;).

From 1969 until 1972 Gorodnitsky headed the Laboratory of Marine Geophysics of the Research institute for Geology of Arctic. In 1972, Gorodnitsky moved from Leningrad to Moscow and started working for the Research Institute of Oceanology named after P.P. Shirshov as a principal researcher. In 1982, he became a Doctor of Sciences in geological and mineralogical sciences (thesis on &quot;The structure of oceanic lithosphere and underwater mountain building&quot;). In 1991, Gorodnitsky was given the highest academic rank of the professor. He authored original model of petromagnetic structure of the Mid-ocean ridge zones (1997).

He teaches in the State University of the naukograd Dubna as visiting professor. He was awarded the honorary title of &quot;Merited figure of sciences of Russian Federation&quot; (2005).

Gorodnitsky was at the drifting station at the North Pole (1964) and in Antarctica (1973). In 1982 and 1984, he took part in expeditions devoted to the search for the legendary Atlantis at the Ampère Seamount in the North Atlantic.

Gorodnitsky&#x27;s research included numerous dives on bathyscaphes, starting from Hermit Atoll in Papua New Guinea in 1978. In 1988, during an expedition on the research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in the North Atlantic on the deep-sea apparatus Mir (submersible), he dived to a depth of 4.5 kilometers.

== Poet and singer-songwriter ==

Gorodnitsky&#x27;s first songs appeared during his expedition in 1953. For a long time his songs were distributed via samizdat tape recordings, and often performed by other singers. Like Alexander Galich, and unlike other bards, Gorodnitsky composed and sang his songs a cappella for several decades; later, he started playing the guitar. Most of his songs are based on his personal experiences. In concert, he usually performs with a professional guitarist accompanying him.

In 1972, Alexander Gorodnitsky was admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers on the recommendations of famous poets Boris Slutsky, David Samoilov, and Vadim Shefner.

In the opinion of literary critics:
&quot;The art of Alexander Gorodnitsky is definitely a most remarkable phenomenon of both guitar poetry and the wider Russian literary culture of the 20th century. Having undergone a nearly 50-year-long evolution, it now presents an organic synthesis of the poetic word with profound philosophical, historical, and scientific intuition to embody in its multi-genre creative system the essential qualities of the modern worldview&quot;.

Poems and songs by Alexander Gorodnitsky have been translated into English, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Spanish, German, Polish, French, Czech and other languages. They have also been included in school curricula.

Gorodnitsky is acknowledged to be one of the founders of the bard songs genre in Soviet Union. His most popular songs are following: &quot;Atlantes Hold the Heavens&quot;, &quot;Near the Pillars of Hercules&quot;, &quot;To the mainland&quot;, &quot;Blue sky above Canada&quot;, &quot;French ambassador&#x27;s wife&quot;, &quot;Snow&quot;, &quot;Riffles&quot;, &quot;The song of polar pilots&quot;.

Many of Alexander Gorodnitsky poems and songs published in post-Soviet period are dedicated to Germany: &quot;Stuttgart&quot; (1998), &quot;Neva-Elbe&quot; (2000), &quot;German castles&quot; (2003), &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach&quot; (2018), &quot;Lüneburg&quot; (2019) and others.

Gorodnitsky is a member of the Union of Writers of Russia and PEN International. Also he is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Fazil Iskander International Literary Award. He was awarded the honorary title of &quot;Merited figure of arts of Russian Federation&quot; (2013).

== Family ==
Gorodnitsky has a son from first wife, a Vladimir (born 1955), who has been living in Israel since 1984.

His second wife was Anna Nal (28 September 1942 - 11 September 2017), professional interpreter/translator. The marriage was childless.

==Political views and social activity==
Gorodnitsky opposed the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and had signed the open letter against war, political self-isolation of Russia, restoration of totalitarianism.

<doc id="608800" wikidata="Q4943842" url="?curid=608800" title="Boot money">
<text>Boot money refers to money paid privately or anonymously to amateur athletes, often to circumvent laws or league regulations prohibiting athlete compensation. It can be paid as an incentive to win or as a reward for a good performance, but especially in more recent times can involve a company rewarding players for using their apparel or products. This phenomenon has been found in amateur sports for centuries. The term &quot;boot money&quot; became popularised in the late 1880s when British football leagues prohibited professionalism, but it was not unusual for players to find a half crown (two shillings and sixpence) in their boots after a game (worth around £66 in 2009, calculated by the rise in average earnings). Before the breaking of the £20 wage-cap by Johnny Haynes, many British football players received ciphered boot money, by fans paying for entrance but not being counted in an official match attendance. This method was also a way of escaping tax deductions too.

==Scandals==
In 1982, Adidas was paying British Olympic athletes to wear their gear. The main person involved in the scandal was Horst Dassler.

A scandal broke out over payments alleged to have been made to some Welsh rugby union internationals during the 1970s. Many other ways were found to work around the laws of rugby union amateurism.

<text>The International Lutheran Council (ILC) is a worldwide association of confessional Lutheran denominations. Member bodies of the ILC hold &quot;an unconditional commitment to the Holy Scriptures as the inspired and infallible Word of God and to the Lutheran Confessions contained in the Book of Concord as the true and faithful exposition of the Word of God.&quot; The member church bodies are not required to be in church-fellowship with one another, though many of them are.

The organization was constituted in 1993 at a council held in Antigua, Guatemala, although it traces its roots back to theological conferences held in various locations during the 1950s and 1960s. It is to be distinguished from the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference.

The council has 59 participating churches as of 2022. Among its larger members are the Malagasy Lutheran Church, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil, and the Lutheran Church – Canada. Altogether, approximately 7,150,000 adherents belong to ILC member churches.

The council&#x27;s chairman is Bishop Juhana Pohjola of the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland. The executive secretary is Albert B. Collver III of the LCMS. Delegates to the ILC meet every two years.

The organization has not accepted the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, an agreement reached by the Catholic Church&#x27;s Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (PCPCU) and the Lutheran World Federation, in 1999. However, the ILC has been involved in dialogue with the PCPCU, with a final report released on 30 November 2021.

==History==
The origins of the ILC go back to a meeting at Uelzen, Germany, in July 1952 by Lutherans who were not happy with the theological course being taken by the Lutheran World Federation. Among the participants were delegates from the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod who had been observers at the LWF assembly in Hannover. Other delegates were present from churches affiliated with the LCMS from Germany, Australia, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Two further meetings were held, in Oakland, California, in 1958 and in Cambridge, England, in August 1963. At the latter meeting it was decided to create a permanent organization, a &quot;Continuation Committee&quot;, to act for the group in between meetings, which were now dubbed International Lutheran Theological Conferences. The committee was also tasked with publishing a theological journal and a committee bulletin, and with facilitating exchanges of pastors, theological professors, and students. However, the meeting explicitly disclaimed it was founding a group in opposition to the LWF.
Five more &quot;theological conferences&quot; were held until the name was shortened to International Lutheran Conference at the Eighth Conference in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Resolutions passed during this period described the ILC as a partnership, forum, or &quot;group of independent Lutheran churches&quot;. At the Fifteenth Conference in Antigua, Guatemala, the group decided on creating a more formal structure as an association of churches and adopted a set of &quot;Guiding Principles&quot; that would serve as a constitution and theological point of reference. The &quot;Continuation Committee&quot; was replaced by an &quot;Executive Council&quot;.
At the 2018 World Conference meeting, held in Antwerp, Belgium, on 25–26 September 2018, the ILC voted to admit 17 new church bodies, 11 as full members and 6 as associate members. This increased the church members of ILC to 54 and their faithful to 7.15 million members.
At the 2022 World Conference meeting, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia was accepted as a full member. It had already been accepted as an observer member in February 2022.

==World Conferences==

The World Conference of the International Lutheran Council is an official meeting ordinarily held every three years. They are hosted by a church body whose invitation is accepted in the previous conference.

*Seoul (South Korea) 2009 (23rd World Conference)

At the 23rd conference, the association unanimously adopted the statement &quot;Same-Gender Relationships and the Church&quot;, which defined the practice of homosexuality as a sin.

*Toronto (Canada) 2012 (24th World Conference)
*Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2015 (25th World Conference)
*Antwerp (Belgium) 2018 (26th World Conference)

At the 26th conference, the association welcomed seventeen new church bodies into membership (eleven were received as full members and six as observer members) representing approximately 4.15 million Lutherans across the globe. Their addition more than doubles the number of Lutherans worldwide associated with the ILC, bringing the total to approximately 7.15 million members and bringing the total number of church bodies holding membership in the International Lutheran Council to 54.

<text>The or NRK (based on its Romaji initials) is a confessional Lutheran denomination in Japan. It currently has approximately 766 baptized members in 35 congregations nationwide.

The current chairman of the NRK is Rev. Shinri Emoto.

==History==

During the occupation of Japan by the Allied forces after the Second World War, several US Army chaplains affiliated with the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS) were serving the local population. Discussions were held with representatives from the Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church (JELC) as well as other churches on mission work in post-war Japan. With the information gathered, the LCMS came to the conclusion that they should send missionaries to northern Japan where the Lutheran presence was scarce in order to avoid redundancies among the various Lutheran churches and missions operating in Japan and a resolution was adopted accordingly.

In September 1948, the LCMS installed the first missionary to Japan and declared the start of the Japan Mission, in accordance with the resolution adopted. With the passing of the in 1950 legalising commercial and private broadcasting, &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; radio program started broadcasting in 1951.

The NRK was officially recognised as a religious body in Japan in 1953. Cooperation with the JELC remained close and in the same year, the NRK-established School of Theology was merged with JELC&#x27;s Lutheran Theological Seminary. In 1966, both the NRK and the JELC came into full communion with the adoption of the Establishment of Pulpit and Altar Fellowship and the Agreement on Cooperation in Theological Education agreements. This opened the door for the NRK&#x27;s participation in activities organised by the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). In 1968, the self-governing NRK was established and it became self-supporting in 1976.

In 1997, the NRK sent a delegation to the LWF&#x27;s Assembly in Hong Kong and became an associate member of the LWF in 1999. Prior to that, the NRK had already been a full member of the confessional International Lutheran Council that was constituted in 1993.

In 2021, the NRK amended its constitution to allow women to be ordained as pastors. As a result of that and other differences in doctrinal issues, the LCMS, at its 2023 convention, declared that it was no longer in fellowship with the NRK.

==Structure and organization==

The NRK is structured with a congregational polity.

==Ministries==

Education is emphasized as a means of communicating the Gospel. Accordingly, the NRK operates Urawa Lutheran School in Urawa and Holy Hope School in Hannō. The NRK also operates the Japan Lutheran College in cooperation with the JELC and several members of the NRK sit on the college&#x27;s board of regents. The NRK also operates eleven kindergartens, four preschools, an elementary school, two middle schools, two secondary schools, and a Japanese and English Language Institute (both as the Lutheran Language Institute).

The Volunteer Youth Ministry (VYM) program for lay missionaries through LCMS World Mission who committed themselves for 2½ years in ministry serving as English language teachers. Most of the volunteers were young college graduates.

==Affiliations and cooperation==

===Ecumenism===

The NRK is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the National Christian Council in Japan, the Christian Conference of Asia or the World Council of Churches. However, the NRK is a full member of the International Lutheran Council as well as an associate member of the Lutheran World Federation.

===Relationship with other Lutheran churches===

The work of Lutheran missionaries resulted in the establishment of five major Lutheran church bodies and a number of smaller ones, with a total membership of approximately 30,000. The largest of these, with about 20,000 members, is the JELC. Other Lutheran churches include the Kinki Evangelical Lutheran Church, the West Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Japan Lutheran Brethren Church, the Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Fellowship Deaconry Evangelical Church (Marburger Mission).

Cooperation among the various Lutheran churches in Japan is common, particularly with respect to outreach ministries. Church planting plans are mutually shared in order to avoid duplications. Most of the Lutheran churches have also joined together to form the , which publishes Christian books and materials; one notable endeavor being in the publication of a common Lutheran hymnal.

The NRK and the JELC sponsor a joint seminary in Tokyo, the Japan Lutheran Theological Seminary while the other Lutheran seminary in Kobe is sponsored by the Kinki Evangelical Lutheran Church and the West Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church.

<text>Patrick Nally (born 1947) is a British entrepreneur and specialist consultant. He is widely acknowledged as the &#x27;Founding Father&#x27; of modern sports marketing and a principal pioneer of today&#x27;s sports business industry.

==Early life==
Born in 1947 to parents who met while serving in the Royal Navy, Nally grew up in Clapham, south London, the youngest of three children born in consecutive years. A chess champion at Spencer Park School in Wandsworth, he gravitated towards his parents&#x27; professions of journalism and public relations, beginning his career in business as a messenger boy at Notley Advertising before joining the Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company advertising agency as a junior accounts executive. His mother Margaret Nally, who was the first female chair of the National Union of Journalists&#x27; Press &amp; P.R. department and the first female President of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), is commemorated each year at a Memorial Lecture given at Britain&#x27;s House of Lords.

==West Nally==
Having been introduced to the journalist, BBC presenter and sports commentator Peter West in 1969, Nally founded the West Nally Group the following year as a public relations agency with a specialised sporting events mandate. With West as chairman, and managing director Nally its driving force, the company would go on to redefine the sports business industry by pioneering the offering to &#x27;blue chip&#x27; companies of exclusive, off-the-shelf packages of sponsorship rights to the world&#x27;s largest sports tournaments on behalf of the world&#x27;s leading sports federations. Early successes included securing investment to establish the Masters in snooker, the Squash World Open, and an annual one-day cricket competition which would run for three decades in the UK. In 1976, on brokering an agreement to sponsor the FIFA World Cup, the company assured its reputation as a leading innovator within the expanding sports marketing field. Employing over 400 staff in 14 offices across 11 countries in its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, West Nally has served as partner to, among others, the International Olympic Committee, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the Davis Cup and Federation Cup in tennis, the Hockey World Cup, the International Swimming Federation (FINA), the International Rowing Federation (FISA), the International Cycling Union (UCI) and the FIS World Ski Cup. The company helped secure the financial foundations of the first London Marathon, held in 1981, before playing an instrumental role in the inception of the International Association of Athletics Federations&#x27; Track and Field Program and in initiating the World Athletics Championships, first held in Helsinki in 1983. For the International Rugby Board (IRB), West Nally helped to commercially package and launch the Rugby World Cup, first held in 1987 in Australia and New Zealand. Known within the industry as the &#x27;university of sports marketing&#x27; on account of its comprehensive training procedures responsible for cultivating a generation of leading sports business executives, the company&#x27;s founder Patrick Nally was in 1988 described by &quot;Marketing&quot; magazine, along with Adidas owner Horst Dassler and IMG founder Mark McCormack, as one of the &quot;three godfathers of sport&quot; who at one time, between them, &quot;controlled the commercial destinies of almost every major sports event in the world&quot;. Credited with first perceiving and harnessing sport&#x27;s unique potential as a medium for global brand communication, Nally is today alternatively hailed as &quot;the &#x27;Founding Father&#x27; of sports marketing&quot;, &quot;the father of modern sports marketing&quot;, &quot;the founding father of the sports business industry&quot;, &quot;the godfather of sports sponsorship&quot; and the &#x27;Dean&#x27; of the &#x27;Sports Marketing University&#x27;. In 2009, his pioneer status within the industry was recognised with a nomination in the &#x27;Outstanding Contribution&#x27; category at &quot;SportBusiness Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual Sports Event Management Awards.

===Relationship with FIFA===
After playing an instrumental role in João Havelange&#x27;s successful 1974 bid for the Presidency of FIFA, Nally set out to fulfil the campaign&#x27;s election promise to expand the federation&#x27;s global development programme. Having restructured FIFA&#x27;s rules and regulations and modernised its commercial structure, Nally conceived and designed the FIFA World Youth Championship, first held in Tunisia in 1977, for which he secured sponsorship from the Coca-Cola Company. The landmark agreement that followed, with which Coca-Cola became the primary sponsor of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, would help set the cast for the future development of soccer globally, as the relationship between the FIFA World Cup and Coca-Cola matured to produce what has been described as &quot;the biggest, most sustained corporate sponsorship programme in the world&quot;. Signed by West Nally in 1976, the original agreement is today considered a watershed moment within the evolution of the sports business industry. Nally himself has described it as &quot;the best deal&quot; he ever made.

====The ‘InterSoccer4’ Program====
After the 1978 World Cup, West Nally was awarded rights to all FIFA and UEFA competitions, including the European Cup Final, the European Nations Cup and the World Champions&#x27; Gold Cup, which the agency marketed together in a four-year package called the &#x27;InterSoccer4&#x27;. Guaranteeing sponsors category exclusivity, advertising exposure, tickets and VIP access, after its successful implementation in the lead-up to the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the &#x27;InterSoccer&#x27; model rapidly became the new industry standard by which sponsorship rights to international sporting events were administered. Signalling what has been called &quot;sport&#x27;s Big Bang Moment&quot;, the InterSoccer program&#x27;s offer of a package of rights to multiple tournaments over several years is still today widely emulated across the sports business industry. According to &quot;SportBusiness International magazine&quot;, the concept became &quot;the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of sports marketing for the next 20 years&quot;, confirming Patrick Nally as &quot;in many respects, the man who made the World Cup what it is today&quot;. While the world&#x27;s largest sports tournament grew to signify a multi-billion dollar sponsorship proposition, Nally oversaw the InterSoccer program&#x27;s evolution through the 1986 and 1990 competitions, held respectively in Mexico and Italy, before helping to establish a dedicated company to host the 1994 World Cup in the US.

====Support for Japan&#x27;s 2022 World Cup Bid====
In 2009, Nally teamed with the organising committee of Japan&#x27;s 2022 World Cup bid which, on 2 December 2010 in a ceremony in Zürich was finally awarded to Qatar. Based around the slogan &#x27;208 smiles&#x27;, the centerpiece of the Japanese offering was a proposal to broadcast the tournament via 360-degree, 3D free viewpoint television to over 400 fan sites across FIFA&#x27;s 208 member-nations. In his vocal support for the innovative, technology-driven offering which would have brought the World Cup to Asia for the second time in two decades, Nally openly criticised FIFA for adhering to a development model he had himself been instrumental in originating. &quot;It was almost part of our development programme brief to take it to Asia, as it was to take it to Africa,&quot; he told &quot;SportsPro Magazine&quot; in the lead-up to the decision:

In the same article, Nally further admitted that he views the introduction of goal-line technology to the World Cup as all but &quot;an inevitability&quot;.

===Involvement with the International Olympic Committee===
Having established relationships with the British and Australian Olympic Associations in the late 1970s, Nally began working with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as an advisor to the organising committee of the 1980 Summer Games held in Moscow. Afterwards, he played a key role in laying the commercial foundations of the future of the Olympic Movement by adapting the InterSoccer program he&#x27;d devised for FIFA to the Olympic Games. The result was a package combining the rights of the IOC&#x27;s organising committees and those of the national Olympic committees in one sponsorship deal. Initially rolled out for the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, the concept would culminate the following year in the launch of the IOC&#x27;s innovative TOP (The Olympic Partners) program.

====Foundation of SportAccord====
Through his decades-long association with the IOC and its longtime partner, the Japanese advertising and sponsorship agency Dentsu Incorporated, Nally has, over the course of his career, worked with an array of international Olympic and non-Olympic federations, helping them to ensure their commercial viability while also promoting enhanced global co-operation across the sporting world. His involvement with the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) dates from 1976 when he was instrumental in re-establishing the organisation and securing for it a permanent home in Monte Carlo. He later devised the GAISF Calendar to assist international sports federations in avoiding conflicting event schedules.

====Campaigns on behalf of new Olympic Sports====
Having secured sponsorship for numerous international multi-sports tournaments over the years, including the 1979 Pan American Games held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the 1986 and 1990 Commonwealth Games held respectively in Edinburgh and Auckland, West Nally has also served non-Olympic world class sports federations with strategic advice, sponsorship procurement and by expanding their profiles at both single and multi-sports international championships. Of the 23 sports featured at the second quadrennial World Games, which West Nally was instrumental in staging across eight London venues in 1985, taekwondo would be introduced at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, netball would receive Olympic recognition within a decade and korfball would twice feature as a demonstration sport at the Summer Olympics. Having served the International Federation of Poker (IFP) since its foundation in Lausanne in April 2009, West Nally helped secure the federation membership within the International Mind Sports Association (IMSA) in April 2010.

===Support for Sports Business Education===
A respected authority on all aspects of sports marketing and sponsorship, Nally has since 2006 lectured as a Touring Fellow of the University of Manchester&#x27;s World Academy of Sport and has, since March 2010, written a monthly column advising on sponsorship-related matters for the UK-based, sports business trade publication &quot;Platform&quot;. An impassioned advocate of the role of education within sport, he has advised UNESCO on the use of sport as a showcase to attract private sector support for educational and cultural programs, and has long been a vocal proponent of degree-based education tailored specifically to the sports business industry. In 2010 Nally became the Academic Director of IE Business School&#x27;s Sports Management master&#x27;s degree course.

====Views on the Impact of New Media on the Sports Business Industry====
Addressing the fourth annual Sports Marketing 360 conference in London in October 2010, Nally declared: “Conventional advertising is dead and conventional sports sponsorship is dead. The world is digital.” Having, for much of his career, seen the sports business come increasingly to be dominated by large advertising, marketing and talent representation agencies, Nally is outspoken in his anticipation of a future in which new media has replaced conventional controlling interests. “The era of dominant agencies is gone,” he told &quot;SportBusiness Magazine&quot; in 2003:


As with Japan&#x27;s 2022 World Cup bid, Nally is an ardent supporter of non-traditional sponsorship methods that enhance the immediacy of sport as live action experience. “Sport has a tremendous ability to galvanise people. It is instant drama and instant theatre and it makes for the perfect live events,” he has said. “People want to be part of the event, they want instant connectivity and instant access.” As live events play an ever more crucial role in marketing, Nally argues that new media can provide powerful opportunities to revolutionise traditional methods of activating brand-connection within any sport&#x27;s audience. Recalling his early success in transforming the ways in which sports federations market their product to the world, in a 2003 interview Nally lamented what he saw as the industry&#x27;s failure to respond sufficiently to the increasing needs of sponsors within a rapidly evolving media marketplace: “The creation of the product was what fascinated me and it fascinates me that it hasn’t really gone on much further,” he avowed, “but it could.”

===Entertainment===
Throughout his career, Nally has consulted on a range of aspects pertaining to sport as collective, immediate, live action experience, from stadia environment and venue design to the technological enhancement of audience appreciation systems. He helped popularise magazine-style sports TV programming, alongside pioneering the use of big screen technology within stadia by introducing Mitsubishi &#x27;Diamond Vision&#x27; screens to Wembley Stadium in 1984. A decade later, he was involved in the planning stages of the watershed redevelopment of England&#x27;s national stadium which reopened after a four-year reconstruction in March 2007. Alongside his sports marketing activities, Nally has also secured sponsorship for major music events including The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1982 European Tour, the David Bowie Serious Moonlight Tour, Duran Duran&#x27;s 1984 UK Tour, Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1986 series of Anniversary Concerts sponsored by Swiss watchmaker Ebel, The Three Tenors&#x27; 1990 concert in Rome, and the 2007 Tribute Concert to Maria Callas at the Acropolis. In addition to serving diverse companies in music, leisure and live entertainment, Nally has himself produced several theatrical musicals, notably &quot;Casper: The Musical&quot; based on the animated cartoon series Casper the Friendly Ghost, which ran at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London&#x27;s West End from 1999 to 2000, and &quot;Theatre of Dreams&quot;, chronicling the history of Manchester United from the emergence of the Busby Babes to the Munich air disaster to the arrival of Alex Ferguson, which premiered in 2001 at Manchester&#x27;s Bridgewater Hall and was a financial disaster.

<doc id="608835" wikidata="Q5632347" url="?curid=608835" title="HMS Euryalus (F15)">
<text>HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; (F15) was a of the Royal Navy (RN). Like the rest of the class, &quot;Euryalus&quot; was named after a figure of mythology. &quot;Euryalus&quot; was built by Scotts Shipbuilders of Greenock. &quot;Euryalus&quot; was launched on 6 June 1963, and commissioned on 16 September 1964.

This &quot;Euryalus&quot; was the sixth of the name and had a strong liaison with the Lancashire Fusiliers, whose motto (&quot;Omnia Audax&quot;) she bore from the 4th &quot;Euryalus&quot; landing its 1st Battalion at W Beach, Gallipoli, where the Regiment &quot;won six Victoria Crosses before breakfast&quot;.

==Service history==
===1964–1969===
On commissioning &quot;Euryalus&quot; became Leader of the 26th Escort Squadron which was based in the Far East. While based in the Far East, &quot;Euryalus&quot; took part in Indonesian Confrontation, with &quot;Euryalus&quot; having few incidents during her participation in the conflict, mainly patrolling the waters around Borneo.

In 1966 &quot;Euryalus&quot; recommissioned and went into refit in Devonport. In April 1967, after work up, she joined &quot;STANAVFORLANT&quot;, visiting Norway (Bodø and Tromsø), Sweden (Stockholm), Iceland, Newport, Rhode Island, Canada (Halifax for the Canadian Centennial), Montreal for Expo 67, Quebec and St John&#x27;s Newfoundland. She deployed to the Far East in December 1967 as Leader of the 1st Frigate Squadron and spent Christmas in Simonstown (South Africa).

Early in 1968 she carried out a six-week Beira Patrol followed by a week on Internal Security duty in Mauritius which was approaching independence, which had caused the different racial groups there to jostle violently for position. This deployment to the Far East continued with visits to Sydney, Auckland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tsuruga and Yokohama in Japan, and Hong Kong, Indonesia, Sabah and Singapore before returning home in December 1968 via Auckland, Fiji, Pearl Harbor, San Diego and the Panama Canal.

In 1969, &quot;Euryalus&quot; again returned to the Far East, which also had a substantial Royal Navy presence at the time.

===1970–1979===

In 1970, &quot;Euryalus&quot; became the Gibraltar guard ship, a role that a number of &quot;Leanders&quot; performed. In 1972, &quot;Euryalus&quot; undertook a Beira Patrol, designed to prevent oil reaching Rhodesia via Mozambique. The following year, &quot;Euryalus&quot; began her modernisation at Devonport Dockyard, which included the removal of her twin 4.5-in gun to accommodate the Australian-designed Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile system. The modernisation was completed in 1976.

In 1977, the highlight of the year was the taking part in June of the Fleet Review of the Royal Navy, in celebration of HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. She was positioned in the middle of her sister-ships and . 
In 1978, &quot;Euryalus&quot; was a member of the 2nd Frigate Squadron (F2) more commonly known as the Portland Training Squadron, spending most of her time in and around Portland Naval base. She took part in various exercises, including the dreaded &quot;Thursday War&quot;, helping to train warships and auxiliaries of the Royal and Foreign navies as part of maintaining their operational effectiveness. However it was not all work and no play as she carried out visits to Bayonne in France, Aalborg in Denmark, and a &quot;Meet the Navy&quot; visit to her adopted town of South Shields where she took part in the activities to commemorate the wartime exploits of , the highlight of which was a visit by Earl Mountbatten of Burma.

===1980–1989===
In 1981, &quot;Euryalus&quot; undertook a Middle East patrol during the tense times in that region, specifically the Iran–Iraq War which had begun the previous year. In 1982, &quot;Euryalus&quot;, along with her sister-ship , came to the aid of the Portuguese vessel MV &quot;Ave Maria&quot; which was ablaze off the Essex coast, rescuing 45 people.

In February 1984, &quot;Euryalus&quot; joined the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a NATO multi-national squadron, relieving the destroyer . In 1986, &quot;Euryalus&quot; became the leader of the 1st Frigate Squadron. &quot;Euryalus&quot; decommissioned on 31 March 1989 and was bought by Devonport Management Limited with the intention of then selling her to a foreign navy, but this was not to be, and in 1990, &quot;Euryalus&quot; was sold for scrap and broken up at Millom in Cumbria alongside HMS &quot;Ajax&quot;.

<text>Abuyog (IPA: ), officially the Municipality of Abuyog, (; ; ), is a first class municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 61,216 people.

Facing Leyte Gulf out into the Philippine Sea, it is the largest town on the island of Leyte in terms of land area. It is bordered to the north by Javier, to the west by Mahaplag and Baybay, and to the south by Silago, located in Southern Leyte.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1588, likely due to the mismanagement by the incumbent encomendero, the local inhabitants revolted and killed him. Captain Juan Esguerra dispatched a punitive force to punish the assassins of the encomendero. In 1613, the town was raided and plundered by the Sanguiles and Caragas.

In 1655, the Jesuits established Abuyog as their second mission post, with Dagami serving as the center. In 1716, the town and parish were officially founded under the patronage of Saint Francis Xavier, the Apostle of the Indies. The Augustinians took over in 1768, continuing the work of Fathers Jose Herrera and Cipriano Barbasan. In 1843, the town was entrusted to the Franciscan Order, with Fr. Santiago Malonda becoming its first Franciscan parish priest. A horse path connecting Abuyog and Dulag was opened in 1851.

The early captains were Galza, Foran, Nicolas Mandia, Faustino Remanes, Prudencio Remanes, Felipe Costin, Ciriaco Costin, Eulalio Brillo, and Vicente Tiaoson. Eulalio Brillo became president in 1896–1899 while Nazario Tupa took office in 1900. Eugenio Villote finished Tupa&#x27;s term. From 1901 to 1906, pulahan attacks occurred, with one leader of which was Faustino Ablen. The municipal building was razed. Ex-Captain Eugenio Villote, Pedro Gonazaga, and two other policemen were killed in the encounter.

=== Electoral management ===
In the electoral division made by the Philippine Assembly, Abuyog was placed in the third district of Leyte. During the Commonwealth regime, Abuyog was transferred to the fourth district. During these periods, the town was under the administration of Arturo Brillo, Vicente Brillante, Basilio Adolfo (two terms), Antero Brillo and Ricardo Collantes (three terms). In 1940, Pedro Gallego was elected mayor and served until July 3, 1946. Mayor Pedro Remanes Gallego was the only mayor of Leyte province who did not surrender to the Japanese forces. On July 4, 1946, Catalino Landia was appointed mayor. He was re-elected for three terms.

Abuyog inaugurated the first passenger bus service in 1925. In 1936, the vice-president Sergio Osmeña inaugurated the Baybay–Abuyog road, which linked the eastern and western coasts of Leyte.

=== Japanese occupation ===
At the outbreak of World War II, Abuyog became a Japanese occupied area. Pedro Gallego retreated to the mountains to lead the guerrilla resistance. His wife, Ignacia Regis Gallego, organised the non-combatant Auxiliary Forces. On October 13, 1942, the Japanese abandoned the town due to guerrilla pressure. They came back on November 26, 1943, yet they suffered heavy losses in the hands of the guerrillas. From December 26–31, the XXIV Corps of the United States opened the Palompon–Libungao road. The 77th Infantry Division led the charge to secure the road, facing resistance from the Japanese 5th Regiment.

On July 14, 1944, when the submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; landed in Barrio San Roque, Mayor Gallego provided the logistics (manpower, bamboo rafts, transport, lookouts) to Colonel Ruperto Kangleon (the head of Leyte Resistance Movement) to unload 72 tons of automatic weapons (Thompson submachine guns and other rapid fires like carbine and M1 Garand guns), ammunition, food and propaganda materials for Leyte and Samar guerrillas.

Kangleon tipped the naval officers of &quot;Nautilus&quot; on the locations of Japanese fortifications in Leyte province. The local guerrillas of Abuyog used the automatic weapons to repeatedly ambush the Japanese forces. When the American fleet under General Douglas MacArthur was sighted off Leyte Gulf, Japanese forces left Abuyog before the landing of Allied Forces, which included the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary military units. After liberation, elementary school education was resumed on December 4, 1944, under the supervision of the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU).

The Church of St. Francis Xavier was first built with nipa, wood and bamboo in 1718 by the Jesuits. Fr. José Herrera and Cipriano Barbasan restored the church and convent, as well as the school and Casa Real. The Augustinians took over the church&#x27;s supervision in 1768 after it was rebuilt. The church&#x27;s design was changed in 1781 to conform with the architecture of the Roman Renaissance. A more durable church and convent of masonry was later built, with a galvanized iron roof and wooden floor. In 1965, the church was renovated when an extension was built at the center of the church through the effort of Msgr. Luis D. Caintic who also facilitated the construction of the new bell tower.

<text>Inuvialuktun (part of &quot;Western Canadian Inuit&quot; / &quot;Inuktitut&quot; / &quot;Inuktut&quot; / &quot;Inuktun&quot;) comprises several Inuit language varieties spoken in the northern Northwest Territories by Canadian Inuit who call themselves &quot;Inuvialuit&quot;. Some dialects and sub-dialects are also spoken in Nunavut.

== Distribution and varieties ==

Inuvialuktun is spoken by the Inuit of the Mackenzie River delta, Banks Island, part of Victoria Island and the Arctic Ocean coast of the Northwest Territories – the lands of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. It was traditionally subsumed under a broader &quot;Inuktitut&quot;. Rather than a coherent language, Inuvialuktun is a politically motivated grouping of three quite distinct and separate varieties. It consists of &quot;Sallirmiutun&quot; (formerly Siglitun; Inuvialuktun proper), the &quot;Kangiryuarmiutun&quot; dialect of Inuinnaqtun on Victoria Island in the East and the &quot;Uummarmiutun&quot; dialect of Iñupiaq around Inuvik and Aklavik in the West.

Inuvialuktun, Inuinnaqtun and Inuktitut constitute three of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories. Inuinnaqtun is also official alongside Inuktitut in Nunavut.

The Inuvialuktun dialects are seriously endangered, as English has in recent years become the common language of the community. Surveys of Inuktitut usage in the NWT vary, but all agree that usage is not vigorous. According to Statistics Canada&#x27;s 2016 Census 680 (22%) of the 3,110 Inuvialuit speak any form of Inuktitut, and 550 (18%) use it at home. Considering the large number of non-Inuit living in Inuvialuit areas and the lack of a single common dialect among the already reduced number of speakers, the future of the Inuit language in the NWT appears bleak.
== History ==
Before the 20th century, the Inuvialuit Settlement Region was primarily inhabited by &quot;Siglit&quot; Inuit, who spoke Siglitun, but in the second half of the 19th century, their numbers were dramatically reduced by the introduction of new diseases. Inuit from Alaska moved into traditionally Siglit areas in the 1910s and 1920s, enticed in part by renewed demand for furs from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. These Inuit are called &quot;Uummarmiut&quot; – which means &quot;people of the green trees&quot; – in reference to their settlements near the tree line. Originally, there was an intense dislike between the Siglit and the Uummarmiut, but these differences have faded over the years, and the two communities are thoroughly intermixed these days.

==Phonology==

The phonology of Inuvialuktun and other Inuit languages can be found at Inuit phonology.
Most Inuit languages have fifteen consonants and three vowel qualities (with phonemic length distinctions for each). Although Inupiatun and Qawiaraq have retroflex consonants, retroflexes have otherwise disappeared in all the Canadian and Greenlandic dialects.

== Writing system ==
Inuvialuktun and Inuinnaqtun are written in a Latin alphabet and have no tradition of Inuktitut syllabics. However, the dialects spoken in Nunavut, east of the Inuinnaqtun region use syllabics.

== Dialects ==
The Inuvialuktun dialects are seriously endangered, as English has in recent years become the common language of the community. Surveys of Inuktitut usage in the NWT vary, but all agree that usage is not vigorous. According to the &quot;Inuvialuit Cultural Resource Centre&quot;, only 10% of the roughly 4,000 Inuvialuit speak any form of Inuktitut, and only 4% use it at home. Statistics Canada&#x27;s 2001 Census report is only slightly better, reporting 765 self-identified Inuktitut speakers out of a self-reported Inuvialuit population of 3,905. Considering the large number of non-Inuit living in Inuvialuit areas and the lack of a single common dialect among the already reduced number of speakers, the future of the Inuit language in the NWT appears bleak.

From east to west, the dialects are:

* &quot;Iglulingmiut&quot; or North Baffin, spoken on western Baffin Island (contrast South Baffin dialect.)
* &quot;Aivilingmiutut&quot; or Aivilik on the northern Hudson Bay shore of the Kivalliq Region
* &quot;Kivallirmiutut&quot; or Kivalliq or Caribou on the southern Hudson Bay shore of the Kivalliq Region
* &quot;Natsilingmiutut or Netsilik consists of three subdialects:&quot; Natsilik &quot;proper,&quot; Arviligjuaq&quot;,&quot; Utkuhiksalik
* &quot;Inuinnaqtun&quot; consists of four subdialects: Kangiryuarmiutun, Kugluktuk, Bathurst, Cambridge. The Kangiryuarmiutun subdialect is spoken in the small community of Ulukhaktok. Essentially the same as Natsilingmiutut.
* &quot;Siglitun&quot; was, until the 1980s, believed to be extinct, but it is still spoken by people in Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour and Tuktoyaktuk.

The Inuvialuk dialects spoken in Nunavut (that is, Iglulingmiut, Aivilingmiutut, Kivallirmiutut, and eastern Natsilingmiutut) are often counted as Inuktitut, and the government of the NWT only recognizes Inuinnaqtun and Inuvialuktun. In addition, &quot;Uummarmiutun&quot;, the dialect of the &quot;Uummarmiut&quot; which is essentially identical to the Inupiatun dialect spoken in Alaska and so considered an Inupiat language, has conventionally been grouped with Inuvialuktun because it&#x27;s spoken in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of the NWT. Uummarmiutun is found in the communities of Inuvik and Aklavik.

<text>Alangalang (IPA: ), officially the Municipality of Alangalang (; ; ), is a First Class municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 57,185 people.

It is a landlocked town with an area of 151 km2. It is bounded on the north by Barugo and San Miguel, on the south by Pastrana, on the north-east by Tacloban City, on the east by Santa Fe and on the west by Jaro.

On the way to Carigara is a steel bridge spanning the Mainit River. There was a time when only footpaths existed and the river was far too wide for a leap and too deep to wade in, travelers were undecided what to do. Hence the name Alangalang was given to the town, from the vernacular word &quot;alang-alang&quot; which means &quot;indecision&quot;.
The strongest tropical typhoon Haiyan, more commonly known as Typhoon Yolanda impacted the town on November 8, 2013.

==Etymology==
The place got its name from the word &quot;Alang-alang&quot;, a vernacular word for &quot;indecision&quot;. There was a time when only footpaths existed in Mainit river going to Carigara which was too wide to leap and too narrow to wade in, so travelers were undecided on what to do.

==History==

The town began to form from different &quot;rancherías&quot; and &quot;barangays&quot; at about the year 1596, Fr. Cosme de Flores, a priest-engineer, made it into the fourth &quot;doctrina.&quot; Fr. Tomas de Montaya, a Manila college professor succeeded Fr. Flores who died at the early age of 29. Alangalang, with Dulag, was made a &quot;cabecera&quot; of nine towns with Fr. Mateo Sanchez as superior.

In 1600, the town suffered from the Moro raids. A punitive force from Cebu under Capitan Francisco de Pedraza was sent to suppress lawlessness. In 1611, a hurricane swept the whole town and floods became frequent. The 18 or 20 rancherias declined in importance and around December 1628, Alangalang became a &quot;visita&quot; of Barugo.

The old town of Alangalang was founded in 1748 in a site located across the steel bridge at Binongto-an called &quot;Bukid Height&quot;. This settlement was headed by Francisco Antonis, a courageous leader, together with Pongal, Manamot, Francisco Gariando, Hidalgo Pedrera and Solang Adlao. Antonis was famed for having eaten the liver of a Moro bandit whom he caught during one of the raids. Fr. Baysa, a Franciscan, was then their spiritual mentor. The objective of the Moro raids was the gold church bell. During every Moro attack, the inhabitants would take the gold bell with them to the hills. At one time, when the townsfolk were being pursued, they had to drop the gold bell in the Bangka River only to save it from the invaders, the bell has never been recovered since then.

Alangalang was made into a parish in 1809 according to a historian named Cousin. Towards the end of the 18th century, the settlement in Bukid thrived that Fr. Jose Olmo, then Parish priest, transferred the town across the Mainit River where the provincial nursery is located up to this day. The government officials at that time were the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot;, &quot;teniente mayor&quot;, &quot;teniente segundo&quot;, &quot;cabeza de la barangay&quot; or &quot;guinhaopan&quot;, &quot;delgado de las rentas&quot; and &quot;cuadrilleros&quot;. Among the lay leaders were Eulogio Barrantes, Santo Pabilona, Eulogio Daroles and Esteban Pedero. By the middle of the 19th century, Alangalang had a rectory and six rural schools; the roads to Palo and Barugo were also opened. The town was noted for its abacá, copra, seeds of &quot;kabalonga&quot;, wax, cocoa, tobacco and rice.

A big flood leveled the town in 1883. By November of the same year, the gobernadorcillo moved the town to its present site. In 1892, when there was a rebellion in the country, Alangalang was in the middle of the fight. Leocardio Pabilona overthrew the Spanish rule in the town and became the &quot;jefe&quot; or &quot;capitán&quot; with a new set of &quot;guinhaopan&quot;. When the Americans occupied the town upon orders from Pabilona, the inhabitants evacuated the place. The Americans, angered, set the town on fire. It was the hardship of mountain life which finally made the townsfolk yield to American authority.

From then on, the town&#x27;s growth was steady. Alangalang is a big producer of copra and rice and lies along the route of the busiest national highway of the province. The town has one of the biggest Spanish-made churches and shortly before the war had a new concrete municipal building with a swimming pool.

After the fall of Corregidor in May 1942, the municipality became the emergency capital of the province. Provincial and national offices and government records were accordingly transferred there for safekeeping. On December 16, 1942, Japanese planes bombed the town. Alangalang again became one of the bulwarks of the resistance movement with Filemon Pabilona and Elias Macina as leaders. In 1944 to 1945, the Filipino forces of the 4th, 9th, 92nd, 93rd and 95th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army took in the town in Alangalang, Leyte fought the battles against the Japanese forces in World War II. After liberation, a regional high school opened. The town continues to lead in agriculture.

<doc id="608845" wikidata="Q343075" url="?curid=608845" title="Greg Lake">
<text>Gregory Stuart Lake (10 November 1947 – 7 December 2016) was an English musician, singer, and songwriter. He gained prominence as a founding member of the progressive rock bands King Crimson and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (ELP).

Born and brought up in Dorset, Lake began to play the guitar at the age of 12 and wrote his first song, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, at the same age. He became a full-time musician at 17, playing in several rock bands until his friend and fellow Dorset guitarist Robert Fripp invited him to join King Crimson as lead singer and bassist. They found commercial success with their influential debut album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; (1969).

Lake left the band in 1970 and achieved significant success in the 1970s and beyond as the singer, guitarist, bassist, and producer of ELP. As a member of ELP, Lake wrote and recorded several popular songs including &quot;Lucky Man&quot; and &quot;From the Beginning&quot;. Both songs entered the UK and US singles charts. Lake launched a solo career, beginning with his 1975 single &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot; which reached number two in the UK. He went on to release three solo albums with his Greg Lake Band and guitarist Gary Moore, recorded 1981 through 1983 (two studio albums, one live album). He was also briefly but notably a member of pop rock band Asia in 1983, replacing vocalist/bassist John Wetton (another former member of King Crimson) for three concerts in Tokyo, Japan. As well as collaborating and performing with other artists and with various groups in the 1980s, he had occasional ELP reunions in the 1990s and in 2010, and toured regularly as a solo artist into the 21st century.

Lake also sponsored other artists, producing their recordings and helping them to get recording contracts. He also was a fundraiser for the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children. He died on 7 December 2016 in London, of pancreatic cancer, at the age of 69.

== Early life ==
Gregory Stuart Lake was born on 10 November 1947 in the Parkstone area of Poole in Dorset, to Harry, an engineer, and Pearl, a housewife. He grew up in the residential suburb of Oakdale. Speaking about his childhood, Lake said he was &quot;born in an asbestos prefab housing unit&quot; into a &quot;very poor&quot; family, and remembered several cold winters at home, but credits his parents for sending him money and food during his time as a struggling musician. He later described his upbringing as a happy one.

Lake discovered rock and roll in 1957 when he bought Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Lucille&quot;. At the age of 12, he first learned to play the guitar and wrote his first song, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, which he didn&#x27;t write down, simply committing it to memory. He named his mother, a pianist, as his initial musical influence and she bought Lake a second hand guitar to learn on. Lake then took guitar lessons from Don Strike, who had a shop in Westbourne. Strike taught him &quot;these awful Bert Weedon things&quot;, reading musical notation exercises with violin pieces by Niccolò Paganini, and playing 1930s pop tunes, the latter of which became an influence on Lake at the time. After roughly one year with Strike, Lake ended his tuition as he wished to learn songs by the Shadows, a favourite band of his, but Strike &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have any of it&quot;. Lake&#x27;s second guitar was a pink Fender Stratocaster.

Lake attended Oakdale Junior School followed by Henry Harbin Secondary Modern School, and left the latter in 1963 or 1964. He then took up work loading and unloading cargo at the Poole docks, and as a draughtsman for a short period. Lake then decided to become a full-time musician at the age of 17.

== Career ==

=== Early bands ===
Lake joined his first band, Unit Four, playing cover songs as their singer and guitarist.
 Following their split in 1965, Lake and Unit Four bassist Dave Genes formed another covers group, the Time Checks, until 1966. He then became a member of the Shame, where he is featured on their single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away Little Girl&quot;, written by Janis Ian. During his stay in Carlisle for a gig, Lake contracted pneumonia and continued to perform on stage. His bandmates refused to drive back home that night, leaving Lake to sleep in the van where he &quot;woke up blue ... When we got home I was nearly dead ... That was probably the worst I went through&quot;. Following a brief stint in the Shy Limbs, by 1968 Lake was involved with the Gods, based in Hatfield, which he described as &quot;a very poor training college&quot;, but the group secured a residency at the Marquee Club in London. Lake left the group in 1968 over creative differences as the band were to enter the recording studio. Their keyboardist Ken Hensley later said that Lake &quot;was far too talented to be kept in the background&quot;.

=== King Crimson ===
In the 1960s, Lake formed a friendship with guitarist Robert Fripp, who would later lead King Crimson. Lake and Fripp were from Dorset and both received lessons from Don Strike. Fripp saw Lake perform in Unit Four in Poole, and was asked to be a roadie for a gig at Ventnor, Isle of Wight; when no audience turned up, Lake and Fripp decided to play tunes from their guitar lessons that Strike had taught them.

In 1968 Fripp formed King Crimson after Giles, Giles and Fripp ended due to creative tensions and lack of commercial success. Michael Giles stayed as drummer and Ian McDonald joined on keyboards, flute and saxophone. Vocalist/bassist Peter Giles left the group, and was replaced by Lake. This was Lake&#x27;s first time playing bass guitar; he had primarily been a guitarist for eleven years. Peter Sinfield was the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, with Lake contributing some of the lyrics for their debut album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;. After their contracted producer Tony Clarke walked away from the project, Lake produced the album. Released in October 1969, the album was an immediate commercial and critical success. Lake recalled: &quot;There was this huge wave of response. The audiences were really into us because we were an underground thing – the critics loved us because we offered something fresh&quot;.

King Crimson supported &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; with a tour of the UK and the US, with some of the shows featuring rock band the Nice as the opening act. In San Francisco during the US tour, Lake struck up a friendship with Nice keyboardist Keith Emerson; the two shared similar musical interests, were ready to leave their respective bands, and talked about the benefits of their forming a new group together. When King Crimson returned to the UK in early 1970, Lake agreed to sing on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;, and appear on the music television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with them, performing the song &quot;Cat Food&quot;.

=== Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer ===
In April 1970, Lake left King Crimson and joined with Emerson and drummer Carl Palmer of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster, to form the progressive rock supergroup, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Lake began with a Fender bass before he switched to a Gibson Ripper. Lake also contributed some work on acoustic and electric guitar to Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and his voice had a wider and more diverse range than anything the Nice had previously recorded. Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer became one of the most successful groups in the 1970s.

Lake became known for performing on an expensive Persian carpet on stage; sometimes criticized as being one of the band&#x27;s lavish egocentric stagepieces, Lake stated that it served a practical purpose: it covered a rubber mat he stood on at his microphone to address his fear of electrocution after he received an electric shock from a microphone on stage. Sinfield, who stated he went with Lake to purchase the carpet, felt that this was half the story; he believed that Lake was driven to keep up with Emerson&#x27;s extravagant equipment: &quot;He was one of those classic keep-up-with-the-Joneses cases.&quot;

Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer conflicted between Emerson&#x27;s interest in complex, classically influenced music and Lake&#x27;s more straightforward rock tastes. Lake complained that Emerson chose to play in keys that were not a good fit for his voice. During the making of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Tarkus&quot;, Lake initially rejected the title track, but was persuaded to record it following a band meeting with management, which ended in the addition of an original Lake tune, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, into the suite. Lake&#x27;s track &quot;From the Beginning&quot;, released on &quot;Trilogy&quot; in 1972, had no particular source of inspiration; &quot;I just felt an inspiration to do it, and it flowed through me in a natural way. My hands fell upon these very unusual chords;... It was kind of a gift&quot;.
It was released as a single, and reached number 39 in the US.

In 1974, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer took a break in activity. Lake used this time to focus on his family life, travel, and to write and release music. By then the band were tax exiles and relocated to Switzerland, France, Canada and the Bahamas as they were restricted to two months&#x27; stay in England a year. In March 1977, the band released &quot;Works Volume 1&quot;, a double album, with each member of the group getting one side of an album for his solo music, and the fourth side for the group to work together. Lake wrote five acoustic songs with lyrical assistance from Sinfield, with a conscious effort not to record &quot;just ballads&quot; in favor of recording a wider variety of musical styles. He then incorporated orchestral overdubs to the songs.
One of them, &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;, was released as a single. Lake called the album the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; of the band, as he stopped producing their albums, neither of which were a &quot;really innovative record&quot;. In November 1977, the band released &quot;Works Volume 2&quot;.

The band split up in 1979 following the unsuccessful album &quot;Love Beach&quot;, an album the group were contractually obliged to record. The group reformed for a number of years in the mid-1990s and released two albums, &quot;Black Moon&quot; in 1992 and &quot;In The Hot Seat&quot; in 1994, before permanently disbanding except for one forty-year anniversary reunion concert in 2010 at London&#x27;s High Voltage Festival.

=== Solo career and other projects ===
In 1975, while still a member of ELP, Lake achieved solo chart success when his single, &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot;, reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. It has become a Yuletide perennial. In the UK, the single sold over 13,000 copies in two days.

Several months following the break-up of ELP in 1979, Lake began to write new songs and had &quot;put down a tremendous amount of material&quot; for his first solo album. He travelled to Los Angeles and worked with a group of session musicians to develop his songs further, but he found a lack of personality in the music, though not at the fault of the performers. Lake realised he wished to play as part of a group, and began to assemble members of the Greg Lake Band. The result, &quot;Greg Lake&quot;, was released in September 1981 on Chrysalis Records, and reached number 62 in both the UK and the US. The debut concert for the tour of the album took place in August 1981 at the Reading Festival, with bandmates Gary Moore on guitar, Ted McKenna on drums, Tommy Eyre on keyboards, and Tristram Margetts on bass. A concert at the Hammersmith Odeon during the tour in 1981, broadcast live on the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, was released as a live album in 1995.

Lake&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Manoeuvres&quot; was released in July 1983. He disbanded the Greg Lake Band soon after completing it, without promoting or touring the album, and split with his record company. In a 1997 interview, he explained his decision: &quot;It was a weird time for me, and for the music business. I was pressured into writing songs that the record company thought radio programmers wanted to hear. Hence, there was not the passion the first album had. There were some nice ballads, but the record lacked the pure vision that a hit album needs to succeed.&quot; He gave further insight in 2011: &quot;It was great to be the rhythm guitar player in that line-up. Gary is a fabulous player, and the bass was covered properly. The problem was the solo albums really lacked direction. I was lost in a way. Once you&#x27;ve been in a band like ELP, if you try a solo career you can do it, but the public voted &#x27;You&#x27;re part of ELP. That&#x27;s who you are&#x27;... When you try and search for an alternative identity, it&#x27;s difficult. For a long while, I was kind of lost and would try different things. It was fun, but also a bit here, there and everywhere.&quot; Adding to the decision, lead guitarist Gary Moore had written solo material that brought him a recording contract: &quot;I was working with Greg Lake for two years during &#x27;81 and &#x27;82 and we did two albums. At the time I was with him, I was writing songs ... I did some demos after the U.S. tour with Greg to see what would happen, and I got a deal with Atlantic. I really wanted to get out on my own at that stage, and I wanted these songs recorded – they weren&#x27;t suitable for Greg... so I set up a deal with Virgin, and went in and did &#x27;Corridors Of Power&#x27;. We didn&#x27;t even set out to form a band, but the album took off, so we went on tour.&quot;

In October 1983, at friend Carl Palmer&#x27;s request, Lake briefly joined Palmer in the 1980s supergroup Asia, to replace fellow King Crimson alumnus John Wetton for four scheduled concerts in Japan. Lake agreed and spent six weeks learning Asia&#x27;s songs, culminating in his performance in the &quot;Asia in Asia&quot; concert at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, 6 December 1983, the first concert broadcast over satellite to MTV in the United States, and later made into a home video. Lake left the group after the tour, having joined as a favor for the Japanese concerts only.

In 1986, he and Keith Emerson decided to re-form Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer to record another album. However, Carl Palmer continued to have commitments to Asia, so Lake and Emerson auditioned other artists. They found good rapport with drummer Cozy Powell, and recorded their eponymous album &quot;Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell&quot; with him.

In 2001, Lake toured as a member of the seventh incarnation of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.

In 2003, Lake played bass on The Who song &quot;Real Good Looking Boy&quot;. The group&#x27;s usual bassist Pino Palladino was touring at the time of recording, and Lake was asked to play bass.

In 2005, Lake toured Germany and the UK with his group, the Greg Lake Band, which now included David Arch on keyboards, Florian Opahle on guitar, Trevor Barry on bass, and Brett Morgan on drums. The tour was sponsored by UK entertainer and long-term ELP fan, Jim Davidson. But the shows were not a sell-out, the US leg was cancelled, and the two men then fell out.

In 2006, Lake played as a member of the supergroup the RD Crusaders in aid for charity. Lake performed &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra at several shows. He was a special guest on their album &quot;Night Castle&quot; (2009).

In 2010, Lake and Emerson completed an acoustic world tour, performing ELP songs. The tour got off to a bad start following a backstage altercation between the two, but &quot;we completed the tour and it was very happy. We actually ended up enjoying ourselves&quot;. That July, Lake joined Emerson and Palmer for a one-off gig from Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer at the High Voltage Festival in Victoria Park, London, to commemorate the band&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. The concert was released on CD, DVD, and Blu-ray as &quot;High Voltage&quot;. It was the final performance by the group. Lake wished to continue touring, but claimed his bandmates &quot;didn&#x27;t want to&quot;, thus ending such plans.
Lake continued to tour solo in the 2010s. His Songs of a Lifetime Tour began in 2012 which featured songs of his career and those by his favourite artists, including Elvis Presley and Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates. The tour ended in December of that year and produced the live albums, &quot;Songs of a Lifetime&quot; (2013) and &quot;Live in Piacenza&quot; (2017).

On 9 January 2016, he was awarded an honorary degree in music and lyrics composition by Conservatorio Nicolini in Piacenza, Italy, the first degree awarded by any conservatory, ever.

Lake spent several years writing his autobiography &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, originally planned to be published in 2012 but eventually released posthumously in June 2017.

On 19 June 2017, the Municipality of Zoagli (Genoa) Italy awarded the Honorary Citizenship post mortem to Greg Lake and engraved a marble plaque that is next to Castello Canevaro where the musician performed on 30 November 2012.
In the last years he worked on producing for Manticore &quot;Moonchild&quot; by Annie Barbazza and Max Repetti: an album where some of his most iconic songs were arranged in an avant-garde/contemporary mood, for only piano and voice.

== Personal life and death ==
In late 1974, Lake moved from a flat in Cornwall Gardens in Kensington, London to a home near Windsor. Lake later lived in the Kingston and Richmond areas of Greater London with his wife, Regina. The couple had one daughter, Natasha.

Lake was an accomplished angler who developed a friendship with broadcaster Jack Hargreaves, appearing as a result in an episode (1980) of “Out of Town”, Hargreaves’ programme about country life for Southern TV.

Lake died in London on 7 December 2016, at the age of 69, after suffering from pancreatic cancer. His manager announced the news on Twitter, describing Lake&#x27;s battle with the illness as &quot;long and stubborn&quot;. Numerous fellow musicians paid tribute, including Rick Wakeman and Steve Hackett, Ringo Starr, John Wetton, Opeth&#x27;s Mikael Åkerfeldt, Ian Anderson and ELP drummer Carl Palmer. Lake&#x27;s death occurred nine months after the death of ELP keyboardist Keith Emerson.

<text>Babatngon (IPA: ), officially the Municipality of Babatngon (; ), is a municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 28,823 people.

Babatngon is located in the northern part of the island of Leyte, along the shore of Carigara Bay. It is situated on a small plain set in a semicircle of mountain ranges and nestles in the northern mouth of the San Juanico Strait, which separates Samar from Leyte. Boats coming in or going out of Tacloban City have to pass by it through the pilot station of Canaway, one of the islets along the strait. It is north-west of Tacloban City and about north of the town of San Miguel. Small coconut covered islets fringe its coast along San Juanico Strait, the most important of which are Rizal, Magsaigad, Tabigue, almost all of which extend from east to west.

==Etymology==
The place got its name from the word &quot;batong&quot;, a large trap made of abaca fibers used for hunting by the early Boholano settlers. Later on named as &quot;Babatngon,&quot; which means hunting ground with the use of a net.

==History==
===Historical Location===
There are divergent versions as to the first municipal site of Babatngon. Some say that the first settlement was called San Juanico in Bacod Island from which the name San Juanico strait was derived. Another version says that the first settlement was San Vicente, which was part of Bacod Island, while still others say that the first municipal site was in the present barangay of Malibago. The most favored version, however, is that Babatngon and Malibago existed as separate settlements along the San Juanico strait during the 17th century and then in the process of growth, Babatngon became a municipality earlier than the other settlements.

Another version claims that Babatngon was founded as an outpost. This version may be proven by the presence of two &quot;baluartes&quot; or watchtowers at Bijuco and Magsaigad.

===Settlement===
Babatngon was first settled in 1540 by natives of Carigara, Catbalogan (Samar) and migrants from Bohol. The Boholanos traded mats, abacá cloths, bolos and other goods. One day, near the end of the year 1600, the Boholano traders were stranded in the present site of Babatngon because of unfavorable winds. The town at the time was covered by thick forests from the shore to the uplands with undergrowth of pandans and guava trees. Greatly in need of food, they hunted for wild animals and found wild game to be rich. Inspired by their first abundant catch, they went home and told their home folks about the rich hunting ground. Encouraged by the news and inspired by their desire to settle in fertile lands which they can call their own, many Boholanos came equipped with large traps called &quot;batong&quot; made of abacá fibers.

From &quot;batong&quot;, the place was called &quot;Babatngon&quot; - hunting ground with the use of a net. The early Spaniards called the town &quot;Babagnon&quot; but the natives changed the original name into &quot;Babatngon&quot; for easier diction.

===Colonial Period===
The conquistadors&#x27; first concern was religion, thus it was Fr. Juan Quimbo who constructed the first church. At the turn of the century, the friars turned over the parish to the secular priests. Remembered for the contributions to the parish are:

Fr. Masecampo who established the first &quot;campo santo&quot; which has lived to the present; Fr. F. Langteco who reconstructed the church after it was destroyed by typhoons; Fr. A Colasito who constructed the belfry; Fr. F. Rostata who began the reconstruction of the church after the war; and finally, Fr. A. Alve to whom belongs the distinction of giving Babatngon Church the finishing touches. Fr. Alve was also responsible for constructing the first convent.

Today there are ten religious organizations all dedicated to St. Vincent Ferrer, Babatngon&#x27;s patron saint. According to a census, out of a population of 12,000 inhabitants, only 98 are non-Catholics.

===Expansion===
The expansion of the town was sparked by the establishment of a British trading post - called &quot;Almacen&quot; in Soledad street. Soon after the trading post was organized, huge brick and adobe commercial houses were constructed across the street. The trade name of the establishment was Smith Bell.

Immigrants from Japan, Carigara, Barugo, San Miguel and from the coastal towns of Western Samar and other countries flocked to Babatngon which had grown into a commercial district.

Farming and fishing became the chief industries of the new and thriving town. Rice, corn, abacá and coconuts grew in abundance. The manufacture of wooden sandals (bakya) inevitably developed from the presence of an almost inexhaustible source of soft wood, the material from which sandals are patiently carved. The sandals have reached far and wide and have found a market even in Surigao.

===Revolutionary Period===
In 1901, when the uprising rocked the entire archipelago from end to end, a band of revolucionarios led by Domingo Inbrua fought openly with the guardias civiles and caused havoc in the garrisons of Carigara and Barugo. The revolucionarios, armed with bolos and other crude weapons struck fear in the hearts of their better-trained armed adversaries.

However, Babatngon had its share of misfortune. The stone buildings were ruined when the Spaniards made their last stand during the revolution within the town proper. No sooner had the people recovered from the devastation when another war razed the school building, the town hall, recreational centers and countless residential houses to the ground.

===WW II and Japanese Occupation===
During the Second World War, Mayor Melchor Cañete guided the townspeople through the difficulties of food shortage and unsettled times. Mayor Cañete kept the peace in Babatngon so well during the Japanese occupation that the seat of provincial government was temporarily transferred to the town. Moreover, Many evacuees found refuge in the town from the dangers of their own municipalities.

In 1944 to 1945, an attack by combined American and the Philippine Commonwealth troops took the town of Babatngon, Leyte.

===Today===
Banditry created a ripple of unrest in Babatngon&#x27;s history for a time. Bandit lairs in Poro, Kalangawan Island, and Toyong on Kalkagan Island hid two of the fiercest leaders of organized piracy. Punitive forces under the leadership of Capitan Cecilio Serrano raided the bandits&#x27; lair and in a hand-to-hand encounter succeeded in killing the two bandits and many of their followers. The imprisonment of the bandits and the death of their leaders disorganized the others so that again, peace came to the town.

==Geography==

===Barangays===
Babatngon is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

In 1957, sitios Biasong, Lube, Ubayan, Calcagan, Cancamaoy, and Opong was constituted into barrio Biasong while sitio Nababoy was converted into barrio San Ricardo.

== Economy ==
==Tourism==
Babatngon is known for Busay Falls, a three-tiered cataract which is an attraction for picnickers who flock to Babatngon during the summer months. A massive bowl of solid, moss-covered rock catches the cool waters of the third fall.

==Infrastructure==
There are 11 barrios linked to the town proper with &quot;vecinal&quot; roads. These are provided with artesian wells. Barrio Bagahupi has been made a pilot barrio in the study of schistosomiasis as the area has been suspected of being positive for the parasite.

Although some of the buildings burned down during the war have not been reconstructed, several pre-fabricated buildings have taken care of the needs of the children.

<doc id="608852" wikidata="Q2984407" url="?curid=608852" title="Thyroid follicular cell">
<text>Thyroid follicular cells (also called thyroid epithelial cells or thyrocytes) are the major cell type in the thyroid gland, and are responsible for the production and secretion of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). They form the single layer of cuboidal epithelium that makes up the outer structure of the almost spherical thyroid follicle.

== Structure ==
===Location===
Thyroid follicular cells form a simple cuboidal epithelium and are arranged in spherical thyroid follicles surrounding a fluid filled space known as the colloid. The interior space formed by the follicular cells is known as the follicular lumen. The basolateral membrane of follicular cells contains thyrotropin receptors which bind to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) found circulating in the blood. 

Calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells are also found along the basement membrane of the thyroid follicle, interspersed between follicular cells; and in spaces between the spherical follicles. Parafollicular cells can be distinguished from follicular cells based on their lighter staining cytoplasm using H&amp;E. 

===Development===
Their embryologic origin is from a median endodermal mass in the region of the tongue (foramen cecum) in contrast to parafollicular cells which arise from the 4th pharyngeal pouch.

== Function ==

Follicular cells take up iodide and amino acids from the blood circulation on the basolateral side, synthesize thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase from amino acids and secrete these into the thyroid follicles together with iodide. The follicular cells subsequently take up iodinated thyroglobulin from the follicles by endocytosis, extract thyroid hormones from it with the help of proteases and subsequently release thyroid hormones into the blood.

These thyroid hormones are transported throughout the body where they control metabolism (which is the conversion of oxygen and carbohydrates to energy). Every cell in the body depends upon thyroid hormones for regulation of their metabolism. The normal thyroid gland produces about 80% T4 and about 20% T3, however, T3 is about four times as potent as T4.

===Iodide transport===
The transport of iodide into follicular cells is vital for the synthesis of the iodine containing thyroid hormones. Iodide is actively transported at the basolateral membrane of follicular cells by the sodium-iodide symporter. At the apical membrane iodide is secreted into the colloid by the chloride/iodide transporter pendrin.

<text>Borna disease, also known as sad horse disease, is an infectious neurological syndrome of warm-blooded animals, caused by Borna disease viruses 1 and 2 (BoDV-1/2). BoDV-1/2 are neurotropic viruses of the species &quot;Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus,&quot; and members of the &quot;Bornaviridae&quot; family within the &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; order.

Borna disease is a severe neurological illness that predominantly affects horses and sheep, but it has been observed in a wide range of mammals. The disease is characterised by ataxia and abnormal depressive behaviour, frequently culminating in death. There have been rare cases of human fatalities associated with encephalitis caused by Borna disease virus infection. Additionally, correlative evidence exists linking BoDV-1/2 infection with neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder in humans.

== History ==

Borna disease was first described in 1885, when all horses belonging to a cavalry regiment stationed near the city of Borna in Saxony, Germany, died from a hitherto unknown disease, then termed &quot;hitzige Kopfkrankheit&quot; (&quot;hot-tempered head illness&quot;). In 1909, Ernst Joest and Kurt Degen discovered distinctive inclusions in the nerves of horses that had died of Borna disease, which were named Joest-Degen inclusion bodies. This histopathological feature remains in use today to confirm the presence of Borna disease. In 1924, the Austrian virologist Wilhelm Zwick suggested a virus as the cause of the disease.

==Transmission==
The mode of transmission of BoDV-1/2 is unclear but probably occurs through intranasal exposure to contaminated saliva or nasal secretions. Following infection, individuals may develop Borna disease, or may remain subclinical, possibly acting as a carrier of the virus. The only known animal reservoir of BoDV-1 is the bicolored shrew (&quot;Crocidura leucodon&quot;), which is not susceptible to Borna disease. It is unclear whether human or livestock infections are due to zoonotic transmission from the bicolored shrew.

== Disease in animals ==

=== Mammals ===
Borna diseases viruses 1 and 2 appear to have wide host ranges, having been detected in horses, cattle, sheep, new world camelids, dogs, cats, and foxes. In 1995, BoDV-1 was isolated from cats with a &quot;staggering disease&quot; in Sweden. BoDV-1 has been detected in animals in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.

Symptoms of Borna disease in horses and sheep start after a four-week incubation period followed by the development of immune-mediated meningitis and encephalomyelitis. Clinical manifestations vary but may include excited or depressed behaviour, ataxia, teeth grinding, excessive salivating, ocular disorders and abnormal posture and movement. Later stages are characterised by bouts of fever and flailing of limbs while lying down. Death occurs a few days to weeks after symptom onset. Mortality rates are 80-100% in horses and greater than 50% in sheep.

Experimental infection of rats has been demonstrated to lead to learning impairments and altered social behaviour. The virus appears to be distributed primarily in the limbic system of the brain, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. These areas of the brain are considered to be of importance in emotion.

=== Birds ===
Avian bornaviruses, a group of related viruses, have been reported, yet not proven, as the cause of proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), a disease of pet parrots. The use of a &#x27;positive&#x27; brain cell culture containing ABV to inoculate another psittacine (parrot) bird resulted in the inoculated bird&#x27;s death and subsequent histopathological diagnosis of PDD (mononuclear infiltrative ganglioneuritis). Earlier research with purified avian bornavirus inoculant (while did result in the death of parrots) did not reproduce histopathological changes associated with PDD.

== Disease in humans ==
Antibodies to BoDV-1 in humans were first discovered in the mid-1980s, suggesting that humans can be non-fatally infected. Antibodies to BoDV-1 and BoDV-1 antigen have also been detected in blood donors.

=== Encephalitis ===
In 2018, three fatal cases of Borna disease in humans were confirmed in Germany. Three people were suspected to have been infected via organ transplants from the same donor, two of whom died. A third fatal case was unconnected to the organ donation. All three deaths were due to severe encephalitis.

In 2020, several additional cases of human infection were identified in the German federal state of Bavaria. In total, there have been 24 cases of confirmed BoDV-1 infection of humans between 1996 and 2021 . The infection was almost always fatal. All cases occurred in known areas of spread of BoDV-1, including the federal states of Bavaria, Brandenburg, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt.

===Psychiatric disease===
There is some evidence that there may be a relationship between BoDV-1 infection and psychiatric disease.

In 1990, Janice E. Clements and colleagues reported in the journal &quot;Science&quot; that antibodies to a protein encoded by the BoDV-1 genome are found in the blood of patients with behavioral disorders. In the early 1990s, researchers in Germany, America, and Japan conducted an investigation of 5000 patients with psychiatric disorders and 1000 controls, in which a significantly higher percentage of patients than controls were positive for BoDV-1 antibodies. Subsequent studies have also presented evidence for an association between BoDV-1 and human psychiatric disorders. However, not all researchers consider the link between BoDV-1 and human psychiatric disease to be conclusively proven. A study published in 2003 found no BoDV-1 antibodies in 62 patients with the deficit form of schizophrenia.

Additional evidence for a role of BoDV-1 in psychiatric disorders comes from reports that the drug amantadine, which is used to treat influenza infections, has had some success in treating depression and clearing BoDV-1 infection.

<text>Parafollicular cells, also called C cells, are neuroendocrine cells in the thyroid. They are called C cells because the primary function of these cells is to secrete calcitonin. They are located adjacent to the thyroid follicles and reside in the connective tissue. These cells are large and have a pale stain compared with the follicular cells. In teleost and avian species these cells occupy a structure outside the thyroid gland named the ultimopharyngeal body.

== Structure ==
Parafollicular cells are pale-staining cells found in small number in the thyroid and are typically situated basally in the epithelium, without direct contact with the follicular lumen. They are always situated within the basement membrane, which surrounds the entire follicle.

===Development===
Parafollicular cells are derived from pharyngeal endoderm. Embryologically, they associate with the ultimopharyngeal body, which is a ventral derivative of the fourth (or fifth) pharyngeal pouch. Parafollicular cells were previously believed to be derived from the neural crest based on a series of experiments in quail-chick chimeras. However, lineage tracing experiments in mice revealed that parafollicular cells are derived from the endoderm origin.

== Function ==
Parafollicular cells secrete calcitonin, a hormone that participates in the regulation of calcium metabolism. Calcitonin lowers blood levels of calcium by inhibiting the resorption of bone by osteoclasts, and its secretion is increased proportionally with the concentration of calcium.

Parafollicular cells are also known to secrete in smaller quantities several neuroendocrine peptides such as serotonin, somatostatin or CGRP. They may also have a role in regulating thyroid hormones production locally, as they express thyrotropin-releasing hormone.

==Clinical significance==
When parafollicular cells become cancerous, they lead to medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

<doc id="608858" wikidata="Q1305106" url="?curid=608858" title="Looking Backward">
<text>Looking Backward: 2000–1887 is a utopian time travel science fiction novel by the American journalist and writer Edward Bellamy first published in 1888.

The book was translated into several languages, and in short order &quot;sold a million copies.&quot; According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, &quot;In the 19th-century United States, only &quot;Uncle Tom’s Cabin&quot; sold more copies in its first years&quot; than Bellamy&#x27;s book. 

The novel inspired several utopian communities. In the United States alone, over 162 &quot;Bellamy Clubs&quot; sprang up to discuss and propagate the book&#x27;s ideas. According to Erich Fromm, &quot;It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement.&quot; 

&quot;Looking Backward&quot; influenced many intellectuals, and appears by title in many socialist writings of the day. Owing to its commitment to the nationalization of private property and the desire to avoid use of the term &quot;socialism,&quot; this political movement came to be known as Nationalism (not to be confused with the political ideology of nationalism). 

==Synopsis==
Bellamy&#x27;s novel tells the story of a young American man named Julian West who, in 1887, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy&#x27;s thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and the use of an &quot;industrial army&quot; to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.

The young man is awoken to a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age, including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous, internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens (realized as factory-kitchens in the 1920s–30s in the USSR). The productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.

Although Bellamy&#x27;s novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail, commentators frequently compare &quot;Looking Backward&quot; with actual economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the consumers&#x27; cooperatives of his own day based on the &quot;Rochdale Principles&quot; of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern warehouse club like BJ&#x27;s, Costco, or Sam&#x27;s Club. He additionally introduces a concept of &quot;credit&quot; cards in chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like modern debit cards. All citizens receive an equal amount of &quot;credit.&quot; Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours. Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through cable &quot;telephone&quot; (already demonstrated but commercialized only in 1890 as Théâtrophone in France).

Bellamy&#x27;s ideas somewhat reflect classical Marxism. In chapter 19, for example, he has the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of atavism, then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried again. Chapters 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more libertarian socialist system. In one case, Bellamy even writes, &quot;the nation is the sole employer and capitalist.&quot;

==Publication history==
The decades of the 1870s and the 1880s were marked by economic and social turmoil, including the Long Depression of 1873–1879, a series of recessions during the 1880s, the rise of organized labor and strikes, and the 1886 Haymarket affair and its controversial aftermath. Moreover, American capitalism&#x27;s tendency towards concentration into ever larger and less competitive forms—monopolies, oligopolies, and trusts—began to make itself evident, while emigration from Europe expanded the labor pool and caused wages to stagnate. The time was ripe for new ideas about economic development which might ameliorate the current social disorder.

Edward Bellamy (1850–1898), a relatively unknown New England-born novelist with a history of concern with social issues, began to conceive of writing an impactful work of visionary fiction shaping the outlines of a utopian future, in which production and society were ordered for the smooth production and distribution of commodities to a regimented labor force. In this he was not alone—between 1860 and 1887, no fewer than 11 such works of fiction were produced in the United States by various authors dealing fundamentally with the questions of economic and social organization.

Bellamy&#x27;s book, gradually planned throughout the 1880s, was completed in 1887 and taken to Boston publisher Benjamin Ticknor, who published a first edition of the novel in January 1888. Initial sales of the book were modest and uninspiring, but the book did find a readership in the Boston area, including enthusiastic reviews by future Bellamyites Cyrus Field Willard of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and Sylvester Baxter of the &quot;Boston Herald.&quot;

Shortly after publication, Ticknor&#x27;s publishing enterprise, Ticknor and Company, was purchased by the larger Boston publisher, Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., and new publishing plates were created for the book. Certain &quot;slight emendations&quot; were made to the text by Bellamy for this second edition, released by Houghton Mifflin in September 1889.

In its second release, Bellamy&#x27;s futuristic novel met with enormous popular success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in the United States alone by the time Bellamy&#x27;s follow-up novel, &quot;Equality,&quot; was published in 1897. Sales topped 532,000 in the US by the middle of 1939. The book gained an extensive readership in Great Britain, as well, with more than 235,000 copies sold there between its first release in 1890 and 1935.

The &quot;Bellamy Library of Fact and Fiction&quot;, by William Reeves, a radical London publisher, printer and bookseller was a systematic effort to organize this literature. The Bellamy Library codified series of texts designed to make political works, defined by their radical content and popular appeal, both intellectually and financially accessible to working-class activists and lower- middle-class radicals. It was especially popular among working men&#x27;s clubs.
The first version of the novel published in China, heavily edited for the tastes of Chinese readers, was titled &quot;Huitou kan jilüe&quot; (回頭看記略). This text was later retitled &quot;Bainian Yi Jiao&quot; (百年一覺 ), or &quot;A Sleep of 100 Years&quot; and in 1891–1892 this version was serialized in &quot;Wanguo gongbao&quot;; the organization Guangxuehui (廣學會; Society for Promoting Education) published these pieces in a book format. This first translation, the first piece of science fiction from a Western country published in Qing dynasty China, was done in an abridged format by Timothy Richard. The novel was again serialized in China in 1898, in &quot;Zhongguo guanyin baihua bao&quot; (中國官音白話報); and in 1904, under the title &quot;Huitou kan&quot; (Looking Backward), within &quot;Xiuxiang xiaoshuo&quot; (繡像小說; Illustrated Fiction).

The book remains in print in multiple editions, with one publisher alone having reissued the title in a printing of 100,000 copies in 1945.

==Precursors==
Though Bellamy tended to stress the independence of his work, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; shares relationships and resemblances with several earlier works—most notably the anonymous &quot;The Great Romance&quot; (1881), John Macnie&#x27;s &quot;The Diothas&quot; (1883), Laurence Gronlund&#x27;s &quot;The Co-operative Commonwealth&quot; (1884), and August Bebel&#x27;s &quot;Woman in the Past, Present, and Future&quot; (1886). For example, in &quot;The True Author of Looking Backward&quot; (1890) J. B. Shipley argued that Bellamy&#x27;s novel was a repeat of Bebel&#x27;s arguments, while literary critic R. L. Shurter went so far as to argue that &quot;&quot;Looking Backward&quot; is actually a fictionalized version of &quot;The Co-operative Commonwealth&quot; and little more&quot;. However, Bellamy&#x27;s book also bears resemblances to the early socialist theorists or &#x27;utopian socialists&#x27; Etienne Cabet, Charles Fourier, Robert Owen, and Henri Saint-Simon, as well as to the &#x27;Associationism&#x27; of Albert Brisbane, whom Bellamy had met in the 1870s.

==Reaction and sequels==
On publication, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; was praised by both the American Federation of Labor and the Knights of Labor. Many members of the Knights read &quot;Looking Backward&quot; and also joined Bellamy&#x27;s Nationalist clubs. &quot;Looking Backward&quot; was also praised by Daniel De Leon, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Upton Sinclair.

In 1897, Bellamy wrote a sequel, &quot;Equality&quot;, dealing with women&#x27;s rights, education, and many other issues. Bellamy wrote the sequel to elaborate and clarify many of the ideas merely touched upon in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;.

The success of &quot;Looking Backward&quot; provoked a spate of sequels, parodies, satires, dystopian, and &#x27;anti-utopian&#x27; responses. A partial list of these follows.
The result was a &quot;battle of the books&quot; that lasted through the rest of the 19th century and into the 20th. The back-and-forth nature of the debate is illustrated by the subtitle of Geissler&#x27;s 1891 &quot;Looking Beyond&quot;, which is &quot;A Sequel to &#x27;Looking Backward&#x27; by Edward Bellamy and an Answer to &#x27;Looking Forward&#x27; by Richard Michaelis&quot;.

The book was translated into Bulgarian in 1892. Bellamy personally approved a request by Bulgarian author Iliya Yovchev to make an &quot;adapted translation&quot; based on the realities of Bulgarian social order. The resulting work, titled &quot;The Present as Seen by Our Descendants And a Glimpse at the Progress of the Future&quot; (&quot;Настоящето, разгледано от потомството ни и надничане в напредъка на бъдещето&quot;), generally followed the same plot. The events in Yovchev&#x27;s version take place in an environmentally friendly Sofia and describe the country&#x27;s unique path of adapting to the new social order. It is considered by local critics to be the first Bulgarian utopian work.

The book also influenced activists in Britain. Scientist Alfred Russel Wallace credited &quot;Looking Backward&quot; for his conversion to socialism. Politician Alfred Salter cited &quot;Looking Backward&quot; as an influence on his political thought.

William Morris&#x27;s 1890 utopia &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; was partly written in reaction to Bellamy&#x27;s utopia, which Morris did not find congenial.

Bellamy&#x27;s descriptions of utopian urban planning influenced Ebenezer Howard to found the garden city movement in England, and also influenced the design of the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles.

During the Great Strikes of 1877, Eugene V. Debs argued that there was no essential necessity for the conflict between capital and labor. Debs was influenced by Bellamy&#x27;s book to turn to a more socialist direction. He soon helped to form the American Railway Union. With supporters from the Knights of Labor and from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike in June 1894. This came to be known as the Pullman Strike.

The book had a specific and intense reception in Wilhelminian Germany including various parodies and sequels, from Eduard Loewenthal, Ernst Müller and Philipp Wasserburg, Konrad Wilbrandt and Richard Michaelis.

The Russian translation of &quot;Looking Backward&quot; was banned by the Tsarist Russian censors.

In the 1930s, there was a revival of interest in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;. Several groups were formed to promote the book&#x27;s ideas. The largest was Edward Bellamy Association of New York; its honorary members included John Dewey, Heywood Broun and Roger N. Baldwin. Arthur Ernest Morgan, chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, also admired the book and wrote the first biography of Bellamy.

== Legacy and later responses ==
&quot;Looking Backward&quot; influenced the novel &quot;Future of a New China&quot; by Liang Qichao.

Despite never mentioning the book by name in any of his works, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; postulated a socialist-fueled utopia that &quot;confounded&quot; Orwell, and his &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; can be seen as a dystopian counterpoint to the utopian genre, of which &quot;Looking Backward&quot; was a progenitor. Orwell wrote of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot; that &quot;these optimistic forecasts make rather painful reading.&quot;

&quot;Looking Backward&quot; was rewritten in 1974 by American socialist science fiction writer Mack Reynolds as &quot;Looking Backward from the Year 2000&quot;. Matthew Kapell, a historian and anthropologist, examined this re-writing in his essay, &quot;Mack Reynolds&#x27; Avoidance of his own Eighteenth Brumaire: A Note of Caution for Would-Be Utopians&quot;.

In 1984, Herbert Knapp and Mary Knapp&#x27;s &quot;Red, White and Blue Paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama&quot; appeared. The book was in part a memoir of their careers teaching at fabled Balboa High School, but also a re-interpretation of the Canal Zone as a creature of turn-of-the-century Progressivism, a workers&#x27; paradise. The Knapps used Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward&quot; as their heuristic model for understanding Progressive ideology as it shaped the Canal Zone.

A one-act play, &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s Musical Telephone,&quot; was written by Roger Lee Hall and premiered at Emerson College in Boston in 1988 on the centennial year of the novel&#x27;s publication. It was released as a DVD titled &quot;The Musical Telephone&quot;.

Founded in 1989, the club found success early, winning the Third and Second Divisions of São Paulo regional tournaments. In 1998, the club was runner up of the Serie C, and was promoted to Serie B.

=== Serie A era (2000–2006) ===
In 2000, the Brazilian national championship was contested in a rather unusual way. According to previous credentials, teams would play in the First, Second or Third Division; São Caetano played in the Second. The difference was that, after all Divisions were finished, a mini tournament would gather representatives from all of them (one team from Third Division, three from Second and twelve from First), and the winner would be the Brazilian Champion of 2000.

São Caetano was runner-up of the Second Division and qualified to the finals. Beating Fluminense, Palmeiras and Grêmio, they entered the final against Vasco da Gama. The first match ended as a draw. Halfway during the second match, a fence collapsed at Estádio São Januário and the match was suspended. Despite several claims that São Caetano should be declared champion, Vasco petitioned the league for a third match, which Vasco went on to win 3-1. Their runner-up finish gave them qualification for the 2001 Copa Libertadores.

Unlike many teams that rise prominently then quickly fall back to obscurity, São Caetano had another strong campaign in 2001. Playing its first full season in the top division, they topped the table in the first stage, and then reached the finals against Atlético Paranaense. Once again they finished as the runner-up, but consecutive seasons placing well secured their reputation on a national level. In the 2001 Copa Libertadores, &quot;Azulao&quot; reached the round of 16, being eliminated by Palmeiras on penalties.

Sao Caetano had an excellent campaign in the 2002 Copa Libertadores. They began their campaign by topping their group, with four wins and two losses. In the round of 16 they eliminated U. Católica on penalties, setting up a quarter-final matchup with five-time Libertadores champion Peñarol, which they also beat on penalties. In the semi-finals, they faced Club América, and beat them 3-1 on aggregate to advance to the finals against two-time champion Club Olimpia. On 24 July, Sao Caetano won the first leg in Asuncion 1-0, but in the second leg at Pacaembu Stadium Olimpia won 2-1 and sent the game into a penalty shootout. Olimpia won the shootout 4-2, causing Sao Caetano to finish runner-up for the third consecutive time. Despite finishing runner up, Sao Caetano earned respect, and their run to the Libertadores final was seen as an extreme fairytail story. In the 2002 Serie A, Sao Caetano had a good campaign as well, finishing second in the regular season before being eliminated by Fluminense in the quarter-finals. 

The following season, Sao Caetano finished fourth in the league, and qualified for the 2004 Copa Libertadores; In the Libertadores the club eliminated Club America again in the round of 16 before narrowly being knocked out by eventual champions Boca Juniors on penalties in the quarter finals. Also that year, São Caetano won their first title, the Campeonato Paulista, being Paulista from Jundiaí.

On 27 October 2004, while playing in a match against São Paulo, São Caetano defender Serginho suffered a fatal heart attack. As São Caetano&#x27;s staff let Serginho play despite knowing that he had heart problems, the club was penalized heavily by the CBF, which has since marked a decline in their performance, and caused them to be deducted 24 points in the 2004 Serie A. 

The club performed poorly in the 2005 Serie A, finishing seventeenth and just two points off the relegation zone. At the end of the 2006 season, they finished within the relegation zone, and were relegated to the 2007 Serie B. 

=== Free–fall Decline (2007–) ===
In the next few seasons, the club finished in the middle of the Serie B table. In the 2012 Série B, the club had a good season, finishing fifth and only missing out on promotion to the Serie A on goal difference (top four were promoted). However, the 2013 season was the complete opposite; even with the signing of Brazil legend Rivaldo, the club had a poor season and was relegated to Série C after 14 years in the top two divisions of Brazil, and just 10 years after being in the Copa Libertadores finals. In the same year, the team was relegated in the São Paulo state championship, relegated to the Paulista Serie A2. In 2014, the team would begin the season with lackluster performance in the 2nd level of the state championship, in which the team only escaped relegation in the last round. Following a subpar season in the 2014 Série C, the team suffered back to back relegations and found itself in the Série D. 

After an unsuccessful campaign in the Serie D, the club would play only in the state leagues. However, after finishing the 2018 Campeonato Paulista in 7th place, they qualified for the 2019 Serie D. However, since 2019 the club has been in an absolute free fall, suffering three further relegations and playing in the Campeonato Paulista Série A4 as of 2024.

==Stadium==

Built in 1955, São Caetano&#x27;s stadium is Estádio Anacleto Campanella. Its capacity is 22,738 people. However, for Copa Libertadores matches, the club used Pacaembu Stadium because their main stadium did not meet CONMEBOL&#x27;s requirements.

<doc id="608862" wikidata="Q3341413" url="?curid=608862" title="Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Nighthawk is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. There have been several versions of the character: two supervillains-turned-superheroes from the mainstream Marvel Universe continuity (Earth-616), Kyle Richmond (who belonged to the Squadron Sinister) and [[Tilda Johnson]] (the former Deadly Nightshade); two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Jackson F. &quot;Jack&quot; Norriss and Joaquin Pennyworth; five from alternate universes, who belonged to various incarnations of the Squadron Supreme, including Kyle and Neal Richmond of Earth-712, and an African-American version of Kyle Richmond from Earth-31916 who primarily kills white supremacists and mentors Tilda upon travelling to Earth-616; and a [[simulacrum]] of Kyle Richmond created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite to serve as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America, under the command of Phil Coulson.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Scoot McNairy plays impersonator Jackson Norriss in the live-action short film &quot;All Hail the King&quot; (2014), with A. J. Bowen playing the real Jackson Norris in the web series &quot;WHIH Newsfront&quot; (2016).

==Publication history==
Kyle Richmond, the original Nighthawk, debuted as a supervillain in the final panel of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (October 1969). This story is the first chapter of a three-issue story arc by writer Roy Thomas and penciller Sal Buscema. The arc introduced the supervillain team the Squadron Sinister, whose four members were loosely based on heroes in DC Comics&#x27; Justice League of America, with Nighthawk based on Batman.

Following this arc, Nighthawk pursues a solo career, next appearing in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #62 (March 1970). Here, Richmond attempts through underhanded means to tarnish DD&#x27;s reputation and supplant him. Daredevil tricks Richmond into revealing his criminal activities to the public and, after a battle atop a subway, Nighthawk makes good his escape.

Nighthawk next appears in the superhero team title &quot;The Defenders&quot; #13–14 (May–July 1974), he goes to the titular supergroup for help against his former teammates, and joins the team the following issue. &quot;Defenders&quot; writer Len Wein said that adding Nighthawk to the group &quot;gave me a character to play with who didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of previous history ... [a] character I could do anything I wanted to without worrying about how it would affect any other titles that character might appear in.&quot;

Nighthawk appeared on a regular basis in &quot;The Defenders&quot; and a number of other Marvel titles. A long-range story arc in &quot;The Defenders&quot;, beginning in 1979, has Nighthawk under criminal investigation. Writer Ed Hannigan later revealed he planned to end this story arc with Nighthawk being put in prison &quot;for good&quot;, but his run on the series ended before he could bring this to fruition.

Defenders writer David Anthony Kraft said, describing Nighthawk&#x27;s role in the team, &quot;Nighthawk so desperately wanted to be the leader. He would be telling everyone what to do, but no one would listen to him! He may be wealthy and can buy all these toys, but he still gets no respect!&quot;

Nighthawk apparently sacrifices his life in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #106 (cover dated April 1982). The supervillain Dead Ringer impersonates him in &quot;Captain America&quot; #429 (July 1994). In the three-issue miniseries &quot;Nighthawk&quot; (September–November 1998) Richmond is revealed to be alive, but in a coma and brain dead. Through supernatural means, he is revived and resumes his crime-fighting career. He co-starred in the 12-issue run of &quot;The Defenders&quot; vol. 2 (March 2001–February 2002) and the miniseries &quot;The Order&quot; #1-6 (April–September 2002). Nighthawk formed a short-lived version of the Defenders, with the mutant Colossus, the Blazing Skull, and She-Hulk, as part of the Initiative, depicted in the miniseries &quot;The Last Defenders&quot; #1–6 (May–October 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===Kyle Richmond===

Kyle Richmond was born to two wealthy parents and was brought up by his governess while his dad is away. When Kyle&#x27;s mother died in an accident, his father sent him to boarding school. Due to his family&#x27;s money, Kyle got into Grayburn College where he became involved with Mindy Williams who helped him focus through his education. One night, Kyle was caught in a drunk-driving crash in which Mindy was killed, and he was kicked out of school and was unable to return. Kyle later became anti-social, and learned that Grayburn College was closed down due to a lack of funds. Kyle Richmond attempted to join the army, but was rejected due to a heart murmur. Afterwards, Kyle received word that his father died in a plane crash and that Kyle has inherited Richmond Enterprises. Kyle turned to finding a cure for his heart murmur and physically training himself.

While drunk, Kyle Richmond concocted an alchemy serum that he found in an alchemy volume. The alchemy serum enabled Kyle to gain enhanced strength at night. Kyle took on various sports activities to strengthen his natural abilities where he eventually became Nighthawk. Nighthawk and three other supervillains are brought together as the Squadron Sinister by the cosmic entity the Grandmaster to battle the superhero team the Avengers, which has been forced to act as the champions of the time-traveling conqueror Kang the Conqueror. Nighthawk battles the Avenger Captain America, who outfights the villain. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron.

Reunited by the alien Nebulon, the villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the Arctic with a plan to melt the polar ice caps and flood the entirety of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Despite being asked to join the venture, Nighthawk asks for the aid of superhero team the Defenders, who prevent the scheme and defeat the villains and Nebulon.

The character suffers several setbacks as a superhero, including being charged with tax evasion and fraud by the United States government, and arrested by the FBI for operating as a hero while charges were pending. This stipulation was waived after he was forced to reveal his secret identity. Nighthawk&#x27;s cumulative wounds from battle eventually leave him paralyzed. Recovering to the point that he can move at night, Nighthawk continues to aid the Defenders, until resigning from the team. He is advised he is to be cleared of all charges if a predetermined amount is repaid to the government.

After apparently sacrificing his life to stop an organization bent on decimating the people of the Soviet Union, Richmond turns up alive but comatose. He has a vision of an angel that facilitates his healing and bestows on him a &quot;second sight&quot;, which enables him to see criminal acts before they are committed. In return, he must punish the would-be criminals. Once healed, Richmond becomes Nighthawk once again and fights crime until forced into a confrontation with Daredevil, whom he kills. The &quot;angel&quot; then reveals itself to be the demon Mephisto, who transports Nighthawk and Daredevil&#x27;s corpse to Hell, intending to claim Daredevil&#x27;s soul. Nighthawk battles the demons of Hell and manages to revive Daredevil, and together they escape. A sorcerer later purges him of Mephisto&#x27;s gift.

After an adventure with Fantastic Four member the Thing Nighthawk discovers his abilities are increasing, and learns that his former Squadron Sinister teammate Speed Demon has joined the superhero team the New Thunderbolts. After encountering teammate Hyperion, apparently resurrected after being thought dead, and a new Doctor Spectrum (Alice Nugent), Nighthawk briefly joins the New Thunderbolts, but upon discovering he is being used for his fortune, leaves and rejoins the Squadron Sinister. That team learns that the Grandmaster, using an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities, the Wellspring of Power, has been increasing the team-members&#x27; powers. After a battle between the Squadron and the New Thunderbolts, Nighthawk and the other members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.

Nighthawk is initially opposed to the Superhuman Registration Act during the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. Following the death of superhero Black Goliath at the hands of the cyborg clone of Thor on the Pro-Registration Side, Nighthawk joins the Pro-Registration Side, but is defeated in a skirmish with Anti-Registration heroes Falcon and Storm.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Nighthawk joins Howard the Duck, She-Hulk and Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster to form the Fearsome Four when Man-Thing is driven on a rampage. They later discover a plot by Psycho-Man to use Man-Thing&#x27;s volatile empathy to create a weapon.

===Jackson F. &quot;Jack&quot; Norriss===

Jackson F. &quot;Jack&quot; Norriss and his wife Barbara worked with the original Nighthawk and the Defenders. He later became a S.H.I.E.L.D. file-clerk, and then agent often going by the codename Nighthawk. He then went on to be a TV reporter for &quot;Inside America&quot;. He helped psychiatrist Andrea Sterman uncover a conspiracy involving Roxxon Oil, the Commission on Superhuman Activities, S.H.I.E.L.D., Nomad, and the Thunderbolts.

===Joaquin Pennyworth===

After Richmond joins the US government&#x27;s Fifty State Initiative of registered heroes as Nighthawk, he forms a short-lived Initiative version of the Defenders with the mutant Colossus, the Blazing Skull, and She-Hulk. With She-Hulk and Warlord Krang, battling the group the Sons of the Serpent and culminating in a confrontation with his old Defenders foe Yandroth, Yandroth manipulates time and forces Nighthawk to battle a twisted version of his old team, the Squadron Sinister, before being rescued by a future incarnation of the Defenders. Noting that one of the future members is Joaquin Pennyworth, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the son of the one-time leader of the Sons of the Serpent, Richmond asks him to commence training to become the new Nighthawk, before retiring himself.

===Squadron Supreme of America version===
A new version of Kyle Richmond is a member of the Squadron Supreme of America. He is revealed to be a simulacrum created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite to obey Phil Coulson. Nighthawk was programmed to be in top physical condition while sporting some doubt and jealousy for his teammates enough for him to brood. In his personal time, he is a U.S. congressman elected to the House of Representatives to represent Washington DC.

In the team&#x27;s first mission, Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme of America fought Namor and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska.

Then, the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Kyle was at a congressional hearing when a code red was issued that sent the representatives to the tunnels below. He and the other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Coulson brought them up to speed with Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s invasion. Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme of America fight an army of Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Coulson sends them to Ohio, which has become a battleground.

Nighthawk was with the Squadron Supreme when they attempted to apprehend Black Panther, when he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Coulson.

During the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline where reality is altered to feature a world without the Avengers, Nighthawk was with the Squadron Supreme of America when they fought the Masters of Doom. Nighthawk engaged his enemy Black Skull (a version of Red Skull possessed by the Venom symbiote). Following the fight, Blade (whose memories remained intact) confronted Nighthawk to learn more about this reality. He was unable to get any answers. Nighthawk is later called in by police commissioner Luke Cage to deal with a breakout at Ravencroft. Nighthawk defeats most of them easily, but experiences trouble with the Black Skull (whose symbiote wants to return to Nighthawk) and Deadpool (who intends to kill him despite being ordered not to by the breakout&#x27;s mastermind the Goblin). After defeating the Black Skull and Deadpool, Nighthawk confronts the Goblin, who exposes the former&#x27;s partner Dr. Gwen Stacy/Nightbird to Goblin Gas in order to make her kill Nighthawk. While Nighthawk cures Stacy and spares the Goblin, the villain reveals to Nighthawk how the world has changed. Following this, Nighthawk returns to his headquarters to review Ravencroft&#x27;s surveillance footage and discovers Blade and Captain America helped Lopez escape. Later, Black Panther assumes the Ronin alias and breaks into the Squadron&#x27;s headquarters to steal their files. After fighting Nighthawk, he escapes and joins Blade&#x27;s group. Nighthawk was with the Squadron Supreme of America when they discuss their encounters with various heroes and concerns about their world being wrong. Putting aside their differences and without telling President Coulson, they gather clues and rule out suspects before eventually arriving in Wakanda where they confront the Avengers. Nighthawk and the rest of the Squadron Supreme are defeated by the Avengers after a fight with them. When reality is returned to normal, Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme of America find their memories transferred to their counterparts in the Avengers&#x27; reality and struggle to find their place in an unfamiliar world.

During the &quot;Infinite Destinies&quot; storyline, Nighthawk stalks Nick Fury Jr. and wants him to bring his world back. He proceeds to capture Star in order to pull it off. Nick Fury Jr. defeats Nighthawk who manages to escape.

As Nighthawk is being driven around by his Life Model Decoy servants while noting that his entire life is a lie, his car is then intercepted by Black Panther who has noted his nocturnal crime-fighting and outdriving the Sun. Black Panther is told by Nightwing that he resigned as the ambassador to Wakanda because &quot;Kyle Richmond never existed&quot; and states that he was just a &quot;straw man&quot; that the devil created while Nighthawk was real. Black Panther notes that they have a mutual dislike of Mephisto for his role in the alternate reality. As Black Panther needs every ally he can kind with Mephisto going Multiversal, Nighthawk takes up Black Panther&#x27;s offer as Black Panther resigns as Chairman of the Avengers for an undisclosed leave of absence. Later in New York City, Nighthawk crashes the worshiping of the Serpent Society at their old Serpent Solutions headquarters. The rest of the Avengers arrive to find Nighthawk had defeated the Serpent Society. The portal that the Serpent Society summoned opens as Mephisto&#x27;s dog form. Nighthawk mentioned that the serpent was one of Mephisto&#x27;s forms as he plans to put Mephisto down. After Mephisto makes the Council of Red known to them, the Avengers hold a vote and allow Nighthawk to join the Avengers. He states that they will need a time machine for where they can trigger a confrontation with the Council of Red. He then proceeds to join the Avengers in confronting the Serpent Society after they escaped from police custody and are killing people while making their way across the Brooklyn Bridge.

===Tilda Johnson===

After meeting the Nighthawk of Earth-31916 and helping him defend Chicago from a group of white nationalists called the True Patriots, Tilda Johnson decides to reform her image as the supervillain Nightshade and train under Nighthawk. Sometime later, they help Hawkeye and Red Wolf after they find barrels of epidurium, a synthetic skin used to build Life-Model Decoys, on a truck that was hijacked. They go to an abandoned coal factory where they end up being attacked by armed soldiers led by Nick Fury. It&#x27;s later revealed that Nick Fury, as well as Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones and the other agents, are Life-Model Decoys. They later thwart an attack by gunmen attempting to rob the base. After defeating the gunmen, Tilda decides to join Hawkeye and Red Wolf on the Avengers, saying her goodbyes to Nighthawk.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, while Hawkeye joins the Underground resistance following Hydra&#x27;s takeover in the United States, the rest of the team gather their own resistance army to help the people in rural areas that are being affected by Hydra&#x27;s cruel treatment. Tilda is revealed to have become the new Nighthawk, after the Nighthawk of Earth-31916 was killed by Hydra soldiers. After several successful victories, the resistance heads to a secret base in South Dakota and prepares for their next attack until Hydra forces raid the base. During the battle, Red Wolf and Tilda have a private conversation, in which both confess their feelings for each other, and they share a kiss. They then head out to help the resistance defeat Hydra.

==Powers and abilities==

==Other versions==
===Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)===
Roy Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an alternate-universe team of heroes called the Squadron Supreme, who debut in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 (February 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat. The characters (including Nighthawk) were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel&#x27;s production department, as the covers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 and #141 (November 1975) &quot;cover-blurbed&quot; appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

The heroic Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the Serpent Cartel, but eventually team together and prevent the use of the artifact the Serpent Crown. The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title &quot;Thor&quot;, when the evil version of Hyperion attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Thunder God Thor.

Richmond later retires as Nighthawk, feeling that he can better serve the public good as a politician, eventually becoming President of the United States. However, President Richmond is mentally assaulted by the alien entity known as the Over-Mind, who nearly obliterates the real Richmond&#x27;s mind and then embarks on a campaign of world domination via an artificial duplicate of the President. The real Richmond is rescued by a psychic entity from Earth-616 with ties to that world&#x27;s Kyle Richmond, and reconstructs his mind to make him temporarily believe that he is the Nighthawk of Earth-616 (then presumed deceased by his teammates in the Defenders). When the other Squadron members, save for Hyperion, are mind-controlled by the Overmind (who itself is later revealed to be a pawn of another alien menace, Null the Living Darkness), Hyperion and Nighthawk recruit the Defenders to help free the Squadron and defeat the alien threat. When the Richmond working with the Overmind is revealed to be artificial, Nighthawk recalls his true identity and rejoins the Squadron Supreme.

The Squadron&#x27;s Earth lies in shambles after the Overmind&#x27;s attempt to conquer the world. Led by Hyperion, the Squadron believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a utopia. Nighthawk resigns in protest, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule; he also ponders assassinating Hyperion to try to halt the Squadron&#x27;s plans before they begin. At a joint press conference, Richmond resigns as President of the United States and the Squadron announces its plans to the public; Richmond comes prepared to kill Hyperion, but cannot bring himself to do so. The Squadron assumes control of the United States and remakes the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implements a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of behavior modification in prisons; enforcing a strict gun control policy, and developing medical technology to resurrect the dead.

Predicting a nightmarish outcome to the Squadron&#x27;s so-called &quot;Utopia Program&quot;, Nighthawk attempts in vain to solicit the aid of the Avengers, and then recruits former Squadron foes and newly emerged superhumans to form a team called the Redeemers. They eventually confront the Squadron, and a brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes Nighthawk was in fact right and ends the battle, and the Squadron disband and release control of the United States to the government.

The Earth-712 Nighthawk lacks superhuman powers but possesses extensive training and uses a variety of advanced weaponry.

===Neal Richmond (Earth-712)===
When the remnants of the Squadron Supreme returns to their home universe in the one-shot &quot;Squadron Supreme: New World Order&quot;, they encounter a new Nighthawk, adopted son of Kyle Richmond and biological son of Kyle&#x27;s foe the Huckster. The Squadron&#x27;s reality is now dominated by corporations using the Squadron&#x27;s own Utopia technologies, with the characters eventually reinstating democracy. For years prior to the Squadron Supreme&#x27;s return, Neal had organized and supervised a resistance force dubbed the &quot;Nighthawks&quot; who battle the Blue Eagles enlisted by the corporate New World Order. Nighthawk later joins the Squadron.

Nighthawk and the Squadron come into conflict with a new government when interdimensional team the Exiles reveal that the government rigged the election with worldwide vote fraud. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government, and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.

This character lacks powers but possesses extensive training and uses a variety of advanced weaponry.

===Earth X===
In Earth X, Kyle Richmond is an elderly retired superhero. Kyle Richmond&#x27;s eyes, given by a disguised Mephisto, allow him to see into the future. He dictates what he sees to his colleague, Isaac Christians, so that a record can be kept of what will become of history. The Earth-9997 version lacks powers but possess extensive training and use a variety of advanced weaponry.

===Ultimate Marvel (Earth-1610)===
The Ultimate Marvel alternate universe title &quot;The Ultimates&quot; features a non-powered version of Nighthawk who is the leader of a version of the Defenders. Nighthawk&#x27;s only attempt at heroics involves leaping from the shadows at a group of petty criminals – only to break his ankle and be severely beaten. In &quot;Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates&quot;, he and the Defenders are seen to have gained superhuman powers from Loki.

===Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)===
The mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Squadron Supreme. This version of Kyle Richmond, an African-American, first appears in the limited series &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, and utilizes his wealth to train and develop advanced weaponry and devices to aid in his campaign on crime as a vigilante. Although the character aids the loose formation of heroes that eventually become the Squadron Supreme, Nighthawk chooses to remain aloof and only interacts with them when necessary. The character also appears in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Supreme Power: Nighthawk&quot;, in which he investigates an epidemic of drug addiction in Chicago, and learns it is the work of serial killer Whiteface. Nighthawk apprehends and executes the criminal, but not before he causes the deaths of the Mayor and his family.

After the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Richmond was transported to the regular Marvel Universe. In 2016 Marvel published a comic featuring the character titled &quot;Nighthawk&quot;, which ran for six issues. The character worked on reforming Chicago and targeted racism and police brutality with the aid of ex-supervillain Tilda Johnson / Deadly Nightshade. The character also joins the local reality&#x27;s Squadron Supreme, assassinating (and resurrecting) Namor.

Nighthawk and Deadly Nightshade later encounter Hawkeye and Red Wolf. He is machine-gunned to death shortly afterwards, and succeeded as Nighthawk by Deadly Nightshade.

<doc id="608864" wikidata="Q7994906" url="?curid=608864" title="White House Plumbers">
<text>The White House Plumbers, sometimes simply called the Plumbers, the Room 16 Project, ODESSA or more officially, the White House Special Investigations Unit, was a covert White House Special Investigations Unit, established within a week of the publication of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; in June 1971, during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Its task was to stop and/or respond to the leaking of classified information, such as the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, to the news media. The work of the unit &quot;tapered off&quot; after the bungled &quot;Ellsberg break-in&quot; but some of its former operatives branched into illegal activities while still employed at the White House together with managers of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, including the Watergate break-in and the ensuing Watergate scandal. The group has been described as Nixon&#x27;s &quot;fixers&quot;.

==Name==
On Thanksgiving, 1971, David Young arrived home from his planning at the Special Investigative Unit, when his grandmother asked him, &quot;What do you do at the White House?&quot;, he replied, &quot;I am helping the president stop some leaks&quot;, purposely playing off on information leak versus water leak. She exclaimed, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re a plumber!&quot; Young, E. Howard Hunt, and G. Gordon Liddy then put up a sign on their office with the title &quot;The Plumbers&quot;, but it was taken down as their operations were intended to be top secret. Still, the name stuck for the group.

==Members==
The Plumbers came to include several Watergate figures including Frank Sturgis. Hunt was recommended by Charles Colson, and Liddy was recommended by Egil Krogh. Liddy coined his own sensitivity indicator for the group in the form of &quot;ODESSA&quot;. ODESSA stood for &quot;&quot;Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen&quot;,&quot; Liddy termed the unit&#x27;s mission as &quot;directed to eliminate subversion of the secrets of the administration.&quot; He marked the Plumber&#x27;s official papers with the monicker.

Central Intelligence Agency officer John Paisley worked with the Plumbers through the CIA&#x27;s Office of Security, of which Nixon campaign security coordinator and Watergate burglar James McCord was once a member. On August 9, 1971, Young&#x27;s memo indicates he met with Paisley and OS Director Howard Osborn, in which Paisley provided a list of objectives for the Special Investigations Unit.

==Operations==
The Plumbers&#x27; first task was the burglary of the office of Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s Los Angeles psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding, in an effort to uncover evidence to discredit Ellsberg, who had leaked the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. The operation was reportedly unsuccessful in finding Ellsberg&#x27;s file and was thus reported to the White House. However, Fielding himself stated the file was in his office; he found it on the floor on the morning after the burglary and quite clearly, someone had gone through it. In a September 1971 conversation, John Ehrlichman advised Nixon, &quot;We had one little operation; it&#x27;s been aborted out in Los Angeles which, I think, is better that you don&#x27;t know about.&quot; Eventually, the case against Ellsberg was dismissed due to government misconduct.

Aside from the Fielding burglary, there are few other activities the Plumbers were known to have been engaged in. Hunt reportedly looked into the Ted Kennedy-Chappaquiddick incident; and Liddy reported the alleged involvement of the Kennedy administration in the assassination of South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem.

After the California break-in, Liddy—who was general counsel, a member of the finance committee of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) and promoted from aide to Krogh and Young—worked with Campaign political-intelligence operations. Ehrlichman, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Special Investigations Unit, knew about Liddy&#x27;s goal to perform an intelligence-gathering operation for the CRP. Liddy involved Hunt in the operations which would later include the Watergate burglary.

<doc id="608865" wikidata="Q3272785" url="?curid=608865" title="Parathyroid chief cell">
<text>Parathyroid chief cells (also called parathyroid principal cells or simply parathyroid cells) are the primary cell type of the parathyroid gland. They produce and secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to low calcium levels. PTH plays an important role in regulating blood calcium levels by raising the amount of calcium in the blood. 

Parathyroid chief cells are much more prevalent in the parathyroid gland than the oxyphil cells. Oxyphil cells may be derived from chief cells at puberty, as they are not present at birth like chief cells.

Most individuals display four parathyroid glands adjacent to the thyroid gland anterior in the neck.

==Histology==
The chief cells are organized as dense cords surrounding the capillaries in the parathyroid. Parathyroid chief cells make up the majority of the parathyroid gland along with adipocytes and oxyphil cells. Parathyroid chief cells have large amounts of organelles associated with protein synthesis. As in many endocrine organs, with age, more oxyphil cells appear in the parathyroid gland. Parathyroid tissue seems to have a low turn-over rate.

Chief cells appear as a dark purple in an H&amp;E stain, with the oxyphil cells staining as a lighter pink. They are polygonal in shape with a round nucleus.

Chief cells spend most time inactive due to normal calcium level conditions. These inactive cells are classified as cuboidal. They have low levels of secretory granules, as opposed to active chief cells. These granules can contain acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatase is only found in larger secretory granules, 400 to 900 nm in diameter, and is less prevalent in smaller granules. This acid phosphatase is also present in the Golgi apparatus of the chief cell. However, the Golgi apparatus areas associated with parathyroid hormone packaging contained little or no acid phosphatase. The chief cells become active in response to low calcium in the blood. The low level is sensed by the calcium- sensing receptor. These active cells have a greater electron density than the inactive chief cells. The electron density is caused by the secretory granules. The chief cell is thought to have a clear cytoplasm.

==Function==
The chief cells of the parathyroid glands sense the amount of calcium in the blood, and release the calcium-increasing hormone parathyroid hormone (PTH) accordingly to correct or maintain normal blood calcium levels. It therefore regulates calcium metabolism as part of the endocrine system. PTH raises calcium levels by releasing calcium from bone storage, as well as retaining calcium from the urine, and alerts the intestines to absorb more calcium from ingested nutrients. Too much of either hormone can be an indicator of disease.

=== Calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) ===
The secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is regulated by the interaction of the calcium-sensing receptor with calcium in the blood. The calcium-sensing receptor is present on the plasma membrane of the chief cells. The CaR is a G protein-coupled receptor, as part of the C family. The CaR is divided into three general domains. These include an NH2-terminal extracellular end, a COOH-terminal intracellular end, and seven transmembrane domains. The CaR interacts positively with phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylyl cyclase. The CaR includes phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA). The phosphorylation of the PLC is seen to inhibit the secretion of PTH due to high calcium levels in the blood. The function of the PKA sites is currently unknown.

==Clinical significance==
=== Hyperparathyroidism ===
Because the formation of PTH regulates the calcium level in the blood, it can affect all areas of the body. The overactivity of a parathyroid gland is known as hyperparathyroidism. It is unknown what directly causes hyperparathyroidism. However there are many factors that can cause over-secretion of PTH. The further consequence of this disorder can be osteopenia, or even osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density. This leaves bones more porous, fragile, and likely to experience fracture. This can be detected by usage of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Interesting enough, a derivative of synthetic PTH is often given to patients with osteoporosis to combat the disease.

=== Vitamin D deficiency ===

Vitamin D in the kidney assists in the absorption of calcium in the blood. Some individuals may be vitamin D deficient, which prevents them from retaining calcium. While their parathyroid gland is functional, it senses a very low level of calcium in the blood and constantly secretes hormone, increasing PTH levels.

=== Medications ===

There are many drugs that can affect calcium level in the blood, and therefore PTH secretion. For example, many individuals may take a calcium carbonate supplement, which increases the calcium level in the blood. PTH is decreased. Many medications may also increase urination, furthering loss of calcium.

=== Parathyroid adenoma ===

A parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism. They are more commonly found in women than in men. In this form, the chief cells mutate to exhibit multiple nuclei. Chief cells in parathyroid adenomas also display acid phosphatase activity. It is a benign tumor of the gland that requires surgical removal. These benign adenomas are typically affect only one or two of the parathyroid glands, known respectively as a single adenoma or double adenoma. Typically, no disease is linked to the cause. A primary adenoma can only develop as a primary cause.

=== Chief cell hyperplasia ===
In many way, chief cell hyperplasia is similar to parathyroid adenoma. The hyperplasia is seen as an enlargement of all four of the parathyroid glands, as opposed to a parathyroid adenoma is viewed as an enlargement of one gland. Chief cell hyperplasia is a common disorder in individuals with other endocrine abnormalities, though it may still occur sporadically. A chief cell hyperplasia can develop from either a primary or secondary cause.

=== Parathyroid carcinoma ===
In extremely rare cases, a malignant tumor may develop within the parathyroid gland. They can be detected intraoperatively, imaging, or through blood testing. A thick fibrous capsule is usually present around the gland, as opposed to the thin capsule present in benign adenomas. Parathyroid hormone level is often greater in carcinomas than in benign disorders.

=== Hypoparathyroidism ===

There are very few cases of hypoparathyroidism. Most often, it is related with surgical removal of the parathyroid glands. It can also be due to a head or neck injury and further loss of function of the glands. Hypoparathyroidism can also be linked to a low serum magnesium level in the blood. Serum magnesium is necessary for full secretion of PTH. Without the parathyroid glands, there is no trigger to release calcium into the blood. Another consequence of hypoparathyroidism is the lack of calcium in the blood to trigger muscle contraction. Without calcium present, muscles innervation is unable to take place. This is especially crucial in the function of the most important muscle of the body – the heart.

<text>Bornaviridae is a family of negative-strand RNA viruses in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Horses, sheep, cattle, rodents, birds, reptiles, and humans serve as natural hosts. Diseases associated with bornaviruses include Borna disease, a fatal neurologic disease of mammals restricted to central Europe; and proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) in birds. Bornaviruses may cause encephalitis in mammals like horses or sheep. The family includes 11 species assigned to three genera.

== History ==
Borna disease was first identified in 1926 and its genome was isolated in 1990. The ICTV proposed the creation in 1996 of the family &quot;Bornaviridae&quot; along with the genus &quot;Bornaviru&quot;s (today &quot;Orthobornavirus&quot;). The viral family is named after the city of Borna in Saxony, Germany, which is where many animals were lost to the sporadic encephalopathy caused by the viral disease.

== Structure ==

Orthobornavirions are enveloped, with spherical geometries and helical capsids. The diameter is around 70 to 130 nm. Genomes are made of negative-sense single-stranded RNA. They are linear, monopartite and around 8.9 kbp in length. The genome codes for nine proteins.

Proteins of orthobornaviruses that have been characterized:
== Life cycle ==

In the &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; order, &quot;Bornaviridae&quot; is one of only two families with viruses that replicate in the nucleus. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral GP glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the negative stranded RNA virus replication model. Negative stranded RNA virus transcription, using polymerase stuttering, with some alternative splicing mechanism, is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export. This virus usually has a highly variable incubation period of around a few weeks to several months. Horses, sheep, cattle, rodents, birds, and humans serve as the natural hosts. Transmission routes are fomites, contact, urine, feces, and saliva.

== Pathogenicity ==
Between 2011 and 2013, three German breeders of variegated squirrels (&quot;Sciurus variegatoides&quot;) had encephalitis with similar clinical signs and died 2 to 4 months after onset of the clinical symptoms. Genomic analysis found a previously unknown orthobornavirus in a contact squirrel and in brain tissue from the three men, the researchers reported, and it is the &quot;likely causative agent&quot; in their deaths. Prior to this, bornaviruses were not thought to be responsible for human diseases. More VSBV-1 infected squirrels from the subfamilies Sciurinae and Callosciurinae were also confirmed to be present not only in Germany but in the Netherlands. Zero VSBV-1 positive squirrels showed clinical signs of infection. Since behavioral disease has been studied in BoDV-1 infected animals like rhesus monkeys, tree shrews, and rats, BoDV-1 has also been hypothesized to be associated with humans psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and affective psychoses. In several studies with large sample sizes, there has been an association with increased presence of BoDV-1 antibodies in hospitalized psychiatric patients and a higher seroprevalence rate among the psychiatric patients when compared to the control groups.

<doc id="608878" wikidata="Q3326185" url="?curid=608878" title="Oxyphil cell (parathyroid)">
<text>Parathyroid oxyphil cells are one out of the two types of cells found in the parathyroid gland, the other being parathyroid chief cell. Oxyphil cells are only found in a select few number of species and humans are one of them.

These cells can be found in clusters in the center of the section and at the periphery. Oxyphil cells appear at the onset of puberty, but have no known function. It is perceived that oxyphil cells may be derived from chief cells at puberty, as they are not present at birth like chief cells. Oxyphil cells increase in number with age.

== Structure ==
Oxyphil cells may be binucleated and proteins found within their cytoplasms are basic, resulting in acidophilic cytoplasms. Cytochemically, oxyphil cells and C cells are fairly similar. Oxyphil cells are much larger in size (12–20 μm) compared with chief cells (6–8 μm) and also stain lighter than chief cells. Oxyphil cells have a cytoplasm filled with many, large mitochondria. Oxyphil cells have abundant cytoplasmic glycogen and ribosomes that are interspersed between the mitochondria. The endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatuses, and secretory granules are poorly developed in oxyphil cells of normal parathyroid glands

== Function ==
With nuclear medicine scans, they selectively take up the Technetium-sestamibi complex radiotracer to allow delineation of glandular anatomy.
Oxyphil cells have been shown to express parathyroid-relevant genes found in the chief cells and have the potential to produce additional autocrine/paracrine factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and calcitriol. Oxyphil cells have also been shown to have higher oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme activity than chief cells due to having more mitochondria. Oxyphil cells have significantly more calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) than chief cells. More work needs to be done to fully understand the functions of these cells and their secretions.
