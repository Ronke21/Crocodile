<text>Borbetomagus are a free jazz/noise rock group. They are cited by critics as pioneers of aggressive improvised noise music.

== Biography ==
Borbetomagus formed in 1979 when saxophone players Jim Sauter and Don Dietrich joined with electric guitarist Donald Miller. Sauter and Deitrich were fans of and frequent callers to Miller&#x27;s radio show on WKCR (Columbia University) which lead to them collaborating. Bass guitarist Adam Nodelman was briefly a member, and they have occasionally collaborated with others.

Their aggressive music has been described as &quot;a huge, overpowering, take-no-prisoners mass of sound.&quot; One extended technique they use is called &quot;bells together&quot; where Sauter and Dietrich place the bells (openings) of their saxophones against one other while playing. 

While the core trio listed above has been responsible for most of Borbetomagus&#x27;s music, they have collaborated with Swiss circuit bending duo Voice Crack, Dutch cellist Tristan Honsinger, German double-bassist Peter Kowald, multi-instrumentalist Milo Fine, the band Fat on their album Hit, and others. In 2006, they recorded a collaborative album with Hijokaidan live at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville, Canada, and in 2007 their long out-of-print cassette &quot;Live In Allentown&quot; was released on CD with nearly twice as much material as the original. Sauter and Dietrich have also recorded a duo album and a collaborative album with Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore. 

== Name ==
Borbetomagus refers to the Celtic origin of the German city of Worms.

== Influence ==

They are considered widely influential on the Japanese noise music scene, as demonstrated by the re-release of their limited &quot;Live At Inroads&quot; cassette on CD by the Japanese label P.S.F. Records, as well as having a CD released by Osaka-based noise label Alchemy Records.

They have been influential on many American rock, free jazz, and noise musicians, such as Sonic Youth, Pelt, Thomas Ankersmit, and Kevin Drumm. Miller has worked with Pelt; he now resides in New Orleans, where he frequently collaborates live with Rob Cambre and others on E-Bowed guitars.

<text>Timothy (c. 1844 – 3 April 2004) was a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise, estimated to be about 160 years old at the time of her death. This made her the UK&#x27;s oldest known animal resident. In spite of her name, Timothy was female; gender identification for tortoises was not properly known in the 19th century. Timothy was named after a tortoise owned by Gilbert White.

Timothy was believed to have been born in the Mediterranean shores of the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey) and was found aboard a Portuguese privateer in 1854, aged around 10, by Captain John Guy Courtenay-Everard of the Royal Navy. The tortoise served as a mascot on a series of navy vessels until 1892. She was the ship mascot of during the first bombardment of Sevastopol in the Crimean War (she was the last survivor of this war), then moved to followed by .

After her naval service, she retired to live out her life on dry land, taken in by the Earl of Devon at his home, Powderham Castle. From 1935, she lived in the castle&#x27;s rose garden and was owned by Camilla Gabrielle Courtenay (1913–2010), the daughter of the 16th Earl of Devon. On her underside was etched &quot;Where have I fallen? What have I done?&quot;, English translation of the Courtenay family motto &quot;ubi lapsus, quid feci&quot;.

In 1926, Timothy&#x27;s owners decided that he should mate, and then &quot;he&quot; was discovered to be actually female. Despite this information, mating attempts were unsuccessful.

Timothy is buried at Powderham Castle.

<doc id="589167" wikidata="Q1384903" url="?curid=589167" title="Frank Morley">
<text>Frank Morley (September 9, 1860 – October 17, 1937) was a leading mathematician, known mostly for his teaching and research in the fields of algebra and geometry. Among his mathematical accomplishments was the discovery and proof of the celebrated Morley&#x27;s trisector theorem in elementary plane geometry.

He led 50 Ph.D. students, including Clara Latimer Bacon, to their degrees, and was said to be
:... one of the more striking figures of the relatively small group of men who initiated that development which, within his own lifetime, brought Mathematics in America from a minor position to its present place in the sun.

==Life==
Morley was born in the town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, England. His parents were Elizabeth Muskett and Joseph Roberts Morley, Quakers who ran a china shop. After being educated at Woodbridge School, Morley went on to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (B.A., 1884).

In 1887, Morley moved to Pennsylvania. He taught at Haverford College until 1900, when he became chairman of the mathematics department at Johns Hopkins University. His publications include &quot;Elementary Treatise on the Theory of Functions&quot; (1893), with James Harkness; and &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions&quot; (1898). In 1897, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1917. He was President of the American Mathematical Society from 1919 to 1920 and was the editor of the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot; from 1900 to 1921. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1912 at Cambridge (England), in 1924 at Toronto, and in 1936 at Oslo.

In 1933 he and his son Frank Vigor Morley published the &quot;stimulating volume&quot; &quot;Inversive Geometry&quot;. The book develops complex numbers as a tool for geometry and function theory. Some non-standard terminology is used such as &quot;base-circle&quot; for unit circle and &quot;turn&quot; for a point on it.

He was a strong chess player and once beat world chess champion Emanuel Lasker in a game.

He died in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 77.

He had three sons: novelist Christopher Morley; Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, journalist, and college president Felix Morley; and Frank Vigor Morley, also a mathematician.

<text>Peter Engel (born 1959) is an American origami artist and theorist, science writer, graphic designer, and architect. He has written several books on Origami, including &quot;Origami from Angelfish to Zen&quot;, &quot;10-Fold Origami: Fabulous Paperfolds You Can Make in Just 10 Steps!&quot;, and &quot;Origami Odyssey&quot;.

==Education==
Engel studied the history and philosophy of science as an undergraduate at Harvard University, where he began studying origami seriously under design scientist Arthur Loeb. In 1987 he graduated from Columbia University with a master&#x27;s degree in architecture.

==Works==
&quot;Folding the Universe: Origami from Angelfish to Zen&quot; (1989) is his first book on origami. It is a highly unusual origami book in that besides the usual folding instructions, a significant portion was devoted to essays on the history of the craft as well as the theory. By exploring the relationship between art and science, and between creation, invention, and discovery, Engel provides unusual insights on the craft medium which has strict inherent constraints in favouring simple, geometric patterns and yet holds enough creative possibility within it to capture an unexpected range of complex forms. His models range from a unique coiled rattlesnake to a charming dollar bill bow tie to a delicate, detailed butterfly. The book also contains an interview with the legendary Japanese origami artist Akira Yoshizawa.

&quot;Folding the Universe&quot; was later re-released as &quot;Origami from Angelfish to Zen&quot;.

&quot;10-Fold Origami: Fabulous Paperfolds You Can Make in Just 10 Steps!&quot; (2009) is his second book on origami.

&quot;Origami Odyssey: A Journey to the Edge of Paperfolding&quot; (2011) is his third book on origami.

Engel&#x27;s writings on science have appeared in various publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

<text>Second Life is a multiplayer virtual world that allows people to create an avatar for themselves and then interact with other users and user-created content within a multi-user online environment. Developed for personal computers and owned by the San Francisco-based firm Linden Lab, it launched on June 23, 2003 and saw rapid growth for some years; in 2013 it had approximately one million regular users. Growth eventually stabilized, and by the end of 2017, the active user count had fallen to &quot;between 800,000 and 900,000&quot;. In many ways, &quot;Second Life&quot; is similar to massively multiplayer online role-playing video games; nevertheless, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: &quot;There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective.&quot;

The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab&#x27;s own client software or via alternative third-party viewers. &quot;Second Life&quot; users, also called &#x27;residents&#x27;, create virtual representations of themselves, called &quot;avatars&quot;, and are able to interact with places, objects and other avatars. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in both individual and group activities, build, create, shop, and trade virtual property and services with one another.

The platform principally features 3D-based user-generated content. &quot;Second Life&quot; also has its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar (L$), which is exchangeable with real world currency. &quot;Second Life&quot; is intended for people ages 16 and over, with the exception of 13–15-year-old users, who are restricted to the &quot;Second Life&quot; region of a sponsoring institution (e.g., a school).

== History ==

Philip Rosedale formed Linden Lab in 1999 with the intention of developing computer hardware to allow people to become immersed in a virtual world. In its earliest form, the company struggled to produce a commercial version of the hardware, known as &quot;The Rig&quot;, which in prototype form was seen as a clunky steel contraption with computer monitors worn on shoulders. That vision changed into the software application Linden World, in which people participated in task-based games and socializing in a three-dimensional online environment. That effort eventually transformed into the better-known, user-centered &quot;Second Life&quot;. Although he was familiar with the metaverse of Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, Rosedale has said that his vision of virtual worlds predates that book, and that he conducted early virtual world experiments during his college years at the University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics.

&quot;Second Life&quot; began to receive significant media attention in 2005 and 2006, including a cover story in &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine featuring the virtual world and &quot;Second Life&quot; avatar Anshe Chung. By that time, Anshe Chung had become &quot;Second Life&quot;″s poster child and symbol for the economic opportunities that the virtual world offers to its residents. At the same time, the service saw a period of exponential growth of its user base.

One of the principal developers, Cory Ondrejka, was forced to resign as chief technology officer in December 2007, with Rosedale citing irreconcilable differences in the way the company was run. Nevertheless, the platform continued to grow rapidly, and by January 2008, residents spent a total of 28,274,505 hours &quot;inworld&quot; and on average 38,000 residents were logged in at any moment. The maximum concurrency (number of avatars inworld) recorded was set at 88,200 in the first quarter of 2009.

&quot;Second Life&quot; was honored at the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the development of online sites with user-generated content in 2008, adding to the media attention. Rosedale accepted the award, although he had announced plans to step down from his position as Linden Lab CEO and to become chairman of Linden Lab&#x27;s board of directors instead in March 2008. Rosedale announced Mark Kingdon as the new CEO effective May 15, 2008. In 2010, Kingdon was replaced by Rosedale, who took over as interim CEO. After four months, Rosedale abruptly stepped down from the Interim CEO position. It was announced in October 2010 that Bob Komin, Linden Lab&#x27;s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, would take over the CEO job for the immediate future.

With the platform&#x27;s failure to continue its high rate of growth after 2009, Linden Lab announced layoffs of 30% of its workforce in 2010. Some 21.3 million accounts were registered by this point, although the company did not make public any statistics regarding actual long-term consistent usage and numbers of dormant accounts.

Despite speculation as to the actual size of the user base, &quot;Second Life&quot; continued as a commercial success. In 2015, &quot;Second Life&quot; users cashed out approximately $60,000,000 (60 million US dollars) and &quot;Second Life&quot; had an estimated GDP of $500,000,000 (500 million US dollars), higher than some small countries.

Recognizing improvements in computing power and particularly in computer graphics, Linden Lab began work on a successor to &quot;Second Life&quot;, a VR experience called &quot;Sansar&quot;, launching a public beta in July 2017. Uptake was low and Linden Lab halted development in 2020 to focus their attention fully on &quot;Second Life&quot;. The rights to &quot;Sansar&quot;&#x27;s assets were sold to Wookey Search Technologies, who are expected to continue development on the title without Linden Lab. &quot;Second Life&quot;, the usage of which peaked in the first decade of the 21st century, has been cited as the first example of the metaverse, a concept which has been taken up by other major corporations such as Facebook in 2021. As a notable precursor (which retains a small and loyal following), it provides several examples of virtual reality social issues and lessons learned.

== Classification ==

During a 2001 meeting with investors, Rosedale noticed that the participants were particularly responsive to the collaborative, creative potential of &quot;Second Life&quot;. As a result, the initial objective-driven, gaming focus of &quot;Second Life&quot; was shifted to a more user-created, community-driven experience.

&quot;Second Life&quot;″s status as a virtual world, a computer game, or a talker, is frequently debated. Unlike traditional computer games, &quot;Second Life&quot; does not have a designated objective, nor traditional game play mechanics or rules. It can also be argued that &quot;Second Life&quot; is a multi-user virtual world, because its virtual world facilitates interaction between multiple users. As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to &quot;Second Life&quot;. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker, &quot;Second Life&quot; contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses. In March 2006, while speaking at Google TechTalks, Rosedale said: &quot;So, we don&#x27;t see this as a game. We see it as a platform.&quot;

&quot;Second Life&quot; used to offer two main grids: one for adults (18+) and one for teens. In August 2010, Linden Lab closed the teen grid due to operating costs. Since then, users 16 and over can sign up for a free account. Other limited accounts are available for educators who use &quot;Second Life&quot; with younger students.

There are three activity-based classifications, called &quot;Ratings&quot;, for sims in &quot;Second Life&quot;:
:# General (formerly &quot;PG&quot;) – no extreme violence or nudity
:# Moderate (formerly &quot;Mature&quot;) – some violence, swearing, adult situations, nudity
:# Adult – may contain overt sexual activity, nudity, and violence

, live streaming service Twitch lists Second Life as a &#x27;prohibited game&#x27; which cannot be streamed on the service.

== Residents and avatars ==

There is no charge for creating a &quot;Second Life&quot; account or for making use of the world for any period of time. Linden Lab reserves the right to charge for the creation of large numbers of multiple accounts for a single person (5 per household, 2 per 24 hours) but at present does not do so. A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member&#x27;s avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week. This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts. Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of &quot;Second Life&quot; do not upgrade beyond the free &quot;basic&quot; account.

Avatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life. They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. &quot;Second Life&quot; culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person&#x27;s multiple accounts are referred to as &quot;alternate character&quot; (&quot;alts&quot;)).
Avatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because &quot;Second Life&quot; is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.

Avatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available. Instant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident&#x27;s email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.

Identities in &quot;Second Life&quot; can relate to the users&#x27; personality or creating their own character. It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves. Most avatars are human, but they can choose to be vampires or animals. Sometimes, what they choose does not relate to their offline selves.

In &quot;Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human&quot;, anthropologist Tom Boellstorff notes that the interface of &quot;Second Life&quot; is designed with the purpose of disconnecting a player&#x27;s virtual identity from their physical identity in mind. As of 2015 &quot;Second Life&quot; has made it possible to display one&#x27;s legal name in the player&#x27;s profile or as their screen name, but when Boellstorff first published the book in 2008 users were required to select a last name from a pre-determined list of options. Boellstorff describes this mentality as being in direct contrast to the one held by other mainstream social media websites, where anonymity is shunned and users are encouraged to make the link between their online and physical presence clear.

== Content ==

The ability to create content and shape the &quot;Second Life&quot; world is one of the key features that separate this from online games. Built into the software is a 3D modeling tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects. There is also a procedural scripting language, Linden Scripting Language (LSL), which can be used to add interactivity to objects. Sculpted prims (&quot;sculpties&quot;), 3D mesh, textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The &quot;Second Life&quot; terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple digital rights management (DRM) functions. However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013 to be able to use user-generated content for any purpose. The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from third-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly.

== Economy ==

&quot;Second Life&quot; has an internal economy and closed-loop virtual token called the Linden Dollar (L$). L$ can be used to buy, sell, rent or trade land or goods and services with other users. The &quot;Linden Dollar&quot; is a closed-loop virtual token for use only within the Second Life platform. Linden Dollars have no monetary value and are not redeemable for monetary value from Linden Lab. However, the presence of a currency exchange has led to the Linden Dollar being recognised as a centralized virtual currency, a fiat currency, or property. A resident with a surplus of Linden Dollars earned via a Second Life business or experiential play can request to refund their Linden Dollar surplus to PayPal. Linden Lab reports that the &quot;Second Life&quot; economy generated US$3,596,674 in economic activity during the month of September 2005, and in September 2006 &quot;Second Life&quot; was reported to have a GDP of $64 million. In 2009, the total size of the &quot;Second Life&quot; economy grew 65% to US$567 million, about 25% of the entire U.S. virtual goods market. Gross resident earnings are US$55 million in 2009 – 11% growth over 2008. In 2013, Linden Lab released an info graphic that showed that over 10 years $3.2 billion in transactions for virtual goods had exchanged between &quot;Second Life&quot; residents, with an average of 1.2 million daily transactions.

There is a high level of entrepreneurial activity in &quot;Second Life&quot;. Residents of &quot;Second Life&quot; are able to create virtual objects and other content. &quot;Second Life&quot; is unique in that users retain all the rights to their content which means they can use &quot;Second Life&quot; to distribute and sell their creations, with 2.1 million items listed on its online marketplace. At its height circa 2006, hundreds of thousands of dollars were changing hands daily as residents created and sold a wide variety of virtual commodities. &quot;Second Life&quot; also quickly became profitable due to the selling and renting of virtual real estate. 2006 also saw &quot;Second Life&quot;″s first real-world millionaire; Ailin Graef, better known as Anshe Chung (her avatar), converted an initial investment of US$9.95 into over one million dollars over the course of two and a half years. She built her fortune primarily by buying, selling, and renting virtual real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/03/million.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Major tech corporations have tried to use &quot;Second Life&quot; to market products or services to &quot;Second Life&quot;″s tech-savvy audience. IBM, for example, purchased 12 islands within &quot;Second Life&quot; for virtual training and simulations of key business processes, but has since moved on to other platforms due to maintenance costs. Others, like musicians, podcasters, and news organizations (including CNET, Reuters, NPR&#x27;s &quot;The Infinite Mind&quot;, and the BBC), have all had a presence within &quot;Second Life&quot;.

Virtual goods include buildings, vehicles, devices of all kinds, animations, clothing, skin, hair, jewelry, flora and fauna, and works of art. Services include business management, entertainment, and custom content creation (which can be broken up into the following six categories: building, texturing, scripting, animating, art direction, and the position of producer/project funder). L$ can be purchased using US dollars and other local currencies on the LindeX exchange provided by Linden Lab. Customer USD wallets obtained from Linden Dollar sales on the Lindex are most commonly used to pay &quot;Second Life&quot;″s own subscription and tier fees; only a relatively small number of users earn enough profit to request a refund to PayPal. According to figures published by Linden Lab, about 64,000 users made a profit in &quot;Second Life&quot; in February 2009, of whom 38,524 made less than US$10, while 233 made more than US$5000. Profits are derived from selling virtual goods, renting land, and a broad range of services.

== Technology ==

&quot;Second Life&quot; comprises the &quot;viewer&quot; (also known as the &quot;client&quot;) executing on the user&#x27;s personal computer, and several thousand servers operated by Linden Lab.

=== Client ===
Linden Lab provides official viewers for the operating systems Windows, macOS, and most distributions of Linux where the more known ChromeOS has been excluded so far. The viewer renders 3D graphics using OpenGL technology. The viewer source code was released under the GPL in 2007 and moved to the LGPL in 2010.

There are now several mature third-party viewer projects, the most popular being Firestorm, that contain features not available in the Linden Lab &#x27;Official&#x27; client, target other platforms or cater to specialist &amp; accessibility needs. The main focus of third party development is exploring new ideas and working with Linden Lab to deliver new functionality.

An independent project, libopenmetaverse, offers a function library for interacting with &quot;Second Life&quot; servers. libopenmetaverse has been used to create non-graphic third party viewers.

There are several &quot;Alternate Viewers&quot; published by Linden Lab used for software testing by volunteers for early access to upcoming projects. Some of these clients only function on the &quot;beta grid&quot; consisting of a limited number of regions running various releases of unstable test server code.

=== Server ===

Each full region (an area of 256×256 meters) in the &quot;Second Life&quot; &quot;grid&quot; runs on a single dedicated core of a multi-core server. Homestead regions share 3 regions per core and Openspace Regions share 4 regions per core, running proprietary software on Debian Linux. These servers run scripts in a region, and provide communication between avatars and objects present in a region.

Every item in the &quot;Second Life&quot; universe is referred to as an &quot;asset&quot;. This includes the shapes of basic 3D polygon objects formally known as &quot;Primitive Mesh&quot; (commonly known as &quot;primitives&quot; or &quot;prims&quot; for short), the digital images referred to as &quot;textures&quot; that decorate primitives, digitized audio clips, avatar shape and appearance, avatar skin textures, LSL scripts, information written on notecards, and so on. Each asset is referenced with a universally unique identifier or &quot;UUID&quot;.

Assets are stored on Isilon Systems storage clusters, comprising all data that has ever been created by anyone who has been in the &quot;Second Life&quot; world. Infrequently used assets are offloaded to S3 bulk storage. , the total storage was estimated to consume 100 terabytes of server capacity. The asset servers function independently of the region simulators, though the region simulators act as a proxy for the client, request object data from the asset servers when a new object loads into the simulator. Region simulators areas are commonly known as &quot;sims&quot; by residents.

Each server instance runs a physics simulation to manage the collisions and interactions of all objects in that region. Objects can be nonphysical and non-moving, or actively physical and movable. Complex shapes may be linked together in groups of up to 256 separate primitives. Additionally, each player&#x27;s avatar is treated as a physical object so that it may interact with physical objects in the world. , &quot;Second Life&quot; simulators use the &quot;Havok 2011.2&quot; physics engine for all in-world dynamics. This engine is capable of simulating thousands of physical objects at once.

Linden Lab pursues the use of open standards technologies, and uses free and open source software such as Apache, MySQL, Squid and Linux. The plan is to move everything to open standards by standardizing the &quot;Second Life&quot; protocol. Cory Ondrejka, former CTO of &quot;Second Life&quot;, stated in 2006 that a while after everything has been standardized, both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software.

In January 2021, Linden Lab completed the migration of all of its services and databases to AWS servers.

=== OpenSimulator ===
In January 2007, OpenSimulator was founded as an open-source simulator project. The aim of this project is to develop a full open-source server software for &quot;Second Life&quot; clients. OpenSIM is BSD Licensed and it is written in C# and can run under Mono environment. From 2008, alternative grids began to emerge and many of these allow cross visits from other grids through the hypergrid protocol using OpenSimulator.

== Applications ==
=== Arts ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; residents express themselves creatively through virtual world adaptations of art exhibits, live music, live theater and machinima, and other art forms.

=== Competitive entertainment ===
A wide variety of recreational activities, both competitive and non-competitive, take place on the &quot;Second Life&quot; Grid, including both traditional sports and video game–like scenarios.

=== Education ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; is used as a platform for education by many institutions, such as colleges, universities, libraries and government entities. Since 2008, the University of San Martin de Porres of Peru has been developing &quot;Second Life&quot; prototypes of Peruvian archeological buildings, and training teachers for this new paradigm of education. The West Virginia University (WVU) Department of Special Education has used &quot;Second Life&quot; widely in education, and it provided teaching certification and certificates of degree in seven different distance education programs. WVU started a pilot program in the college&#x27;s computer lab in spring 2011.

=== Embassies ===

The Maldives was the first country to open an embassy in &quot;Second Life&quot;. The Maldives&#x27; embassy is located on &quot;Second Life&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Diplomacy Island&quot;, where visitors will be able to talk face-to-face with a computer-generated ambassador about visas, trade and other issues. &quot;Diplomacy Island&quot; also hosts Diplomatic Museum and Diplomatic Academy. The Island is established by DiploFoundation as part of the Virtual Diplomacy Project.

In May 2007, Sweden became the second country to open an embassy in &quot;Second Life&quot;. Run by the Swedish Institute, the embassy serves to promote Sweden&#x27;s image and culture, rather than providing any real or virtual services. The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Carl Bildt, stated on his blog that he hoped he would get an invitation to the grand opening.

In September 2007, Publicis Group announced the project of creating a Serbia island as a part of a project Serbia Under Construction. The project is officially supported by Ministry of Diaspora of Serbian Government. It was stated that the island will feature the Nikola Tesla Museum, the Guča Trumpet Festival and the Exit Festival. It was also planned on opening a virtual info terminals of Ministry of Diaspora.

On Tuesday, December 4, 2007, Estonia became the third country to open an embassy in &quot;Second Life&quot;. In September 2007, Colombia and Serbia opened embassies. As of 2008, North Macedonia and the Philippines have opened embassies in the &quot;Diplomatic Island&quot; of &quot;Second Life&quot;. In 2008, Albania opened an embassy in the Nova Bay location. SL Israel was inaugurated in January 2008 in an effort to showcase Israel to a global audience, though without any connection to official Israeli diplomatic channels. In 2008, Malta opened an embassy on &quot;Second Life&quot;.

=== Religion ===

Religious organizations have also begun to open virtual meeting places within &quot;Second Life&quot;. In early 2007, LifeChurch.tv, a Christian church headquartered in Edmond, Oklahoma, and with eleven campuses in the US, created &quot;Experience Island&quot; and opened its twelfth campus in &quot;Second Life&quot;. In July 2007, an Anglican cathedral was established in &quot;Second Life&quot;; Mark Brown, the head of the group that built the cathedral, noted that there is &quot;an interest in what I call depth, and a moving away from light, fluffy Christianity&quot;.

The First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Second Life was established in 2006. Services have been held regularly, making the FUUCSL Congregation one of the longest-running active congregations in &quot;Second Life&quot;.

The Egyptian-owned news website Islam Online has purchased land in &quot;Second Life&quot; to allow Muslims and non-Muslims alike to perform the ritual of Hajj in virtual reality form, obtaining experience before actually making the pilgrimage to Mecca in person.

&quot;Second Life&quot; also offers several groups that cater to the needs and interests of humanists, atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers. One of the most active groups is SL Humanism which has been holding weekly discussion meetings inside &quot;Second Life&quot; every Sunday since 2006.

=== Relationships ===
Romantic relationships are common in &quot;Second Life&quot;, including some couples who have married online. The social engagement offered by the online environment helps those who might be socially isolated. In addition, sex is often encountered. However, to access the adult sections requires age verification. There are also large BDSM and Gorean communities.

&quot;Second Life&quot; relationships have been taken from virtual online relationships into personal, real-world relationships. Booperkit Moseley and Shukran Fahid were possibly the first couple to meet in &quot;Second Life&quot; and then marry in real life. Booperkit travelled to the United States to meet Shukran and he returned to England with her after one week. They married in 2006, had twin boys in 2009, and are still married. Some couples meet online, form friendships, and eventually move to finding one another in the real world. Some even have their weddings on &quot;Second Life&quot;, and in a real-world setting.Relationships in virtual worlds have an added dimension compared to other social media, because avatars give a feeling of proximity making the voyeur experience more intense than simply a textual encounter. The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars, whether they are engaging disassociatively (entertainment only), immersively (as if the avatar was them), or augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real-life purpose).

=== Science ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; is used for scientific research, collaboration, and data visualization. Examples include SciLands, American Chemical Society&#x27;s ACS Island, Genome, Virginia Tech&#x27;s SLATE, and Nature Publishing Group&#x27;s Elucian Islands Village.

=== Social network ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; can be a real-time, immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their lives, who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars. (Some academics believe using &quot;Second Life&quot; might even help improve motor ability for people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.).

An example of how &quot;Second Life&quot; has been used by disabled people is Wheelies, the widely publicised disability-themed virtual nightclub founded by Simon Stevens.

=== Music streams ===
Shoutcast and Icecast radio stations can be streamed into a land parcel in &quot;Second Life&quot;. The streaming codec is MP3, as AAC and Vorbis are not currently supported. There are internet radio providers that offer these services or select from a list. At the time of this writing, media on a prim (MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.

=== Work spaces ===

&quot;Second Life&quot; gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet, hold events, practice any kind of corporate communications, conduct training sessions in 3D immersive virtual learning environment, simulate business processes, and prototype new products.

In 2020, CEO of &quot;Second Life&quot; Ebbe Altberg announced a microsite for &quot;Second Life&quot; to serve as a space for digital meetings to take place amidst global social distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Notable events and influence ==

=== Second Life movie ===
In 2007 director David Fincher worked with screenwriter Peter Straughan to make a &quot;Second Life&quot; movie based on Tim Guest&#x27;s novel &quot;Second Lives&quot;. The movie was rumored to feature Sacha Baron Cohen as protagonist Plastic Duck, a zany Second Life resident who drove founder Philip Rosedale bonkers.

=== Ban of Woodbury University ===
Linden Lab has twice, in 2007 and 2010, banned a California educational institution, Woodbury University, from having a representation within &quot;Second Life&quot;. On April 20, 2010, four simulators belonging to the university were deleted and the accounts of several students and professors terminated, according to &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. Edward Clift, dean of the School of Media, Culture and Design at Woodbury University, told &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; that their campus &quot;was a living, breathing campus in &quot;Second Life&quot;&quot;, including educational spaces designed mostly by students, such as a mock representation of the former Soviet Union and a replica of the Berlin Wall. According to Clift, the virtual campus did not &quot;conform to what Linden Lab wanted a campus to be&quot;.

The article in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; concluded with: &quot;Meanwhile, many people in &quot;Second Life&quot; expressed on blogs that they were glad to see the virtual campus go, arguing that it had been a haven for troublemakers in the virtual world.&quot;

=== &quot;The Alphaville Herald&quot; ===

In 2004, the newspaper &quot;The Alphaville Herald&quot;, founded and edited by the philosopher Peter Ludlow, migrated to &quot;Second Life&quot;, and in the following years the newspaper played a prominent role in reporting on &quot;Second Life&quot; and in the public discussion of the game. The newspaper, which was known as &quot;The Second Life Herald&quot; from 2004 to 2009, was later edited by the Internet pioneer Mark P. McCahill. According to scholars Constantinescu and Decu, &quot;The Alphaville Herald&quot; was the first &quot;virtual free press,&quot; pioneering mass communication in virtual worlds.

=== 2007 &quot;Virtual Riot&quot; ===
In January 2007, a &quot;virtual riot&quot; erupted between members of the French National Front (FN) who had established a virtual HQ on &quot;Second Life&quot;, and &quot;anti-racism&quot; activists, including Second Life Left Unity, a socialist and anti-capitalist user-group. Since then, several small Internet-based organizations have claimed some responsibility for instigating the riots.

=== Marketing ===
Corporate marketers, especially during the height of &quot;Second Life&quot; in the cultural zeitgeist of 2005–2010, have been accused of being overly credulous of the actual reach and influence of &quot;Second Life&quot;. Journalists have theorized this might be partly due to blithely accepting total account statistics rather than harder-to-discern active player counts. Reasons for account &quot;inflation&quot; can include in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts such as &quot;traffic bots&quot; which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there, and simply idle and long inactive accounts. One article in &quot;Wired&quot; featured a marketer for Coca-Cola who found &quot;Second Life&quot; to be essentially deserted when personally inspecting it, yet still funded a marketing campaign there anyway from fear of missing out.

=== Griefing and denial of service attacks ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; has been attacked several times by groups of residents abusing the creation tools to create objects that harass other users or damage the system. This included grey goo objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers; &quot;orbiters&quot; which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; &quot;cages&quot; which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate denial-of-service attacks (DoS) on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar&#x27;s location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content before being patched out.

=== The Emerald client and in-world logging scripts ===
The Emerald client was developed by a group of users based on Snowglobe, an opensource fork of the &quot;Second Life&quot; client. Several groups alleged that the Emerald viewer contained Trojan code which tracked user details and demographics in a way that the developers could later recover. One of these groups was banned from &quot;Second Life&quot; by Linden Lab after publishing their discovery. Shortly afterward, a member of the Emerald team was accused of a DDOS attack against another website. In response, Linden Lab revoked Emerald&#x27;s third-party viewer approval and permanently banned several of Emerald&#x27;s developers. Due to what happened with Emerald, Linden Lab instituted a new third-party viewer policy.

The support staff and one of the developers of the Emerald project, who was not banned, left to work on a new viewer project, Phoenix (using some of the Emerald codebase, but without Off-the-Record Messaging nor any potentially malicious code). The Phoenix team are now the developers behind Firestorm Viewer, a fork of &quot;Second Life&quot;&#x27;s &quot;viewer 2.0&quot; open source client.

===&quot;Vlogger&quot;===

&quot;Vlogger&quot; is a 2011 Spanish political thriller film that makes heavy use of &quot;Second Life&quot; through machinima production. The film follows a Pakistani computer specialist who discovers that her brother has been recruited into an Islamic extremist group in the video game. With six days until he plans to commit a suicide bombing, the protagonist enters the digital world of &quot;Second Life&quot; to stop him. The film debuted at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival.

== Criticism and controversy ==
&quot;Second Life&quot; has seen a number of controversies. Issues range from the technical (budgeting of server resources), to moral (e.g., pornography and cyberbullying), to legal (legal position of the Linden Dollar, &quot;Bragg v. Linden Lab&quot;). Security issues have also been a concern.

=== Regulation ===
In the past, large portions of the &quot;Second Life&quot; economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to &quot;Second Life&quot;″s terms of service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within &quot;Second Life&quot; into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.

On July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.

In August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or Ponzi scheme called Ginko Financial collapsed due to a bank run triggered by Linden Lab&#x27;s ban on gambling. The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual &quot;Linden Dollar banks&quot;, which critics had long asserted were scams. On Tuesday, January 8, 2008, Linden Lab announced the upcoming prohibition of payment of fixed interest on cash deposits in unregulated banking activities in-world. All banks without real-world charters closed or converted to virtual joint stock companies by January 22, 2008. After the ban, a few companies continue to offer non-interest bearing deposit accounts to residents, such as the e-commerce site XStreet, which had already adopted a zero-interest policy 3 months before the Linden Lab interest ban.

=== Technical issues ===

&quot;Second Life&quot; has suffered from difficulties related to system instability. These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system&#x27;s use of an &quot;asset server&quot; cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a bottleneck which frequently causes problems. Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.

Another problem is inventory loss, in which items in a user&#x27;s inventory, including those which have been paid for, can disappear without warning or permanently enter a state where they will fail to appear in-world when requested (giving an &quot;object missing from database&quot; error). Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have &quot;lost their parent directory&quot; means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. &quot;Loss to recovery times&quot; have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.

&quot;Second Life&quot; functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300 kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.

=== Quality assurance ===
Criticism of quality assurance of &quot;Second Life&quot; states that Linden Lab focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000 users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the quality assurance process of the company. Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.

=== Frame rate ===
Computer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other MMOGs may perform poorly in &quot;Second Life&quot;, resulting in low frame rates and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use upwards of a dozen times the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.

=== Congestion ===

A single region (65,536 m2 of land hosted on a single CPU) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on &#x27;mainland&#x27; regions, up to 100 on private islands), causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.

=== Customer security ===
On September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their &quot;Second Life&quot; database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users&#x27; real names, had likely been accessed. However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety&#x27;s sake.

=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===
Although &quot;Second Life&quot;″s client and server incorporate digital rights management technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, CopyBot, was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as GLIntercept, can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the &quot;Second Life&quot; TOS and could be prosecuted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Linden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab&#x27;s enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions of the DMCA which used to require a regular mail DMCA complaint. However, since 2019 an electronic DMCA complaint form is also available.

A few high-profile businesses in &quot;Second Life&quot; have filed such lawsuits, none of the cases filed to date have gone to trial, and most have been dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement reached between the parties. Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros, LLC v. Linden Research, Inc. As of October 7, 2010, the case was transferred to private mediation and the plaintiffs filed for dismissal of charges on March 15, 2011.

Most users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements.
A group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.

=== OpenSpaces ===
Linden Lab, for a period, offered &quot;Openspace&quot; regions to users: regions which were purchased in packs of four, with all four running on a single CPU core, intended to be placed next to an existing region to create the effect of larger size. The fee for 4 Openspaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit Openspaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, and increasing the prim load each one could handle. Openspaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.

In October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the Openspaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per Openspace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.

A week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.

In May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were &quot;grandfathering&quot; Openspace sims (now rebranded as &quot;Homesteads&quot;), after a protracted protest movement caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.

=== Sex ===
Some media attention has been given to sexual activity involving avatars with a childlike appearance. The United Kingdom and Germany are among the countries investigating new laws to combat simulated child pornography. The USA has attempted to pass several laws forbidding simulated child pornography; however, each one has been struck down by the US Supreme Court as an infringement on the First Amendment right to free speech.

As of May 2007, two such countries, Germany and Belgium, have launched a police investigation into age of consent-related offenses in &quot;Second Life&quot; (including both trading of non-virtual photography and involuntary virtual sexual activity with childlike avatars by means of virtual identity theft). Linden Lab responded by issuing a statement that any &quot;depiction of sexual or lewd acts involving minors&quot; was a bannable offence.

In France, a conservative family union, Familles de France, sued Linden Lab in June 2007, alleging that &quot;Second Life&quot; gave minors access to sexual content, including bondage, zoophilia, scatophilia, and to gambling, and advertisements for alcohol, drugs and tobacco. Linden Lab pointed out that the virtual world is not meant for children (people under the age of 18) because of the mature content and interactions within &quot;Second Life&quot;. However, minors aged between 13 and 17 can access &quot;Second Life&quot;, but they will be restricted to what they can see or do based on age. The &quot;Second Life&quot; world is split into sections/worlds and each one is given a maturity rating similar to films: General, Moderate and Adult. Minors aged 13–17 can access areas with a General Rating only.

&quot;Second Life&quot; Main Grid regions are rated either &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;, or &quot;Adult&quot; (previously &quot;PG&quot;, &quot;Mature&quot;, or &quot;Adult&quot;). Builds, textures, actions, animations, chat, or businesses that are of an adult nature are regulated by the &quot;Second Life&quot; Terms of Service to only occur in simulators with a Moderate or Adult rating. General rated sims exist as an alternative for residents who do not wish to reside in areas where adult-oriented activities and businesses are permitted.

Linden Lab has created an Adult rated &quot;mainland&quot; continent named Zindra in response to its other &quot;mainland&quot; continents being mostly General.

=== Unauthorized copying of content ===
&quot;Second Life&quot; features a built-in digital rights management system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the &quot;Second Life&quot; servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user&#x27;s computer to be displayed or played, an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.

In November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called CopyBot, developed as part of libsecondlife and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their &quot;Second Life&quot; data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.

Residents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from &quot;Second Life&quot;, but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA takedown notices served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on &quot;Second Life&quot;.

Any user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the &quot;Second Life&quot; terms of service states; &quot;you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service&quot;.

A user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).

Regardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; &quot;you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute&quot;. Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.

== Litigation ==
=== &quot;Bragg v. Linden Lab&quot; ===

In 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below reserve. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the &quot;Second Life&quot; Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable contract of adhesion. The case eventually ended with Bragg&#x27;s virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement. Since the settlement created no legal precedent, it left users with confusion as to what legal rights they truly had with respect to their virtual land, items, and account. Many of Bragg&#x27;s legal arguments rested on the claim, advertised on Linden Lab web site, that virtual land within &quot;Second Life&quot; could be &quot;owned&quot; by the purchasing user, which was removed shortly after the settlement.

=== &quot;Eros, LLC and Grei v. Linden Lab&quot; ===
Eros, LLC and Shannon Grei brought forth a class action suit in US District Court in Northern California against Linden Research, Inc on September 15, 2009 (Case4:09-cv-04269-PJH). Court papers allege the defendants knowingly and profitably turned a blind eye to copyright and trademark violations within the Second Life service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strokerz Toyz/Eros LLC Takes Linden Lab to Court in Class Action Lawsuit!!!&quot;&gt;Mistral, Pixeleen: &quot;Strokerz Toyz/Eros LLC Takes Linden Lab to Court in Class Action Lawsuit!!!&quot; Alphaville Herald, September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;Evans et al. v. Linden Lab&quot; ===
In 2010, a group of banned SL users filed suit against Linden Lab and CEO Philip Rosedale, in the same Pennsylvania Federal District Court that the Bragg case was adjudicated in, with the same judge, to deal with further land seizures and account suspensions by the Lab against various customers. Due to the Terms of Service agreement changes since the Bragg case, defendants attorneys successfully argued to move the suit to federal court in California, where the case lingered for several years. The judge did rule that there was a basis to turn the litigation into a class action, and that there were two classes under which claimants could file claims. The primary class was those who suffered economic damages to their livelihoods, through loss of their business revenues in &quot;SL&quot;. The secondary class was those who suffered property losses from loss of land, money on hand, and virtual goods in avatar inventories. In May 2013, attorney for defendants negotiated a settlement agreement with one of the lead attorneys that, in plain language, agreed to refund region setup fees for private island owners, pay land owners 2 Linden Dollars per square meter of virtual land, refund all L$ and USD amounts in the plaintiffs&#x27; accounts at the time of suspension, and allow the plaintiffs the option of either receiving $15US as compensation for loss of accounts and inventory virtual goods OR restoration of their accounts to sell their goods on the &quot;SL&quot; Marketplace. The settlement agreement went to final hearing in March 2014, with an objection from claimant Mike Lorrey as to the vagueness of certain terms in the settlement as to which fees exactly would be refunded. With the resolution of that objection, claimants who had filed claims prior to March 28, 2014, began to receive settlement money a few months later.

== In popular culture ==
Since its debut in 2003, &quot;Second Life&quot; has been referred to by various popular culture media, including literature, television, film and music. In addition, various personalities in such media have themselves used or employed &quot;Second Life&quot; for both their own works and for private purposes.

In September 2006, former Governor of Virginia Mark Warner became the first politician to appear in a MMO when he gave a speech in &quot;Second Life&quot;. Musicians followed suit, with Redzone being credited by &quot;Wired&quot; and Reuters as the first band to tour in &quot;Second Life&quot; in February 2007. Authors George R R Martin (May 2007) and Paul Levinson (November 2007) were interviewed in &quot;Second Life&quot; about their work. Then, in June 2008, author Charles Stross held a conference in &quot;Second Life&quot; to promote an upcoming novel. &quot;Second Life&quot; was also featured prominently, and used as a tool to locate a suspect, in the television show &quot;&quot; in 2007. In the American sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is known to play the game, most notably in the episode &quot;Local Ad&quot;.

== Research ==

Much of the published research conducted in &quot;Second Life&quot; is associated with education, learning, and data collection. Unlike computer games, &quot;Second Life&quot; does not have a pre-defined purpose and allows for highly realistic enactment of real life activities online. One such study tested the usefulness of &quot;SL&quot; as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using &quot;SL&quot; as a platform. Both problem-based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with students working in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life.

Situated learning has also been examined in &quot;SL&quot;, to determine how the design and social dynamics of the virtual world support and constrain various types of learning. The paper, &quot;The future for (second) life and learning&quot;, published in the &quot;British Journal of Educational Technology&quot;, examines the potential of &quot;Second Life&quot; to further innovative learning techniques. It notes trends within the &quot;SL&quot; innovation to date, including the provision of realistic settings, the exploitation of pleasant simulated environments for groups, and the links with other learning technologies. It also considers the creativity sparked by &quot;SL&quot;″s potential to offer the illusion of 3-D &#x27;spaces&#x27; and buildings, and points to infinite imaginative educational possibilities.
Second Life has also offered educational research potential within the medical and healthcare fields. Examples include in-world research facilities such as the Second Life Medical and Consumer Health Libraries (Healthinfo Island, funded by a grant from the US National Library of Medicine), and VNEC (Virtual Neurological Education Centre, developed at the University of Plymouth, UK).

There have also been healthcare related studies done of &quot;SL&quot; residents. Studies show that behaviors from virtual worlds can translate to the real world. One survey suggests that users are engaged in a range of health-related activities in&quot; SL&quot; which are potentially impacting real-life behaviors.

Another focus of &quot;SL&quot; research has included the relationship of avatars or virtual personas to the &#x27;real&#x27; or actual person. These studies have included research into social behavior and reported two main implications. The first is that &quot;SL&quot; virtual selves shape users&#x27; offline attitudes and behavior. The research indicated that virtual lives and physical lives are not independent, and our appearances and actions have both online and offline consequences. The second deals with experimental research and supports the idea that virtual environments, such as &quot;SL&quot;, can enable research programs in that people behave in a relatively natural spread of behavioral patterns. Remote data collection in SL must account for issues related to research participant engagement, burden, retention, and accuracy of data collected.

The &quot;SL&quot; avatar-self relationship was also studied via resident interviews, and various enactments of the avatar-self relationship were identified. The study concluded that &quot;SL&quot; residents enacted multiple avatar-self relationships and cycled through them in quick succession, suggesting that these avatar-self relationships might be shaped and activated strategically to achieve the desired educational, commercial, or therapeutic outcomes.

Anthropologist Tom Boellstorff describes the anthropological applications of studying &quot;Second Life&quot; and its userbase in &quot;Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human.&quot; Boellstorff explores the relationship between anonymity and community when everyone in a community belongs to varying degrees of anonymity, and how this feeds into the idea of digital collectivity. He also comments on the phenomenon of data becoming &quot;part of social context&quot; that has been observed both inside and outside of &quot;Second Life&quot; as surveillance becomes more integrated into everyday life. He stresses the difference between the concepts of anonymity and pseudonymity, identifying &quot;Second Life&quot; users as belonging to the latter group of people – though their avatars are not directly linked to their real identities and reputations, they have forged new ones in this online space, a unique effect of creating an online persona in the digital age.

<text>The Christian Coalition was an Evangelical Christian political party operating in New Zealand. It was an alliance of the now-defunct Christian Heritage Party and the Christian Democrats, New Zealand&#x27;s two theologically conservative Christian parties. The Christian Coalition did not meet with the success that it hoped for, and was eventually dissolved.

The Coalition was established for the purpose of contesting the 1996 election, which was the first to be held using the new mixed member proportional (MMP) voting system. Under MMP, it would not be necessary for the party to win any electorate seats – it merely needed to gain more than five percent of the national vote. The party was led by the Christian Democrat&#x27;s leader Graeme Lee and the Christian Heritage leader Graham Capill.

In terms of policy, the Coalition generally pursued goals located somewhere between those of the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage. At times, there appeared to be dispute between the two groups, with the Christian Democrats pursuing a more moderate path and Christian Heritage insisting upon a hard line. There were also complaints from the Christian Democrats that Christian Heritage was dominating the Coalition, and that Graham Capill (leader of Christian Heritage and Co-leader of the Coalition as a whole) was running the party &quot;autocratically&quot;.

Despite the internal differences within the party, however, the Coalition steadily rose in the polls. As the election drew closer, some polls showed the Coalition passing the critical five percent threshold. As the result, the party came under intense media scrutiny and was criticized by its opponents. Rather than assisting the party, however, the increased media coverage appeared to damage its chances, with many people expressing worry about the more extreme elements of the party. The Coalition claimed that the media coverage about it was biased, saying that the news media set out to &quot;falsely&quot; portray them as extremist. Opponents of the Coalition, however, said that the intense media scrutiny penetrated an artificial layer of reasonableness that the Coalition had adopted, revealing the party&#x27;s allegedly true character. Whatever the case, the party&#x27;s polling dropped below the five percent threshold once again.

In the election itself, the Christian Coalition gained 4.33% of the vote, ranking sixth. It would have needed around 13,000 more votes to enter parliament. None of the Coalition&#x27;s thirty-seven electoral constituency candidates were successful.

In May 1997, the Christian Coalition disbanded, with the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage going their own separate ways. The Christian Democrats later &quot;secularised&quot; themselves, removing the explicitly religious nature of their party while keeping the same policy outlook. The resultant party, Future New Zealand, merged with the United Party to form the current United Future New Zealand. Ironically, the latter split in 2007, with disgruntled fundamentalist ex-UFNZ members forming a more intransigent entity, The Kiwi Party.

Christian Heritage remained an independent party, but did not meet with the same success that it did while part of the Coalition. At the New Zealand general election, 1999 it polled 2.4% and at the New Zealand general election, 2002 it polled 1.3%, finally in the New Zealand general election, 2005, it polled 0.12 percent, its lowest ever poll rating.

Christian Heritage New Zealand and Destiny New Zealand also tried to form a second &quot;Christian Coalition&quot; in 2004, but were unsuccessful. In October 2006, CHNZ Leader Ewen McQueen announced the closure of CHNZ after ex-CHNZ leader Graham Capill had been jailed on multiple counts of pedophilia. Destiny New Zealand did not prove politically viable, nor did its successor, the Family Party of New Zealand.

<text>George Salmon (25 September 1819 – 22 January 1904) was a distinguished and influential Irish mathematician and Anglican theologian. After working in algebraic geometry for two decades, Salmon devoted the last forty years of his life to theology. His entire career was spent at Trinity College Dublin, having served as the 32nd Provost of the university from 1888 to 1904.

==Personal life==
Salmon was born in Cork in 1819, to Michael Salmon and Helen Weekes (the daughter of the Reverend Edward Weekes). During his boyhood in Cork, where his father Michael was a linen merchant, he attended Hamblin and Porter&#x27;s School there before starting at Trinity College Dublin in 1833.

In 1837, he won a scholarship and graduated from Trinity in 1839 with first-class honours in mathematics. In 1841, at the age of 21, he attained a paid fellowship and teaching position in mathematics at Trinity. In 1845, he was additionally appointed to a position in theology at the university, after having been ordained a deacon in 1844 and a priest in the Church of Ireland in 1845.

He remained at Trinity for the rest of his career.

He died at the Provost&#x27;s House on 22 January 1904 and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin. He was an avid reader throughout his life, and his obituary refers to him as &quot;specially devoted to the novels of Jane Austen.&quot;

In 1844, he married Frances Anne Salvador, daughter of Rev J L Salvador of Staunton-upon-Wye in Herefordshire, with whom he had six children, of whom only two survived him.

==Academic career==
===Mathematics===
In the late 1840s and the 1850s, Salmon was in regular and frequent communication with Arthur Cayley and J. J. Sylvester. The three of them, together with a small number of other mathematicians (including Charles Hermite), were developing a system for dealing with n-dimensional algebra and geometry. During this period Salmon published about 36 papers in journals. In these papers for the most part he solved narrowly defined, concrete problems in algebraic geometry, as opposed to more broadly systematic or foundational questions. But he was an early adopter of the foundational innovations of Cayley and the others. In 1859, he published the book &quot;Lessons Introductory to the Modern Higher Algebra&quot; (where the word &quot;higher&quot; means n-dimensional). This was for a while simultaneously the state-of-the-art and the standard presentation of the subject, and went through updated and expanded editions in 1866, 1876 and 1885, and was translated into German and French.

From 1858 to 1867, he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity.

Meanwhile, back in 1848, Salmon had published an undergraduate textbook entitled &quot;A Treatise on Conic Sections&quot;. This text remained in print for over fifty years, going through five updated editions in English, and was translated into German, French, Italian, and Japanese. Salmon himself did not participate in the expansions and updates of the later editions. The German version, which was a &quot;free adaptation&quot; by Wilhelm Fiedler, was popular as an undergraduate text in Germany. Salmon also published two other mathematics texts, &quot;A Treatise on Higher Plane Curves&quot; (1852) and &quot;A Treatise on the Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions&quot; (1862). These too were in print for a long time and went through a number of later editions, with Salmon delegating the work of the later editions to others.

In 1858, he was presented with the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy. In June 1863, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society followed in 1868 by the award of their Royal Medal &quot;For his researches in analytical geometry and the theory of surfaces&quot;. In 1889 Salmon received the Copley Medal of the society, the highest honorary award in British science, but by then he had long since lost his interest in mathematics and science.

Salmon received honorary degrees from several universities, including that of &quot;Doctor mathematicae (honoris causa)&quot; from the Royal Frederick University on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.

 is named in honour of George Salmon.

===Theology===
From the early 1860s, Salmon was primarily occupied with theology. In 1866, he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at Trinity College, at which point he resigned from his position in the mathematics department at TCD. In 1871, he accepted an additional post of chancellor of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin.

One of his early publications in theology was in 1853 as a contributor to a book of rebuttals to the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;. Arguments against Roman Catholicism were a recurring theme in Salmon&#x27;s theology and culminated in his widely read 1888 book &quot;Infallibility of the Church&quot; in which he argued that certain beliefs of the Roman church were absurd, especially the beliefs in the infallibility of the church and the infallibility of the pope. Salmon also wrote books about eternal punishment, miracles, and interpretation of the New Testament. His book &quot;An Historical Introduction to the Study of the Books of the New Testament&quot;, which was widely read, is an account of the reception and interpretation of the gospels in the early centuries of Christianity as seen through the writings of leaders such as Irenaeus and Eusebius.

==Chess==
Salmon was a keen chess player. He was a patron to the University Chess Club, and was also the President of Dublin Chess Club from 1890–1903. He participated in the second British Chess Congress and had the honour of playing the chess prodigy Paul Morphy in Birmingham, England, on 27 August 1858. He beat Daniel Harrwitz in an interesting game.

Even in his book &quot;Infallibility of the Church&quot;, Salmon mentions chess a few times: 
*He argues that the doctrine of papal infallibility is vitally important for opponents of Catholicism to refute; otherwise, all other arguments would be of little importance, as when a chess player wins many pieces but his king is checkmated.
*In another chess reference Salmon said that if one met someone who says that he has never been beaten, this player could be given rook odds. Thus &quot;the delusion of invincibility can never grow up in the mind of anyone except one who has never met a strong antagonist.&quot;
*Salmon said that if one played someone who would normally receive queen odds, then one would go easy and not be too strict, e.g. allowing take-backs. Thus he is so convinced that the Popes have erred that he is not threatened by acknowledging when they have been right.

==Provost of Trinity College Dublin==

Salmon was Provost of Trinity from 1888 until his death in 1904. The highlight of his career may have been when in 1892 he presided over the great celebrations marking the tercentenary of the College, which had been founded by Queen Elizabeth I in 1592.

===Admission of women to Trinity===
In 1870, Trinity had introduced the &quot;Examinations for Women&quot;, following a request from Alexandra College. In 1880, while Humphrey Lloyd was provost, Samuel Haughton, Anthony Traill, John Jellett and others proposed that degrees be open to women, on the same terms as men. Lloyd, as provost, was not a supporter, and the motion was defeated. In 1881, Jellett became provost, and a committee was set up in 1882 to investigate the matter, including future provosts Salmon and Trail, respectively opposing and supporting admission. Despite the support of the provost, the committee was not effective.

Salmon was provost during the campaign for admission by the Central Association of Irish Schoolmistresses (CAISM), in which Alice Oldham was an important figure. Salmon and the board were not generally receptive to the campaign. While Salmon was a conservative, his strong opposition to the admission of women cannot be dismissed simply; he had been a member of the council of Alexandra College, had supported girls competing on equal terms with boys in Intermediate examinations and his daughter, from the provost&#x27;s house, had acted as coordinator for the Examinations for Women and was a member of CAISM. In 1896, all eight members of the board were over 70 years of age, but by 1901 retirements and deaths had resulted in the majority of the board being pro-admission.

In 1902, John Mahaffy proposed that the time had come to take action on the issue of awarding degrees to women. This was passed by the board, and, though the motion was opposed by Salmon, a committee was set up to report, and by the end of the year the board resolved that the Lord Lieutenant, William Ward should be petitioned to move the king to issue new Letters Patent for admission of Women. In 1903, Ward replied, indicating that the agreement of the provost was essential before Letters Patent would be issued. Salmon wrote withdrawing his formal objections in July 1903. The Letters Patent were received by the board on 16 January 1904. This was Salmon&#x27;s last board meeting.

On 22 January 1904, Isabel Marion Weir Johnston became the first woman undergraduate to succeed in registering at Trinity, and by the end of the year, dozens of other women had done likewise. She recalled, &quot;When I arrived in Dublin 1904, I was informed that he [Salmon] had died that day, and the examination had to be put off until after the funeral.&quot;

===Death===
Salmon continued to attend board meetings up to his death. At his death, Salmon had been a familiar figure in Trinity for over 62 years, and was held in affection even by those who disagreed with him. Both Trail and Mahaffy were eager to succeed Salmon as provost, and were lobbying to secure the position on the day of his death. Just before his death, Salmon is said to have anticipated this in another apocryphal story. He dreamt that he was dead, and his funeral was processing across Front Square, followed by weeping Fellows and Scholars. His coffin was laid in the chapel, &quot;and then&quot;, he said, &quot;I sat up in my coffin, whereupon Mahaffy and Trail wept louder than ever&quot;.

==History==
vBulletin was first launched in 2000 by James Limm and John Percival. Its successor, vBulletin 2, was released in 2001. A third version was launched in 2004.

Internet Brands acquired the product from JelSoft in 2007.

vBulletin 4 was released in late 2009. The StyleVars system was added to draw CSS variables directly from the vBulletin Template code. 

In July 2010, the BBC reported that there was a serious flaw in vBulletin software that allows anyone to easily access the database username and password.

In October 2010, Internet Brands sued three former employees, just as their new competing software XenForo was to be launched, as well as a second lawsuit in the United States claiming breach of contract, copyright infringement, and misappropriation of trade secrets. In May 2011 it was announced that vBulletin had abandoned an attempt at preventing XenForo doing business, and in 2013 the claims were dismissed.

vBulletin 5 was released in 2012.

In late 2017, a post by Technical Support Lead, Wayne Luke, confirmed that vBulletin 3 and vBulletin 4 were now considered to be &quot;End of Life&quot; software, with no further development of the series planned.

On 18 September 2023, Wayne Luke confirmed that the previously-community run modifications website, vBulletin.org, would be sunset and shut down on 24 August 2024; modification creators were advised to post their content on the main vbulletin.com website via the Social Groups feature, or to host them via other means.

<doc id="589214" wikidata="Q954089" url="?curid=589214" title="Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham">
<text>Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham, KG (1536 – 14 December 1624), known as Lord Howard of Effingham, was an English statesman and Lord High Admiral under Elizabeth I and James I. He was commander of the English forces during the battles against the Spanish Armada and was chiefly responsible for the victory that saved England from invasion by the Spanish Empire.
==Early life: 1536–1558==
Few details of Charles Howard&#x27;s early life are known. He was born in 1536, and was the cousin of Queen Elizabeth. He was son of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham (c. 1510–1573) and Margaret Gamage (d. 18 May 1581), daughter of Sir Thomas Gamage. He was a grandson of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. He was also the cousin of Anne Boleyn (Anne&#x27;s mother was half-sister to Charles&#x27; father), and held several prominent posts during the reign of Anne&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth I.

It is believed that Charles Howard was taught French and some Latin at the house of his uncle, the 3rd Duke of Norfolk. He was also educated in penmanship, chivalric exercises, and some legal traditions. He served as a page to his cousin Thomas who later became the 4th Duke of Norfolk. He also fished and hunted fervently throughout his life.

In his childhood he was educated by John Foxe, the famous Protestant martyrologist and tutor in charge of the education of the children of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, a first cousin of Charles who was executed for treason in January 1547. During that time Howard lived with his cousins at Reigate Castle, one of the estates belonging to his uncle, the 3rd Duke of Norfolk.

Howard served at sea under his father&#x27;s command as a youth. In 1552, he was sent to France to become well-educated in the French language, but was soon brought back to England at the request of his father because of questionable or unexpected treatment.

==Early political career: 1558–1585==
Howard went to the peace negotiations between England and France which led to the Treaty of Câteau-Cambrésis of 1559. He personally informed Queen Elizabeth of its ratification.

He served as ambassador to France in 1559. In December 1562, he became the keeper of the Queen&#x27;s house and park at Oatlands. In his early years he and five other gentlemen bore the canopy of state when Queen Elizabeth opened her second Parliament on 11 January 1563. He is recorded as having been a regular participant in jousts and tournaments, but despite his relationship to the Queen it is said that it took some time before he was able to gain any personal benefit from his situation.

Howard was also a member of the House of Commons, representing Surrey in the Parliament of 1563 and again in 1572.

In 1564 he became a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn, and received his Master of Arts degree at Cambridge in 1571. This was not because he had any legal ambitions, but because it was the normal thing for men of his status to do.

He served as General of the Horse in 1569 and was involved that year in the suppression of the Catholic rebellion in northern England. He commanded a squadron of ships escorting the Queen of Spain on a state visit in 1570.

Howard was knighted in 1572, and then became Lord Howard of Effingham following his father&#x27;s death in 1573. From 1576 to 1603 he was patron of a playing company, Nottingham&#x27;s Men, later called the Admiral&#x27;s Men.

On 3 April 1575, Howard was elected to the Order of the Garter to replace his cousin, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who had been executed in 1572. He was installed at Windsor on 8 May 1575.

==Lord High Admiral: 1585–1619==

Howard was named Lord High Admiral in 1585. The French ambassador wrote to Sir Francis Walsingham, saying Elizabeth&#x27;s appointment of Howard was &quot;a choice worthy of her virtue and prudence and very necessary for the Admiralty. I pray you tell her that the King [of France] has written to me by an express to thank her for having elected so good an admiral, from whom he hopes great things for the peace of his subjects&quot;.

===Trial and execution of Mary, Queen of Scots: 1587===
Howard regularly attended the Privy Council during the Babington Plot. He was named as one of the commissioners to try Mary, Queen of Scots but is not subsequently mentioned as one of those who sat on the trial. William Davison later alleged that Howard spoke to Elizabeth on 1 February 1587 &quot;of the great danger she continually lived in&quot; as there were rumours of new plots against her life and spoke of the stories that Mary had escaped from prison. Elizabeth was &quot;moved by his lordship to have some more regard to the surety of herself and the state than she seemed to take&quot; and finally made up her mind, telling Howard to send for Davison and Mary&#x27;s death warrant. Howard then met Davison and informed him that Elizabeth was now &quot;fully resolved&quot; and ordered him to bring forth the warrant to be signed, &quot;that it might be forthwith despatched and deferred no longer&quot;. Elizabeth would later blame Davison for breaking orders that no-one must be told of what had happened. The Privy Council met the next day and decided to take responsibility for the execution of Mary.

===Spanish Armada: 1588===

In early December 1587 orders were drawn up for Howard to take the English fleet to sea. On 21 December Howard&#x27;s commission was signed, requiring Howard &quot;according as there shall be occasion, and wherever and whenever he shall deem it fitting, to invade, enter, spoil and make himself master of the kingdoms, dominions, lands, islands, and all other places whatever belonging to the said Spaniards&quot;. He was furthermore given full authority over the navy and army at sea.

Between 15 December and 1 April 1588 he sat on the Privy Council only four times and attended court briefly every five or six days to meet with Walsingham. Writing on 27 January 1588, Howard believed the peace negotiations with Spain were a trap and expressed his dismay in a letter to Walsingham:I have made of the French King, the Scottish King, and the King of Spain, a Trinity that I mean never to trust to be saved by; and I would others were, in that, of my opinion. Sir, there was never, since England was England, such a stratagem and mask made to deceive England withal as this is of the treaty of peace. I pray God we have not cause to remember one thing that was made of the Scots by the Englishmen; that we do not curse for this a long grey beard with a white head, witless, that will make all the world think us heartless. You know whom I mean.

The next day he wrote again to Walsingham that if there was going to be a &quot;surcease of arms&quot; then &quot;it shall be but folly and to no purpose for me to lie here&quot; as if he was in arms whilst Elizabeth was negotiating peace it would make him &quot;a jest to many, and they have reason&quot;. Peace negotiations continued until the Armada was sailing for England.

On 1 February Howard wrote to Walsingham: &quot;It doth appear no less by your letter but that we may assure ourselves that Scotland is the mark which they shoot at to offend us, and therefore most necessary to provide for that...for my own part, had rather be drawn in pieces with wild horses than that they should pass through Scotland and I lie here&quot;.

On 14 February, Howard again wrote to Walsingham that Elizabeth would be &quot;no good housewife for herself&quot; if she refused to grant James VI a pension for his support for England rather than Spain. Howard wrote on 21 February: &quot;I have been aboard every ship that goeth out with me, and in every place where any may creep, and I do thank God that they be in the estate they be in; and there is never a one of them that knows what a leak means...there is none that goeth out now but I durst go to the Rio de la Plata in her&quot;. On 29 February he wrote to Burghley:I doubt not but to make her Majesty a good account of anything that shall be done by the Spanish forces, and I will make him wish his galleys at home again. If the Commissioners bring peace it is the happiest thing that can be; but if they come without it, look for great matters to ensue presently upon it; for the charge is so great that the King is at, both in Spain and here, in the Low Countries, that is cannot continue long, if he had five times the treasure he hath...I protest before God, and as my soul shall answer for it, that I think there were never in any place in the world worthier ships than these are, for so many. And as few as we are, if the King of Spain&#x27;s forces be not hundreds, we will make good sport with them.

By 28 May, Howard was at Plymouth. On that day he wrote to Burghley: &quot;My good Lord, there is here the gallantest company of captains, soldiers, and mariners that I think ever was seen in England&quot;. Two days later the Spanish Armada sailed from Lisbon but was forced back into port by bad winds. On 14 June, Howard wrote to Walsingham that the &quot;surest way to meet with the Spanish fleet is upon their own [coast], or in any harbour of their own, and there to defeat them...I wish with all my heart that King Anthony were with us, that he might set foot in his own country, and find the King occupied there, which we might easily do&quot;. The next day he wrote again to Walsingham:

We would go on the coast of Spain; and therefore our ground was first, to look to that principal; and if we found they did but linger on their own coast, or that they were put into the Isles of Bayona or the Groyne, then we thought in all men&#x27;s judgments that be of experience here, it had been most fit to have sought some good way, and the surest we could devise, by the good protection of God, to have defeated them...And if her Majesty do think that she is able to detract time with the King of Spain, she is greatly deceived; which may breed her great peril. For this abusing [of] the treaty of peace doth plainly show how the King of Spain will have all things perfect, [as] his plot is laid, before he will proceed to execute...Whether this [may] not breed most great danger and dishonour, I leave it to her Majesty&#x27;s wisdom; but if it should fall out so, I would I had never been born...And if [we] were to-morrow next on the coast of Spain, I would not land in any place to offend any; but they should well perceive that we came not to spoil, but to seek out the great force to fight with them; and so should they have known by message...But I must and will obey.

On 19 June Howard wrote that: &quot;You see it is very likely to come to pass, my opinion that I always had of the French King; as also of the treacherous treaty of peace, which was never to any other end but that the King of Spain might have time, and not be troubled in gathering his forces together...persuade her Majesty that she lose no more time in taking care enough of herself, and to make herself, every way that is possible, as strong as she can; for there is no question but the King of Spain hath engaged his honour to the uttermost in this, for the overthrow of her Majesty and this realm...if he be put back from this year, her Majesty may have a good and honourable peace. If not, yet she shall be sure he shall not be able to trouble her Majesty in many years after&quot;.

Howard wrote to Elizabeth on 23 June: &quot;For the love of Jesus Christ, Madam, awake thoroughly, and see the villainous treasons round about you, against your Majesty and your realm, and draw your forces round about you, like a might prince, to defend you&quot;. On the same day he said to Burghley: &quot;We must not lose one hour of time...Let her Majesty trust no more to Judas&#x27; kisses; for let her assure herself there is no trust to French King nor Duke of Parma. Let her defend herself like a noble and mighty prince, and trust to her sword and not to their word, and then she need not fear, for her good God will defend her&quot;.

On 19 July Howard received the news that the Armada had been seen off Lizard Point, Cornwall. Two days later he wrote to Walsingham:
...whereupon, although the wind was very scant, we first warped out of harbour that night, and upon Saturday turned out very hardly, the wind being at South-West; and about three of the clock in the afternoon, descried the Spanish fleet, and did what we could to work for the wind, which [by this] morning we had recovered, descrying their f[leet to] consist of 120 sail, whereof there are 4 g[alleasses] and many ships of great burden. At nine of the [clock] we gave them fight, which continued until one. [In this] fight we made some of them to bear room to stop their leaks; notwithstanding we durst not adventure to put in among them, their fleet being so strong. But there shall be nothing either neglected or unhazarded, that may work their overthrow. Sir, the captains in her Majesty&#x27;s ships have behaved themselves most bravely and like men.

On 29 July Howard wrote to Walsingham: &quot;Their force is wonderful great and strong; and yet we pluck their feathers by little and little. I pray to God that the forces on the land be strong enough to answer so present a force&quot;.

On 7 August he updated Walsingham:In our last fight with the enemy before Gravelines, the 29th July, we sank three of their ships and made four to go room with the shore so leak as they were not able to live at sea. After that fight, notwithstanding that our powder and shot was well near all spent, we set on a brag countenance and have them chase, as though we had wanted nothing, until we had cleared our own coast and some part of Scotland of them. And then...we made for the Frith, and sent certain pinnaces to dog the fleet until they should be past the Isles of Scotland, which I verily believe they are left at their sterns ere this...I must thank you for your favourable using of my brother Hoby. He telleth me how forwards you were to further all things for our wants. I would some were of your mind. If we had had that which had been sent, England and her Majesty had had the most honour that ever any nation had. But God be thanked; it is well.

The next day he wrote to Walsingham to say he was in Margate and that &quot;although we have put the Spanish fleet past the Frith, and I think past the Isles, yet God knoweth whether they go either to the Nase of Norway or into Denmark or to the Isles of Orkney to refresh themselves, and so to return; for I think they dare not return with this dishonour and shame to their King, and overthrow their Pope&#x27;s credit. Sir, sure bind, sure find. A kingdom is a great wager...Some made little account of the Spanish force by sea; but I do warrant you, all the world never saw such a force as theirs was; and some Spaniards that we have taken, that were in the fight at Lepanto, do say that the worst of our fights that we have had with them did exceed far the fight they had there&quot;. On 9 August Howard wrote that he believed the Armada would return because &quot;they dare not go back with this dishonour and shame; for we have marvellously plucked them&quot;.

The day after he wrote to Burghley: &quot;Sickness and mortality begins wonderfully to grow amongst us; and it is a most pitiful sight to see...how the men, having no place to receive them into here, die in the streets. I am driven myself, of force, to come a-land, to see them bestowed in some lodging; and the best I can get is barns and such outhouses; and the relief is small that I can provide for them here. It would grieve any man&#x27;s heart to see them that have served so valiantly to die so miserably&quot;. Howard wrote to Lord Winchester on 15 August: &quot;Whereas the Ryall of Weymouth hath served in her Majesty&#x27;s service of late against the Spaniards, in defence of religion, our prince and country, for the space of one month, wherein she and her company have performed their duties very well, and that now, in reward of their good service, they look for payment and satisfaction&quot;. Furthermore, Howard requested that Winchester &quot;and the rest of the justices of your shire, to cause an estimate to be first taken of the powder, shot, victuals and other charges of pay, and such like; and afterwards to cause the sum to be levied by equal contributions, as shall seem good to your Lordship and the rest, out of your shire of Dorset; and therewith to reward and satisfy the good service of the said ship and company&quot;.

In late August Howard wrote to Elizabeth, the Privy Council and Walsingham of the terrible sickness that had spread throughout the fleet. On 29 August he informed Walsingham: &quot;There is not any of them that hath one day&#x27;s victuals, and many [of them] have sent many sick men ashore here, and not one penny to relieve them...It were too pitiful to have men starve after such a service. I know her Majesty would not, for any good. Therefore I had rather open the Queen&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s purse something to relieve them, than they should be in that extremity; for we are to look to have more of these services; and if men should not be cared for better than to let them starve and die miserably, we should very hardly get man to serve. Sir, I desire [but] that there may be but double allowance of but as much as I [give] out of my own purse, and yet I am not the ablest man in [the realm]; but, before God, I had rather have never penny in the world than they should lack&quot;. In December Howard wrote to Burghley: &quot;...there hath grown a surcharge unto her Majesty of 623&quot;l&quot;. 10&quot;s&quot;. 11&quot;d&quot;. in this late service, by reason of certain extraordinary kinds of victuals, as wine, cider, sugar, oil, and certain fish, provided and distributed amongst the ships at Plymouth by my order, and Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s, which was done as well to relieve such men withal as by reason of sickness or being hurt in fight&quot;.

Howard commissioned the Italian writer Petruccio Ubaldini to write a chronicle on the defeat of the Armada. He also commissioned a Flemish artist, Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, to make a series of tapestries on the Armada, based on Augustine Ryther&#x27;s engravings. These tapestries were for many years at Howard&#x27;s London home and he sold them to James I to help pay for debts. In 1650 they were displayed in the House of Lords where they remained until destroyed by fire in October 1834. However they can still be seen in John Pine&#x27;s 1739 publication of &quot;The Tapestry Hangings of the House of Lords&quot;.
===Cadiz expedition: 1596===
Howard was created Earl of Nottingham in 1596 and was appointed Lord Lieutenant General of England [a unique and unprecedented title] in 1599. In 1596, when another Spanish invasion was feared, Howard was again appointed to defend England. Howard and the Earl of Essex jointly led an attack against the Spanish base at Cadiz on 20 June.

===3rd Spanish Armada===
During the Spanish armada of 1597, Essex was sent home in disgrace after the failed Azores Voyage having left the English coast unguarded. Adverse winds frustrated the Spanish fleet however and the English fleet was able to return safely. Howard took charge and sent out the fleet to intercept the Spanish and one of the ships captured a flyboat from which information was given about the Armada and its retreat back to Spanish ports. Howard was rewarded soon after by the Queen and was created Earl of Nottingham.

===Trial and execution of the Earl of Essex: 1601===
When Essex rebelled in 1601, Howard took command of the soldiers massed to defend London and defeated him in the field. Howard served as a commissioner at Essex&#x27;s trial and examined him at least once.

===Death of Elizabeth I: 1603===
The death of Howard&#x27;s wife affected Elizabeth; she remained in &quot;a deep melancholy, with conceit of her own death&quot;, complaining &quot;of many infirmities suddenly to have overtaken her&quot;. Howard was at Elizabeth&#x27;s deathbed and pressed her on the succession, receiving Elizabeth&#x27;s reply that it should be &quot;our cousin of Scotland&quot;. Elizabeth died on 24 March.

===Reign of James I===

Nottingham served as Lord High Steward at the coronation of the new king, James I.
The king appointed Howard to the English delegation that negotiated the peace treaty with Spain, and the subsequent ratification of the treaty at Valladolid. He presented a diamond jewel depicting the Habsburg emblems of the double eagle and golden fleece to Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain in Madrid. The King of Spain, Philip III gave him a diamond and gold feather jewel for his hat, a gold collar set with diamonds, and other jewellery and gilt plate, with gifts for his sons, his wife Margaret Stewart. His retinue in Spain including seven trumpeters and eight musicians.

Howard served on the commission of union between England and Scotland and served as commissioner at the Gunpowder Plot trial in 1605.

==Later life: 1619–1624==

Howard died in 1624 at the age of 88. None of his three sons left heirs, and shortly after the last died the Nottingham earldom was recreated for a close relative of the Earl of Winchilsea; the Howard of Effingham barony passed to descendants of his brother, the Earl of Effingham being the modern heir.

==Legacy==

William Bourne dedicated his 1578 book &quot;Inventions or Devices. Very Necessary for all Generalles and Captaines, as wel by Sea as by Land&quot; to Howard and Robert Norman dedicated to Howard his 1584 translations of two Dutch guides to North Sea coastlines. Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s 1598 edition of &quot;The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; was also dedicated to Howard.

During a debate on the American Revolutionary War in the House of Lords on 18 November 1777, Henry Howard, 12th Earl of Suffolk (a descendant of Howard) defended the war against the American colonists. Lord Chatham in response made his appeal:

Effingham has often been identified with the character Marinell from Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. He is one of the principal characters in the opera &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti, though referred to inaccurately as the &quot;Duke of Nottingham&quot;.

There is now a mixed comprehensive school, Howard of Effingham School, named after him. It is located in the village of Effingham in Surrey. He was portrayed by John Shrapnel in the film . The site of his estate in south Croydon is now the location of Whitgift School.

==Children==
He was married first to Catherine Carey, daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and Ann Morgan. They had five children:
* Frances Howard (buried 11 July 1628). She was married first to Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare. She was secondly married to Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham.

<text>Forterra Systems, Inc. was a 3D graphics software company headquartered in San Mateo, California that produced private and secure massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) virtual worlds for corporate, government, defense, medical and educational clients. Forterra Systems also shared a close history with the MMOG &quot;There&quot;. On February 1, 2010, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) announced its acquisition of the company&#x27;s simulation &amp; collaboration product line, including all names, trademarks and licenses.

Founded in 1998 as There, Inc., Forterra Systems built private and secure distributed virtual worlds using their OLIVE (On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment) technology platform and industry-standard PC server and client hardware. OLIVE virtual environments typically are deployed within a client&#x27;s existing IT and network security systems. Optionally, OLIVE could be hosted externally by Forterra, depending upon the customer&#x27;s preferences.

==On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment==
On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment (OLIVE) customers rapidly generate realistic, three-dimensional virtual environments that scale from single user applications to large-scale simulated environments that support a vast number of concurrent users.

The virtual worlds produced or hosted by Forterra Systems and their clients appear to function similarly to public, open-invitation MMOGs (e.g., &quot;There&quot;, &quot;Second Life&quot;, &quot;Active Worlds&quot;). OLIVE environments differ from consumer-based MMOGs in that access to the virtual world is privately managed, and granted only to specific groups of users. OLIVE applications typically focus on employee or staff training, and secure collaborative business decision-making, for example, rather than focusing on entertainment or broadly-defined social networking purposes.

Another difference between conventional MMO virtual environments and OLIVE environments is that real-world locations are replicated in an OLIVE virtual world, as opposed to fantasy-based worlds or hypothetical &quot;islands&quot;.

&quot;There&quot; is based on shared technology with Forterra Systems that was initially developed in conjunction with a US Army project. The &quot;There&quot; service was spun off to Makena Technologies in 2005. &quot;There&quot;&#x27;s operations remained uninterrupted during the various corporate changes. Since then, two additional instances of &quot;There&quot; have been created, both owned and administered by Makena Technologies.

<text>Cornell College is a private liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Originally the Iowa Conference Seminary, the school was founded in 1853 by George Bryant Bowman. Four years later, in 1857, the name was changed to Cornell College, in honor of iron tycoon William Wesley Cornell.

==Academics==
Cornell students study one course at a time (commonly referred to as &quot;the block plan&quot; or &quot;OCAAT&quot;). Since 1978, school years have been divided into &quot;blocks&quot; of three and a half weeks each (usually followed by a four-day &quot;block break&quot; to round out to four weeks), during which students are enrolled in a single class; what would normally be covered in a full semester&#x27;s worth of class at a typical university is covered in just eighteen Cornell class days. While schedules vary from class to class, most courses consist of around 30 hours of lecture, along with additional time spent in the laboratory, studying audio-visual media, or other activities. Cornell formerly operated on a calendar of 9 blocks per year but switched to 8 blocks per year beginning in the fall of 2012.

Since its inception, Cornell has accepted women into all degree programs. In 1858, Cornell was host to Iowa&#x27;s first female recipient of a baccalaureate degree, Mary Fellows, a member of the first graduating class from Cornell College. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. In 1871, Harriette J. Cooke became the first female college professor in the United States to become a full professor with a salary equal to that of her male colleagues.

==Campus buildings==
Among the most widely recognizable buildings on Cornell&#x27;s campus is King Chapel. The chapel is the site of the annual convocation at the commencement of the school year as well as the baccalaureate service in the spring for graduating students. The chapel contains a large organ (over 3000 pipes) and is often the site of musical performances. Religious services are held in the nearby Allee Chapel.

Old Sem, for a short while, was the second building of the original college and now houses administrative offices of the college.

Cornell contains 9 academic buildings. College Hall (also sometimes called &quot;Old Main&quot;), the oldest building on campus, houses classrooms and offices of several social science and humanities departments. South Hall, originally a male dormitory, houses the Politics and Creative Writing Departments. Prall House contains offices and classrooms of the Philosophy and Religion Departments. The Merle West Science Center houses the Physics, Biology, and Chemistry Departments. West Science contains one of the school&#x27;s two stadium seating lecture-style classrooms, with a capacity around 100. These have since been relocated to the new science building, Russell Science Center. It opened for classes for the 2019–2020 academic year. The Norton Geology Center contains both an extensive museum and classrooms for geological sciences. Law Hall includes the Math, Computer Science, and Psychology Departments, and is the computing hub of the campus. McWethy Hall, formerly a gymnasium, was remodeled and now contains the studios and offices of the Art Department. Armstrong Hall and Youngker Hall are adjoining fine arts buildings. Armstrong Hall is the location of the Music Department, while Youngker Hall contains the Theatre Department, including Kimmel Theatre. In addition, the Small Sports Center and the Lytle House contain classrooms of the Kinesiology Department.

Cole Library serves both the college and the Mount Vernon community.

Cornell has several residence halls. Pfeiffer Hall, Tarr Hall, and Dows Hall together form the &quot;Tri-Hall&quot; area. Tarr was once an all-male residence hall, but now houses both males and females. Likewise, Dows, once an all-female residence hall, joins Pfeiffer and Tarr in providing co-ed housing. Tarr and Dows are both primarily freshmen dorms, while Pfeiffer houses upperclassmen as well as first-years. Pfeiffer was extensively renovated in 2008 and is co-ed by room. Bowman-Carter Hall is an all-female hall for upperclassmen, situated in an old hospital building. Pauley-Rorem Hall (commonly referred to as PR) is a combination of two residence halls that are joined in the middle by a common set of stairs. Female first-years resided in Pauley, and male first-years resided in Rorem until 2012-2013 when both residence halls became co-ed by floor. Pauley Hall was once home to the Pauley Academic Program, a community of male and female students with strong academic backgrounds. Pauley Hall was co-ed by floor as early as 1986, and in 1987–1989, the second floor Pauley was home to the Academic Program and was co-ed by room. Olin and Merner Hall are co-ed upper-class residence halls. New and Russell Hall (the latter commonly known as Clock Tower) were opened in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and offer suite-style living. Students may choose more independent living options in apartments at Wilch Apartments, 10th Avenue, Armstrong House, and Harlan House, and even at the Sleep Inn. Nearly all Cornell students are required to live on-campus or in campus apartments, so most students do not rent non-college housing.

The Cornell campus is centered on a modest hill, the feature noted in the moniker &quot;Hilltop Campus.&quot; Several campus buildings are grouped on the hilltop, while the athletic facilities and some residential buildings are located farther downhill on the campus&#x27;s northwest side.

==Athletics==
Cornell College fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams, all of which compete in NCAA Division III sports. Formerly a member of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC), Cornell joined the Midwest Conference (MWC) in the fall of 2012.

Cornell has achieved its greatest success in wrestling. Cornell wrestlers have won eight individual national titles, and in 1947, the wrestling team won the NCAA Division I and AAU national championships. Sixty-Two Cornell wrestlers have been named NCAA All-Americans, and seven have been elected to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. Seven wrestlers have also competed at the Olympics.

Another Cornell team has also met with success recently. In 2011, the women&#x27;s volleyball team captured the IIAC title and went on to take part in the national tournament for the first time in school history. Since then, the women&#x27;s volleyball team has moved to the Midwest Conference (MWC) and won the MWC title seven times consecutively—six of those seven years making it to the national tournament.

Twenty-five Cornell students have earned NCAA Postgraduate Scholarships, awarded annually to students in their final year of eligibility who excel both athletically and academically. Cornell ranks in the top 15 Division III colleges in recipients of this award.

Cornell&#x27;s football rivalry with Coe College dates to 1891, making it the oldest intercollegiate rivalry west of the Mississippi. Coe currently holds the lead in the series, 60-51-4.

Cornell&#x27;s mascot is a ram. In 1949, the Royal Purple, the school&#x27;s yearbook, offered a $5 prize for someone who could come up with a new mascot to replace either the &quot;Purples&quot; or &quot;Hilltoppers.&quot; A sophomore came up with the idea for the ram.

==Greek life==

From 1853-1927 over twenty literary societies and secret societies emerged as the backbone of social life at Cornell. In 1927, all of these groups voluntarily disbanded, and in 1929, faculty voted to allow groups to organize as Greek organizations, provided that they renounced all ties to national Greek organization. At present, Cornell College has 11 officially recognized local fraternities and sororities.

<doc id="589222" wikidata="Q17113225" url="?curid=589222" title="The Cat Who...">
<text>The Cat Who... is a series of twenty-nine mystery novels and three related collections by Lilian Jackson Braun and published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, featuring a reporter named Jim Qwilleran and his Siamese cats, Kao K&#x27;o-Kung (Koko for short) and Yum Yum. The first was written in 1966, with two more following in 1967 and 1968. The fourth appeared eighteen years later, after which at least one new novel was published every year until 2007. A thirtieth novel, originally announced for 2008, was postponed indefinitely by its publisher and then canceled after the author&#x27;s death in 2011. It remains unpublished.

==Main characters==
James Mackintosh Qwilleran is the main human character in the books. Qwilleran (Qwill to his friends) is a man who goes from late forties to mid fifties over the course of the series. He is often described as looking melancholy or brooding, but he is witty and enjoyable company. His most distinguishing feature is his &quot;luxuriant moustache.&quot;

&quot;Kao K’o-Kung&quot; is the full name of the Siamese cat who is almost always referred to as Koko. He is named after a 13th-century Chinese artist whose name is usually written in modern Pinyin as Gao Kegong. He has the appearance of a prize-winning show-cat and an obstinate attitude toward anything he does not like.

Yum Yum is also Siamese, and had a troubled past. Yum Yum is named after a character in the opera &quot;The Mikado&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan who is also the ward of a man named Ko-Ko. Yum Yum is described as being smaller than Koko, and far more affectionate. Her beautiful violet-blue eyes are slightly crossed.

<text>Irmgard Maria Elisabeth Möller (born 13 May 1947) is a German former militant. She joined the Red Army Faction (RAF) in 1971. After participating in two bombings she was arrested the following year. During the German Autumn of 1977, she was one of the prisoners demanded by the RAF to be freed and was part of an alleged suicide pact in Stammheim Prison with Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe. The other three died and she survived, claiming it was an assassination attempt. She was released from prison in 1994.

==Early life==
Irmgard Möller was born in 13 May 1947. In the late 1960s, she studied in Munich and participated in protests such as the occupation of the Institut für Zeitungswissenschaften. She joined the Tupamaros Munich and lived in a commune with Fritz Teufel. She joined the Red Army Faction (RAF) in 1971.

==RAF activity==

In October 1971, Möller and fellow RAF members Margrit Schiller and Gerhard Müller were involved with a shootout with the police which ended with one officer dead and Schiller arrested. Both she and Schiller later said that Müller had shot the policeman. According to Müller, who later turned police informant, Möller and Angela Luther walked into the police headquarters in Augsburg and placed pipe bombs in empty offices on 12 May 1972. The subsequent explosions injured five policemen. Two weeks later, Möller, Luther, Andreas Baader and Holger Meins bombed the Campbell Barracks of the United States Army Europe and Africa in Heidelberg. Three soldiers were killed in the attack.

Recent RAF recruit Hans-Peter Konieczny was persuaded by the police to become an informant and betrayed Möller and Klaus Jünschke, who were both arrested on 9 July 1972 in Offenbach am Main. Möller received a sentence of four and a half years in prison and in January 1977 was moved to the high-security Stammheim Prison, where she inhabited a floor with fellow RAF militants Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe.

==German Autumn==

During the German Autumn of 1977, the powerful German industrialist and former SS (Nazi) officer Hanns Martin Schleyer was kidnapped on 5 September by the RAF. The group demanded the release of eleven prisoners, including Möller. In October, Lufthansa Flight 181 was hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in support of the RAF communique and then stormed by the GSG 9 special forces unit after it had landed in Somalia. The day after the failure of the hijack, the German authorities announced that Baader, Ensslin, Möller and Raspe had tried to kill themselves in a suicide pact. Baader and Ensslin died, whilst Raspe died of his wounds several hours later and Möller survived. In response, the RAF murdered Schleyer.

When she had recovered, Möller stated it was an assassination attempt and there was no suicide pact. She had been awakened around 04:30 on the morning of 17 October by loud bangs and she had not stabbed herself four times in her chest. Baader and Raspe had allegedly shot themselves, so questions were raised about how they had obtained guns in a supermax prison; Baader had powder burns on his right hand, but he was left-handed.

==Release==
Möller was released from prison on 1 December 1994. She published a book in which the journalist interviewed her about her time in the RAF.

<text>A bimetallic strip or bimetal strip is a strip that consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated. They are used to convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher coefficient of thermal expansion is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.

The invention of the bimetallic strip is generally credited to John Harrison, an eighteenth-century clockmaker who made it for his third marine chronometer (H3) of 1759 to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the balance spring. Harrison&#x27;s invention is recognized in the memorial to him in Westminster Abbey, England.

== Characteristics ==

The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually steel and copper, or in some cases steel and brass. The strips are joined together throughout their length by riveting, brazing or welding. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher coefficient of thermal expansion is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled. The sideways displacement of the strip is much larger than the small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals.

In some applications, the bimetal strip is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for compactness. The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.

The radius of curvature formula_1 of a bimetallic strip depends on temperature formula_2 according the formula derived by French physicist Yvon Villarceau in 1863 in his research for improving the precision of clocks: 

:formula_3,

where formula_4 is the total thickness of the bimetal and formula_5 is a dimensionless coefficient. For each metallic strip: formula_6 is the Young modulus, formula_7 is the coefficient of thermal expansion and formula_8 is the thickness. The formula can also be rewritten as a function of the thermal misfit strain formula_9. And if the modulus and height are similar, we simply have formula_10.

An equivalent formula can be derived from the beam theory.

== History ==
The earliest surviving bimetallic strip was made by the eighteenth-century clockmaker John Harrison who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third marine chronometer (H3) of 1759 to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the balance spring. It should not be confused with the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his gridiron pendulum. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison&#x27;s invention is recognized in the memorial to him in Westminster Abbey, England.

== Composition ==

The metals involved in a bimetallic strip can vary in composition so long as their thermal expansion coefficients differ. The metal of lower thermal expansion coefficient is sometimes called the passive metal, while the other is called the active metal. Copper, steel, brass, iron, and nickel are commonly used metals in bimetallic strips. Metal alloys have been used in bimetallic strips as well, such as invar and constantan. Material selection has a significant impact on the working temperature range of a bimetallic strip, with some having a temperature limit up to 500°C, with others only reaching 150°C before failing.

== Applications ==

This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices.

=== Clocks ===

Mechanical clock mechanisms are sensitive to temperature changes as each part has tiny tolerance and it leads to errors in time keeping. A bimetallic strip is used to compensate this phenomenon in the mechanism of some timepieces. The most common method is to use a bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the balance wheel. What it does is move a weight in a radial way looking at the circular plane down by the balance wheel, varying then, the momentum of inertia of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with the increasing temperature, the balance becomes smaller in diameter to decrease the momentum of inertia and keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.

Nowadays this system is not used anymore since the appearance of low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox, parachrom and many others depending on each brand.

=== Thermostats ===

In the regulation of heating and cooling, thermostats that operate over a wide range of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the &quot;set point&quot;.

Some thermostats use a mercury switch connected to both electrical leads. The angle of the entire mechanism is adjustable to control the set point of the thermostat.

Depending upon the application, a higher temperature may open a contact (as in a heater control) or it may close a contact (as in a refrigerator or air conditioner).

The electrical contacts may control the power directly (as in a household iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a relay or the supply of natural gas or fuel oil through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a thermocouple that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered spark generating device.

=== Thermometers ===

A direct indicating dial thermometer, common in household devices (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer), uses a bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil in its most common design. The coil changes the linear movement of the metal expansion into a circular movement thanks to the helicoidal shape it draws. One end of the coil is fixed to the housing of the device as a fix point and the other drives an indicating needle inside a circular indicator. A bimetallic strip is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet&#x27;s thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix in order to have a more accurate result.

=== Heat engine ===

Heat engines are not the most efficient ones, and with the use of bimetallic strips the efficiency of the heat engine is even lower as there is no chamber to contain the heat. Moreover, the bimetallic strips cannot produce strength in its moves, the reason why is that in order to achieve reasonables bendings (movements) both metallic strips have to be thin to make the difference between the expansion noticeable. So the uses for metallic strips in heat engines are mostly in simple toys that have been built to demonstrate how the principle can be used to drive a heat engine.

=== Electrical devices ===

Bimetal strips are used in miniature circuit breakers to protect circuits from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.

Bimetal strips are also used in time-delay relays, gas oven safety valves, thermal flashers for older turn signal lamps, and fluorescent lamp starters. In some devices, the current running directly through the bimetal strip is sufficient to heat it and operate contacts directly. It has also been used in mechanical PWM voltage regulators for automotive uses.

<text>Cairo International Airport (; &quot;Maṭār El Qāhira El Dawli&quot;) is the principal international airport of Cairo and the largest and busiest airport in Egypt. It serves as the primary hub for Egyptair and Nile Air as well as several other airlines. The airport is located in Heliopolis, to the northeast of Cairo around from the business area of the city and has an area of approximately . It is the busiest airport in Africa and one of the busiest airports in the Middle East in terms of total passengers.

== History ==
During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) built John Payne Field Air Force Base to serve the Allied Forces, rather than take over the existing Almaza Airport located away. Payne Field was a major Air Transport Command air cargo and passenger hub, connecting westwards through Benghazi Airport (during the war known as &quot;Soluch Airfield&quot;) to Algiers airport on the North African route to Dakar Airport, in French West Africa.

Other locations that transport routes were flown were RAF Habbaniya, Iraq on the Cairo – Karachi, India route; Lydda Airport, British Palestine; Jeddah, Arabia, on the Central African route to Roberts Field, Liberia (1941–1943), and later after the war ended, Athens, Greece and on to destinations in Europe.

When American forces left the base at the end of the war, the Civil Aviation Authority took over the facility and began using it for international civil aviation. In 1963, Cairo International Airport replaced the old Heliopolis Airport, which had been located at the Hike-Step area in the east of Cairo.

The airport is administered by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, which controls the Cairo Airport Company, the Egyptian Airports Company, National Air Navigation Services and Aviation Information Technology, and the Cairo Airport Authority. In 2004, Fraport AG won the management contract to run the airport for eight years, with options to extend the contract twice in one-year increments.

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 is the oldest terminal currently in operation, having been inaugurated on 18 March 1963 by President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Over the years, the terminal witnessed several expansion projects; a second hall was constructed between 1977–79 and a third one was completed in 1980. In the early 2000s, work commenced on the renovation of the ground floor, along with the addition of an expanded departure hall containing a mezzanine floor, thereby allowing more natural light into the terminal. All phases of the project were completed by the end of 2003.

Terminal 1 was originally used by EgyptAir and several Middle Eastern airlines. However, an increasing number of other foreign carriers, such as Air France and KLM transferred operations from Terminal 2 in 2006.

The terminal facilities include Departure Hall 1, International Hall 3, and Hall 4 for private and non-commercial aircraft services. 

Departures and arrivals are with all airlines departing from Terminal 1 Hall 1, with the exception of Saudia. Most international airlines arrive in Hall 3. Arrival Hall serves international and domestic arrivals.

The CAC has inaugurated the &quot;Airport City Concept&quot; to provide an array of services and entertainment facilities to travelers, airport visitors, as well as the general public. The first phase, a new shopping mall called the &#x27;AirMall&#x27; has been built near Terminal 1&#x27;s International Arrival Hall 3.

As of 2009, the facade of the terminal was being upgraded. Terminal 1 has 12 gates.

====Hall 4====
Terminal 1, Hall 4 is dedicated to private jet and executive jet services. Even though it is referred to as a &#x27;Hall&#x27; under Terminal 1 it is operated independently from the commercial passenger terminal.

Smart Aviation Company has been based at the building since 2007; it moved to a new executive FBO in 2010 adjacent to Hall 4.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 was inaugurated in 1986 with 7 boarding gates. It primarily served European, Gulf and East Asian airlines. The terminal was closed in April 2010 for complete renovations starting in 2012 and lasting 36 months. The architecture of the building limited the opportunities for further expansion, which necessitated the entire building to be closed for major structural overhaul at an estimated cost of approximately $400 million.
The renovated terminal is operating jointly with Terminal 3 as one integrated terminal via an air bridge, thus, reinforcing the role of Cairo International Airport as a regional hub.

===Terminal 3===

Given projected growth, and the limited ability to expand Terminal 2, the Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation began construction of Terminal 3 in 2004. The terminal was officially inaugurated on 18 December 2008 and opened for commercial operations on 27 April 2009. The facility is twice as large as the current two terminal buildings combined, with the capacity to handle 11 million passengers annually (6 million international and 5 million domestic) once the first phase is completed. It is adjacent to Terminal 2, and the two terminals are initially connected by a bridge.

With its hub at the airport, EgyptAir&#x27;s operations were overhauled with the full transfer of its operations (international and domestic) into the new terminal between 27 April and 15 June 2009. To implement the Star Alliance &quot;Move Under One Roof&quot; concept, all Alliance members serving the airport were relocated to the terminal by 1 August 2009.

The new terminal includes:
* Two piers of extendable capacity and gates facilities serving domestic and international traffic on contact and remote stands. The main building and the piers are connected by concourses. Two of the gates are equipped to handle Airbus A380 aircraft. Provisions for a third pier are in the planning stages.
* Terminal 3 has 23 gates (two gates for the A380), six check-in islands consisting of 110 check-in counters (plus 10 mobile counters and 10 CUSS kiosks), 76 immigration counters (plus five biometric gates), 52 contact and remote aircraft parking stands (five with multiple uses), 425 FIDS, 15 public information points, seven baggage carousels, 63 elevators, 50 moving walkways and 51 escalators.
* Retail space covers more than 5,000 m2 (4.034 m2 occupied by EgyptAir Tourism &amp; Duty Free Shops).
*International food court with Oriental, Asian and Western food (incl. Burger King, Hippopotamus, Upper Crust).
*Landside roads including bridges and flyover serving the traffic to and from the terminal building, surface car park areas (multi-story parking garage capable of holding more than 3,000 cars), a new access road connecting the airport with the Autostrad road (Cairo ring road) and upgrading the access roads.

===Seasonal flight terminal===
On 20 September 2011, Prime Minister Sharaf inaugurated the new Seasonal Flights Terminal (ST), located west of Terminal 3. During the start-up phase EgyptAir operates its daily flight to Medina from the new Terminal. All Hajj traffic of EgyptAir will move to the ST while Saudia&#x27;s Hajj flights will still operate from Terminal 1.

The terminal has an annual capacity of 3.2 million passengers with 27 check-in counters and 7 gates with a common gate and single security concept, the first in Cairo. It is designed to handle 1,200 passengers per hour. Passengers will be bussed to remote aircraft stands around Terminal 3. Its purpose is to ease operational strains on the existing terminals during pilgrim seasons.

==Facilities==
===Overview===

The airport has four terminals, the third (and largest) opened on 27 April 2009 and the Seasonal Flights Terminal opened on 20 September 2011. Terminal 2 was closed in April 2010 for major renovation works and was reopened on 28 September 2016. A third parallel runway replaced the crossing runway in 2010. Runway 05L/23R is long, 05C/23C has a length of , and the new runway is designated as 05R/23L and is long.

====Terminal transfer====
The MiniMetro people mover links Terminal 1, the AirMall, the multi-storey car park and Terminals 2 and 3. The main station is located between Terminals 2 and 3 and is an integral part of the bridge connecting the two terminals. An air-cushioned system with top speed was designed and constructed by Leitner-Poma.

====Airport hotel====
A luxury 350-room five-star Le Méridien hotel opened in front of Terminal 3 in December 2013. The hotel is linked to the terminal by a skyway that is also equipped with a moving walkway.

== Statistics ==
The sharp decline in 2020 was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and in Egypt.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

===Cargo===
==Ground transport==

===Limousines and shuttle buses===
There are several ways to leave Cairo airport upon arrival. The most convenient way is by one of the numerous &quot;limousine services&quot;. Pick-up points are in front of the terminals (curb side). The prices are fixed depending on the destination and the car category, but different providers may charge wildly different prices. Category A are luxury limousines (e.g. Mercedes-Benz E-Class), Category B are micro buses for up to seven passengers, Category C are midsized cars (e.g. Mitsubishi Lancer) and new Category D are London Taxis.

===Public transport===
A shuttle bus connects with all the passenger terminals and finally stops at the Cairo Airport Bus Terminal where public buses heading to other destinations in Cairo and connect frequently to major transportation hubs like Abbasia and Tahrir Square/Abdel-Moniem Riad bus terminus.

However, there were efforts by Transport for Cairo (TFC) to map the major bus routes and metro lines in Cairo. Having this map in hand is useful.

Also, scheduling and route information of both the public Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) and Mwasalat Mirs (MM) buses are now readily available on Google Transit and can be accessed using the Google Maps app and website.

There were plans to connect the Line 3 of the Cairo Metro to the airport, however, these plans have been put on hold. The nearest metro stations are Heliopolis and Adly Mansour stations.

===Taxi===
With the exception of the so-called (and increasingly scarce) &quot;Black and White&quot; cabs, all regular Cairo taxis (colloquially known as the White taxi) are equipped with digital taxi meters. Taxi drivers in Cairo are legally required to switch on their Taxi meters the moment they pick up a new client (See video on Mada Masr). However, some taxi drivers will try to either manipulate how the meter counts the distance driven (by electronically tampering with their meters).

===Ride sharing===
An affordable and reliable form of private transport readily available in Cairo are the popular ride-sharing mobile phone app based services such as Uber and Careem, which both accepts cash and card payments.

===Car===
The airport can be reached via Oroba Road from Heliopolis or via the new road, connecting Terminal 3 with the Cairo Ring Road and Suez Road interchange. The toll for driving into the airport grounds is approximately 30 EGP, depending on the type of the vehicle.

Note: Cairo-Suez road is part of the Arab Mashreq International Road Network, designated as the Motorway 50/M50. It connects Cairo to Suez, South Sinai through the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the Suez Canal, then to Israel via the Taba Border Crossing, Jordan via the Wadi Araba Crossing, to Saudi Arabia via Durra Border Crossing, and then finally into Iraq via the Arar border crossing where the road ends in the capital, Baghdad. To bypass crossing through the Taba Border Crossing, where an entry visa to Israel may be required, the majority of the intra-Arab road traffic -including cargo and trucking- uses the Nuweiba – Aqaba ferries.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 20 February 1956, a Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux Douglas DC-6B on a scheduled Saigon-Karachi-Cairo-Paris flight crashed on approach to Cairo airport, killing 52 of the 63 people on board.
* On 12 June 1961, KLM Flight 823, a Lockheed L-188 Electra crashed 4 km (2.5 mi) SE of Cairo Airport because of the pilot-in-command &#x27;s inattention to his instruments. Three crew and 17 passengers were killed out of the 36 passengers and crew on board.
* On 15 May 1962, a United Arab Airlines Douglas DC-3 crashed shortly after takeoff for a cargo flight to Beirut. All three occupants died.
* On 19 March 1965, Vickers Viscount YI-ACU of Iraqi Airways was damaged beyond economic repair when it ran into a number of lamp standards after a hydraulic system failure.
* On 20 May 1965, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 705, a Boeing 720-040B, crashed on approach to Runway 34, killing 121.
* On 18 March 1966, United Arab Airlines Flight 749 crashed while attempting to land at Cairo International Airport. All 30 passengers and crew on board were killed.
* On 15 January 1968, Douglas DC-3 SU-AJG of United Arab Airlines departed on an international scheduled cargo flight to Beirut when the crew decided to return due to icing. The aircraft subsequently broke up in mid-air and crashed at Zefta, killing all four people on board. The cargo shifting in flight and the aircraft being overloaded may have contributed to the accident.
* On 6 September 1970, Pan Am Flight 93, which was flying to New York City from Amsterdam, was hijacked and landed in Cairo after refueling and picking up another hijacker in Beirut. The Boeing 747–100 was blown up after everyone got out. The hijackers were arrested later.
* On 10 June 1986, an Air Sinai Fokker F-27 Friendship upon returning to Cairo crashed short of the runway while approaching in a sandstorm, colliding with the side of a building and catching fire. All five crew and 18 passengers out of the 26 on board were killed.
* On 31 March 1988, an Arax Airlines Douglas DC-8 crashed on its second takeoff attempt at the runway end because of an engine fire. All four occupants died.
* On 29 July 2011, EgyptAir Flight 667 caught fire while parked at the terminal just before its scheduled flight to Saudi Arabia. Everyone on board was able to quickly evacuate the aircraft.

<text>Forro Creole () or Sãotomense () is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe.

It should not be confused with São Tomean Portuguese, the non-creolised form of Portuguese spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe by the majority of São Toméans.

== History ==

São Tomé is an island of the Gulf of Guinea, discovered by the Portuguese in the 15th century. It was uninhabited at the time, but Portuguese settlers used the island as a center of the slave trade, and there was a need for slaves on the island. It has been theorised that since both parties needed to communicate, a pidgin was formed. The substrate languages were from the Bantu and Kwa groups. It is believed that this pidgin then became fixed (creolized) as it became the mother language of children born from Portuguese men and African women slaves. Mixed marriages were then encouraged by the Portuguese Crown, for the sake of settlement.

Later, because of Dutch and French pressure to gain the island, many Portuguese settlers left. Children of Portuguese and black women were, eventually, not considered African or slaves; some were considered full right Portuguese citizens. Those mixed-race people that did not have the status of Portuguese citizens, those with darker skin, often gained a &quot;forro&quot; designation, because their Portuguese fathers did not want to enslave their children. The São Tomean Creole is mostly known as &quot;Forro&quot;, the language of the freed slaves or Crioulo Santomense, not to be confused with São Tomean Portuguese (a variety and dialect of Portuguese in São Tomé and Príncipe). Portuguese is the main language for children until their early 20s, when they relearn Forro Creole. The rich São Tomean culture also preserves a unique mixture of Portuguese and African cultures. European Portuguese is mostly spoken in formal situations, in the media, business, education, judicial system and legislature, while Forro and Sao Tomean Portuguese are preferred for informal situations as a vernacular language in day-to-day life and daily activities, and code switching even occurs between Forro, standard European Portuguese, and São Tomean Portuguese in informal speech.

== Classification and related languages ==

Forro is a creole language with a majority of its lexicon coming from Portuguese, the superstrate language. The substrate languages were from the Bantu and Kwa groups. It is similar to two other creoles spoken in the country (Principense Creole and Angolar Creole) as well as to the creole found in the island of Annobón, Equatorial Guinea (Annobonese Creole).

== Geographic distribution ==

Forro Creole is spoken mainly in São Tomé Island (most of it); there are some speakers in Principe Island.

Due to their great similarity and historical derivation, Principe Island&#x27;s Principense Creole and Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s Annobonese Creole may be regarded as dialects of Forro Creole. Forro&#x27;s lexical similarity is 77% with Principense Creole, 62% with Fa d’Ambu Creole and 70% with Angolar Creole.

== Vocabulary ==

Although the São Tomean Creole had (and still has) a restricted contact with Portuguese (seen as a prestigious language), it did preserve a larger number of the substrate languages&#x27; elements, more than the creoles of Cape Verde. Roughly 93% of São Tomean Creole lexicon is from Portuguese and 7% of African origin. Most Forro Creole speakers also speak non-creolised Portuguese.

Although 95% of São Tomeans speak Portuguese and it is the country&#x27;s national language, Forro Creole is traditionally said to be spoken by 85% of the inhabitants of São Tomé Island, or 81.7% of the country&#x27;s population. However, official census figures state that only 36.2% of the population can speak Forro Creole, and the creole is now considered threatened.

== Writing system ==

Forro was and is largely an oral language; there is no standard orthography.

== Examples ==

:Hello: &quot;Seja lovadu!&quot; (proposed: &quot;sejalovadu&quot;); From Port. 
:Good Morning: &quot;Bom dja ô&quot; (proposed: &quot;Bondja o&quot;); From Port. 
:Good Afternoon: &quot;Bos tadji ô&quot; (proposed: &quot;Boxtadji o&quot;); From Port. or 
:Good Evening: &quot;Boj notxi ô&quot; (proposed: &quot;Bojnotxi o&quot;); From Port. or 
:What&#x27;s your name: &quot;Que nomi bo e?&quot; (proposed: &quot;Ke nomi bo e?&quot;); possibly from Port. or 
:My name&#x27;s Pedro: &quot;Nomi mu sa Pedro&quot;; possibly from Port. .

Not everything is from Portuguese:
:I live in Neves (São Tomean city): &quot;Nga-ta Tlaxa.&quot; (&quot;-ta&quot; is from and &quot;tlaxa&quot; is from )

<doc id="589250" wikidata="Q152920" url="?curid=589250" title="4183 Cuno">
<text>4183 Cuno, provisional designation , is an eccentric, rare-type asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, and measures approximately 4 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered on 5 June 1959, by German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister at Boyden Observatory in Bloemfontein, South Africa, and later named in the discoverer&#x27;s honor.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Cuno&quot; orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7–3.2 AU once every 2 years and 9 months (1,019 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.63 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its identification as , the first used observation made at Palomar Observatory in 1986, approximately 27 years after its official discovery observation at Boyden.

The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which translates into 11 lunar distances. &quot;Cuno&quot; approaches the Earth to within 40 million kilometers six times in the 21st century. On 20 May 2012, it made its closest Earth approach at a distance of . It will not make a closer approach until 2093 when it will pass Earth at .

Due to its eccentric orbit, it is also a Mars and Venus-crosser.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type and composition ===

&quot;Cuno&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid. As it has a reflective surface, composed of a mixture different silicates, nickel and iron, Cuno has been characterized as a rare Q-type asteroid by the 1-meter Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope on La Palma, Pan-STARRS″ large-scale magnitude survey, and NASA IRTF telescope. On the SMASS taxonomic scheme, Cuno is a Sq-subtype, a transitional group between the S and Q types.

=== Rotation and shape ===

Several rotational lightcurves were obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec and American astronomer Brian Warner between 1998 and 2014. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 3.56 hours with a high brightness amplitude between 0.47 and 0.83 in magnitude, indicating that the body has a non-spheroidal shape.

In December 2000, Cuno was analysed by radar to determine its shape. The resultant images are lacking in detail, but indicate a rough sphere with some kind of concave depression 1–2 km in diameter.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

Following the space-based surveys carried out by NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope and the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Cuno&quot; has an albedo between 0.097 and 0.36, and a diameter between 2.945 and 5.618 kilometers.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for the stony asteroid of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 3.9 kilometer with an absolute magnitude of 14.4, as the higher the body&#x27;s albedo (reflectivity), the lower its diameter at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).

This minor planet was named after its discoverer, Cuno Hoffmeister, according to the established practice to name near-Earth asteroids with a four-letter masculine name. The central main-belt asteroid 1726 Hoffmeister, namesake of the Hofmeister family, is also named after the discoverer. The official naming citation was published on 28 May 1991 ().

<text>Sir William Huggins (7 February 1824 – 12 May 1910) was a British astronomer best known for his pioneering work in astronomical spectroscopy together with his wife, Margaret.

==Biography==

William Huggins was born at Cornhill, Middlesex, in 1824. In 1875, he married Margaret Lindsay, daughter of John Murray of Dublin, who also had an interest in astronomy and scientific research.

She encouraged her husband&#x27;s photography and helped to put their research on a systematic footing.

Huggins built a private observatory at 90 Upper Tulse Hill, London, from where he and his wife carried out extensive observations of the spectral emission lines and absorption lines of various celestial objects.

On 29 August 1864, Huggins was the first to take the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he analysed NGC 6543.

He was also the first to distinguish between nebulae and galaxies by showing that some (like the Orion Nebula) had pure emission spectra characteristic of gas, while others like the Andromeda Galaxy had the spectral characteristics of stars.

Huggins was assisted in the analysis of spectra by his neighbor, the chemist William Allen Miller. Huggins was also the first to adopt dry plate photography in imaging astronomical objects.

With observations of Sirius showing a redshift in 1868, Huggins hypothesized that a radial velocity of the star could be computed.

Huggins won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867, jointly with William Allen Miller. He later served as President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1876 to 1878, and received the Gold Medal again (this time alone) in 1885. He served as an officer of the Royal Astronomical Society for a total of 37 years, more than any other person.

Huggins was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1865, was awarded their Royal Medal (1866), Rumford Medal (1880) and Copley Medal (1898) and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1885.

He then served as President of the Royal Society from 1900 to 1905. For example, his Presidential Address in 1904 praised the fallen Fellows and distributed the prizes of that year.

He died at his home in Tulse Hill, London, after an operation for a hernia in 1910 and was buried at Golders Green Crematorium.

== Telescopes ==
In 1856 Huggins acquired a 5-inch diameter aperture telescope by Dollond. In 1858 an 8-inch telescope by Clark was added. These were both refracting telescopes. They had glass objectives.

In 1871 Huggins acquired an speculum reflecting telescope from the Grubb Telescope Company.

<text>Sir William Samuel Stephenson (born William Samuel Clouston Stanger, 23 January 1897 – 31 January 1989) was a Canadian soldier, fighter pilot, businessman and spymaster who served as the senior representative of the British Security Coordination (BSC) for the Western Allies during World War II. He is best known by his wartime intelligence code name, Intrepid. Many people consider him to be one of the real-life inspirations for James Bond. Ian Fleming himself once wrote, &quot;James Bond is a highly romanticised version of a true spy. The real thing is... William Stephenson.&quot;

As head of the BSC, Stephenson handed British scientific secrets over to Franklin D. Roosevelt and relayed American secrets back to Winston Churchill. In addition, Stephenson has been credited with changing American public opinion from an isolationist stance to a supportive tendency regarding the United States&#x27; entry into World War II.

==Early life==

Stephenson was born William Samuel Clouston Stanger on 23 January 1897, in Point Douglas, Winnipeg, Manitoba. His mother was Icelandic, and his father was Scottish from the Orkney Islands. He was adopted early by an Icelandic family after his parents could no longer care for him, and given his foster parents&#x27; name, &quot;Stephenson&quot;. Water Street in Winnipeg was renamed in his honour to William Stephenson Way.

He left school at a young age and worked as a telegrapher. In January 1916, during World War I, he volunteered for service in the 101st Overseas Battalion (Winnipeg Light Infantry), Canadian Expeditionary Force. He left for England on RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; on 29 June 1916, arriving on 6 July 1916. The 101st Battalion was broken up in England, and he was transferred to the 17th Reserve Battalion in East Sandling, Kent. On 17 July, he was transferred to the Canadian Engineer Training Depot. He was attached to the Sub Staff, Canadian Training Depot Headquarters, in Shorncliffe, and was promoted to Sergeant (with pay of Clerk) in May 1917. In June 1917 he was &quot;on command&quot; to the Cadet Wing of the Royal Flying Corps at Denham Barracks, Buckinghamshire.

On 15 August 1917, Stephenson was officially struck off the strength of the Canadian Expeditionary Force and granted a commission in the Royal Flying Corps. Posted to 73 Squadron on 9 February 1918, he flew the Sopwith Camel biplane fighter and scored 12 victories to become a flying ace before he was shot down and crashed his plane behind enemy lines on 28 July 1918. During the incident Stephenson was injured by fire from a German ace pilot, Justus Grassmann, by friendly fire (according to a French observer), or by both. In any event, he was subsequently captured by the Germans and held as a prisoner of war until allegedly escaping in October 1918. His Royal Air Force (RAF) Service file indicates that he was repatriated from the Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp on 9 December 1918.

By the end of World War I, Stephenson had achieved the rank of Captain and earned the Military Cross and the Distinguished Flying Cross. His medal citations perhaps foreshadow his later achievements, and read:

==Interwar period==

After World War I, Stephenson returned to Manitoba and with a friend, Wilf Russell, started a hardware business, inspired largely by a can opener that Stephenson had taken from his POW camp. The business was unsuccessful, and he left Canada for England. In England, Stephenson soon became wealthy, with business contacts in many countries. In 1924, he married American tobacco heiress Mary French Simmons, of Springfield, Tennessee. That same year, Stephenson and George W. Walton patented a system for transmitting photographic images via wireless that produced £100,000 a year in royalties for the 18-year run of the patent (about $12 million per annum adjusted for inflation in 2010). In addition to his patent royalties, Stephenson swiftly diversified into several lucrative industries: radio manufacturing (General Radio Company Limited); aircraft manufacturing (General Aircraft Limited); Pressed Steel Company that manufactured car bodies for the British motor industry; construction and cement, as well as Shepperton Studios and Earls Court. Stephenson had a broad base of industrial contacts in Europe, Britain and North America, as well as a large group of contacts in the international film industry. Shepperton Studios were the largest film studios in the world outside of Hollywood.

As early as April 1936, Stephenson was voluntarily providing confidential information to British MP Winston Churchill about how Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi government was building up its armed forces and hiding military expenditures of £800,000,000. This was a clear violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and showed the growing Nazi threat to European and international security. Churchill used Stephenson&#x27;s information in Parliament to warn against the appeasement policies of the government of Neville Chamberlain.

==World War II==

After World War II began (and over the objections of Sir Stewart Menzies, wartime head of British intelligence) now-Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent Stephenson to the United States on 21 June 1940, to covertly establish and run British Security Coordination (BSC) in New York City, over a year before U.S. entry into the war.

His deputy at BSC was the Australian-born MI6 intelligence officer Dick Ellis, who has been credited with writing the blueprint for William Donovan&#x27;s Coordinator of Information and the Office of Strategic Services. Ellis wrote an Historical Note for William Stevenson&#x27;s 1976 biography of Stephenson, &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;.

BSC was registered by the State Department as a foreign entity. It operated out of Room 3603 at Rockefeller Center and was officially known as the British Passport Control Office from which it had expanded. BSC acted as the administrative headquarters more than the operational one for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and was a channel for communications and liaison between US and British security and intelligence organisations.

Stephenson&#x27;s initial directives for BSC were to
#investigate enemy activities;
#institute security measures against sabotage to British property; and
#organize American public opinion in favour of aid to Britain.

Later this was expanded to include &quot;the assurance of American participation in secret activities throughout the world in the closest possible collaboration with the British&quot;. Stephenson&#x27;s official title was British Passport Control Officer. His unofficial mission was to create a secret British intelligence network throughout the western hemisphere, and to operate covertly and broadly on behalf of the British government and the Allies in aid of winning the war.

Stephenson was soon a close adviser to Roosevelt, and suggested that he put Stephenson&#x27;s good friend William J. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan in charge of all U.S. intelligence services. Donovan founded the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which in 1947 would become the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As senior representative of British intelligence in the western hemisphere, Stephenson was one of the few persons in the hemisphere who were authorized to view raw Ultra transcripts of German Enigma ciphers that had been decrypted at Britain&#x27;s Bletchley Park facility. He was trusted by Churchill to decide what Ultra information to pass along to various branches of the U.S. and Canadian governments. 

While it was still neutral, agreement was made for all trans-Atlantic mails from the U.S. to be routed through the British colony of Bermuda, 640 miles off the North Carolina coast. Airmails carried by both British and American aircraft were landed at RAF Darrell&#x27;s Island and delivered to 1,200 censors of &quot;British Imperial Censorship&quot;, part of BSC, working in the Princess Hotel. All mail, radio and telegraphic traffic bound for Europe, the U.S. and the Far East were intercepted and analyzed by 1,200 censors, of &quot;British Imperial Censorship&quot;, part of British Security Coordination (BSC), before being routed to their destination with no indication that they had been read. 
With BSC working closely with the FBI, the censors were responsible for the discovery and arrest of a number of Axis spies operating in the US, including the Joe K ring.

After the war, Stephenson lived at the Princess Hotel for a time before buying his own home in Bermuda.

Under Stephenson, BSC directly influenced U.S. media (including newspaper columns by Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson), and media in other hemisphere countries, toward pro-British and anti-Axis views. Once the U.S. had entered the war in December 1941, BSC went on to train U.S. propagandists from the United States Office of War Information in Canada. BSC covert intelligence and propaganda efforts directly affected wartime developments in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Mexico, the Central American countries, Bermuda, Cuba and Puerto Rico.

Stephenson worked without salary.

He hired hundreds of people, mostly Canadian women, to staff his organization and covered much of the expense out of his own pocket. His employees included secretive communications genius Benjamin deForest &quot;Pat&quot; Bayly and future advertising wizard David Ogilvy. Stephenson employed Amy Elizabeth Thorpe, codenamed CYNTHIA, to seduce Vichy French officials into giving up Enigma ciphers and secrets from their Washington embassy. At the height of the war Bayly, a University of Toronto professor from Moose Jaw, created the Rockex, the fast secure communications system that would eventually be relied on by all the Allies.

Not least of Stephenson&#x27;s contributions to the war effort was the setting up by BSC of Camp X, the unofficial name of the secret Special Training School No. 103, a Second World War paramilitary installation for training covert agents in the methods required for success in clandestine operations. Located in Whitby, Ontario, this was the first such training school in North America. Estimates vary, but between 500 and 2,000 British, Canadian and American covert operators were trained there from 1941 to 1945.

Reports indicate that Camp X graduates worked as &quot;secret agents, security personnel, intelligence officers, or psychological warfare experts, serving in clandestine operations. Many were captured, tortured, and executed; survivors received no individual recognition for their efforts.&quot; Camp X graduates operated in Europe (Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Balkans) as well as in Africa, Australia, India and the Pacific. They may have included Ian Fleming (though there is evidence to the contrary), future author of the James Bond books. It has been said that the fictional Goldfinger&#x27;s raid on Fort Knox was inspired by a Stephenson plan (never carried out) to steal $2,883,000,000 in Vichy French gold reserves from the French Caribbean colony of Martinique.

BSC purchased a ten-kilowatt transmitter from Philadelphia radio station WCAU and installed it at Camp X. By mid-1944, Hydra (as the Camp X transmitter was known) was transmitting 30,000 and receiving 9,000 message groups daily – much of the secret Allied intelligence traffic across the Atlantic.

==Honours==

For his extraordinary service to the war effort, he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in the 1945 New Year Honours. In recommending Stephenson for the knighthood, Winston Churchill wrote: &quot;This one is dear to my heart.&quot;

In November 1946 Stephenson received the Medal for Merit from President Harry S. Truman, at that time the highest U.S. civilian award. He was the first non-American to be so honoured. General &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan presented the medal. The citation paid tribute to Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;valuable assistance to America in the fields of intelligence and special operations&quot;. The first non-American was the Belgian Edgar Sengier on 9 April 1946

The &quot;Quiet Canadian&quot; was recognized by his native land late: he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada on 17 December 1979, and invested in the Order on 5 February 1980.

On 2 May 2000, CIA Executive Director David W. Carey, representing Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet and Deputy Director John A. Gordon, accepted from the Intrepid Society of Winnipeg, Manitoba, a bronze statuette of Stephenson. In his remarks, Carey said:

Sir William Stephenson played a key role in the creation of the CIA. He realized early on that America needed a strong intelligence organization and lobbied contacts close to President Roosevelt to appoint a U.S. &quot;coordinator&quot; to oversee FBI and military intelligence. He urged that the job be given to William J. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, who had recently toured British defences and gained the confidence of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Although Roosevelt didn&#x27;t establish exactly what Sir William had in mind, the organization created represented a revolutionary step in the history of American intelligence. Donovan&#x27;s Office of Strategic Services was the first &quot;central&quot; U.S. intelligence service. OSS worked closely with and learned from Sir William and other Canadian and British officials during the war. A little later, these OSS officers formed the core of the CIA. Intrepid may not have technically been the father of CIA, but he&#x27;s certainly in our lineage someplace.

On 8 August 2008, Stephenson was recognized for his work by Major General John M. Custer, Commandant of the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps. Custer inducted him as an honorary member of the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, an honour shared by only two other non-Americans.

==Legacy==
In 1997, a new public library built in Winnipeg was named for him, after a vote was held to choose the name of the new library. Leo Mol donated a miniature of his statue of Stephenson to the library.

On 24 July 1999, The Princess Royal unveiled, in Stephenson&#x27;s hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, near the Provincial Legislature on York Street, Leo Mol&#x27;s life-sized bronze statue of Stephenson in military aviator uniform. The monument is dedicated to Stephenson&#x27;s memory and achievements.

On 15 November 2009, Water Avenue in downtown Winnipeg was renamed William Stephenson Way.

Whitby, Ontario has a street named for Stephenson. It connects with streets named Intrepid and Overlord. The town is also home to Sir William Stephenson Public School, which opened in 2004.

In Oshawa, Ontario, Branch 637 of the Royal Canadian Legion is named for Stephenson. Intrepid Park, named after Stephenson&#x27;s wartime code name, is located in southern Oshawa near the original Camp X site. A historic plaque erected at the park reads as follows:

==Disputes==

In 1976 British-born Canadian author William Stevenson published a biography of Stephenson, &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;. Some of the book&#x27;s statements have been called into question; in a review the same year, Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote that &quot;This book ... is, from start to finish, utterly worthless,&quot; while other former intelligence personnel and historians criticized the book for inaccuracies. Nigel West&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Counterfeit Spies&quot; asserts that &quot;Intrepid&quot; was probably not Stephenson&#x27;s codename, but BSC&#x27;s telegraphic address in New York. Stevenson was a frequent visitor to Bermuda, where Stephenson had taken up residence during after the war. He was an ex-naval officer, having served in the Fleet Air Arm during the war with prominent Bermudian lawyer William Kempe (a founding partner of Appleby, Spurling &amp; Kempe), a prominent Bermudian law firm (another author and frequent visitor to Bermuda was ex-naval officer Ian Fleming).

Intelligence historian David A. T. Stafford asserts that a more reliable source on Stephenson&#x27;s career is H. Montgomery Hyde&#x27;s &quot;The Quiet Canadian,&quot; published in 1962, before Stevenson&#x27;s book. 
But generally acknowledged as the most accurate account of Stephenson&#x27;s life is Bill Macdonald&#x27;s &quot;The True Intrepid&quot; (1998), with a foreword by the late CIA staff historian Thomas Troy. The book clears up the spymaster&#x27;s fictitious background in Winnipeg and contains oral histories from his ex-agents. Macdonald&#x27;s book includes a chapter on the secretive communications genius Benjamin deForest &quot;Pat&quot; Bayly, who according to Stafford&#x27;s book Camp X – refused to speak with Stafford. Bayly is not mentioned in &quot;The Quiet Canadian&quot; or &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;.

# In &quot;Counterfeit Spies,&quot; Bermuda resident Rupert Allason (Nigel West) reports that no record exists of Stephenson having received the French &quot;Croix de guerre avec Palmes&quot; or the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. Stephenson was of course awarded Britain&#x27;s Military Cross and Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics in France. In September 2009 his medals and other effects were displayed in Manitoba&#x27;s legislative building, in Winnipeg.

# William Stevenson describes a dinner held at Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s house in May or June 1940 which Stephenson purportedly attended. Churchill&#x27;s private secretary Jock Colville casts doubt on Stevenson&#x27;s account, pointing out that the invitation that Churchill supposedly sent Stephenson was clearly a forgery. The highly punctilious Churchill would never have called Beaverbrook &quot;the beaver&quot;, and he would never have signed himself &quot;W.C.&quot; (the abbreviation for &quot;water closet).&quot; Moreover, Stevenson reports that Lord Trenchard chatted with Stephenson about his own fighter plane; however, in 1940 Trenchard was over 65 years old and was retired from the military. In author William Stevenson&#x27;s papers at the University of Regina there is a reference to the Beaverbrook dinner, noting that in later years Stephenson had cabled the author that he did not recall the exact date of the gathering. There is no mention of Stephenson having received an invitation from Churchill. In his foreword to Richard Dunlop&#x27;s &quot;Donovan&quot;, Stephenson writes that he received a telephoned invitation to the dinner.
# In his 1981 book &quot;The Churchillians,&quot; Jock Colville took issue with Stevenson&#x27;s description of Stephenson&#x27;s wartime relations with Churchill. Colville pointed out that Stephenson was not Churchill&#x27;s personal liaison with Roosevelt, that in fact (as is well known) the two leaders corresponded directly. Indeed, Colville contends that he never heard Churchill speak of Stephenson (which may say as much about Churchill&#x27;s relations with Colville, an Assistant Private Secretary, as it does about his relations with the spy Stephenson). Based on this and other questions, Colville expressed the hope that Stevenson&#x27;s book would not be &quot;used for the purpose of historical reference.&quot; Meanwhile, numerous other references to a Stephenson-Churchill connection can be found; for example, in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, 17 December 1952, and &quot;The Times&quot;, 21 October 1962. The relationship is also referenced in Hyde&#x27;s biography of Stephenson, &quot;The Quiet Canadian&quot; (1962). In addition, British–Soviet double agent Kim Philby, in his book &quot;My Silent War,&quot; refers to Stephenson as a friend of Churchill&#x27;s. Stephenson&#x27;s personal secretary and personal cipher clerks mention Stephenson-Churchill communications in &quot;The True Intrepid&quot; and in the documentary film &quot;Secret Secretaries&quot;. In CIA historian Thomas Troy&#x27;s book &quot;Wild Bill and Intrepid&quot;, there is a chapter on the relationship based on several direct interviews conducted by the author with Stephenson on Bermuda which discounts much of the criticism of West and Hugh Trevor-Roper.

==In popular culture==

In 1979 Stephenson was portrayed by David Niven in the miniseries &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;, based on William Stevenson&#x27;s bestseller, &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;.

<text>Norman Earl Steenrod (April 22, 1910October 14, 1971) was an American mathematician most widely known for his contributions to the field of algebraic topology.

==Life==
He was born in Dayton, Ohio, and educated at Miami University and University of Michigan (A.B. 1932). After receiving a master&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1934, he enrolled at Princeton University. He completed his Ph.D. under the direction of Solomon Lefschetz, with a thesis titled &quot;Universal homology groups&quot;.

Steenrod held positions at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1942, and the University of Michigan from 1942 to 1947. He moved to Princeton University in 1947, and remained on the Faculty there for the rest of his career. He was editor of the Annals of Mathematics and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He died in Princeton, survived by his wife, the former Carolyn Witter, and two children.

==Work==

Thanks to Lefschetz and others, the cup product structure of cohomology was understood by the early 1940s. Steenrod was able to define operations from one cohomology group to another (the so-called Steenrod squares) that generalized the cup product. The additional structure made cohomology a finer invariant. The Steenrod cohomology operations form a (non-commutative) algebra under composition, known as the Steenrod algebra.

His book &quot;The Topology of Fibre Bundles&quot; is a standard reference. In collaboration with Samuel Eilenberg, he was a founder of the axiomatic approach to homology theory. See Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms.

<text>Achomawi (also Achumawi, Ajumawi and Ahjumawi) are the northerly nine (out of eleven) bands of the Pit River tribe of Palaihnihan Native Americans who live in what is now northeastern California in the United States. These 5 autonomous bands (also called &quot;tribelets&quot;) of the Pit River Indians historically spoke slightly different dialects of one common language, and the other two bands spoke dialects of a related language, called Atsugewi. The name &quot;Achomawi&quot; means river people and properly applies to the band which historically inhabited the Fall River Valley and the Pit River from the south end of Big Valley Mountains, westerly to Pit River Falls. The nine bands of Achumawi lived on both sides of the Pit River from its origin at Goose Lake to Montgomery Creek, and the two bands of Atsugewi lived south of the Pit River on creeks tributary to it in the Hat Creek valley and Dixie Valley.

==Population==

Achomawi speaking territories reached from Big Bend to Goose Lake. This land was also home to the closely related Atsugewi peoples. Descendants of both cultures later were forcibly relocated onto the Pit River Reservation. Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the combined 1770 population of the Achomawi as 3,000 and the Atsugewi as 300. A more detailed analysis by Fred B. Kniffen arrived at the same figure. T. R. Garth estimated the Atsugewi population at a maximum of 900. Edward S. Curtis, a photographer and author in the 1920s, gave an estimate of there being 240 Atsugewi and 985 Achomawi in 1910. As of 2000, the Achomawi population is estimated at 1,500.

==Language==

The Achomawi language and the Atsugewi language are classified together as the Palaihnihan languages, and more broadly in a possible northern group of the proposed Hokan phylum with Yana, the Shastan languages, Chimariko, Karuk, Washo, and the Pomo languages.

==Historical culture==

===Lodging and villages===
Each of the nine tribes in the &quot;Achomawi&quot; language group had defined separate territories up and down the banks of the Pit River (which they called &quot;Achoma&quot;). Within their respective territories, each band had several villages, which were apparently composed of extended family members, and had about 20-60 inhabitants per village. The bands were organized by having one central village with smaller satellite villages. The lower Pit River bands existed in a more densely forested mountain zone, while the upper Pit River bands had a drier sage brush and juniper zone. Their housing, food sources, and seasonal movements therefore also varied. In the summer, the Achomawi band, and other upper Pit River bands usually lived in cone-shaped homes covered in tule-mat and spent time under shade or behind windbreaks of brush or mats. In the winter, larger houses were built. Partially underground, these winter homes had wooden frames which supported a covering made of a mix of bark, grass and tule.

===Family life===
In marriage, the bridegroom lived in the bride&#x27;s home briefly, hunting and working for the bride&#x27;s relatives. Eventually she would move with him to his family, in what is known as a patrilocal pattern. They have a patrilineal society, with inheritance and descent passed through the paternal line. The traditional chiefdom was handed down to the eldest son.

When children were born, the parents were put into seclusion and had food restrictions while waiting for their baby&#x27;s umbilical cord to fall off. If twins were born, one of them was killed at birth.

The Achomawi buried their dead in a flexed position, on the side, facing east; at times they were placed in woven baskets at burial. Those who died outside the community were cremated, and their ashes were brought back for burial among their people. The dead&#x27;s belongings and relatives&#x27; offerings were buried or burned with the body, and the dead&#x27;s house was born. There were no special ceremonies or rituals. When women became widows, they would crop their hair and rub pitch into the stubble and on her face. A widow would also wear a necklace with lumps of pitch around her neck. These items were worn for about three years. After a widow&#x27;s hair grew to reach her upper arm, she was permitted to marry her dead husband&#x27;s brother.

For leisure, women within the community would play a double ball game. The Achomawi also built and used sweat lodges.

===Dress and body art===
Achomawi men wore buckskin with coats and shirts. A deerskin with a hole cut out in the middle was put over the heads after the sides were sewn together to provide armholes, and then it would be belted. Buckskin leggings with fringe were rare but occasionally worn by Achomawi. Moccasins of twined tule and stuffed with grass were the most common type of footwear. Deerskin moccasins were worn during dry weather. An apron like kilt was also seen within communities, similar to the breechcloth of Eastern communities. Women wore short gowns or tops similar to the men, along with a deerskin skirt or a fringed apron. Buckskin moccasins and a basket cap were also standard among women. Both men and women&#x27;s clothing might be decorated with porcupine quill embroidery.
Both men and women did have tattoos. Women would have three lines tattooed under the mouth and perhaps a few lines on the cheek. Men had septum piercings with dentalium shell or other jewelry.

===Subsistence===
The Achomawi fished, hunted and gathered from around the area. Deer, wildfowl, bass, pike, trout, and catfish were caught. Wild plant foods, herbs, eggs, insects and larvae were also gathered. The only meat avoided by the Achomawi was the domestic dog and salt was used in extreme moderation, as the community believed that too much salt caused sore eyes.

====Fishing====
Fishing was a major source of food supply for the Achomawi. The Sacramento sucker was described as being of &quot;paramount importance&quot; to the Achomawi. Salmon was scarce for eastern groups, while those in the lower Pit River found it in abundance. The salmon was sun dried, lightly roasted or smoked, and then stored in large bark covered baskets in slabs or in crumbled pieces.

Fishermen used nets, baskets and spears to fish, and fish traps to catch the Sacramento sucker. Ten fish traps were found and are on display at the Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park. Made of stone, the traps consisted of a large outer wall that connects two points of land on the lake. The wall was built to the water level out of lava stones. A central opening in the wall, which measured between 20 and 50 centimeters, was supplied to allow the suckers to enter the traps. The opening pulls in the spring water outflow that is strong enough to carry in the suckers. To entrap the fish, a log, dip net or a canoe prow, and then they were speared. The stones are described as labyrinths due to the many interior channels and pools they form.

Aside from traps, other tools were made and used by the community for fishing blue rose is the first time to see, including fish hooks and spear points made of bone and horn. Achomawi fish hooks were made of deer bone, and fishing spears consisted of a long wooden shaft with a double-pointed bone head with a socket in which the base of the shaft was installed. A line was fastened to the spear point which was then held by the spearsman for control. Hemp was also used to make cords to make fishing nets and rawhide was used for fishing weirs. The Achomawi made five types of fishing nets, three of them were dip nets, one a gill net and the fifth a seine.

The three dip nets were shaped like bags. One type, called &quot;taláka&#x27;yi&quot;, was suspended on the prongs of a forked pole, and was used from a canoe, land, or from wading and was used for catching suckers, trout and pike. Another dip net, a &quot;tamichi&quot;, was used only for fishing suckers. The &quot;tamichi&quot; was four to five feet deep and wide when closed. The mesh at the lower edge of the bags opening are threaded along a stick which is then placed in the water to catch the fish. The fisherman would wade in the water while moving the net while women and children would wade pushing the fish towards the fisherman. When the fish enter the net, the fisherman releases the bag which then closes. The third bag, the &quot;lipake&quot;, was small with an oval hoop sewn into the opening. The fisherman would dive into the water and would hold the net in one hand while driving the suckers in with his free hand. Upon succeeding at capturing the fish, the fisherman would then flip the hoop over the net to close it for safe capture.

The other two nets were generally used for capturing trout and pike. The gill net, called &quot;tuwátifshi&quot;, was 40 to 60 feet long and was weighted with stones to sink it. One end was fasted to a tree and the other to a buoy; when a fish was captured the buoy would move. The seine, &quot;talámámchi&quot;, was six to feet in depth and extended across the stream from one side to the other in calm water. Stones were used to sink the lower edge, and buoys were used on the upper edge. The fisherman would sit in a canoe at one bank, and a pulley was attached to the opposite shore. When the net was tugged upon by the fish, the fisherman would haul in the float line with the pulley to remove the catch.

Minnows were also caught for drying. They were captured with a fish trap made of willow rods and pine root weft. Cylindrical in shape, the mouth of the trap had splints converging inwards, which would prevent the scape of the fish, were controlled by two weirs. A weir, called &quot;tatápi&quot;, was placed in shallow streams to capture trout, pike and suckers. A row of stakes were placed in the bottom of the stream and stones, logs, stumps and dirt was piled up against the stakes so that the water would be dammed and have to pour over the weir and into a trap on the other side. Another weir, the &quot;tafsifschi&quot;, was used in a larger stream to catch &quot;allis&quot; (steelhead trout) when they would return to sea in the fall. The &quot;tafsifschi&quot; consisted of two fence sections which extended from opposite river banks at a down-stream angle; almost meeting mid-river. They were connected by a short section of wall made by lashing horizontal poles close together across the gap. This was the lowest point in the created dam, and water would pour over carrying the fish into the basket on the other side of the gap. Salmon would be caught by spear, seine, or in nets that hung above water falls or dams.

====Hunting====
Due to the dry nature of the Achomawi&#x27;s land, deer was not always abundant, hence their unique way of hunting deer compared to other Californian Natives America. A deep pit would be dug along a deer trail, covered with brush, the trail restored including adding deer tracks using a hoof, and all dirt and human evidence taken away. The settlers&#x27; cattle would also fall in these pits, so much so that the settlers convinced the people to stop this practice. The pits were most numerous near the river because the deer came down to drink and so the river is named for these trapping pits. Deer hunting was always preceded by ritual. Rituals also existed that did not involve the hunting process but involved the avoidance of deer meat. Adolescent girls would stuff their nostrils with fragrant herbs to avoid smelling venison being cooked while going through their maturity ceremony.

Waterfowl, like ducks, were snared by a noose stretched across streams. Rabbits would be driven into nets.

====Gathering====
A variety of foodstuffs was gathered by the Achomawi people throughout the year. Acorns were a staple for Achomawi and other California native societies. Due to a scarcity of oak trees in the Achomawi territories these nuts were largely procured from neighboring cultures. Tule was utilized by the Achomawi in creating twine, mats and shoes; in addition to being a food source. Sprouts were gathered in early spring and then cooked or eaten raw. Fruit bearing trees were also a source of nutrition, including the Oregon grape, Oregon plum, Pacific yew, and Whiteleaf manzanita. Other plants harvested annually included camas, in addition to several species of seed bearing grasses, Indian potatoes and lilies. These bulbs and seeds were preserved and stored for use in the winter months in addition for occasional use in trade.

===Religion===
Adolescent boys sought guardian spirits called &quot;tinihowi&quot; and both genders experienced puberty ceremonies. A victory dance was also held in the community, which involved the toting of a head of the enemy with women participating in the celebration. Elder men would fast to increase the run of fish and women and children would eat out of sight of the river to encourage fish populations. Spiritual presences were identified with mountain peaks, certain springs, and other sacred places.

Achomawi shamans maintained the health of the community, serving as doctors. Shamans would focus on &quot;pains&quot; which were physical and spiritual. These pains were believed to have been put on people by other, hostile shamans. After curing the pain, the shaman would then swallow it. Both men and women held the role of shaman. A shaman was said to have a fetish called &quot;kaku&quot; by Kroeber or by Dixon. Kroeber relied upon Dixon&#x27;s work in this part of California. (The letter &quot;q&quot; was supposed to represent a velar spirant &quot;x&quot;, as in &quot;Bach&quot;, in the system generally used at that time for writing indigenous American languages. The &quot;Achumawi Dictionary&quot; does not have this word.) Dixon described the as a bundle of feathers which were believed to grow in rural places, rooted in the earth, and which, when secured, dripped of blood constantly. It was used as an oracle to locate pains in the body. Quartz crystal was also revered within the community and was obtained by diving into a waterfall. In the pool in the waterfall the diver would find a spirit (like a mermaid) who would lead the diver to a cave where the crystals grew. A giant moth cocoon, which symbolized the &quot;heart of the world&quot;, was another fetish, and harder to obtain.

====Puberty rites====
A girl would begin her puberty ritual by having her ears pierced by her father or another relative. She would then be picked up, dropped, and then hit with an old basket, before running away. During this part, her father would pray to the mountains for her. The girl would return in the evening with a load of wood, another symbol of women&#x27;s roles within the community, like the basket. She would then build a fire in front of her house and dance around it throughout the night, with relatives participating; around the fire or inside the house. Music would accompany the dance, made by a deer hoof rattle. During the ritual time, she would have herbs stuffed up her nose to avoid smelling venison being cooked. In the morning, she would be picked up and dropped again, and she would run off with the deer hoof rattle. This repeated for five days and nights. On the fifth night, she would return from her run to be sprinkled with fir leaves and bathed, completing the ritual.

Boys’ puberty rites were similar to the girls ritual but adds shamanistic elements. The boys ears are pierced, and then he is hit with a bowstring and runs away to fast and bathe in a lake or spring. While he is gone, his father prays for the mountains and the Deer Woman to watch over the boy. In the morning, he returns, lighting fires during his trip home and eats outside the home and then runs away again. He stays several nights away, lighting fires, piling up stones and drinking through a reed so that his teeth would not come into contact with water. If he sees an animal on the first night in the lake or spring or dream of an animal; that animal would become his personal protector. If the boy has a vision like this, he will become a shaman.

===War traditions and weaponry===
In general Achomawi held a significantly negative view of actual warfare, finding it be an undesirable outcome. Joining in a battle or killing an enemy was believed to give a particular contamination. Only through &quot;a rigorous program of purification&quot; could an individual remove it. Sinew-backed bows were their primary weapon. These bows had a noticeably flatter design than those used by the Yurok and other California tribes. Body armor would be made of hard elk or bear hide with a waistcoat of thin sticks wrapped together.

==Arts==

===Basket-making===

The Achomawi follow in the tradition of other California tribes, with their skills in basketry. Baskets are made of willow and are colored with vegetable dyes. Their basketry is twined, and compared to the work of the Hupa and Yurok are described as being softer, larger, and with designs that lack the focus on one horizontal band. The shapes are similar to those made by the Modoc and have slightly rounded bottoms and sides, wide openings and shallow depth. Baskets sizes and shapes depend on the intended use. Some baskets are created for women to wear as caps, some for cooking on hot stones, holding semi-liquid food or water. Willow rods are used for the warp and pine root is used for the weft. In the caps, only tule fiber is used. A burden basket was also made by the Achomawi, as was a mesh beater which would be used to harvest seeds into the burden baskets, made of willow or a mix of willow and pine root.

Most baskets are covered in a light white overlay of xerophyllum tenax, though it is believed that those covered in xerophyllum tenax are for trade and sale only, not for daily use. The xerophyllum tenax protects the baskets artwork and materials when used, helpful for when boiling or holding water. Anthropologist Alfred Kroeber believed that by 1925 the Achomawi were no longer cooking in baskets, and were merely making them for sale and trade.

===Canoes===
The Achomawi made simple dugout canoes of pine or cedar. Longer, thinner and less detailed than the Yurok redwood boats and Modoc canoes, the canoes were produced for transportation and hunting.

==History==

===Early history===
Relations with the nearby Atsugewi speakers were traditionally favorable for the majority of Achomawi. Yet the close proximity between the Illmawi band of Achomawi and the Atsugewi inhabitants of Hat Creek (haatiiw̓iw), the Atsuge (haatííw̓iwí - ″Hat Creek People″, own name: atuwanúúci), were terse. These bad feelings arose in part from particular Atsuge trespassing upon Illmawi territory while traveling through to collect obsidian from the nearby Glass Mountain (sáttít - ″flint place″, also name for Medicine Lake). 

In their networks with neighboring cultures Achomawi exchanged their furs, basketry, steatite, rabbit-skin blankets, food and acorn in return for goods such as epos root, clam beads, obsidian and other goods. Through these commercial dealings goods from the Wintun (iqpiimí - ″Wintun people″, númláákiname - Nomlaki (Central Wintu people)), Modoc and possibly the Paiute (aapʰúy - ″stranger″) were transported by the Achomawi. Eventually they would also trade for horses with the Modoc. The Achomawi used beads for money, specifically dentalia.

Contact between the Achomawi and Atsugewi speakers with the Klamath (ál ámmí - ″Klamath people″) and Modoc (lutw̓áámíʼ / lútʰám - ″Modoc people″) to the north largely wasn&#x27;t documented. Despite this Garth found it probable that there were extensive interactions between the cultures prior to the adoption of horses by the Northerners. Leslie Spier concluded that the Klamath and their Modoc relatives gained horses in the 1820s. Achomawi settlements became victim to slave raids by Modoc and Klamath horsemen. In particular the residents around Goose Lake, the Hewisedawi, were used by the Goose Lake Modoc (lámmááw̓i - ″Goose Lake Modoc″) &quot;as a source of supply of slaves (cah̓h̓úm - slave; lit. ″dog″- later also meaning ″horse″) who might be traded for other goods.&quot; Captured people would be sold into slavery at an intertribal slave market at The Dalles in present-day Oregon.

The Madesi band, Achomawi residents around modern Big Bend, had particularly cordial relationships with the Wintun. The nearby Shasta (sástayci / sastííci - ″Shasta people″) and Yana (tʰísayci - ″Yana people″) were &quot;powerful enemies&quot; that would on occasion attack Madesi settlements.

===European contact===
In 1828 fur trappers and traders visited Achomawi land. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1840s and the California gold rush when outsiders began to arrive in large numbers and taking land and disturbing the Achomawi lifeways. The Rogue River Wars in 1855-56 brought a strong U.S. military presence to the area, as well.

===Late 19th and 20th centuries===
In 1871 community members participated in the first Ghost Dance movement, and other future religious revitalization movements after moving to a reservation. In 1921, a smallpox epidemic took its toll on the Achomawi&#x27;s.

===Present day===
The majority of Achomawi people are enrolled in the federally recognized Pit River Tribe. The tribe consists of several autonomous bands - nine Achomawi and two (perhaps three) Atsugewi bands:

Upriver Achomawi (Eastern Achomawi)
* h̓ééwíssátééwi (“Highland People”), h̓ééwíssáy̓tuwí (“Goose Lake People”), usually &quot;Hewisedawi/Hay-wee-see-daw-wee/Hewise&quot; (″Those from On Top″, &quot;The People Who Live High Up&quot;): several Hewise villages were situated around the Goose Lake, their territory stretched from Fandango Valley south through the Warner Mountains to Cedar Pass; west across the Pit River and out onto the high plateau area called Devils Garden; north up to the west side of Goose Lake.

that since time immemorial have resided in the area known as the square, located in parts of Shasta, Siskiyou, Modoc, and Lassen counties in the state of California.

There is a Housing Authority that through Government grants has developed community housing projects, such as housing for low income families and elders. The Tribe operates a Day Care center, and environmental program. The Pit River Tribe currently operates Pit River Casino, a Class III gaming facility located on in Burney, California.

<doc id="589286" wikidata="Q723069" url="?curid=589286" title="Pi bond">
<text>In chemistry, pi bonds (π bonds) are covalent chemical bonds, in each of which two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap with two lobes of an orbital on another atom, and in which this overlap occurs laterally. Each of these atomic orbitals has an electron density of zero at a shared nodal plane that passes through the two bonded nuclei. This plane also is a nodal plane for the molecular orbital of the pi bond. Pi bonds can form in double and triple bonds but do not form in single bonds in most cases.

The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. One common form of this sort of bonding involves p orbitals themselves, though d orbitals also engage in pi bonding. This latter mode forms part of the basis for metal-metal multiple bonding.

== Properties ==
Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. The C-C double bond, composed of one sigma and one pi bond, has a bond energy less than twice that of a C-C single bond, indicating that the stability added by the pi bond is less than the stability of a sigma bond. From the perspective of quantum mechanics, this bond&#x27;s weakness is explained by significantly less overlap between the component p-orbitals due to their parallel orientation. This is contrasted by sigma bonds which form bonding orbitals directly between the nuclei of the bonding atoms, resulting in greater overlap and a strong sigma bond.

Pi bonds result from overlap of atomic orbitals that are in contact through two areas of overlap. Most orbital overlaps that do not include the s-orbital, or have different internuclear axes (for example px + py overlap, which does not apply to an s-orbital) are generally all pi bonds. Pi bonds are more diffuse bonds than the sigma bonds. Electrons in pi bonds are sometimes referred to as pi electrons. Molecular fragments joined by a pi bond cannot rotate about that bond without breaking the pi bond, because rotation involves destroying the parallel orientation of the constituent p orbitals.

For homonuclear diatomic molecules, bonding π molecular orbitals have only the one nodal plane passing through the bonded atoms, and no nodal planes between the bonded atoms. The corresponding &quot;anti&quot;bonding, or π* (&quot;pi-star&quot;) molecular orbital, is defined by the presence of an additional nodal plane between these two bonded atoms.

== Multiple bonds ==

A typical double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond; for example, the C=C double bond in ethylene (H2C=CH2). A typical triple bond, for example in acetylene (HC≡CH), consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds in two mutually perpendicular planes containing the bond axis. Two pi bonds are the maximum that can exist between a given pair of atoms. Quadruple bonds are extremely rare and can be formed only between transition metal atoms, and consist of one sigma bond, two pi bonds and one delta bond.

A pi bond is weaker than a sigma bond, but the combination of pi and sigma bond is stronger than either bond by itself. The enhanced strength of a multiple bond versus a single (sigma bond) is indicated in many ways, but most obviously by a contraction in bond lengths. For example, in organic chemistry, carbon–carbon bond lengths are about 154 pm in ethane, 134 pm in ethylene and 120 pm in acetylene. More bonds make the total bond length shorter and the bond becomes stronger.

==Special cases==
A pi bond can exist between two atoms that do not have a net sigma-bonding effect between them.

In certain metal complexes, pi interactions between a metal atom and alkyne and alkene pi antibonding orbitals form pi-bonds.

In some cases of multiple bonds between two atoms, there is no net sigma-bonding at all, only pi bonds. Examples include diiron hexacarbonyl (Fe2(CO)6), dicarbon (C2), and diborane(2) (B2H2). In these compounds the central bond consists only of pi bonding because of a sigma antibond accompanying the sigma bond itself. These compounds have been used as computational models for analysis of pi bonding itself, revealing that in order to achieve maximum orbital overlap the bond distances are much shorter than expected.

<doc id="589287" wikidata="Q1052535" url="?curid=589287" title="Cold War (1953–1962)">
<text>The Cold War (1953–1962) refers to the period in the Cold War between the end of the Korean War in 1953 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It was marked by tensions and efforts at détente between the US and Soviet Union.

After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, Nikita Khrushchev rose to power, initiating the policy of De-Stalinization which caused political unrest in the Eastern Bloc and Warsaw Pact nations. Khrushchev&#x27;s speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956 shocked domestic and international audiences, by denouncing Stalin’s personality cult and his regime&#x27;s excesses.

Dwight D. Eisenhower succeeded Harry S. Truman as US President in 1953, but US foreign policy remained focused on containing Soviet influence. John Foster Dulles, Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, advocated for a doctrine of massive retaliation and brinkmanship, whereby the US would threaten overwhelming nuclear force in response to Soviet aggression. This strategy aimed to avoid the high costs of conventional warfare by relying heavily on nuclear deterrence.

Despite temporary reductions in tensions, such as the Austrian State Treaty and the 1954 Geneva Conference ending the First Indochina War, both superpowers continued their arms race and extended their rivalry into space with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 by the Soviets. The Space Race and the nuclear arms buildup defined much of the competitive atmosphere during this period. The Cold War expanded to new regions, with the addition of African decolonization movements. The Congo Crisis in 1960 drew Cold War battle lines in Africa, as the Democratic Republic of the Congo became a Soviet ally, causing concern in the West. However, by the early 1960s, the Cold War reached its most dangerous point with the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, as the world stood on the brink of nuclear war.

==Eisenhower and Khrushchev==

When Harry S. Truman was succeeded in office by Dwight D. Eisenhower as the 34th U.S. President in 1953, the Democrats lost their two-decades-long control of the U.S. presidency. Under Eisenhower, however, the United States&#x27; Cold War policy remained essentially unchanged. Whilst a thorough rethinking of foreign policy was launched (known as &quot;Project Solarium&quot;), the majority of emerging ideas (such as a &quot;rollback of communism&quot; and the liberation of Eastern Europe) were quickly regarded as unworkable. An underlying focus on the containment of Soviet communism remained to inform the broad approach of U.S. foreign policy.

While the transition from the Truman to the Eisenhower presidencies was a mild transition in character (from moderate to conservative), the change in the Soviet Union was immense. With the death of Joseph Stalin (who led the Soviet Union from 1928 and through the Great Patriotic War) in 1953, Georgy Malenkov was named leader of the Soviet Union. This was short lived however, as Nikita Khrushchev soon undercut all of Malenkov&#x27;s authority as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and took control of the Soviet Union himself. Malenkov joined a failed coup against Khrushchev in 1957, after which he was sent to Kazakhstan.

During a subsequent period of collective leadership, Khrushchev gradually consolidated his hold on power. At a speech to the closed session of the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, February 25, 1956, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev shocked his listeners by denouncing Stalin&#x27;s personality cult and the many crimes that occurred under Stalin&#x27;s leadership. Although the contents of the speech were secret, it was leaked to outsiders, thus shocking both Soviet allies and Western observers. Khrushchev was later named premier of the Soviet Union in March 1958.

The effect of this speech on Soviet politics was immense. With it Khrushchev stripped his remaining Stalinist rivals of their legitimacy in a single stroke, dramatically boosting the First Party Secretary&#x27;s domestic power. Khrushchev followed by easing restrictions, freeing some dissidents and initiating economic policies that emphasized commercial goods rather than just coal and steel production.

==U.S. strategy: &quot;massive retaliation&quot; and &quot;brinksmanship&quot;==

===Conflicting objectives===
When Eisenhower entered office in 1953, he was committed to two possibly contradictory goals: maintaining—or even heightening—the national commitment to counter the spread of Soviet influence; and satisfying demands to balance the budget, lower taxes, and curb inflation. The most prominent of the doctrines to emerge from this goal was &quot;massive retaliation&quot;, which Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced early in 1954. Eschewing the costly, conventional ground forces of the Truman administration, and wielding the vast superiority of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence, Dulles defined this approach as &quot;brinksmanship&quot; in a January 16, 1956, interview with &quot;Life&quot;: pushing the Soviet Union to the brink of war in order to exact concessions.

Eisenhower inherited from the Truman administration a military budget of roughly US$42 billion, as well as a paper (NSC-141) drafted by Acheson, Harriman, and Lovett calling for an additional $7–9 billion in military spending. With Treasury Secretary George Humphrey leading the way, and reinforced by pressure from Senator Robert A. Taft and the cost-cutting mood of the Republican Congress, the target for the new fiscal year (to take effect on July 1, 1954) was reduced to $36 billion. While the Korean armistice was on the verge of producing significant savings in troop deployment and money, the State and Defense Departments were still in an atmosphere of rising expectations for budgetary increases. Humphrey wanted a balanced budget and a tax cut in February 1955, and had a savings target of $12 billion (obtaining half of this from cuts in military expenditures).
Although unwilling to cut deeply into defense, the President also wanted a balanced budget and smaller defense allocations. &quot;Unless we can put things in the hands of people who are starving to death we can never lick communism&quot;, he told his cabinet. With this in mind, Eisenhower continued funding for America&#x27;s innovative cultural diplomacy initiatives throughout Europe which included goodwill performances by the &quot;soldier-musician ambassadors&quot; of the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra. Moreover, Eisenhower feared that a bloated &quot;military–industrial complex&quot; (a term he popularized) &quot;would either drive U.S. to war—or into some form of dictatorial government&quot; and perhaps even force the U.S. to &quot;initiate war at the most propitious moment.&quot; On one occasion, the former commander of the greatest amphibious invasion force in history privately exclaimed, &quot;God help the nation when it has a President who doesn&#x27;t know as much about the military as I do.&quot;

In the meantime, however, attention was being diverted elsewhere in Asia. The continuing pressure from the &quot;China lobby&quot; or &quot;Asia firsters&quot;, who had insisted on active efforts to restore Chiang Kai-shek to power was still a strong domestic influence on foreign policy. In April 1953 Senator Robert A. Taft and other powerful Congressional Republicans suddenly called for the immediate replacement of the top chiefs of the Pentagon, particularly the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Omar Bradley. To the so-called &quot;China lobby&quot; and Taft, Bradley was seen as having leanings toward a Europe-first orientation, meaning that he would be a possible barrier to new departures in military policy that they favored. Another factor was the vitriolic accusations of McCarthyism, where large portions of the U.S. government allegedly contained covert communist agents or sympathizers. But after the mid-term elections in 1954–and censure by the Senate–the influence of Joseph McCarthy ebbed after his unpopular accusations against the Army.

===Eisenhower administration strategy===

The administration attempted to reconcile the conflicting pressures from the &quot;Asia firsters&quot; and pressures to cut federal spending while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively. On May 8, 1953, the President and his top advisors tackled this problem in &quot;Operation Solarium&quot;, named after the White House sunroom where the president conducted secret discussions. Although it was not traditional to ask military men to consider factors outside their professional discipline, the President instructed the group to strike a proper balance between his goals to cut government spending and an ideal military posture.

The group weighed three policy options for the next year&#x27;s military budget: the Truman-Acheson approach of containment and reliance on conventional forces; threatening to respond to limited Soviet &quot;aggression&quot; in one location with nuclear weapons; and serious &quot;liberation&quot; based on an economic response to the Soviet political-military-ideological challenge to Western hegemony: propaganda campaigns and psychological warfare. The third option was strongly rejected.
Eisenhower and the group (consisting of Allen Dulles, Walter Bedell Smith, C.D. Jackson, and Robert Cutler) instead opted for a combination of the first two, one that confirmed the validity of containment, but with reliance on the American air-nuclear deterrent. This was geared toward avoiding costly and unpopular ground wars, such as Korea.

The Eisenhower administration viewed atomic weapons as an integral part of U.S. defense, hoping that they would bolster the relative capabilities of the U.S. vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. The administration also reserved the prospects of using them, in effect, as a weapon of first resort, hoping to gain the initiative while reducing costs. By wielding the nation&#x27;s nuclear superiority, the new Eisenhower-Dulles approach was a cheaper form of containment geared toward offering Americans &quot;more bang for the buck&quot;.

Thus, the administration increased the number of nuclear warheads from 1,000 in 1953 to 18,000 by early 1961. Despite overwhelming U.S. superiority, one additional nuclear weapon was produced each day. The administration also exploited new technology. In 1955 the eight-engined B-52 Stratofortress bomber, the first true jet bomber designed to carry nuclear weapons, was developed.

In 1961, the U.S. deployed 15 Jupiter IRBMs (intermediate-range ballistic missiles) at İzmir, Turkey, aimed at the western USSR&#x27;s cities, including Moscow. Given its range, Moscow was only 16 minutes away. The U.S. could also launch -range Polaris SLBMs from submerged submarines.

In 1962, the United States had more than eight times as many bombs and missile warheads as the USSR: 27,297 to 3,332.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis the U.S. had 142 Atlas and 62 Titan I ICBMs, mostly in hardened underground silos.

===Fear of Soviet influence and nationalism===
Allen Dulles, along with most U.S. foreign policy-makers of the era, considered many Third World nationalists and &quot;revolutionaries&quot; as being essentially under the influence, if not control, of the Warsaw Pact. Ironically, in &quot;War, Peace, and Change&quot; (1939), he had called Mao Zedong an &quot;agrarian reformer&quot;, and during World War II he had deemed Mao&#x27;s followers &quot;the so called &#x27;Red Army faction. But he no longer recognized indigenous roots in the Chinese Communist Party by 1950. In &quot;War or Peace&quot;, an influential work denouncing the containment policies of the Truman administration, and espousing an active program of &quot;liberation&quot;, he writes:

Thus the 450,000,000 people in China have fallen under leadership that is violently anti-American, and takes its inspiration and guidance from Moscow... Soviet Communist leadership has won a victory in China which surpassed what Japan was seeking and we risked war to avert.

Behind the scenes, Dulles could explain his policies in terms of geopolitics. But publicly, he used the moral and religious reasons that he believed Americans preferred to hear, even though he was often criticized by observers at home and overseas for his strong language.

Two of the leading figures of the interwar and early Cold War period who viewed international relations from a &quot;realist&quot; perspective, diplomat George Kennan and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, were troubled by Dulles&#x27; moralism and the method by which he analyzed Soviet behavior. Kennan disagreed with the notion that the Soviets even had a world design after Stalin&#x27;s death, being far more concerned with maintaining control of their own bloc. However, the underlying assumptions of a monolithic world communism, directed from the Kremlin, of the Truman-Acheson containment after the drafting of NSC-68 were essentially compatible with those of the Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy. The conclusions of Paul Nitze&#x27;s National Security Council policy paper were as follows:

What is new, what makes the continuing crisis, is the polarization of power which inescapably confronts the slave society with the free... the Soviet Union, unlike previous aspirants to hegemony, is animated by a new fanatic faith, antithetical to our own, and seeks to impose its absolute authority... [in] the Soviet Union and second in the area now under [its] control... In the minds of the Soviet leaders, however, achievement of this design requires the dynamic extension of their authority... To that end Soviet efforts are now directed toward the domination of the Eurasian land mass.

==The end of the Korean War==
Prior to his election in 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower was already displeased with the manner that Harry S. Truman had handled the war in Korea. After the United States secured a resolution from the United Nations to engage in military defense on behalf of South Korea led by the president Syngman Rhee, who had been invaded by North Korea in an attempt to unify all of Korea under the communist North Korean regime led by the dictator Kim Il-sung. President Truman engaged U.S. land, air, and sea forces; United States involvement in the war quickly reversed the direction of military advancement into South Korea to military advancement into North Korea; to the point that North Korean forces were being forced against the border with China, which led to the involvement of hundreds of thousands of communist Chinese troops heavily assaulting U.S. and South Korean forces. Acting on a campaign pledge made during his United States presidential election campaign, Eisenhower visited Korea on December 2, 1952, to assess to the situation. Eisenhower&#x27;s investigation consisted of meeting with South Korean troops, commanders, and government officials, after his meetings Eisenhower concluded, &quot;we could not stand forever on a static front and continue to accept casualties without any visible results. Small attacks on small hills would not end this war&quot;. Eisenhower urged the South Korean President Syngman Rhee to compromise in order to speed up peace talks. This, coupled with the United States&#x27; threat of using nuclear weapons if the war did not end soon, led to the signing of an armistice on July 27, 1953. The armistice concluded the United States&#x27; initial Cold War concept of &quot;limited war&quot;. Prisoners of war were allowed to choose where they would stay, either the area that would become North Korea or the area to become South Korea, and a border was placed between the two territories in addition to an allotted demilitarized zone. The &quot;police action&quot; implemented by the Korean U.N. agreement prevented communism from spreading from North Korea to South Korea. United States involvement in the Korean War demonstrated its readiness to the world to rally to the aid of nations under invasion, particularly communistic invasion, and resulted in President Eisenhower&#x27;s empowered image as an effective leader against tyranny; this ultimately led to a strengthened position of the United States in Europe and guided the development of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The primary effect of these developments for the United States were the military buildup called for in response to Cold War concerns as seen in NSC 68.

==Origins of the Space Race==
The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union was an integral component of the Cold War. Contrary to the Nuclear arms race, it was a peaceful competition in which the two powers could demonstrate their technological and theoretical advancements over the other. The Soviet Union was the first nation to enter the space realm with their launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957. The satellite was merely an 83.6-kilogram aluminum alloy sphere, which was a major downsize from the original 1,000-kilogram design, that carried a radio and four antennas into space. This size was shocking to western scientists as America was designing a much smaller 8-kilogram satellite. This size discrepancy was apparent due to the gap in weapon technology as the United States was able to develop much smaller nuclear warheads than their Soviet counterparts. The Soviet Union later launched Sputnik 2 less than a month later. The Soviet&#x27;s satellite success caused a stir in America as people question why the United States had fallen behind the Soviet Union and if they could launch nuclear missiles at large American cities i.e. Chicago, Seattle, and Atlanta. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by creating the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). This committee was appointed to lead the United States in policy for scientific and defense strategies. Another United States response to the Soviets&#x27; successful satellite mission was a Navy led attempt to launch the first American satellite into space using its Vanguard TV3 missile. This effort resulted in complete failure however, with the missile exploding on the launch pad. These developments resulted in a media frenzy, a frustrated and perplexed American public, and a struggle between the United States Army and Navy for control of the efforts to launch an American satellite into space. To resolve this, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed his President&#x27;s Science Advisor, James Rhyne Killian, to consult with the PSAC to develop a solution.

===Creation of NASA===
In reaction to the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union, the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee advised President Dwight D. Eisenhower to convert National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics into a new organization that would be more progressive in the United States&#x27; efforts for space exploration and research. This organization was to be named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This agency would effectively shift the control of space research and travel from the military into the hands of NASA, which was to be a civilian-government administration. NASA was to be in charge of all non-military space activity, while another organization (DARPA) was to be responsible for space travel and technology intended for military use.

On April 2, 1958, Eisenhower presented legislation to Congress to implement the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency. Congress responded by supplementing the creation of NASA, with an additional committee to be called the National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC). The NASC would include the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the administrator of NASA. Legislation was passed by Congress, and then signed by President Eisenhower on July 29, 1958. NASA began operations on October 1, 1958.

===Kennedy&#x27;s space administration===
Since the conception of NASA, there had been considerations about the possibility of flying a man to the Moon. On July 5, 1961, the &quot;Research Steering Committee on Manned Spaceflight&quot;, led by George Low presented the concept of the Apollo program to the NASA &quot;Space Exploration Council&quot;. Although under the Dwight D. Eisenhower presidential administration NASA was given very little authority to further explore space travel, it was proposed that after the crewed Earth-orbiting missions, Project Mercury, that the government-civilian administration should make efforts to successfully complete a crewed lunar spaceflight mission. NASA administrator T. Keith Glennan explained that President Dwight D. Eisenhower, restricted any further space exploration beyond Project Mercury. After John F. Kennedy had been elected as president the previous November, policy for space exploration underwent a revolutionary change.&quot;This nation should commit itself to the achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth&quot; -John F. KennedyAfter President John F. Kennedy made this proposal to Congress on May 25, 1961, he remained true to this commitment to send a crewed lunar spaceflight in the ensuing 30 months prior to his assassination. Directly after his proposal, there was an 89% increase in government funding for NASA, followed by a 101% increase in funding the subsequent year. This marked the beginning of the United States&#x27; mission to the Moon.

===The Soviet Union in the Space Race===
In August 1957 the Soviet Union tested the world&#x27;s first successful Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the R7 Semyorka. Within only two months of the launch of the Semyorka, Sputnik 1 became the first human made object in Earth&#x27;s orbit. This was followed by the launch of Sputnik II which carried Laika the first living space traveler though she did not survive the trip. This led to the creation of the Vostok programme in 1960 and the first living creatures to survive the trip to space, Belka and Strelka the Soviet space dogs. The Vostok Program was responsible for placing the first human in space, yet another task that the Soviet Union would complete before the United States.

====The R7 ICBM====
Prior to the start of the space race, the Soviet Union and the United States were struggling to build and obtain a missile that could not only carry nuclear cargo, but could also travel effectively from one country to another. These missiles, also known as ICBMs or Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, were key for either country to gain a major strategical advantage in the early years of the Cold War. However, where the U.S. failed in their initial ICBM flight tests, the Soviets proved to be years ahead in ICBM technology with their R7 program. The R7 missile, first tested in October 1953, originally was designed to carry a nose cone plus nuclear cargo equal to 3 tons, maintain a flight range of 7000 to 8000 km, a launch weight of 170 tons, and a two-stage launch and flight system. However, during the initial testing, the R7 ICBM proved too small for the required cargo and major changes were approved and implemented in May 1954. These changes consisted of a heavier nose that could carry 3 tons of nuclear payload and a design change that would allow for a controlled take off and flight due to the new launch weight being 280 tons. This rocket proved effective in testing in May 1957 and was then slightly adjusted to support space flight.

====Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2====
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first Earth satellite into space. Sputnik 1&#x27;s official mission was to send back data from space, however the effects of this launch were monumental for both the USSR and the United States. For both countries, the launch of Sputnik 1 sparked the start of the Timeline of the Space Race. It created a curiosity for space flight and a relatively peaceful competition to the Moon. However the initial effects of Sputnik 1 for the United States was not a matter of exploration, but a matter of national security. What the USSR proved to the world, and mainly the United States, was that they were capable of launching a missile into space and potentially an ICBM carrying nuclear cargo at the United States. The fear of the unknown capability of Sputnik sparked fear in the Americans and many government officials went on record giving their thoughts on the matter. Senator Jackson of Seattle said the launch of Sputnik &quot;was a devastating blow&quot;, and that &quot;[President] Eisenhower should declare a week of shame and danger&quot;. For the Russians&#x27; the launch of Sputnik 1 proved to be a major advantage in the Cold War, because it secured their current leading position in the war, created a retaliation force in the event of a U.S. nuclear strike, and allowed for a competitive advantage in ICBM technology. 

Sputnik 2 launched almost a month later on November 3, 1957, with a mission goal of carrying the first dog, Laika, into Earth orbit. This mission, though unsuccessful in the sense that Laika did not survive the mission, further established the USSR&#x27;s position in the Cold War. Not only were the Soviets capable of launching a missile into space, but they could continue to complete successful space launches before the United States could complete one launch.

====Lunar missions====
The USSR launched three Lunar missions in 1959. The Lunar missions were the Russian equivalent to the United States Project Mercury and Project Gemini space programs, whose primary mission was to prepare to put the first human on the Moon. The first of the Lunar missions was Luna 1, which launched on January 2, 1959. Its successful mission established the first rocket engine restart within Earth orbit and the first man-made object to establish heliocentric orbit. Luna 2, which launched on September 14, 1959, established the first impact into another celestial body (the Moon). Finally, Luna 3 launched on October 7, 1959, and took the first pictures of the dark side of the Moon. After these three missions in 1959, the Soviets continued their exploration of the Moon and its environment in 21 other Luna missions.

====Soviet space travel from 1960–1962====
The Luna (&quot;Moon&quot;) program was a giant step forward for the Soviets in achieving the goal of putting the first man on the Moon. It also &quot;planted the building blocks&quot; of a program for the Soviets to &quot;sustain human beings safely and productively in low Earth orbit&quot; with the creation of the Soviet &quot;equivalent to the Apollo command module, the Soyuz space capsule&quot;.

Over this two-year period, the Soviets were taking major steps forward in getting to the Moon with one mission set back, Sputnik 4. This mission was launched officially as a test of life support systems for future cosmonauts on May 15, 1960. However, on May 19, &quot;an attempt to deorbit a space cabin failed&quot; and sent the cabin into high Earth orbit, only for it to crash into the Earth in September of the same year. The Soviets continued their space program, however by launching Sputnik 5 on August 19, 1960, which carried the first animals and plants to space and return them safely to Earth.

Other notable launches include:
* Vostok 1: Launched on April 12, 1961. Successfully carried the first human into space, Yuri Gagarin, and completed the first crewed orbital flight.
* Vostok 2: Launched August 6, 1961. Successfully carried the first crewed mission lasting one day carrying Gherman Titov.
* Vostok 3 and Vostok 4: Launched August 12, 1962. Vostok 3 carried Andriyan Nikolayev and Vostok 4 carried Pavel Popovich. Successfully completed the first dual crewed space flight, the first ship-to-ship radio contact and first simultaneous flight of crewed spacecraft.

===The race continues===
The Soviet Union continued to extend its lead in the space race with its mission on April 12, 1961, which made Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin the first human being to leave Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and enter space. The United States gained some ground a month later, on May 15, 1961, when they sent Alan Shepard on a fifteen-minute flight outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; project. On February 20, 1962, America made further progress as John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth in his Mercury mission &quot;Friendship 7&quot;.

==Soviet strategy==
In 1960 and 1961, Khrushchev tried to impose the concept of nuclear deterrence on the military. Nuclear deterrence holds that the reason for having nuclear weapons is to discourage their use by a potential enemy, with each side deterred from war because of the threat of its escalation into a nuclear conflict, Khrushchev believed, &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with capitalism would become permanent and allow the inherent superiority of socialism to emerge in economic and cultural competition with the West.

Khrushchev hoped that exclusive reliance on the nuclear firepower of the newly created Strategic Rocket Forces would remove the need for increased defense expenditures. He also sought to use nuclear deterrence to justify his massive troop cuts; his downgrading of the Ground Forces, traditionally the &quot;fighting arm&quot; of the Soviet armed forces; and his plans to replace bombers with missiles and the surface fleet with nuclear missile submarines. However, during the Cuban Missile Crisis the USSR had only four R-7 Semyorkas and a few R-16s intercontinental missiles deployed in vulnerable surface launchers. In 1962 the Soviet submarine fleet had only 8 submarines with short range missiles, which could be launched only from submarines that surfaced and lost their hidden submerged status.

Khrushchev&#x27;s attempt to introduce a nuclear &#x27;doctrine of deterrence&#x27; into Soviet military thought failed. Discussion of nuclear war in the first authoritative Soviet monograph on strategy since the 1920s, Marshal Vasilii Sokolovskii&#x27;s &quot;Military Strategy&quot; (published in 1962, 1963, and 1968) and in the 1968 edition of &quot;Marxism-Leninism on War and the Army&quot;, focused upon the use of nuclear weapons for fighting rather than for deterring a war. Should such a war break out, both sides would pursue the most decisive aims with the most forceful means and methods. Intercontinental ballistic missiles and aircraft would deliver massed nuclear strikes on the enemy&#x27;s military and civilian objectives. The war would assume an unprecedented geographical scope, but Soviet military writers argued that the use of nuclear weapons in the initial period of the war would decide the course and outcome of the war as a whole. Both in doctrine and in strategy, the nuclear weapon reigned supreme.

==Mutual assured destruction==

An important part of developing stability was based on the concept of Mutual assured destruction (MAD). While the Soviets acquired atomic weapons in 1949, it took years for them to reach parity with the United States. In the meantime, the Americans developed the hydrogen bomb, which the Soviets matched during the era of Khrushchev. New methods of delivery such as Submarine-launched ballistic missiles and Intercontinental ballistic missiles with MIRV warheads meant that both superpowers could easily devastate the other, even after attack by an enemy.

This fact often made leaders on both sides extremely reluctant to take risks, fearing that some small flare-up could ignite a war that would wipe out all of human civilization. Nonetheless, leaders of both nations pressed on with military and espionage plans to prevail over the other side. At the same time, different avenues were pursued to try to advance their causes; these began to encompass athletics (with the Olympics becoming a battleground between ideologies as well as athletes) and culture (with respective countries supporting pianists, chess players, and movie directors).

One of the most important forms of nonviolent competition was the space race. The Soviets jumped out to an early lead in 1957 with the launching of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, followed by the first crewed flight. The success of the Soviet space program was a great shock to the United States, which had believed itself to be ahead technologically. The ability to launch objects into orbit was especially ominous because it showed Soviet missiles could target anywhere on the planet.

Soon the Americans had a space program of their own but remained behind the Soviets until the mid-1960s. American President John F. Kennedy launched an unprecedented effort, promising that by the end of the 1960s Americans would land a man on the Moon, which they did, thus beating the Soviets to one of the more important objectives in the space race.

Another alternative to outright battle was the shadow war that was taking place in the world of espionage. There was a series of shocking spy scandals in the west, most notably that involving the Cambridge Five. The Soviets had several high-profile defections to the west, such as the Petrov Affair. Funding for the KGB, CIA, MI6 and smaller organizations such as the Stasi increased greatly as their agents and influence spread around the world.

In 1957 the CIA started the program of reconnaissance flights over the USSR using Lockheed U-2 spy planes. When such a plane was brought down over the Soviet Union on May 1, 1960 (1960 U-2 incident) at first the United States government denied the plane&#x27;s purpose and mission, but was forced to admit its role as a surveillance aircraft when the Soviet government revealed that it had captured the pilot, Gary Powers, alive and was in possession of its largely intact remains. Coming just over two weeks before a scheduled East-West Summit in Paris, the incident caused a collapse in the talks and a marked deterioration in relations.

==Eastern Bloc events==
As the Cold War became an accepted element of the international system, the battlegrounds of the earlier period began to stabilize. A &quot;de facto&quot; buffer zone between the two camps was set up in Central Europe. In the south, Yugoslavia became heavily allied with the other European communist states. Meanwhile, Austria had become neutral.

===1953 East Germany uprising===
Following large numbers of East Germans traveling west through the only &quot;loophole&quot; left in the Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions, the Berlin sector border, the East German government then raised &quot;norms&quot;—the amount each worker was required to produce—by 10%. This was an attempt to transform East Germany into a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Already disaffected East Germans, who could see the relative economic successes of West Germany within Berlin, became enraged, provoking large street demonstrations and strikes. Nearly a million Germans partook in the protests and riots that took place at this time. A major emergency was declared and the Soviet Army intervened.

===Creation of the Warsaw Pact===

In 1955, the Warsaw Pact was formed partly in response to NATO&#x27;s inclusion of West Germany and partly because the Soviets needed an excuse to retain Red Army units in potentially problematic Hungary. For 35 years, the Pact perpetuated the Stalinist concept of Soviet national security based on imperial expansion and control over satellite regimes in Eastern Europe. Through its institutional structures, the Pact also compensated in part for the absence of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personal leadership, which had manifested itself since his death in 1953. While Europe remained a central concern for both sides throughout the Cold War, by the end of the 1950s the situation was frozen. Alliance obligations and the concentration of forces in the region meant that any incident could potentially lead to an all-out war, and both sides thus worked to maintain the status quo. Both the Warsaw Pact and NATO maintained large militaries and modern weapons to possibly defeat the other military alliance.

===1956 Polish protests===
After the death of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the communist regime in Poland relaxed some of its policies. This led to a desire within the Polish public for more radical reforms of this kind, though the majority of Polish officials did not share this desire and were hesitant to reform. This caused impatience among industrial workers who began to strike; demanding better wages, lower work quotas, and cheaper food. 30,000 demonstrators carried banners demanding &quot;Bread and Freedom&quot;. Władysław Gomułka headed up the protests as the new leader of the Polish Communist party.

In Poland, demonstrations by workers demanding better conditions began on June 28, 1956, at Poznań&#x27;s Cegielski Factories and were met with violent repression after Soviet Officer Konstantin Rokossovsky ordered the military to suppress the uprising. A crowd of approximately 100,000 gathered in the city center near the UB secret police building. 400 tanks and 10,000 soldiers of the Polish Army under General Stanislav Poplavsky were ordered to suppress the demonstration and during the pacification fired at the protesting civilians. The death toll was placed between 57 and 78 people, including 13-year-old Romek Strzałkowski. There were also hundreds of people who sustained a variety of injuries.

===Hungarian Revolution of 1956===
After Stalinist dictator Mátyás Rákosi was replaced by Imre Nagy following Stalin&#x27;s death and Polish reformist Władysław Gomułka was able to enact some reformist requests, large numbers of protesting Hungarians compiled a list of Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956, including free secret-ballot elections, independent tribunals, and inquiries into Stalin and Rákosi Hungarian activities. Under the orders of Soviet defense minister Georgy Zhukov, Soviet tanks entered Budapest. Protester attacks at the Parliament forced the collapse of the government.

The new government that came to power during the revolution formally disbanded the Hungarian secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Politburo thereafter moved to crush the revolution with a large Soviet force invading Budapest and other regions of the country. Approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary, some 26,000 Hungarians were put on trial by the new Soviet-installed János Kádár government and, of those, 13,000 were imprisoned. Imre Nagy was executed, along with Pál Maléter and Miklós Gimes, after secret trials in June 1958. By January 1957, the Hungarian government had suppressed all public opposition. These Hungarian government&#x27;s violent oppressive actions alienated many Western Marxists, yet strengthened communist control in all the European communist states, cultivating the perception that communism was both irreversible and monolithic.

===1960 U-2 incident===
The United States sent pilot Francis Gary Powers in a U-2 spy plane on a mission over Russian airspace to accumulate intelligence on the Soviet Union on 1 May 1960. The spy plan had taken off from Peshawar, Pakistan. Eisenhower administration authorized multiple such flights into Russian airspace, however, this one increased the tension on American-Soviet relations. On this day, Powers&#x27; plane was shot down and recovered by the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower and the United States tried to claim the plane was only used for weather purposes. The incident occurred just weeks before the two countries were supposed to attend a summit along with France and Great Britain. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev would not release any information about the plane or its pilot in the days leading up to the summit so that the United States would continue its &quot;weather plane&quot; lie, though eventually Eisenhower would be forced to admit that the CIA had been conducting such surveillance missions for years. This was because, at the summit, Khrushchev admitted that the Soviets had captured the pilot alive and recovered undamaged sections of the spy plane. He demanded that President Eisenhower apologize at the summit. Eisenhower did agree to bring the intelligence gathering excursions to an end but would not apologize for the incident. Upon Eisenhower&#x27;s refusal to apologize, the summit came to an end as Khrushchev would no longer contribute to the discussion. One of Eisenhower&#x27;s primary goals as president was to improve the American-Soviet relationship, however, this exchange proved to damage such relations. The summit was also an opportunity for the two leaders to finalize a limited nuclear test ban treaty, but this was no longer a possibility after the United States handling of the incident. Khrushchev threatened to drop a nuclear bomb on Peshawar, thus warning Pakistan that it had become a target of Soviet nuclear forces.

===Berlin Crisis of 1961===


The crucial sticking point was still Germany after the Allies merged their occupation zones to form the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. In response Soviets declared their section, the German Democratic Republic, an independent nation. Neither side acknowledged the division, however, and on the surface both maintained a commitment to a united Germany under their respective governments.

Germany was an important issue because it was regarded as the power center of the continent, and both sides believed that it could be crucial to the world balance of power. While both might have preferred a united neutral Germany, the risks of it falling into the enemy&#x27;s camp for either side were too high, and thus the temporary post-war occupation zones became permanent borders.

In November 1958, Soviet first secretary Khrushchev issued an ultimatum giving the Western powers six months to agree to withdraw from Berlin and make it a free, demilitarized city. At the end of that period, Khrushchev declared, the Soviet Union would turn over to East Germany complete control of all lines of communication with West Berlin; the western powers then would have access to West Berlin only by permission of the East German government. The United States, Britain, and France replied to this ultimatum by firmly asserting their determination to remain in West Berlin and to maintain their legal right of free access to that city.

In 1959, the Soviet Union withdrew its deadline and instead met with the Western powers in a Big Four foreign ministers&#x27; conference. Although the three-month-long sessions failed to reach any important agreements, they did open the door to further negotiations and led to Soviet leader Khrushchev&#x27;s visit to the United States in September 1959. At the end of this visit, Khrushchev and President Eisenhower stated jointly that the most important issue in the world was general disarmament and that the problem of Berlin and &quot;all outstanding international questions should be settled, not by the application of force, but by peaceful means through negotiations.&quot;
However, in June 1961 Soviet first secretary Khrushchev created a new crisis over the status of West Berlin when he again threatened to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany, which he said, would end existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French access rights to West Berlin. The three powers replied that no unilateral treaty could abrogate their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin, including the right of unobstructed access to the city.

As the confrontation over Berlin escalated, on 25 July President Kennedy requested an increase in the Army&#x27;s total authorized strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million men, along with an increase of 29,000 and 63,000 men in the active duty strength of the Navy and the Air Force. Additionally, he ordered that draft calls be doubled, and asked Congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve units and individual reservists. He also requested new funds to identify and mark space in existing structures that could be used for fall-out shelters in case of attack, to stock those shelters with food, water, first-aid kits and other minimum essentials for survival, and to improve air-raid warning and fallout detection systems.

During the early months of 1961, the government actively sought a means of halting the emigration of its population to the West. By the early summer of 1961, East German President Walter Ulbricht apparently had persuaded the Soviets that an immediate solution was necessary and that the only way to stop the exodus was to use force. This presented a delicate problem for the Soviet Union because the four-power status of Berlin specified free travel between zones and specifically forbade the presence of German troops in Berlin.

During the spring and early summer, the East German regime procured and stockpiled building materials for the erection of the Berlin Wall. Although this extensive activity was widely known, few outside the small circle of Soviet and East German planners believed that East Germany would be sealed off.

On June 15, 1961, two months before the construction of the Berlin Wall started, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party and Staatsrat chairman Walter Ulbricht stated in an international press conference, &quot;&quot;Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!&quot; (No one has the intention to erect a wall)&quot;. It was the first time the colloquial term &quot;Mauer&quot; (wall) had been used in this context.

On Saturday, August 12, 1961, the leaders of East Germany attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in Döllnsee, in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin, and Walter Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a Wall.

At midnight the army, police, and units of the East German army began to close the border and by morning on Sunday, August 13, 1961, the border to West Berlin had been shut. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the barrier to make them impassable to most vehicles, and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the around the three western sectors and the which actually divided West and East Berlin. Approximately 32,000 combat and engineer troops were used in building the Wall. Once their efforts were completed, the Border Police assumed the functions of manning and improving the barrier. East German tanks and artillery were present to discourage interference by the West and presumably to assist in the event of large-scale riots.

On 30 August 1961, President John F. Kennedy ordered 148,000 Guardsmen and Reservists to active duty in response to East German moves to cut off allied access to Berlin. The Air Guard&#x27;s share of that mobilization was 21,067 individuals. ANG units mobilized in October included 18 tactical fighter squadrons, 4 tactical reconnaissance squadrons, 6 air transport squadrons, and a tactical control group. On 1 November; the Air Force mobilized three more ANG fighter interceptor squadrons. In late October and early November, eight of the tactical fighter units flew to Europe with their 216 aircraft in operation &quot;Stair Step&quot;, the largest jet deployment in the Air Guard&#x27;s history. Because of their short range, 60 Air Guard F-104 interceptors were airlifted to Europe in late November. The United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) lacked spare parts needed for the ANG&#x27;s aging F-84s and F-86s. Some units had been trained to deliver tactical nuclear weapons, not conventional bombs and bullets. They had to be retrained for conventional missions once they arrived on the continent. The majority of mobilized Air Guardsmen remained in the U.S.

The four powers governing Berlin (France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) had agreed at the 1945 Potsdam Conference that Allied personnel would not be stopped by East German police in any sector of Berlin. But on 22 October 1961, just two months after the construction of the Wall, the U.S. Chief of Mission in West Berlin, E. Allan Lightner, was stopped in his car (which had occupation forces license plates) while going to a theater in East Berlin. Army General Lucius D. Clay (retired), U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Special Advisor in West Berlin, decided to demonstrate American resolve.

The attempts of a U.S. diplomat to enter East Berlin were backed by U.S. troops. This led to the stand-off between US and Soviet tanks at Checkpoint Charlie on 27–28 October 1961. The stand-off was resolved only after direct talks between Ulbricht and Kennedy.

The Berlin Crisis saw US Army troops facing East German Army troops in a stand-off, until the East German government backed down. The crisis ended in the summer of 1962 and the personnel returned to the United States.

During the crisis KGB prepared an elaborate subversion and disinformation plan &quot;to create a situation in various areas of the world which would favor dispersion of attention and forces by the U.S. and their satellites, and would tie them down during the settlement of the question of a German peace treaty and West Berlin&quot;. On 1 August 1961 this plan was approved by CPSU Central Committee.

==Third World arena of conflict==
The Korean War marked a shift in the focal point of the Cold War, from postwar Europe to East Asia. After this point, in the wake of the disintegration of Europe&#x27;s colonial empires, proxy battles in the Third World became an important arena of superpower competition in the establishment of alliances and jockeying for influence in these emerging nations. Many Third World nations, however, did not want to align themselves with either of the superpowers. The Non-Aligned Movement, led by India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia, attempted to unite the third world against what was seen as imperialism by both the East and the West.

===Defense pacts===
The Eisenhower administration attempted to formalize its alliance system through a series of pacts. Its Southeast Asian allies were joined into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) while allies in Latin America were placed in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR). The ANZUS alliance was signed between the Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. None of these groupings was as successful as NATO had been in Europe.

John Foster Dulles, a rigid anti-communist, focused aggressively on Third World politics. He intensified efforts to &quot;integrate&quot; the entire non-communist Third World into a system of mutual defense pacts, traveling almost 500,000 miles in order to cement new alliances. Dulles initiated the Manila Conference in 1954, which resulted in the SEATO pact that united eight nations (either located in Southeast Asia or with interests there) in a neutral defense pact. This treaty was followed in 1955 by the Middle East Treaty Organization (METO), uniting the United Kingdom, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan in a defense organization. A Northeast Asia Treaty Organization (NEATO) comprising the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan was also considered.

===Decolonization===
The combined effects of two great European wars had weakened the political and economic domination of Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America, and the Middle East by European powers. This led to a series of waves of African and Asian decolonization following World War II; a world that had been dominated for over a century by Western imperialist colonial powers was transformed into a world of emerging African, Middle Eastern, and Asian nations. The sheer number of nation states increased drastically.

The Cold War started placing immense pressure on developing nations to align with one of the superpower factions. Both promised substantial financial, military, and diplomatic aid in exchange for an alliance, in which issues like corruption and human rights abuses were overlooked or ignored. When an allied government was threatened, the superpowers were often prepared and willing to intervene.

In such an international setting, the Soviet Union propagated a role as the leader of the &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; camp, currying favor in the Third World as being a more staunch opponent of colonialism than many independent nations in Africa and Asia. Khrushchev broadened Moscow&#x27;s policy by establishing new relations with India and other key non-aligned, non-communist states throughout the Third World. Many countries in the emerging Non-Aligned Movement developed a close relationship with Moscow.

Meanwhile, the Eisenhower administration adjusted U.S. policy to the effects of decolonization. This shifted the focus of 1947–1949 away from war-torn Europe. By the early 1950s, the NATO alliance had already integrated Western Europe into the system of mutual defense pacts, providing safeguards against subversion or neutrality in the bloc. The Marshall Plan had already rebuilt a functioning Western economic system, thwarting the electoral appeal of the radical left. When economic aid had ended the dollar shortage and stimulated private investment for postwar reconstruction, in turn sparing the U.S. from a crisis of over-production and maintaining demand for U.S. exports, the Eisenhower administration began to focus on other regions.

In an exercise of the new &quot;rollback&quot; policies, acting on the doctrines of Dulles, Eisenhower thwarted Soviet intervention, using the CIA to overthrow unfriendly governments. In the Arab world, the focus was pan-Arab nationalism. U.S. companies had already invested heavily in the region, which contained the world&#x27;s largest oil reserves. The U.S. was concerned about the stability and friendliness of governments in the region, upon which the health of the U.S. economy increasingly grew to depend.

==Africa==
Africa would be a major battleground during the Cold War. The U.S. viewed the decolonization movement in Africa as an opportunity to gain access to raw materials that had previously been monopolized by the imperialist powers in Europe. U.S. policymakers also recognized that the poverty and instability that had persisted in Africa because of the colonial empires would provide a breeding ground for communist ideologies, so the U.S. would respond by providing economic assistance to the newly developing nations in Africa. Though the United States championed itself as a beacon of freedom and democracy, it often supported repressive regimes within Africa, such as the apartheid system led by a minority white population in South Africa.
Communist governments also had, sometimes conflicting, policy objectives within Africa. The Soviet Union sought to respond to United States intervention within Africa by establishing alliances with newly born nations against Western imperialism. The Soviet Union saw the elimination of colonial capitalism from Africa, and the rest of the Third World, as necessary for the advancement of those nations and by extension the triumph of socialism over capitalism. Third World nationalists viewed the command-style economy of the Soviet Union as promising since it allowed that country to advance from an agrarian to an industrial economy. However, Soviet doctrine was not only challenged by the United States but by other communist powers. China also moved to support nationalist movements in Africa in order to challenge imperialism. Though the Soviet Union provided more substantial assistance, Maoist ideology became more alluring than Soviet ideology due to its emphasis on the rural population as opposed to Soviet doctrine which focused more on the urban proletariat. As such, Maoist ideology became popular within the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). Often the Soviet Union and China found themselves supporting opposing liberation movements in Africa. Such as with Zimbabwe, with the Soviet Union supporting the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) while China supported the ZANU&#x27;s breakaway movements.

Cuba would also play a major role in the nationalist movements within Africa. Cuba&#x27;s focus on Africa stemmed from the belief that it provided an arena for the struggle between socialism and capitalism. Another reason cited by the Cuban government for its support of African socialist movements was the shared link between Cuba and Africa due to the fact that one-third of Cubans were of significant African heritage. As such, Fidel Castro and other Cuban revolutionaries wanted to spread the ideas of the Cuban Revolution to African independence movements and government&#x27;s in newly independent African states. Cuba would provide significant support to socialists during the Cold War, such as to the MPLA in Angola, FRELIMO in Mozambique, and to dictators, including Sekou Touré of Guinea, and Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia.

=== Congo Crisis ===
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), previously known as Belgian Congo, achieved independence from Belgium in 1960, after which Western leaders were determined to keep the country, and its enormous quantities of mineral wealth, within the West&#x27;s sphere of influence. However, in May 1960, the elected government. led by Patrice Lumumba, envisioned an economic model that would benefit the citizens of the Congo as opposed to supporting western economic interests. As such western powers sought to replace Lumumba with a more pro-western leader.

On July 5, five days after independence, Congolese soldiers mutinied after being told by their Belgian officers that there would be no wage increases, promotions, or African officers in the post-colonial army. After which Lumumba dismissed the Belgians, and elevated Joseph Mobutu to army chief of staff. Later on July 11, Moïse Tshombe, who was closely associated with Belgian settlers and international mining interests seceded the mineral-rich Katanga province from the DRC Convinced that Belgium was attempting to recolonize the Congo, Lumumba appealed for intervention at the United Nations. However the U.N. and U.S. refused to provide support, and thus Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for aid. The United States government saw this as a threat and thus formulated plans to assassinate Lumumba.

On September 5, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of Lumumba and his cabinet over massacres by the armed forces during the invasion of South Kasai and for allowing Soviets military advisers into the country. Later on September 14, with CIA and Belgian army support, Mobutu staged a coup against Lumumba. Lumumba was captured and transferred to Katanga in January where he was executed by the secessionist forces there. Tshombe then replaced Lumumba as prime minister In July 1964. Despite Tshombe&#x27;s rule, the Congo would continue to be in crisis throughout the rest of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Though Communist nations would support rebel groups in the Congo, those groups would not succeed in taking power. The Congolese crisis had the effect of alienating from both the West and the East some in the third world who saw the East as weak and impotent, and the West as unethical and unscrupulous.

===East Africa===
The Mau Mau uprising who fought against the British colonists and white settlers in Kenya, which was dominated by the Kikuyu which spreads the entire region of British Kenya. Jomo Kenyatta was arrested in 1954 and was released later in 1961. In 1957, Dedan Kimathi, the leader of Mau Mau who calls for Kenya&#x27;s independence from British rule was hanged in the capital Nairobi which has laid down by the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) when the British lieutenant Idi Amin who would later become the dictator of Uganda, has served in the British Army in 1946 which has led Uganda&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom on 9 October 1962 with Milton Obote as Prime Minister.

===Suez Crisis===
The Middle East in the Cold War was an area of extreme importance and also great instability. The region lay directly south of the Soviet Union, which traditionally had great influence in Turkey and Iran. The area also had vast reserves of oil, not crucial for either superpower in the 1950s (who each held large oil reserves on their own) but essential for the rapidly rebuilding American allies in Europe and Japan. The original American plan for the Middle East was to form a defensive perimeter along the north of the region. Thus, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan signed the Baghdad Pact and joined METO.

The Eastern response was to seek influence in states such as Syria and Egypt. In accordance with this, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria made arms deals with Egypt, worth up to $225– 50 million in exchange for surplus cotton, giving Warsaw Pact members a strong presence in the region. Egypt, a former British protectorate, was one of the region&#x27;s most important prizes with a large population and political power throughout the region.

General Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s dealings with the Soviet Union and its allies antagonized the administrations of the West, including the Eisenhower administration in the U.S. In July 1956, the Eisenhower administration balked at funding the massive Aswan Dam project. In response, that same year, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and ejected British troops from Egypt.

Eisenhower persuaded the United Kingdom and France to retreat from a badly planned invasion with Israel that was launched to regain control of the canal from Egypt for fear of alienating other Arab states, and driving them into the arms of the Soviet Union. While the Americans were forced to operate covertly, so as not to embarrass their allies, the Eastern Bloc nations made loud threats against the &quot;imperialists&quot; and worked to portray themselves as the defenders of the Third World. Nasser was later lauded around the globe, but especially in the Arab world.

Thus, the Suez stalemate was a turning point heralding an ever-growing rift between the Atlantic Cold War allies, which were becoming far less of a united monolith than they were in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Italy, France, Spain, West Germany, Norway, Canada, and Britain developed a common market to be less dependent on the United States. Such rifts mirror changes in global economics. American economic competitiveness faltered in the face of the challenges of Japan and West Germany, which recovered rapidly from the wartime decimation of their respective industrial bases. The 20th-century successor to the UK as the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;, the United States found its competitive edge dulled in the international markets while at the same time it faced intensified foreign competition at home. Meanwhile, the Warsaw Pact countries were closely allied both militarily and economically.

==Latin America==

The Eisenhower-Dulles approach sought to overthrow unfriendly governments, but did so in a covert way. Throughout much of Latin America, reactionary oligarchies ruled through their alliances with the military elite and the United States. Although the nature of the U.S. role in the region was established many years before the Cold War, the Cold War gave U.S. interventionism a new ideological tinge. But by the mid-20th century, much of the region passed through a higher state of economic development, which bolstered the power and ranks of the lower classes. This left calls for social change and political inclusion more pronounced, thus posing a challenge to the strong U.S. influence over the region&#x27;s economies. By the 1960s, Marxists gained increasing influence throughout the regions, prompting fears in the United States that Latin American instability posed a threat to U.S. national security.

Future Latin American revolutionaries shifted to guerrilla tactics, particularly following the Cuban Revolution. Arbenz fell when his military had deserted him. Since then, some future Latin American social revolutionaries and Marxists, most notably Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua made the army and governments parts of a single unit and eventually set up single party states. Overthrowing such regimes would require a war, rather than a simple CIA operation, the landing of U.S. Marines, or a crude invasion scheme like the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

===Haiti===

After several coups d&#x27;état of Dumarsais Estimé and Paul Magloire which has led to the campaign of 1957 Haitian general election with the Haitian voodoo dictator Dr. François Duvalier (&quot;Papa Doc&quot;) wins a landslide victory with the highest black majority population on 22 September 1957, with the defeat of Louis Déjoie against the mulatto Haitians throughout the country. On 22 October, Duvalier was inaugurated and sworn in as the 34th President of Haiti. In 1958, after taking power as Haiti&#x27;s new leader, the July 1958 Haitian coup attempt led by Alix Pasquet who attempted to overthrow the dictator but failed as he was killed by a grenade at the barracks next to the palace. Once he established the Duvalier government, he created a new militia and the secret police that used from the Haitian Mythology as the Tonton Macoutes (known as the Volunteers for National Security, French: &quot;Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale&quot;) to secure the regime and making sure he is not overthrown like his predecessors, he continued to the use of ideology as Noirisme, with political and cultural movement at the end of the United States occupation of Haiti.

===Guatemala===

Throughout the Cold War years, the U.S. acted as a barrier to socialist revolutions and targeted populist and nationalist governments that were aided by the communists. The CIA overthrew other governments suspected of turning pro-communist, such as Guatemala in 1954 under Jacobo Arbenz Guzman. The CIA Operation PBSuccess eventually led to the 1954 coup that removed Arbnez from power. The operation drew on an initial plan first considered in 1951 to oust Arbenz named Operation PBFortune. Arbenz, who was supported by some local communists, was ousted shortly after he had redistributed of United Fruit Company land in Guatemala. United Fruit had long monopolized the transportation and communications region there, along with the main export commodities, and played a major role in Guatemalan politics. Arbenz was out shortly afterwards, and Guatemala came under control of a repressive military regime.

===Cuba===

====Consolidation of the Cuban Revolution====
The Castro Regime overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, who came to power in 1933 through a military revolution, and then again through another military coup. Batista&#x27;s first revolt was called the &quot;Revolt of the Sergeants&quot;. After the revolt Batista ran the government through a number of puppet rulers. However, after a series of failed puppet presidents Batista himself became president from 1940 to 1944. Batista&#x27;s first term as president went peacefully and saw large amounts of economic growth due to public works programs he implemented. After his term as president Batista moved to Florida where he lived until he decided to come back to Cuba and run for president in 1952. But, just three months before election day, a military coup put Batista back in power. He justified this coup by claiming the sitting president was planning his own coup in order to remain in power. The Batista dictatorship lasted seven years until 1959 when it was overthrown by Fidel Castro.

Fidel Castro was the first political leader to establish a communist state in the western hemisphere and held control of Cuba for over five decades. Castro&#x27;s political career started when he entered law school at the University of Havana. He then joined the Orthodox Party movement, but tried and failed to overthrow the dictator of the Dominican Republic Trujillo in 1947. In 1952 he ran for a seat in Cuba&#x27;s House of Representatives, but the election failed to happen due to the rise of the dictator. In 1953 Castro launched a coup in an attempt to overthrow Batista, but failed and was jailed soon after. While in jail he renamed his revolutionary group &quot;26th of July Movement&quot; and helped coordinate the group from prison. In 1955 was released from Cuban prison under an amnesty deal, after which fled to Mexico in order to rally support for his second attempt at overthrowing Batista and dictatorship. In December 1956, Castro, along with about 80 of his comrades, landed on Cuba. Though most of his forces were killed or captured for their attempt to overthrow the government during this time, Castro and what was left of his forces escaped into the mountains and began their guerrilla warfare campaign. Over the next two years Castro continued his guerrilla warfare while slowly growing his militant forces. In 1959 Castro&#x27;s forces had key victories at important Cuban strongholds that, combined with Barista&#x27;s loss of popularity and military power, led to Barista fleeing Cuba and Castro taking power.
Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba on February 16, 1959, at this point in time he had control of the Cuban government&#x27;s 30,000 man army. One of Castro&#x27;s first acts as leader of Cuba was to nationalize American assets on the island without compensation. Before the fall of the pro-U.S. Batista regime, U.S. interests had owned four-fifths of the stakes in the island&#x27;s utilities, nearly half of its sugar, and nearly all of its mining industries. The U.S. could manipulate the Cuban economy at a whim by tinkering with the island&#x27;s financial services or by tampering with government quotas and tariffs on sugar–the country&#x27;s staple export commodity. In response to these acts, the U.S. government refused to recognize Castro as the leader of Cuba, the U.S. government made the first of several attempts of overthrow Castro by launching the infamous Bay of Pigs Invasion.

Castro then signed a trade agreement in February 1960 with communist states, which would emerge as a market for the island&#x27;s agricultural commodities (and a new source for machinery, heavy industrial equipment, and technicians) that could replace the country&#x27;s traditional patron–the United States. The East garnered a huge victory when they formed an alliance with Cuba after Fidel Castro&#x27;s successful revolution in 1959. This was a major victory for the Soviet Union, which had garnered an ally in close proximity to the American coast. Overthrowing the new regime became a focus for the CIA.

====Plans against Castro====
After Fidel Castro&#x27;s takeover of Cuba, the United States was unsure about the nation&#x27;s new leader&#x27;s political ideologies. Potential economic cooperation between Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in 1959, leaders of the Soviet Union and Cuba, respectively, resulted in the immediate perturbation of the United States. The largest concern at this time was a Soviet satellite just 90 miles from the United States&#x27; mainland. The administration then began planning to intervene in this situation. The CIA initially proposed sabotaging the sugar refineries in Cuba, but President Eisenhower felt the threat was Castro and that he was the issue the United States needed to resolve. The CIA then began planning for an overthrow or possible assassination of Castro in December 1959. In February 1960, President Eisenhower requested the CIA develop a formal program to remove Castro from power. The request resulted in a plan for a task force led by Deputy Director for Plans Richard Bissell. The initial stage of this task force was to develop and train a group of Cuban exiles to form a paramilitary group. This group would then deploy to Cuba to organize, train, and lead resistance forces to overthrow the government. With no other plausible alternative, Eisenhower approved the Bissell task force which is also known as Brigade 2506. The force was later transitioned from its original guerrilla infiltration model to a more paramilitary invasion concept due to the difficulty in coordinating with anti-Castro opposition. In Eisenhower&#x27;s remaining months in office, he pushed the CIA to accelerate its plans for Brigade 2506. Eisenhower did not want the transition of presidency to halt any development. The plans began to finalize in the time between Kennedy&#x27;s election in November and his inauguration in January. Bissell hoped to train men in Guatemala to be Brigade 2506 and the 5412 Committee endorsed this along with the use of an airstrip in Nicaragua, and supply missions from the United States. President Kennedy was faced with the decision of whether or not to follow through with this plan when he ordered a meeting with many department heads in the United States government. Kennedy ultimately decided to fully fund and accelerate the program making the operation and its results his own responsibility.

====Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis====

Hoping to copy the success of Guatemala and Iran in 1961, the CIA, noting the large wave of emigration to the U.S. after Castro took power, trained and armed a group of Cuban exiles who landed at the Bay of Pigs where they were to attempt to spark an uprising against the Castro regime. The assault failed miserably, however. Afterwards, Castro publicly declared himself a Marxist-Leninst and set up Cuba as the first Communist state in the Americas and continued to nationalize virtually all major industries in the country.

The Soviet government seized on the abortive invasion as a rationale for the placing of Soviet troops in Cuba. It was also decided to position on Cuba medium-range nuclear missiles which could strike many points in the U.S. at once.

In response, President John F. Kennedy quarantined the island, and after several intense days the Soviets decided to retreat in return for promises from the U.S. not to invade Cuba and to pull missiles out of Turkey. After this brush with nuclear war, the two leaders banned nuclear tests in the air and underwater after 1962. The Soviets also began a huge military buildup. The retreat undermined Khrushchev, who was ousted soon afterwards and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev.

The Cuban Revolution led to Kennedy&#x27;s initiation of the &quot;Alliance for Progress&quot; program. The program was to provide billions of dollars of loans and aid over the course of the 1960s for economic development in order to stave off socialist revolution. The Alliance also contained counterinsurgency measures, such as the establishment of the Jungle Warfare School in the Panama Canal Zone and the training of police forces.

===Mossadegh and the CIA in Iran===
The United States reacted with alarm as it watched developments in Iran, which had been in a state of instability since 1951.

Through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), the British had a monopoly on the transporting, pumping, and refining of oil in most of Iran. The company paid production royalties to the government of the Shah— placed on the throne by the British in 1941. But the royalties and salaries to Iranian employees were smaller, considering that the company&#x27;s earnings were ten times greater than its expenses. Iran suffered from poverty, and nationalists insisted that controlling the company could alleviate this.

Many Iranians demanded that a higher share of the company&#x27;s earnings be paid. In response, the AIOC replied that it had a binding agreement with the Shah until 1993, and collaborated with some Iranian political forces to draft a report opposing nationalization. In February 1951, the Iranian prime minister, suspected of being involved with the report, was assassinated. He was replaced by nationalist Mohammad Mosaddegh. Later that year the new prime minister nationalized his nation&#x27;s British-owned oil wells.

As the Iranians moved toward seizing the reserves, the Truman administration attempted to mediate. Later, the Eisenhower administration, convinced that Iran was developing communist ties, used the CIA, joining forces with Iran&#x27;s military leaders to overthrow Iran&#x27;s government. Mossadegh drew on the Tudeh, the Communist Party of Iran, for much of his support. However, by 1953 the party had begun to criticize him as a U.S. puppet state. Since the Tudeh was the strongest Communist party in the Middle East, the Eisenhower administration cited a potential communist takeover in the Middle East to justify intervention. Mossadeq invoked the communist threat to gain American concessions. The premier perceived that as Iran&#x27;s economy suffered and fears of communist takeover gripped the U.S. government, the U.S. would abandon Britain and rescue him from his predicament.

To replace Mossadegh, the U.S. favored the young Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In return, Pahlavi promised to allow U.S. companies to share in the development of his nation&#x27;s reserves. According to CIA documents made public in 2000, the U.S. provided guns, trucks, armored cars, and radio communications in the CIA-assisted 1953 coup, which elevated Pahlavi from his position as that of a constitutional monarch to that of an absolute ruler. With Mossadeq out of the way, oil profits were then divided between the Shah&#x27;s regime and a new international consortium. The British were awarded 40% of the country&#x27;s oil revenues, five U.S. firms (Gulf, SOCONY-Vacuum, Standard Oil of California, Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Texaco) won another 40%, and the rest went to Royal Dutch Shell and Compagnie Française des Pétroles. The profits were divided evenly between the consortium and Iran.

Since the turn of the 20th century the United States had been trying to get into the Iranian oil fields only to encounter British competition. The breakthrough for the U.S. was made possible by the Cold War-era ties to the Shah and under the guidance of the State Department official Herbert Hoover, Jr., who had gained a great deal of experience in the complexities of the international oil problem as a private businessman.

===Indochina===

The Battle of Dien Bien Phu (French: Bataille de Diên Biên Phu; Vietnamese: Chiến dịch Điện Biên Phủ) was the climactic battle of the First Indochina War between French Union forces of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, and Vietnamese Viet Minh communist revolutionary forces led by Ho Chi Minh. The battle occurred between March and May 1954, and culminated in a massive French defeat that effectively ended the war.

Cambodia and Laos both achieved independence from France which led to the founding of the Workers&#x27; Party of Kampuchea (later becoming Kampuchean People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party) and Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. As a result of blunders in the French decision-making process, the French undertook to create an air-supplied base at Dien Bien Phu, deep in the hills of Vietnam. Its purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring French protectorate of Laos and Cambodia, at the same time drawing the Viet Minh into a battle that would cripple them. Instead, the Viet Minh, under General Võ Nguyên Giáp, surrounded and besieged the French, who were unaware of the Viet Minh&#x27;s possession of heavy artillery (including anti-aircraft guns) and their ability to move such weapons to the mountain crests overlooking the French encampment. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Dien Bien Phu, and were able to fire down accurately onto French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, although as the French positions were overrun and the anti-aircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached them. After a two-month siege, the garrison was overrun and most French surrendered. Despite the loss of most of their best soldiers, the Viet Minh marshaled their remaining forces and pursued those French who did flee into the wilderness, routing them and ending the battle.

Shortly after the battle, the war ended with the 1954 Geneva accords, under which France agreed to withdraw from its former Indochinese colonies including Cambodia led by Pol Pot (Saloth Sar) and Laos by Souphanouvong. The accords partitioned the country in two; fighting later resumed, in 1959, among rival Vietnamese forces as the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War).

The U.S. intervention with the greatest ramifications was in Indochina. Between 1954 and 1961, the administration dispatched economic aid and 695 military advisers to the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), which was battling the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrillas. The NLF drew its ranks from the southern peasantry and was backed by North Vietnam, which in turn was backed by the Soviet Union and China. The RVN was later absorbed by its communist counterpart to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Today, Vietnam is one of the world&#x27;s four remaining communist states (along with China, Cuba, and Laos).

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia in February 1958 rebels on Sumatra and Sulawesi declared the PRRI-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the government of Sukarno. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received money, weapons, and manpower from the CIA. This support ended when Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. In April 1958, the central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions on Padang and Manado, the rebel capitals. By the end of 1958, the rebels had been militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerrilla bands surrendered in August 1961.

===South Asia===
There were some strategic reasons to be involved in South Asia. The Americans hoped that the Pakistani armed forces could be used to block any Soviet thrust into the crucial Middle East. It was also felt that as a large and high-profile nation, India would be a notable prize if it fell into either camp. India, a fledgling democracy, was never particularly in any grave danger of falling to insurgents or external pressure from a great power. It also did not wish to ally with the United States.

A key event in the South Asian arena of Cold War competition was the signing of the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Pakistan and the United States in 1954. This pact would limit the later options of all the major powers in the region. The U.S. committed to remaining closely tied to Pakistan. For Pakistan, the U.S. alliance became a central tenet of its foreign policy, and despite numerous disappointments with it, it was always seen as far too valuable a connection to abandon. After the Sino-Soviet Split, Pakistan also pursued close relations with China.

Soviet policy towards South Asia had closely paralleled that of the United States. At first the Soviets, like the Americans, had been largely uninterested in the region and maintained a neutral position in the Indo-Pakistani disputes. With the signing of the accords between Pakistan and the United States in 1954, along with the countries enlisting in METO and SEATO, the situation changed. In 1955, Khrushchev and Bulganin toured India and promised large quantities of financial aid and assistance in building industrial infrastructure. In Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, the Soviet leaders announced that the Soviet Union would abandon its neutralist position and back India in the ongoing Kashmir dispute.

Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was skeptical, however, and for many of the same reasons that he had wished to avoid entanglements with the United States he also wished to keep India from being too closely attached to the Soviet Union. Although the USSR sent India some aid, and although Nehru became the first non-communist leader to address the people of the Soviet Union, the two nations remained relatively distant. After Khrushchev&#x27;s ousting, the Soviets reverted to a neutralist position and moderated the aftermath of the 1965 war. Peace negotiations were held in the Central Asian city of Tashkent.

By the late 1960s, Indian development efforts had again stalled. A large current accounts deficit had developed and a severe drought hit the agricultural sector hard. As with the downturn of a decade earlier, India again looked to outside assistance. However, relations were at a low ebb with the United States, which was largely preoccupied with Vietnam. On top of that, several smaller issues had turned American indifference into antipathy. Western international organizations such as the World Bank were also unwilling to commit money to India&#x27;s development projects without Indian trade concessions.

Along with other Warsaw Pact nations, the Soviets began to provide extensive support for India&#x27;s efforts to create an industrial base. In 1969, the two powers negotiated a treaty of friendship that would make non-alignment little more than a pretext. Two years later, when faced with a growing crisis in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), India signed the agreement. 

===Sino-Soviet split===
Before the Sino-Soviet split, tensions between China and India complicated the Soviet Union&#x27;s efforts to maintain close relations with both of Asia&#x27;s leading emerging nations. In March 1959, China suppressed a revolt in Tibet, leading to open conflict between China and India. On March 31, the Dalai Lama, Tibet&#x27;s spiritual and temporal ruler, fled to India, where he was granted asylum over China&#x27;s protest. India later backed a move in the United Nations general assembly to enter into a full debate on charges of Chinese suppression of human rights in Tibet over the objections of the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, and Mongolia. However, despite the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s, Mongolia&#x27;s, and North Korea&#x27;s objections to the Indian-backed debate in the UN, Mao grew increasingly frustrated with the Soviet Union&#x27;s rather muted and reluctant backing of Chinese actions in Tibet. Director of Central Intelligence at the time Allen W. Dulles believed that India and Pakistan could best combat communist China politically and economically, but noted that the ruthless suppression of the Tibetan Revolt was likely to cause each country to focus resources on protecting their Himalayan borders militarily. This would likely escalate the contest, and not in favor of India.

China&#x27;s active presence in Tibet preceded a much more dangerous confrontation between India and China. Successive Chinese governments had rejected the Sino-Indian border dictated by the British Empire in the early 20th century, called the McMahon Line. As China built outposts along what China thought to be its borders, India built more outposts in the disputed area to drive out the Chinese, in what would be known as the Forward Policy. Charges and counter-charges of border violation and aggression were exchanged along the frontier. On September 9, a few days before his departure for the U.S., Janos Kadar of Hungary attempted to mediate the disputes between China and India, hoping to appeal to his friendly relations with both parties. Khrushchev and Alexander Dubček of Czechoslovakia also appealed to China and India. However, China&#x27;s reaction to the Soviet, Hungarian, and Czechoslovakian appeal for &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with the West and India was not seen as encouraging; and the fallout of the tensions along the Himalayas caused worldwide speculation over the Warsaw Pact-Chinese alliance, which was based on common ideological, political, and military interests.

By the time the Sino-Indian border dispute developed into full-fledged fighting in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the alliance between the world&#x27;s two leading communist powers was irreparably shattered. Although the Warsaw Pact nations backed China&#x27;s October 1962 peace offer, urging Nehru to accept it, Albania&#x27;s and Romania&#x27;s offer to deliver MiG fighter planes to India sent Sino-Albanian and Sino-Romanian relations into crisis. This also turned China against other Eastern European communist states. By the end of 1963, the Eastern Bloc and China were engaging in open polemics against each other, initiating a period of open hostility between the former allies that lasted for the remainder of the Cold War era.

==Culture and media==
In the ensuing years of World War II in the United States, media and culture portrayed a general sense of anxiety and fear of the spread of the Soviet Union&#x27;s communism in American entertainment, political, social, and scientific sectors. As tensions between the two nations increased over the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, public hysteria over communism subverting American daily life was coined the &quot;Red Scare&quot;, but more specifically the Second red scare with respect to the 1950s. Media coverage of the Cold War served as a catalyst for acknowledging ideological differences between the two nations. Written and illustrative forms of communication were the main source of information before the 1960s in the United States; political expressions in American newspaper cartoons, fliers, and movie posters with &quot;easily de-codable [text]&quot; and &quot;emotive images&quot; largely served as a casting mold for solidifying American ideals against its Soviet counterpart. Indeed, both US and USSR media succeeded in producing rhetoric and imagery that bolstered the motives of their respective states while establishing a sense of jingoism in their people; which is effectively known as propaganda. The polarization of the Cold War era and the dread resulting from a Nuclear arms race between the US and USSR, in addition to a politicized system of media distribution, led to the escalated height of sentiments which included statements like &quot;Better Dead Than Red&quot; in American media and culture. As early as 1947 in the United States entertainment sector, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began holding hearings regarding the political orientation of American entertainment professionals, starting with the famous Hollywood Ten trial that resulted in the conviction of 10 Hollywood directors and writers being charged with contempt of Congress, and eventually leading to the broader Hollywood blacklist; with the peak of the committee&#x27;s actions occurring between 1953 and 1956. In the midst of all this included the McCarthy trials. Targets of HUAC&#x27;s entertainment industry blacklist included directors, actors, screenwriters, musicians, and other prominent entertainment professionals, which were ultimately blacklisted from their careers for having been alleged communist members or having communist sympathies. Soviet communistic ideals being propagated into American life was used as justification for the tactics employed by the highly publicized HUAC and McCarthy trials. During this period in America, television stations and motion picture corporations were considerably influential on the minds of the public as associations between federal and private corporations became more intimately associated; a deliberate measure to promote positive consensus for military and intelligence efforts against the Soviet Union in a time of war.

After the downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the McCarthy trials, which was due to his demagogic style and unsubstantiated accusations, the House Un-American Activities Committee shortly after began its descent into ruin by the mid-late 1950s and early 1960s, and later was officially dismantled in 1975. Just prior to the beginning of the 1960s, Harry S. Truman proclaimed that the committee was the &quot;most un-American thing in the country today&quot;. Prior to these events, there had never been such a socially and politically significant issue publicized to the American populace within culture and media regarding domestic threats to United States democracy during the 20th century.

During this great period, Cold War themes first entered mainstream culture as a public preoccupation. The 1959 film &quot;On the Beach&quot;, for example, depicted a gradually dying, post-apocalyptic world that remained after a nuclear Third World War.

James Bond first appeared in 1954; the films were loosely connected to the Cold War, but fans loved the beautiful women, exotic locations, tricky gadgets, and death-defying stunts, and probably paid less attention to the politics. Bond movies followed the political climate in depicting Soviets and &quot;Red&quot; Chinese.

Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s formula spy novels sold in the hundreds of thousands. His 1984 novel &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;, whose title refers to a series of conventions that, if broken, will lead to nuclear war and that are now all broken except for the fourth and last thread, was made into a major 1987 film starring Michael Caine. The point of such novels—like that of American movies of the 1950s, such as &quot;My Son John&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;—is to vilify the &quot;enemy within&quot;, the treacherous peace movement activists, and simple Labor Party voters who, by 1988, were marching against the Cold War.

==Computers in the Cold War==
Computer technology began to be influential in the mid-1940s during World War II and continued to increase in use during the 1950s and 1960s. The first computers were designed and built in Great Britain and the United States to store digital programs. The first electronic digital computers were used for large-scale military calculations. These computers would go on to help scientists in the fields of ballistic missiles, nuclear missiles, and anti-missile defense systems.

===Computers in the Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union faced a dilemma in that Western science was what Soviet scientific progress had been measured against. The dilemma for the Soviets was that while they wanted to surpass and overtake Western science, they had to borrow it in order to further their scientific progress. The results were that many Soviets were denouncing Western science but would turn around and describe a national need for the same theory they just denounced. The Soviet Union first began getting reports about electronically stored digital programs designed and built in Britain and the United States in the 1940s which got great attention from Soviet mathematicians and physicists working on defense projects that needed large amounts of computation. Soviet scientists got information about these computers from publications and survey articles. But they may have also got some of this information through their intelligence channels. One former intelligence officer attached to the Soviet consulate in New York has recently revealed that in 1942-1946 he obtained over 20,000 pages of classified documents from seven agents working at the plants and laboratories of RCA, Western Electric, Westinghouse, General Electric, and two aircraft companies that held military contracts which these documents contained scientific and technical information on radar, sonar, computers, and other electrical equipment. The first electronic digital computers were used for large-scale military calculations. Ballistic missile programs were major clients of Soviet digital computing and were used for calculating missile trajectories which the first problem solved but the large high speed computer M-2, was the calculation of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic parameters for missile design. Anti-missile defenses also pushed for computer developments. One of the first problems solved by a computer was the calculation of the dependency of the target destruction probability on the detonation efficiency of fragmentation warheads.

The Soviet Union got into the game of computers early and further developed them to make them into useful pieces of equipment for military purposes. This was fueled in part by wanting to compete with Western sciences but also this was during the Cold War which meant the United States was also investing in computers which gave the Soviet Union extra motive to keep investing in them.

===Computers in the United States===
The U.S. and Britain were some of the first countries to start developing computers and the United States did not stop developing. The U.S. saw that using computers for military purposes would be beneficial and this came during the beginning of the Cold War. The Soviet Union also began to integrate computers into military programs and so the competition between the Soviet Union and the United States with computers began.

The U.S. quickly started to adapt computers for defense and military purposes. The air force was one of the first military branches to adapt and use computers for their uses. The air force established a Reeves analogue computer at the Wright Air Development Center at Daytona for developing weapons systems. It had already been used in the Korean War to track enemy shells back to their source which was then destroyed. The U.S. Navy then deployed its Naval Ordnance Research Calculator (NORC) as a means of accurately firing a naval gun at a target, taking into account the multiple variables of ship speed, wind velocity, direction and roll and pitch of the vessel. As the United States knew how computers would impact military programs, they began collecting what information they could on how the Soviet Union was coming on with their own computer program. The information the United States got was that the Soviet Union was not really able to keep up with the U.S. because they had insufficient and poor standards of equipment needed for making computers. A U.S. report of 1959 demonstrated that whereas the Soviets had 400 general-purpose digital computers of all types, the U.S. had produced more than 4000, and while the Soviet computer production in 1958 was at most worth $55 million, that for the U.S. was $1 billion. This would show that unlike the nuclear programs of each country which was a pretty even race, the United States had a pretty sizable lead in the computer competition with the Soviet Union.

The U.S. had a good lead in computer development against the Soviet Union. Not only were the military branches using computers avidly but the civilian population also got to be able to use computers. 66% of computers in the United States were used for military purposes while 30% were used for civilian uses. Computers became a very big role in the military after World War II while also being available to civilians and the U.S. led this change into the technical world through the 1950s and 1960s.

<doc id="589291" wikidata="Q757788" url="?curid=589291" title="Atsugewi">
<text>The Atsugewi are Native Americans residing in northeastern California, United States. Their traditional lands are near Mount Shasta, specifically the Pit River drainage on Burney, Hat, and Dixie Valley or Horse Creeks. They are closely related to the Achomawi and consisted of two groups (the Atsugé and the Apwaruge). The Atsugé (&quot;pine-tree people&quot;) traditionally are from the Hat Creek area, and the Apwaruge (&quot;juniper-tree people&quot;) are from the Dixie Valley. They lived to the south of the Achomawi.

==History==
The Atsugewi traditionally lived by hunting and gathering and lived in small groups without centralized political authority. There was a cultural division into two smaller bands, based on the area of habitation. Inhabitants of Hat Creek were known as the &quot;pine tree people&quot; or Atsuge. In turn the residents of Apwariwa or Dixie Valley were known as the &quot;juniper tree people&quot; or Mahuopani; or by the more common Apwaruge, named after the valley itself. Exchanges of gifts and commercial trades were very common between the two bands.

===Neighboring cultures===

Relations with the nearby Achomawi settlements were varied for both Atsugewi bands. For example interactions between the territoriality adjacent band of Achomawi, the Illmawi, and the Atsuge were generally terse. These bad feelings arose in part from particular Atsuge trespassing upon Illmawi territory while traveling through to collect obsidian from the nearby Glass Mountain. In general however the Achomawi-speaking peoples were the principal trading destination for most Atsugewi manufactured goods and foodstuffs.

Contact between the Achomawi and Atsugewi speakers with the Klamath and Modoc to the north was largely undocumented. Despite this, Garth found it probable that there were extensive interactions between the cultures prior to the adoption of horses by the Northerners. Leslie Spier concluded that the Klamath and their Modoc relatives gained horses in the 1820s. Atsugewi settlements were likely attacked primarily by Modoc. Outsahone was applied to both the Klamath and Modoc peoples. Captured people would be sold into slavery at an intertribal slave market at The Dalles in present-day Oregon.

Atsugewi manufactured bows were prized by the neighboring Klamath, Paiute, Modoc and Achomawi. Called dumidiyi, the bows were of a similar design to those made by the Yurok. The best dumidiyi were made of yew wood by the Atsuge. As fairly peaceable relations developed with Paiute groups by 1870, these yew bows became a common trade item. The visiting Paiute would bring stockpiles of buckskins, red ochre, glass beads, guns, and especially shell currency created from Olivella biplicata shells in central and southern California. In return these trading goods were exchanged for Atsugewi basket and bow goods.

The Tolowa, Shasta, Yurok, Klamath, Atsugewi and groups of Western Mono and Paiute were among those known to have adopted buckskin clothing from the distant Plains Indians. For the Astugewi, this relatively new clothing was called dwákawi. They did not employ a system of consistently smoking the fresh skins. Only buckskins for formal occasions were smoked, leaving daily worn buckskins prone to water damage. The Astugewi potentially did not recognise the water resistance given by the smoking process. Garth conjectured that treating the buckskins with smoke was a recent development, having &quot;a close connection with the introduction of buckskin clothing itself&quot; but lacked direct evidence of this trend.

==Culture==
===Ethnobotany===
A full list of Atsugewi plants can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/19/ (68 documented uses).

===Language===
The Atsugewi language is a Palaihnihan language. As of 1994, an estimated three people spoke Atsugewi. The majority of the tribe speaks English.

==Tribes==
Today many Atsugewi are enrolled in the Pit River Tribe, while some Atsugewi people are members of the Susanville Indian Rancheria.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the combined 1770 population of the Achumawi and Atsugewi as 3,000. A more detailed analysis by Fred B. Kniffen arrived at the same figure. T. R. Garth (1978:237) estimated the Atsugewi population at a maximum of 850.

Kroeber estimated the combined population of the Achumawi and Atsugewi in 1910 as 1,100. The population was given as about 500 in 1936.

<doc id="589293" wikidata="Q33406" url="?curid=589293" title="Hokan languages">
<text>The Hokan language family is a hypothetical grouping of a dozen small language families spoken mainly in California, Arizona, and Baja California.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hokan&quot; is loosely based on the word for &quot;two&quot; in the various Hokan languages: &quot;*xwak&quot; in Proto-Yuman, (pronounced ) in Seri, in Achumawi, etc. Compare similar construction of the term &quot;Penutian&quot;.

==History of the proposal==
The &quot;Hokan hypothesis&quot; was first proposed in 1913 by Roland B. Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber, and further elaborated by Edward Sapir. Initial follow-up research found little additional evidence that these language families were related to each other. But since about 1950, increased efforts to document Hokan languages and to establish sound correspondences in proposed lexical resemblance sets have added weight to the Hokan hypothesis, leading to its acceptance by many specialists in the languages of California, Oregon, and Mesoamerica. However, some skepticism remains among scholars.

Linguist Paul Rivet claimed the Yurumanguí language of Colombia was part of the Hokan family. This claim has not been accepted by historical linguists. Terrence Kaufman wondered if Hokan might be related to Oto-Mangean of Central America.

An automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013) found lexical similarities among Seri, Yuman and Tequistlatecan. However, since the analysis was automatically generated, the grouping could be either due to mutual lexical borrowing or genetic inheritance.

==Distribution==
The geographic distribution of the Hokan languages suggests that they became separated around the Central Valley of California by the influx of later-arriving Penutian and other peoples; archaeological evidence for this is summarized in Chase-Dunn &amp; Mann (1998). These languages are spoken by Native American communities around and east of Mount Shasta, others near Lake Tahoe, the Pomo on the California coast, and the Yuman peoples along the lower Colorado River. Some linguists also include Chumash, between San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles, and other families, but the evidence is insubstantial, and most now restrict Hokan to some or all of the languages listed below.

==Languages==
The Hokan languages retained by Kaufman (1988) due to regular sound correspondences and common core vocabulary are as follows. (The data on which these conclusions were drawn have not been published or evaluated by anyone else.) Apart from Shasta–Palaihnihan and Yuman, all branches are single languages or shallow families.
* Hokan
** Chimariko
** Yana/Yahi
** Karuk
** Shasta–Palaihnihan
*** Shastan (4)
*** Palaihnihan (2)
** Pomoan (7)
** Washo
** Esselen
** Salinan
** Yuman (12)
** Seri
** Coahuilteco
** Comecrudan (3)
** Tequistlatecan (3)
** Jicaquean (Tolan, 2)
Marlett (2008) reevaluated the evidence and concluded that the evidence for Seri and Salinan has not been systematically or convincingly presented. The inclusion of the Tequistlatecan languages has also not received much support. The Chumash languages were once included, but that position has been almost universally abandoned.

===Zhivlov (2013)===
A lexicostatistical classification of the Hokan languages by Zhivlov (2013) is roughly presented as follows.
* Hokan
** Northern
**** Chimariko
***** Karuk
****** Shasta
******* Achumawi
******* Atsugewi
** Southern
**** Yana
***** Seri
****** Highland Chontal
****** Yuman
**** Salinan
**** Pomoan
Zhivlov (2013) does not consider Jicaquean (Tol) and Washo to be Hokan languages.

==Vocabulary==
Some Hokan lexical correspondences from Mary R. Haas (1963) are provided below.

Similar forms for &#x27;tongue&#x27; include:
*Chumash &quot;elʔew&quot;, &quot;elew&quot; &lt; *ipariwa
*Washo &quot;alŋ&quot; &lt; *ipariwa
*Salinan &quot;épal&quot;, &quot;ipaL&quot; &lt; *ipari
*Seri &quot;apɬ&quot; &lt; *ipari
*Chontal &quot;pala&quot;, &quot;peɬ&quot;- &lt; *ipari

===Similarities with Uto-Aztecan===
Shaul (2019) notes the following similarities between Proto-Hokan (based on Kaufman 2015) and Proto-Uto-Aztecan.

<text>Sir Joseph John Bossano (born 10 June 1939) is a Gibraltarian politician who served as Chief Minister of Gibraltar from 1988 to 1996 and Leader of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party from 1978 to 2011. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 1984 to 1988 and 1996 to 2011. He was first elected to the then Gibraltar House of Assembly in 1972 and is often referred to as the &quot;Father of the House&quot; for being the longest-serving parliamentarian in Gibraltar.

==Early life and career==
Bossano was born in Gibraltar and has a degree in Economics from the London School of Economics, as well as a degree in Italian from the University of Birmingham. He became part of the trade union movement in the 1960s while working as a seaman in Britain, where he was a member of the British Labour Party.

He was asked by a group of Gibraltarian politicians to return to Gibraltar and was elected a member of the House of Assembly in 1972, as a candidate of the Integration with Britain Party (IWBP). In 1969, the IWBP leader, then the Chief Minister, Sir Robert Peliza, was the mover of the Preamble to the Constitution which safeguards Gibraltar from ever passing to Spain without the expressed wishes of the Gibraltarians. He became the Branch Officer for the Transport and General Workers Union (responsible for the public sector in Gibraltar and was the main force behind the attainment of parity of wages with the UK for Gibraltarians).

In 1975, he left the IWBP to form the Gibraltar Democratic Movement, which won four seats in the Assembly in the 1976 election and two years later became the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party.

He consistently maintained a hard-line stance against any sovereignty deal with Spain without the consent of the Gibraltarians. In 1980, he led a demonstrations of about 2,000 Gibraltarians protesting at the opening of negotiations between Spain and the United Kingdom agreed on the Lisbon Agreement.

In 1987, he supported the position of the Government of Gibraltar and the Assembly against any agreement between Spain and the United Kingdom with regard to the joint use of the Airport of Gibraltar. On 10 November, Bossano and Joshua Hassan, then Chief Minister, led a demonstration of about 12,000 Gibraltarians, one of the largest ever held in the territory.

In February 1988, Bossano and Adolfo Canepa, the leader of the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights, stated that the Gibraltar House of Assembly would not approve the agreement reached by Spain and UK in December 1987 on the joint use of the Airport unless Spain accepted the British sovereignty over the isthmus.

In the key 1988 election, Bossano&#x27;s party called for the self-determination, expressed its opposition to the negotiations over the sovereignty and future of Gibraltar between Spain and the United Kingdom, and opposed to any transfer of sovereignty to Spain. It also asked for the withdrawal of the negotiations on the Brussels Declaration and opposed to the Airport agreement. The GSLP got 8 seats and a 58.2% of the popular vote. Bossano received a personal vote of 8,1128, about 4,000 more than his contender, Adolfo Canepa. Thus, Bossano was the new Chief Minister.

His re-election in 1992 with a 72% share of the vote (using the campaign slogan &quot;Give Spain No Hope&quot;), caused considerable friction with governments in both London and Madrid who were looking for a solution to the 30-year-old Spanish claim to Gibraltar. As Chief Minister he maintained good relations with Spanish politicians at municipal level, but would not sit to discuss the sovereignty of Gibraltar with them. During his time in office, Bossano also oversaw significant economic change, resulting from the decline of traditional sources of employment, such as the UK Ministry of Defence, and the creation of a private sector economy based on offshore finance and tourism.

He helped resolve the severe housing problem existing in Gibraltar before he came into power, by reclaiming land from the sea and constructing hundreds of affordable flats, which were offered at very reasonable prices. For the first time, and since then, Gibraltarians have become home owners, rather than renting from the government, as was traditional.

His main quest is and has always been to achieve the decolonisation of Gibraltar through the maximum level of self-government possible resulting in the removal of Gibraltar from the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories.

As leader of the GSLP and the Opposition and following his retirement as party leader, Bossano is still prominent in Gibraltar politics. He stood down as GSLP leader in April 2011, replaced by Fabian Picardo. Bossano remains active in politics and was a GSLP candidate in the Gibraltar general election in December 2011. Upon the GSLP-Liberal victory, Bossano got a seat in the Gibraltar Parliament and was appointed Minister for Enterprise, Training and Employment by the Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo.

The GSLP-Liberal government under Fabian Picardo won a second term at the 2015 general election and as of 2017, Bossano held the position of Minister for Economic Development, Telecommunications &amp; the Gibraltar Savings Bank.

==Awards==
Bossano was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the 2018 New Year Honours.



==Controversy==

In 1992-1993, when serving as Chief Minister, he told local media that if international law states that a Moroccan man, with his &quot;4 wives and 10 kids&quot;, are required to enter Gibraltar easily, he responded saying that he and his family would not come. Later at the UN, he stated that he would still disobey international laws on immigration.

These comments offended the local Moroccan community, whom they said they don&#x27;t know anyone in Gibraltar with such a large family as quoted by him. The Moroccans were pivotal for Gibraltar for some time since they replaced the Spanish workers lost when the border closed in 1969 and the vast majority were still living and working in squalid, inhumane conditions 30 years on. This sparked a community protest against racism. The whole incidents was later brought up again on social media at the 2023 General Elections (to which Sir Joe was contesting for reelection as Economic Minister).

On 31 July 2023, on the &#x27;Today Gibraltar&#x27; section on GBC&#x27;s Radio Gibraltar, he had an interview where he, in regards to Supported Employment for the Disabled, he expressed the process as &#x27;Protected&#x27; Employment and that disabled employees might not be as engaged and productive on the workplace as normal people and that they might need more sick leave than others.

This sparked negative reactions from the Disability Society and SNAG (Special Needs Action Group), who they described the comments as &#x27;bordering on insult&#x27; and &#x27;promoting Ableism&#x27;. On the next day on the same section, he was asked whether he would apologize to the people he may have offended, to which his response was that he will stand with his comments and not apologise.

<doc id="589303" wikidata="Q898432" url="?curid=589303" title="Molecular orbital theory">
<text>In chemistry, molecular orbital theory (MO theory or MOT) is a method for describing the electronic structure of molecules using quantum mechanics. It was proposed early in the 20th century. The MOT explains the paramagnetic nature of O2, which valence bond theory cannot explain.

In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms.

Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons – the molecular orbitals – as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree–Fock (HF) models to the Schrödinger equation.

Molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory are the foundational theories of quantum chemistry.

==Linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method==
In the LCAO method, each molecule has a set of molecular orbitals. It is assumed that the molecular orbital wave function &quot;ψj&quot; can be written as a simple weighted sum of the &quot;n&quot; constituent atomic orbitals &quot;χi&quot;, according to the following equation:

formula_1

One may determine &quot;cij&quot; coefficients numerically by substituting this equation into the Schrödinger equation and applying the variational principle. The variational principle is a mathematical technique used in quantum mechanics to build up the coefficients of each atomic orbital basis. A larger coefficient means that the orbital basis is composed more of that particular contributing atomic orbital – hence, the molecular orbital is best characterized by that type. This method of quantifying orbital contribution as a linear combination of atomic orbitals is used in computational chemistry. An additional unitary transformation can be applied on the system to accelerate the convergence in some computational schemes. Molecular orbital theory was seen as a competitor to valence bond theory in the 1930s, before it was realized that the two methods are closely related and that when extended they become equivalent.

Molecular orbital theory is used to interpret ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–VIS). Changes to the electronic structure of molecules can be seen by the absorbance of light at specific wavelengths. Assignments can be made to these signals indicated by the transition of electrons moving from one orbital at a lower energy to a higher energy orbital. The molecular orbital diagram for the final state describes the electronic nature of the molecule in an excited state.

There are three main requirements for atomic orbital combinations to be suitable as approximate molecular orbitals.

# The atomic orbital combination must have the correct symmetry, which means that it must belong to the correct irreducible representation of the molecular symmetry group. Using symmetry adapted linear combinations, or SALCs, molecular orbitals of the correct symmetry can be formed.
# Atomic orbitals must also overlap within space. They cannot combine to form molecular orbitals if they are too far away from one another.
# Atomic orbitals must be at similar energy levels to combine as molecular orbitals. Because if the energy difference is great, when the molecular orbitals form, the change in energy becomes small. Consequently, there is not enough reduction in energy of electrons to make significant bonding.

==History==
Molecular orbital theory was developed in the years after valence bond theory had been established (1927), primarily through the efforts of Friedrich Hund, Robert Mulliken, John C. Slater, and John Lennard-Jones. MO theory was originally called the Hund-Mulliken theory. According to physicist and physical chemist Erich Hückel, the first quantitative use of molecular orbital theory was the 1929 paper of Lennard-Jones. This paper predicted a triplet ground state for the dioxygen molecule which explained its paramagnetism (see ) before valence bond theory, which came up with its own explanation in 1931. The word &quot;orbital&quot; was introduced by Mulliken in 1932. By 1933, the molecular orbital theory had been accepted as a valid and useful theory.

Erich Hückel applied molecular orbital theory to unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules starting in 1931 with his Hückel molecular orbital (HMO) method for the determination of MO energies for pi electrons, which he applied to conjugated and aromatic hydrocarbons. This method provided an explanation of the stability of molecules with six pi-electrons such as benzene.

The first accurate calculation of a molecular orbital wavefunction was that made by Charles Coulson in 1938 on the hydrogen molecule. By 1950, molecular orbitals were completely defined as eigenfunctions (wave functions) of the self-consistent field Hamiltonian and it was at this point that molecular orbital theory became fully rigorous and consistent. This rigorous approach is known as the Hartree–Fock method for molecules although it had its origins in calculations on atoms. In calculations on molecules, the molecular orbitals are expanded in terms of an atomic orbital basis set, leading to the Roothaan equations. This led to the development of many ab initio quantum chemistry methods. In parallel, molecular orbital theory was applied in a more approximate manner using some empirically derived parameters in methods now known as semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods.

The success of Molecular Orbital Theory also spawned ligand field theory, which was developed during the 1930s and 1940s as an alternative to crystal field theory.

==Types of orbitals==

Molecular orbital (MO) theory uses a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) to represent molecular orbitals resulting from bonds between atoms. These are often divided into three types, bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding. A bonding orbital concentrates electron density in the region &quot;between&quot; a given pair of atoms, so that its electron density will tend to attract each of the two nuclei toward the other and hold the two atoms together. An anti-bonding orbital concentrates electron density &quot;behind&quot; each nucleus (i.e. on the side of each atom which is farthest from the other atom), and so tends to pull each of the two nuclei away from the other and actually weaken the bond between the two nuclei. Electrons in non-bonding orbitals tend to be associated with atomic orbitals that do not interact positively or negatively with one another, and electrons in these orbitals neither contribute to nor detract from bond strength.

Molecular orbitals are further divided according to the types of atomic orbitals they are formed from. Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams.

Common bonding orbitals are sigma (σ) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis and pi (π) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (δ) orbitals and phi (φ) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as π*.

==Bond order==

Bond order is the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. The bond order of a molecule can be calculated by subtracting the number of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals from the number of bonding orbitals, and the resulting number is then divided by two. A molecule is expected to be stable if it has bond order larger than zero. It is adequate to consider the valence electron to determine the bond order. Because (for principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1) when MOs are derived from 1s AOs, the difference in number of electrons in bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbital is zero. So, there is no net effect on bond order if the electron is not the valence one.

formula_2

From bond order, one can predict whether a bond between two atoms will form or not. For example, the existence of He2 molecule. From the molecular orbital diagram, the bond order is formula_3. That means, no bond formation will occur between two He atoms which is seen experimentally. It can be detected under very low temperature and pressure molecular beam and has binding energy of approximately 0.001 J/mol. (The helium dimer is a van der Waals molecule.)

Besides, the strength of a bond can also be realized from bond order (BO). For example:

For H2: Bond order is formula_4; bond energy is 436 kJ/mol.

For H2+: Bond order is formula_5; bond energy is 171 kJ/mol.

As the bond order of H2+ is smaller than H2, it should be less stable which is observed experimentally and can be seen from the bond energy.

==Overview==

MOT provides a global, delocalized perspective on chemical bonding. In MO theory, &quot;any&quot; electron in a molecule may be found &quot;anywhere&quot; in the molecule, since quantum conditions allow electrons to travel under the influence of an arbitrarily large number of nuclei, as long as they are in eigenstates permitted by certain quantum rules. Thus, when excited with the requisite amount of energy through high-frequency light or other means, electrons can transition to higher-energy molecular orbitals. For instance, in the simple case of a hydrogen diatomic molecule, promotion of a single electron from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital can occur under UV radiation. This promotion weakens the bond between the two hydrogen atoms and can lead to photodissociation, the breaking of a chemical bond due to the absorption of light.

Molecular orbital theory is used to interpret ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–VIS). Changes to the electronic structure of molecules can be seen by the absorbance of light at specific wavelengths. Assignments can be made to these signals indicated by the transition of electrons moving from one orbital at a lower energy to a higher energy orbital. The molecular orbital diagram for the final state describes the electronic nature of the molecule in an excited state.

Although in MO theory &quot;some&quot; molecular orbitals may hold electrons that are more localized between specific pairs of molecular atoms, &quot;other&quot; orbitals may hold electrons that are spread more uniformly over the molecule. Thus, overall, bonding is far more delocalized in MO theory, which makes it more applicable to resonant molecules that have equivalent non-integer bond orders than valence bond theory. This makes MO theory more useful for the description of extended systems.

Robert S. Mulliken, who actively participated in the advent of molecular orbital theory, considers each molecule to be a self-sufficient unit. He asserts in his article: ...Attempts to regard a molecule as consisting of specific atomic or ionic units held together by discrete numbers of bonding electrons or electron-pairs are considered as more or less meaningless, except as an approximation in special cases, or as a method of calculation […]. A molecule is here regarded as a set of nuclei, around each of which is grouped an electron configuration closely similar to that of a free atom in an external field, except that the outer parts of the electron configurations surrounding each nucleus usually belong, in part, jointly to two or more nuclei...An example is the MO description of benzene, , which is an aromatic hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms and three double bonds. In this molecule, 24 of the 30 total valence bonding electrons – 24 coming from carbon atoms and 6 coming from hydrogen atoms – are located in 12 σ (sigma) bonding orbitals, which are located mostly between pairs of atoms (C–C or C–H), similarly to the electrons in the valence bond description. However, in benzene the remaining six bonding electrons are located in three π (pi) molecular bonding orbitals that are delocalized around the ring. Two of these electrons are in an MO that has equal orbital contributions from all six atoms. The other four electrons are in orbitals with vertical nodes at right angles to each other. As in the VB theory, all of these six delocalized π electrons reside in a larger space that exists above and below the ring plane. All carbon–carbon bonds in benzene are chemically equivalent. In MO theory this is a direct consequence of the fact that the three molecular π orbitals combine and evenly spread the extra six electrons over six carbon atoms.
In molecules such as methane, , the eight valence electrons are found in four MOs that are spread out over all five atoms. It is possible to transform the MOs into four localized sp3 orbitals. Linus Pauling, in 1931, hybridized the carbon 2s and 2p orbitals so that they pointed directly at the hydrogen 1s basis functions and featured maximal overlap. However, the delocalized MO description is more appropriate for predicting ionization energies and the positions of spectral absorption bands. When methane is ionized, a single electron is taken from the valence MOs, which can come from the s bonding or the triply degenerate p bonding levels, yielding two ionization energies. In comparison, the explanation in valence bond theory is more complicated. When one electron is removed from an sp3 orbital, resonance is invoked between four valence bond structures, each of which has a single one-electron bond and three two-electron bonds. Triply degenerate T2 and A1 ionized states (CH4+) are produced from different linear combinations of these four structures. The difference in energy between the ionized and ground state gives the two ionization energies.

As in benzene, in substances such as beta carotene, chlorophyll, or heme, some electrons in the π orbitals are spread out in molecular orbitals over long distances in a molecule, resulting in light absorption in lower energies (the visible spectrum), which accounts for the characteristic colours of these substances. This and other spectroscopic data for molecules are well explained in MO theory, with an emphasis on electronic states associated with multicenter orbitals, including mixing of orbitals premised on principles of orbital symmetry matching. The same MO principles also naturally explain some electrical phenomena, such as high electrical conductivity in the planar direction of the hexagonal atomic sheets that exist in graphite. This results from continuous band overlap of half-filled p orbitals and explains electrical conduction. MO theory recognizes that some electrons in the graphite atomic sheets are completely delocalized over arbitrary distances, and reside in very large molecular orbitals that cover an entire graphite sheet, and some electrons are thus as free to move and therefore conduct electricity in the sheet plane, as if they resided in a metal.

<doc id="589305" wikidata="Q712469" url="?curid=589305" title="Cornel West">
<text>Cornel Ronald West (born June 2, 1953) is an American philosopher, theologian, political activist, politician, social critic, and public intellectual. West was an independent candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election and is an outspoken voice in left-wing politics in the United States.

The grandson of a Baptist minister, West&#x27;s primary philosophy focuses on the roles of race, gender, and class struggle in American society. A socialist, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, democratic socialism, left-wing populism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism. 

Among his most influential books are &quot;Race Matters&quot; (1993) and &quot;Democracy Matters&quot; (2004). 

During his career, he has held professorships and fellowships at Harvard University, Yale University, Union Theological Seminary, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Pepperdine University, and the University of Paris in Saint-Denis. 

He has been featured in several documentaries, and made appearances in Hollywood films such as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, as well as providing commentary for both films. West has also made several spoken word and hip hop albums. 

== Early life and education ==
West was born on June 2, 1953, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and grew up in Sacramento, California, where he graduated from John F. Kennedy High School. His mother, Irene Rayshell (Bias), was a teacher and principal. His father, Clifton Louis West Jr., was a general contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. His grandfather Clifton L. West, Sr. was pastor of the Tulsa Metropolitan Baptist Church.
Irene B. West Elementary School in Elk Grove, California, is named after his mother.

As a teen, West marched in civil rights demonstrations and organized protests demanding Black studies courses at his high school, where he was the student body president. He later wrote that, in his youth, he admired &quot;the sincere Black militancy of Malcolm X, the defiant rage of the Black Panther Party, and the livid Black theology of James Cone&quot;.

In 1970, after graduation from high school, he enrolled at Harvard College and took classes taught by the philosophers Robert Nozick and Stanley Cavell. In 1973, West was graduated from Harvard &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in Near Eastern languages and civilization. He credits Harvard with exposing him to a broader range of ideas and that he was influenced by his professors as well as the Black Panther Party (BPP). West says his Christianity prevented him from joining the BPP, instead choosing to work in local breakfast, prison, and church programs. After completing his undergraduate work at Harvard, West enrolled at Princeton University, where he received master&#x27;s and PhD degrees in 1980, completing a dissertation under the supervision of Raymond Geuss and Sheldon Wolin. He became the first African American to graduate from Princeton with a PhD degree in philosophy.

At Princeton, West was heavily influenced by the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty. Rorty remained a close friend and colleague of West&#x27;s for many years following West&#x27;s graduation. The title of West&#x27;s dissertation was &quot;Ethics, Historicism, and the Marxist Tradition&quot;, which was later revised and published under the title &quot;The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Academic appointments ===

In his late 20s, he returned to Harvard as a W. E. B. Du Bois Fellow before becoming an assistant professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. In 1984, he went to Yale Divinity School in what eventually became a joint appointment in American studies. While at Yale, he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and divestment from apartheid South Africa. One of the protests resulted in his being arrested and jailed. As punishment, the university administration canceled his leave for the spring term in 1987, leading him to commute from Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was teaching two classes, across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Paris in Saint-Denis.

He then returned to Union Theological Seminary for one year before going to Princeton to become a professor of religion and director of the program in African American Studies from 1988 to 1994. After Princeton, he accepted an appointment as professor of African American studies at Harvard University, with a joint appointment at the Harvard Divinity School. West taught one of the university&#x27;s most popular courses, an introductory class on African American studies. In 1998, he was appointed the first Alphonse Fletcher University Professor. West used this new position to teach in not only African American studies, but also courses in divinity, religion, and philosophy. West was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa in 1998 at SUNY Plattsburgh.

==== Dispute with Lawrence Summers ====
In 2000, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers became president of Harvard. Soon after, Summers held a private meeting with West, in which he reportedly rebuked West for missing too many classes, contributing to grade inflation, neglecting serious scholarship, and spending too much time on his financially profitable projects. Summers reportedly suggested that West produce an academic book befitting his professorial position, as his recent output had consisted primarily of co-written and edited volumes. According to some reports, Summers also objected to West&#x27;s production of a CD, the critically panned &quot;Sketches of My Culture&quot;, and to his political campaigning, including spending an alleged three weeks to promote Bill Bradley&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. West contended he had missed only one class during his time at Harvard &quot;in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard-sponsored conference on AIDS&quot;. Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of Harvard University Professor and thus reported directly to the president, he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production.

Summers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West, except to state that he hoped that West would remain at Harvard. Soon after, West was hospitalized for prostate cancer. West noted that Summers failed to send him get-well wishes until weeks after his surgery, whereas newly installed Princeton president Shirley Tilghman had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment. In 2002, West left Harvard University to return to Princeton. West criticized Summers in public interviews, calling him &quot;the Ariel Sharon of higher education&quot; on the NPR program &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot;. In response to these remarks, five Princeton faculty members, led by professor of molecular biology Jacques Robert Fresco, said they looked with &quot;strong disfavor upon his characterization&quot; of Summers and that &quot;such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications ... that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate, indeed repugnant and intolerable&quot;. Harvard&#x27;s undergraduate student newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, suggested in October 2002 that the premise of the &quot;Law and Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Anti-Thesis&quot; was based on West&#x27;s conflicts with Summers.

==== Post ====
In 2002, West returned to Princeton, where he helped found the Center for African American studies in 2006. In 2012, West left Princeton and returned to the institution where he began his teaching career, Union Theological Seminary. He continued to teach occasional courses at Princeton in an emeritus capacity as the Class of 1943 University Professor in the Center for African American Studies.

West returned to Harvard in November 2016, leaving Union Theological Seminary for a nontenured position as Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy. He was appointed jointly at the Harvard Divinity School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Department of African and African American Studies.

In February 2021, reports circulated that West was denied consideration for tenure at Harvard and that he had threatened to leave the university again. On March 8, 2021, West announced that he would leave Harvard and move to the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan. He submitted a resignation letter to Harvard on June 30, 2021. West implied that the decision to deny him tenure was retaliation for his critical stance on Israel and the Palestinian cause. West wrote: 

On July 1, 2021, West rejoined the faculty of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, holding the prestigious Dietrich Bonhoeffer Chair. Affiliated with Columbia University since 1928, Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York has served as the Columbia University constituent faculty of theology.

The recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees and an American Book Award, West has written or contributed to more than twenty published books. West is a long-time member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for which he has served as honorary chair. He is also a co-founder of the Network of Spiritual Progressives. West is on the advisory board of the International Bridges to Justice. In 2008, he received special recognition from the World Cultural Council. West is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and its World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand involvement of Alpha Phi Alpha in politics and social policy to encompass international concerns.

Hazel Carby compared West to W. E. B. Du Bois as a prolific African-American thinker and has been cited as &quot;[p]erhaps the most influential contemporary recover of Du Bois&quot;. By establishing West within Du Bois&#x27;s tradition of racial thought, Carby emphasized the similarities in their intellectual positions and their aesthetic presences, such as clothing.

West has been widely cited in the popular press. His scholarship has been criticized as well as praised; &quot;The New Republic&quot; literary editor Leon Wieseltier called West&#x27;s writing &quot;sectarian, humorless, pedantic, and self-endeared&quot;.

In 1997, West was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society, and in 1999, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

=== Broadcast, film, and recording ===
West appears as Councillor West in both &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (2003) and also provides the voice for this character in the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. In addition, West provides philosophical commentary on all three Matrix films in The Ultimate Matrix Collection, along with the integral theorist Ken Wilber.

West has made several appearances in documentary films, such as 2008&#x27;s &quot;Examined Life&quot;, a documentary featuring several academics discussing philosophy in real-world contexts. West, &quot;driving through Manhattan, ... compares philosophy to jazz and blues, reminding us how intense and invigorating a life of the mind can be&quot;. He also appears in conversation with Bill Withers in the 2009 documentary &quot;Still Bill&quot;.

West has made frequent appearances on the political talk show &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.

A character based on West and events in his career appeared in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Anti-Thesis&quot;, significant for introducing the recurring villain character Nicole Wallace.

In May 2012, West guest-starred in the sixth season of the American television comedy series &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?&quot;.

West recorded a recitation of John Mellencamp&#x27;s song &quot;Jim Crow&quot; for inclusion on the singer&#x27;s box set &quot;On the Rural Route 7609&quot; in 2009.

In 2010, he completed recording with the Cornel West Theory, a hip hop band endorsed by West.

He also has released several hip-hop-soul-spoken word albums. In 2001, West released his first album, &quot;Sketches of My Culture&quot;. &quot;Street Knowledge&quot; followed in 2004. In 2007, West released his third album, entitled &quot;Never Forget: A Journey of Revelations&quot;, which included collaborations with the likes of Prince, Talib Kweli, Jill Scott, Andre 3000, KRS-One, Killer Mike, and the late Gerald Levert. West appeared on Immortal Technique&#x27;s song &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;, which appeared on the 2011 album &quot;The Martyr&quot;. In 2012, he was featured on Brother Ali&#x27;s song &quot;Letter to My Countrymen&quot;, which appeared on the album &quot;Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color&quot;.

West is a frequent conversation partner with his friend Robert P. George, a prominent conservative intellectual, with the two often speaking together at colleges and universities on the meaning of liberal arts education, free speech, and civil dialogue. 

In September 2020, he was listed by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine as the fourth-greatest thinker for the COVID-19 era.

As of 2020, West is also the co-host, along with Tricia Rose, of the podcast &quot;The Tight Rope&quot;.

== Criticism and controversies ==
West has drawn criticism for his spending habits, having been in debt often and owing the IRS $483,000 as of 2023. Some of the spending has gone towards extramarital affairs, with some girlfriends and ex-wives claiming that he impregnates and abandons women.

He has been described as controversial.

== Activism ==

=== Views on race in the United States ===

West has called the U.S. a &quot;racist patriarchal&quot; nation where white supremacy continues to define everyday life. &quot;White America&quot;, he writes, &quot;has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of Blacks.&quot; He goes on to say this has created many &quot;degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth.&quot; West attributes most of the Black community&#x27;s problems to &quot;existential angst derive[d] from the lived experience of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture.&quot;

In West&#x27;s view, the September 11 attacks &quot;gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a Black person in the United States&quot;, feeling &quot;unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hatred for who they are&quot;. &quot;The ugly terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on 9/11&quot;, he said, &quot;plunged the whole country into the blues.&quot;

West was arrested on October 13, 2014, while protesting against the shooting of Michael Brown and participating in Ferguson October, and again on August 10, 2015, while demonstrating outside a courthouse in St. Louis on the one-year anniversary of Brown&#x27;s death. The 2015 documentary film &quot;#Bars4Justice&quot; includes footage of West demonstrating and being arrested in Ferguson.

=== Politics ===

West has described himself as a &quot;non-Marxist socialist&quot; (partly because he does not view Marxism and Christianity as reconcilable) and previously served as honorary chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America, which he has described as &quot;the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join.&quot; In the &quot;Matrix&quot;-themed documentary entitled, &quot;The Burly Man Chronicles&quot;, he described himself as a &quot;radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority&quot;.

West has argued &quot;the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ugly totalitarian regime was desirable,&quot; but that the war in Iraq was the result of &quot;dishonest manipulation&quot; on the part of the Bush administration. He asserts that Bush administration hawks &quot;are not simply conservative elites and right-wing ideologues,&quot; but rather are &quot;evangelical nihilists – drunk with power and driven by grand delusions of American domination of the world.&quot; He adds, &quot;[we now] are experiencing the sad gangsterization of America, an unbridled grasp at power, wealth, and status.&quot; Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts, West warns, &quot;Free-market fundamentalism trivializes the concern for public interest. It puts fear and insecurity in the hearts of anxiety-ridden workers. It also makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit – often at the cost of the common good.&quot;

West has been involved with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmons&#x27;s Hip-Hop Summit, and he has worked with such public figures as Al Sharpton, whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised.

In 2000, West worked as a senior advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley. When Bradley lost in the primaries, West became a prominent and active supporter of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, speaking at several Nader rallies. Some Greens sought to draft West to run as a presidential candidate in 2004. West declined, citing his active participation in the Al Sharpton campaign. West, along with other prominent Nader 2000 supporters, signed the &quot;Vote to Stop Bush&quot; statement urging progressive voters in swing states to vote for John Kerry, despite strong disagreements with many of Kerry&#x27;s policies.

In April 2002, West and Rabbi Michael Lerner engaged in an act of civil disobedience by sitting in the street in front of the U.S. State Department &quot;in solidarity with suffering Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters&quot;. West said, &quot;[w]e must keep in touch with the humanity of both sides&quot;. In May 2007, West joined a demonstration against &quot;injustices faced by the Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation&quot; and &quot;to bring attention to this 40-year travesty of justice&quot;. In 2011, West called on the University of Arizona to divest from companies profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.

West also serves as co-chair of the Network of Spiritual Progressives (formerly the Tikkun Community). He co-chaired the National Parenting Organization&#x27;s Task Force on Parent Empowerment and participated in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s National Conversation on Race. He has publicly endorsed &quot;In These Times&quot; magazine by calling it: &quot;The most creative and challenging news magazine of the American left.&quot; He is also a contributing editor for &quot;Sojourners&quot; magazine.

West supports People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in its Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign, aimed at eliminating what PETA describes as the inhumane treatment of chickens by KFC. West is quoted on PETA flyers: &quot;Although most people don&#x27;t know chickens as well as they know cats and dogs, chickens are interesting individuals with personalities and interests every bit as developed as the dogs and cats with whom many of us share our lives.&quot;

In 2008, West contributed his insights on the global issue of modernized slavery and human trafficking in the documentary &quot;Call+Response&quot;. West is a member of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy.

In 2011, West expressed his frustration with some critics of Occupy Wall Street, who said the movement lacked a clear and unified message. West replied by saying:
On October 16, 2011, West was in Washington, D.C., participating in the Occupy D.C. protests on the steps of the Supreme Court over the court&#x27;s decision in the &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; case the previous year. Five days later, he was arrested during an Occupy Wall Street protest in Harlem against the New York Police Department&#x27;s stop and frisk policy.

In 2014, West co-initiated the Stop Mass Incarceration Network, a project of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. Later that year, he and RCP chairman Bob Avakian took part in a filmed discussion on &quot;Religion and Revolution&quot;.

In August 2017, West was one of a group of interfaith, multiracial clergy who took part in a counter-protest at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; West averred that Antifa had saved their lives.

West is an outspoken supporter of Julian Assange, on one occasion saying: &quot;[Assange] has been simply laying bare some of the crimes and lies of the American empire&quot;.

West stated that he believed the Russian invasion of Ukraine was &quot;a criminal invasion, provoked by the expansion of NATO, which is an instrument of U.S. global power&quot; and described the war as a &quot;proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation&quot;.

West condemned Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Strip and called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, saying that the US veto at the UN Security Council &quot;to block a vote to end Israel’s barbaric genocidal campaign in Gaza is an act of spiritual obscenity and moral bankruptcy.&quot; He called President Joe Biden a war criminal and said Israel and the US are complicit in the genocide of the Palestinians.

=== Views on Barack Obama ===

West has often spoken about the lack of adequate Black leadership and how it results in doubt within Black communities as to their political potential to ensure change. West publicly supported 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama, and spoke to more than 1,000 of Obama&#x27;s supporters at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, on November 29, 2007.

West criticized Obama when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, saying that it would be difficult for Obama to be &quot;a war president with a peace prize&quot;. West further retracted his support for Obama in an April 2011 interview, stating that Obama is &quot;a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black muppet of corporate plutocrats. And now he has become head of the American killing machine and is proud of it&quot;. In November 2012, West said in an interview that he considered Obama a &quot;Rockefeller Republican in blackface&quot;.

In 2011, West participated in a &quot;Poverty Tour&quot; with Tavis Smiley, his co-host on the Public Radio International program &quot;Smiley &amp; West&quot;. The tour became a two-part special on their radio program, as well as a five-night special on the PBS television program &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot;. They recounted their experience on the tour in their 2012 bestselling book &quot;The Rich and the Rest of Us&quot;. The stated aim of the tour was to highlight the plight of the impoverished population of the United States prior to the 2012 presidential election, whose candidates, West and Smiley stated, had ignored the plight of the poor.

In 2014, West gave an interview criticizing Obama, calling him a &quot;counterfeit&quot; who posed as a progressive. West defined Obama&#x27;s presidency as &quot;a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national security presidency&quot;.

=== Support for Bernie Sanders ===
In 2015, West expressed his support for Democratic contender Bernie Sanders during an interview on &quot;CNN Tonight&quot;. West argued that the Sanders plans to redistribute wealth from Wall Street elites to the poorest members of society would be beneficial for the African-American community. On August 24, 2015, West tweeted, &quot;I endorse Brother @BernieSanders because he is a long-distance runner with integrity in the struggle for justice for over 50 years.&quot;

In July 2016, after Sanders exited the presidential race, West endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka. West, who was critical of the U.S. interventionist foreign policy in 2016, referred to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as a &quot;neoliberal disaster&quot;, and accused Clinton of merely posing as a progressive.

Following the victory of Donald Trump, West contended in an op-ed for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that white working- and middle-class voters &quot;rejected the economic neglect of neoliberal policies and the self-righteous arrogance of elites&quot;, yet &quot;supported a candidate who appeared to blame their social misery on minorities, and who alienated Mexican immigrants, Muslims, Black people, Jews, gay people, women, and China in the process.&quot;
In 2020, West once again put his support behind Bernie Sanders, who mounted a second presidential bid in that election cycle.

=== 2024 presidential campaign ===
On June 5, 2023, West announced he would run in the 2024 presidential election under the People&#x27;s Party. West&#x27;s decision to run with the People&#x27;s Party sparked criticism due to the party&#x27;s lack of ballot access, claims of leadership dysfunction, and sexual harassment allegations against the party founder Nick Brana. On June 14, West announced that he would instead seek the Green Party nomination, running a campaign centered around support for Medicare for All, public housing, action on climate change, and drastically cutting the U.S. military budget.

On October 5, 2023, West announced that he was abandoning his candidacy for the Green nomination, and would instead continue his presidential bid as an independent candidate. On February 1, 2024, West announced the establishment of the Justice For All Party (JFA), which he claimed would pursue a strategy of securing ballot access in specific areas (Florida, North Carolina, and Washington). In August 2024, Cornel West and his running mate Melina Abdullah were both disqualified and denied entry onto the 2024 Michigan presidential election ballot. 

West&#x27;s campaign received extensive support from Republican and Trump allies to stay on the ballot in swing states in hope that he would take votes from Kamala Harris. West expressed ambivalence about the support from Republicans. David Masciotra criticized West for aligning himself with people and candidates who defend aggressive actions by Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and the Chinese Communist Party.

As of August 2024, West was polling below 1% nationally, his campaign was $17,000 in debt, and he was no longer actively campaigning.

<text>Jean-Christophe Yoccoz (29 May 1957 – 3 September 2016) was a French mathematician. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1994, for his work on dynamical systems. Yoccoz died on 3 September 2016 at the age of 59.

==Biography==
Yoccoz attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, during which time he was a silver medalist at the 1973 International Mathematical Olympiad and a gold medalist in 1974. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1975, and completed an agrégation in mathematics in 1977. 

After completing military service in Brazil, he completed his PhD under Michael Herman in 1985 at Centre de mathématiques Laurent-Schwartz, which is a research unit jointly operated by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and École Polytechnique. 

He took up a position at the University of Paris-Sud in 1987, and became a professor at the Collège de France in 1997, where he remained until his death. He was a member of Bourbaki.

Yoccoz won the Salem Prize in 1988. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1990 at Kyoto, and was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994 in Zürich. He joined the French Academy of Sciences and Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 1994, became a chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 1995, and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Brazilian National Order of Scientific Merit in 1998.

==Mathematical work==
Yoccoz&#x27;s worked on the theory of dynamical systems. His contributions include advances to KAM theory, and the introduction of the method of Yoccoz puzzles, a combinatorial technique which proved useful to the study of Julia sets.

<text>Georg Friedrich Julius Arthur von Auwers (12 September 1838 – 24 January 1915) was a German astronomer. Auwers was born in Göttingen to Gottfried Daniel Auwers and Emma Christiane Sophie (née Borkenstein).

He attended the University of Göttingen and worked at the University of Königsberg. He specialized in astrometry, making very precise measurements of stellar positions and motions. He detected the companion stars of Sirius and Procyon from their effects on the main star&#x27;s motion, before telescopes were powerful enough to visually observe them. He was from 1866 Secretary to the Berlin Academy, and directed expeditions to measure the transits of Venus, in order to measure the distance from the earth to the Sun more accurately, and therefore be able to calculate the dimensions of the Solar System more accurately and with greater precision. He began a project to unify all available sky charts, an interest that began with his catalog of nebulae which he published in 1862. He died in Berlin. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

His son Karl von Auwers became a well known chemist and discoverer of the Auwers synthesis.

<doc id="589318" wikidata="Q56701" url="?curid=589318" title="Esselen">
<text>The Esselen are a Native American people belonging to a linguistic group in the hypothetical Hokan language family, who are Indigenous to the Santa Lucia Mountains of a region south of the Big Sur River in California. Prior to Spanish colonization, they lived seasonally on the coast and inland, surviving off the plentiful seafood during the summer and acorns and wildlife during the rest of the year.

During the mission period of California history, Esselen children were baptized by the priests when they left their villages and relocated as family units to live in the missions where they learned reading, writing, and various trades. The Esselen were required to labor at the three nearby missions, Mission San Carlos, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, and Mission San Antonio de Padua. Like many Native American populations, their members were decimated by starvation, forced labor, over work, torture, and diseases that they had no natural resistance to.

Historically, they were one of the smallest Native American populations in California. Various experts estimate there were from 500 to 1,285 individuals living in the steep, rocky region at the time of the arrival of the Spanish. Due to their proximity to three Spanish missions, they were likely one of the first whose culture was virtually eliminated as a result of European contact and domination. The people were believed to have been exterminated but some tribal members avoided the mission life and emerged from the forest to work in nearby ranches in the early and late 1800s. Descendants of the Esselen are currently scattered, but many still live in the Monterey Peninsula area and nearby regions.
== Origins ==

Archaeological and linguistic evidence indicates that the original people&#x27;s territory once extended much farther north, into the San Francisco Bay Area, until they were displaced by the entrance of Ohlone people. Based on linguistic evidence, Richard Levy places the displacement at around AD 500. Breschini and Haversat place the entry of Ohlone speakers into the Monterey area prior to 200 B.C. based on multiple lines of evidence. Carbon dating of excavated sites places the Esselen in the Big Sur since 2630 BCE. Recently, however, researchers have obtained a radiocarbon date from coastal Esselen territory in the Big Sur River drainage dated prior to 6,500 years ago (archeological site CA-MNT-88).

== Etymology ==

The name Esselen is uncertain. One theory is that it refers to the name of a major native village, possibly &quot;Exse&#x27;ein&quot;, or the place called &quot;Eslenes&quot; (said to be near the current site of the Mission San Carlos). The village name may be derived from a tribal location known as Ex&#x27;selen, &quot;the rock,&quot; which is in turn derived from the phrase &quot;Xue elo xonia eune&quot;, &quot;I come from the rock.&quot; &quot;The Rock&quot; may refer to the tall promontory, visible for miles both up and down the coast, on which the Point Sur Lighthouse is situated.

The Spanish extended the term to mean the entire linguistic group. Variant spellings exist in old records, including &quot;Aschatliens, Ecclemach, Eslen, Eslenes, Excelen,&quot; and &quot;Escelen&quot;. &quot;Aschatliens&quot; may refer to a group around Mission San Carlos, in and around the village of Achasta.

Achasta was a Rumsen Ohlone village, and totally unrelated to the Esselen. Achasta was possibly founded only after the establishment of Mission San Carlos. It was the closest village to Mission San Carlos, and was 10+ miles from Esselen territory. &quot;Eslenes&quot; was nowhere near Mission San Carlos. On January 3, 1603, explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno found a deserted Indian village about a mile from what later became the site of the Carmel Mission.

== Language ==
The Esselen language is a language isolate. It is hypothetically part of the Hokan family. The language was spoken in the northern Santa Lucia Range. Prior to contact with European culture, there were between 500 and 1000 speakers. French explorer Jean La Pérouse, who visited Monterey in 1786, recorded 22 words in 1786. He wrote in his journal during the expedition:

In 1792, Spanish ship captain Dionisio Alcalá Galiano recorded 107 words and phrases. In 1832, Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta recorded another 58 words and 14 phrases at Mission Soledad. The speakers were from the Arroyo Seco area to the east. The neighboring Rumsen people were fluent in Esselen and they provided de la Cuesta with some language. A total of about 300 words along with some short phrases have been identified. Examples include &quot;mamamanej&quot; (fire); &quot;koxlkoxl&quot; (fish); and &quot;ni-tsch-ekė&quot; (my husband). Isabel Meadows, who also spoke Rumsen, was the last fluent Esselen speaker. She died in 1939.

== Geography ==

The Central California coast in this region is marked by high, steep cliffs and rocky shores, interrupted by small coastal creeks with occasional, small beaches. The mountains are very rugged with narrow canyons. The terrain makes the area relatively inaccessible, long-term habitation a challenge, and limited the size of the native population. The tribe were neighbors to the Salinan people who inhabited present-day southern Monterey County, southern San Benito County, and northern San Luis Obispo county.

=== Locations ===

It is believed there were three Esselen geo-political districts: Imunahan, comprising the central Arroyo Seco watershed; Excelen, including the upper Carmel River; and Ekheahan, including the upper watersheds of the Arroyo Seco and Big Sur Rivers along with a section of the Big Sur coast between Posts and Big Creek further south. The Esselen resided along the upper Carmel and Arroyo Seco River, and along the Big Sur coast from near present-day Hurricane Point to the vicinity of Vicente Creek in the south. The Esselen&#x27;s territory extended inland through the Santa Lucia Mountains as far as the Salinas Valley. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, they were hunter-gatherers who resided in small groups with no centralized political authority. Modern researchers believe there were five distinct Esselen districts: Excelen, Eslenahan, Imunahan, Ekheahan, and Aspasniahan. Each are believed to have had a relatively stable resident population.

Jean La Pérouse reported that, &quot;The country of the Ecclemachs [Esselen] extends above 20 leagues to the [south-]eastward of Monterey.&quot;

Within each district the people occupied several villages depending on the season and availability of food, water, and shelter. Carbon dating tests of artifacts found near Slates Hot Springs, presently owned by the Esalen Institute, indicate human presence as early as 3500 BC. With easy access to the ocean, fresh water and hot springs, the Esselen people used the site regularly, and certain areas were reserved as burial grounds.

A large boulder with a dozen or more deep mortar bowls worn into it, known as a bedrock mortar, is located in Apple Tree Camp on the southwest slope of Devil&#x27;s Peak, north of the Camp Pico Blanco. The holes were hollowed out over many generations by Indians who used it to grind the acorns into flour. Other mortar rocks have also been found within the Boy Scout camp at campsites 3 and 7, and slightly upstream from campsite 12, while a fourth is found on a large rock in the river, originally above the river, between campsites 3 and 4.

== Culture ==

Archeological evidence of settlements has been found throughout Esselen territory. Artifacts found at a site in the Tassajara area (archaeological site CA-MNT-44) included bone awls, antler flakers, projectile points including desert side-notched points, and scrapers. Excavation at a second site at the mouth of the Carmel River (archaeological site CA-MNT-63) found more projectile points, a variety of cores and modified flakes, bone awls, a bone tube, a bone gaming piece, and mortars and pestles. Many sites show aesthetic illustrations of numerous pictographs in black, white, and red.

=== Dress and living standards ===

Prior to European contact, the people wore little clothing. The men were naked year-round and the women and girls may have worn a small apron. In cold weather they may have covered themselves with mud or rabbit or deerskin capes. No evidence of sandals or foot wear has been found.

Explorer and later Governor of Alta California Pedro Fages described their dress in an account written before 1775:

=== Food sources ===

Due to the relative abundance of food resources, the Esselen people never developed agriculture and remained hunter-gatherers. They followed local food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter, where they harvested rich stocks of mussels, limpets, abalone and other sea life.

Evidence of baskets have been found and were probably the principal item used to furnish households. Basket design included large conical baskets for carrying burdens, hemispherical-shaped cooking bowls, flat trays, and small boat-shaped baskets which may have been seed-beaters.

In the summer and fall they moved inland to harvest one of their staple foods, acorns, which were very abundant throughout Big Sur. They gathered acorns from the black oak, canyon live oak and tanbark oak, primarily on upper slopes above the narrow canyons. They first soaked the acorns in running water to leach the bitter tannin from them. They then ground the acorns using a mortar. Over many years they hollowed out bedrock mortars in granite rock outcroppings that they used to grind plant seeds and acorns into flour. A large bedrock mortar is located in Apple Tree Camp on the southwest slope of Devil&#x27;s Peak, north of the Camp Pico Blanco. More than across, the boulder contains a dozen or more deep mortar bowls worn into it over several generations. Other mortar rocks have also been found within the Pico Blanco Boy Scout camp at campsites 3 and 7, and slightly upstream from campsite 12, while a fourth is found on a large rock in the river, originally above the river, between campsites 3 and 4. Several Esselen mortars are located in boulders near Clover Basin Camp in Miller Canyon. Once ground, they cooked the acorns into a mush or baked as bread.

Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno reported,

They hunted rabbits and deer likely with bow and arrow, although no stone arrow points have been found. Arrows were made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts. They traded acorns, fish, salt, baskets, hides and pelts, shells and beads with other tribes.

=== Dwellings ===

There are virtually no contemporary records of the Esselen people&#x27;s lives. Researchers believe that they lived in a manner very much like the Ohlone people to the north and the Costonoan people near present-day Monterey. Miguel Constanso, who traveled with Portola&#x27;s expeditions 175 years later, wrote about the homes of the Indians who lived on the Santa Barbara Channel. He described how they lived in dome-shaped dwellings covered with bundled mats of tules. The homes were up to across and three or four families lived in a single dwelling. They built a fire pit in the middle and left a vent or chimney in the center of the roof.

In mountainous regions where redwood trees grew, they may have built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. One of the main village buildings, the sweat lodge, was built low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built boats of tule to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.

=== Spiritual beliefs ===

The Esselen left hand prints on rock faces in a few locations. About 250 have been found in a single rock shelter located a few miles from Tassajara (designated by archeologists as CA-MNT-44). Smaller numbers of handprints have been found in a few caves or rock shelters in the same area and in the next valley to the west.

=== Climate ===

Rainfall varies from throughout the range, with the most falling on the higher mountains in the north; almost all precipitation falls in the winter. During the summer, fog and low clouds are frequent along the coast up to an elevation of several thousand feet. Surface runoff from rainfall events is rapid, and many streams dry up entirely in the summer, except for some perennial streams in the wetter areas in the north.

Viscaino, likely the first European to land on the Central Coast of California, wrote about his visit to Monterey Bay from December 16, 1602, to January 3, 1603.

Father Junipero Serra first established the original mission in Monterey on June 3, 1770, near the native village of Tamo. It was also adjacent to the Presidio and headquarters of Pedro Fages, who served as military governor of Alta California between 1770 and 1774.

Fages worked his men very harshly and complaints mounted until Serra intervened. He told Fages that, as a Christian, he had to observe the sabbath and let his men rest on Sundays. But the soldiers raped the Indian woman and took them as concubines. At Serra&#x27;s urging, Fages punished some of the more excessive incidents of sexual abuse, but it did not stop.

Fages regarded the natives with disrespect. In 1787, he described the area&#x27;s Indians as the laziest, most brutish and least rational of all the natives discovered between San Diego and San Francisco. He reckoned those qualities — along with the foggy and windy climate, shortage of potable water, high death rate, and language barriers — accounted for the painfully slow progress of mission Carmel. Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first and religious outposts second. Fages and Serra were engaged in a heated power struggle and Serra decided to move the mission.

=== Spanish missions ===

In May 1771, the viceroy approved Serra&#x27;s petition to relocate the mission to its current location near the Carmel River and present-day town of Carmel-by-the-Sea and named it Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. Serra&#x27;s goal in part was to put some distance between the mission&#x27;s neophytes and from Fages and his troops.

The new mission was on land better suited to farming and within a short distance of the Rumsen Ohlone villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel. The mission was about from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen. On May 9, 1775, Junípero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, &quot;Pach-hepas&quot;, who was the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. His baptism took place at Xasáuan, 10 leagues (about ) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name.

=== Baptisms and forced labor ===

King Charles V of Spain issued the New Laws (in Spanish, &quot;Leyes Nuevas&quot;, or &quot;New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians&quot;) on November 20, 1542. These were replaced around the beginning of the 17th century with Repartimiento, which entitled a Spanish settler or official to the labor of a number of indigenous workers on their farms or mines. The Spanish state based its right over the land and persons of the Indies on the Papal charge to evangelize the indigenous population. This motivated the Jesuits to build missions across California.

Under Spanish law, the Esselen were technically free individuals, but they could be compelled by force to labor without pay. With the help of the soldiers who guarded the mission, the Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were forcibly relocated, conscripted, and trained as plowmen, shepherds, cattle herders, blacksmiths, and carpenters on the mission. Disease, starvation, over work, and torture decimated the tribe.

The Esselen had ongoing conflicts with the neighboring Rumsen tribe over crops and hunting grounds. The Rumsen initially assisted the Franciscans and when they fell on hard times, taught the missionaries what they could harvest from the wild for food. When a tribal member entered Mission San Carlos to be baptized, the priests tried to communicate to them that they could not leave the mission and wander the forests and fields on their own as they had done before. They became in effect vassals of the mission. They were given a new Christian name at their baptism as well. If an Indian left the mission and attempted to return to his or her village, Spanish law required the soldiers to track them down and bring them back to the Mission. When they were brought back, they were beaten and confined.

The priests baptized a number of Esselen during 1776, most of them children, and a few more in the following years. The priests allowed the children after baptism to continue to live with their parents in their village until they reached the &quot;age of reason,&quot; which was about nine years old. In 1783, the soldiers fought the Excelen and killed a few of them. The battle may have resulted from the soldiers&#x27; attempts to collect the children and force them to live at the mission. Baptisms picked up again after this date, perhaps because the Excelen saw they could not defeat the soldiers and decided they wanted to be with their children. Upon baptism the Esselen were considered to be part of a monastic order and subject to the rules of that order. This placed them, by Spanish law, under the direct authority of the padres.

The families lived in small rooms in generally unsanitary conditions. Over half the children born at a California mission died before age 4 and only about two of every ten lived to be teenagers. The girls were separated from their families at age 8 and required to sleep in a segregated, locked dormitory called the &quot;monjero&quot; (nunnery). Once they rose, they worked inside until they finished their chores around lunch time, they were allowed some time to visit their family&#x27;s homes in the mission village. Married women whose husbands were absent and widows were also required to sleep there. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.

French explorer Jean La Pérouse visited Monterey with two ships on September 14, 1786. Two days after he arrived, he visited Mission San Carlos Borromeo. In honor of his reception, the Indian neophytes were given an extra ration of food and lined up to see him. La Pérouse&#x27;s described the natives as lifeless, robbed of spirit, traumatized, and depressed. Among other things, he described severe punishments inflicted on the Indians by the friars. He thought they considered the Indians &quot;too much a child, too much a slave, too little a man.&quot; Until western contact, the native people lived in small villages of between 30 and 100 people. In 1786, there were 740 native men, women and children living in the village next to the Mission. The priests were ignorant of the cultural differences between the tribes and forced the Rumsen and Esselen Indians to live together. The two tribes were very hostile to one another and their proximity brought ongoing strife. Galaup described them as ill-fed and depressed by the strict mission routines. He said they were treated like slaves on a plantation.

From 1783 to 1785, about 40% of the Excelen were baptized. Another three Esselen were baptized at the Mission Soledad in the early 1790s, but by 1798 the majority of the Indians had been baptized. A new priest, Father Amoró, arrived in September 1804 and injected fresh energy into baptism efforts. From 1804 to 1808, 25 individuals from Excelen were baptized during these final four years. They comprised nearly 10% of the total Excelen population who were baptized. They had held out for 33 years after proselytizing began in their area. The last five baptized were all older, from 45 to 80 years. The total number of Esselen baptized is estimated to range from 790 to 856.

It may be that the older Esselen were baptized last because they were left alone and unable to support themselves after their children and grandchildren had already been coerced into living at the mission. There is some evidence that a few Esselen hid in the rugged, higher reaches of the mountains where the Spanish soldiers could not find them.

In 1795, the Spanish crown dictated that all religious instruction should be conducted in Spanish and that the native languages should be suppressed. This edict overturned the New Laws of 1542 which directed the missionaries to teach the natives in their own tongue. But the priests were still required to adhere to the third provincial council of Lima in 1583, which stated that the priests must give sermons and receive confession in the native people&#x27;s own tongue.

== Population ==
The Esselen were and are one of the least numerous indigenous people in California. The Spanish mission system led to severe decimation of the initially small Esselen population. Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California, including the Esselen, vary substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber suggested that the 1770 population for the Esselen of 500. Sherburne F. Cook raised this estimate to 750. Based on baptism records and population density, Breschini calculated that they numbered 1,185-1,285.

The Esselen are too often regarded as the first California Native American tribe to become culturally extinct, much to the frustration of current generations of Esselen people. By about 1822, much of the California Indian population in proximity to the missions had been forced into the Spanish mission system. Due to the proximity of the Esselen people to three of the Spanish missions, Mission San Carlos in Carmel, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad in Soledad, and Mission San Antonio de Padua in Jolon, the tribe was heavily impacted by their presence. The native population was decimated by disease, including measles, smallpox, and syphilis, which wiped out 90 percent of the native population, and by conscript labor, poor food, and forced assimilation. Most of the Esselen people&#x27;s villages within the current Los Padres National Forest were left largely uninhabited. Professor Sherburne Cook, an expert in Native American populations, described the causes of the population decline:

Some anthropologists and linguists assumed that the Esselen people&#x27;s culture had been virtually extinguished by as early as the 1840s. However, existing tribe members cite evidence that some Esselen were able to move beyond the reach of the Spanish soldiers, who rode on horseback, by hiding in the rugged interior of the Santa Lucia Mountains. In the 1840s, some Esselen are believed to have migrated to the ranchos and rural areas outside the growing towns. Archaeologists located the grave of a girl estimated to be about six years old buried in Isabel Meadows Cave in the Church Creek area. They calculated the date of her burial to be about 1825. Two experts received reports of Indians living in the area through the 1850s. Today, contemporary generations of Esselen trace their ancestry to Esselen who were counted in early U.S. census efforts.

In 1909, forest supervisors reported that three Indian families still lived within what was then known as the Monterey National Forest. The Encinale family of 16 members and the Quintana family with three members lived in the vicinity of The Indians (now known as Santa Lucia Memorial Park west of Ft. Hunger Liggett). The Mora family consisting of three members was living to the south along the Nacimiento-Ferguson Road.

== Federal recognition ==

About 460 individuals have identified themselves as descendants of the original Esselen people and banded together to form a tribe. The Department of the Interior has set aside of Fort Ord that the tribe can use to build a cultural center and museum. But they must first obtain federal recognition. They have been assisted by Alan Leventhal, a lecturer and volunteer at San Jose State University, and Dr. Les Field of the University of New Mexico, who have helped establish the tribe&#x27;s cultural identity.

The tribe was briefly formally identified in 1883 as a tribe by Indian Affairs agent Helen Hunt Jackson. It was also identified on official Indian census rolls, maps, and in a land-rights petition sent to President Theodore Roosevelt. But in 1899, anthropologist Alfred Kroeber declared that the tribe was extinct because most tribal members had intermarried, taken Spanish names, and converted to Catholicism. Kroeber wrote in 1925:

In 1955, Kroeber decided he had made a mistake and tried to persuade the BIA, but the agency refused to listen to his arguments or accept his evidence.

In 1927, the superintendent of the Sacramento agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs listed California tribes that should be given land rights, but he excluded the Esselen along over 135 other tribes from the list. A tribal member and researcher has identified more than 100 individual Esselen who were living in Monterey County in 1923 while the group was still federally recognized. The tribe says their exclusion as a recognized tribe was a mistake that should be rectified.

Many anthropologists believed that the Costanoan-speaking people encompassed a geographical area from north of San Francisco to Monterey. The name Costanoan is derived from a generic name Costaños (&#x27;coast-men) applied by the Spanish to all native people on the coast. It was later corrupted as Costanoan in the English language. As a result of the 1928 California Indian Jurisdictional Act enrollment, almost every Bureau of Indian Affairs &quot;enrollee&quot; of Esselen descent was categorized as Costanoan by the agency.

In 2010 the Esselen Nation petitioned the federal government for recognition as a tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs says the tribe does not meet the formal criteria used to recognize a tribe.

== Tribal land ==

In the 20th century, Axel Adler built a cabin on the former Bixby Ranch and gradually acquired more land. In 2013, descendants of the Adler family who lived in Sweden put of the Adler Ranch on the market for $15 million. It is located at the end and south of Palo Colorado Road. The ranch is located along the Little Sur River at the northwestern edge of the Ventana Wilderness adjacent to the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District&#x27;s Mill Creek Redwood Preserve and the Los Padres National Forest, and includes the peak of Bixby Mountain and the upper portions of Mescal Ridge. The El Sur Ranch and Pico Blanco Mountain are to the south. The tract contains old-growth redwoods, grasslands, oak woodlands, chaparral, and madrone forest. The ranch is an important habitat for California spotted owls, California condors, California red-legged frogs, marbled murrelets, and bald and golden eagles. The property is especially valuable because it includes nine legal parcels, five of which could be developed. The Big Sur Land Trust stated it was not interested in acquiring the property.

The nonprofit Western Rivers Conservancy, which buys land with the goal to protect habitat and provide public access, secured a purchase agreement. It was initially interested in selling the land to the US Forest Service, which would make it possible for hikers to travel from Bottchers Gap to the sea. But some local residents were opposed to the forest service acquiring the land. They are concerned about a lack of federal funding to maintain a critical fire break on the land.

On October 2, 2019, the California Natural Resources Agency announced it was seeking funding through Proposition 68, a bond measure approved by voters in 2018, to obtain the land for the tribe. The Adler family agreed to sell of the Adler Ranch. The land was purchased through a $4.52 million grant from the California Natural Resources Agency. In late July 2020 the purchase of the Adler Ranch successfully closed and the property was transferred to the Esselen tribe. The land acquisition could help facilitate federal recognition of the tribe.

&quot;It is beyond words for us, the highest honor,&quot; said Tom Little Bear Nason, chairman of the Esselen Tribe of Monterey County. &quot;The land is the most important thing to us. It is our homeland, the creation story of our lives. We are so elated and grateful.&quot; The Esselen tribe has 214 members and intends to share it with other Central Coast tribes such as the Ohlone, the , and the Rumsen people who also were decimated during the Mission Era

== In popular culture ==

The Esalen Institute in Big Sur is named after this tribe as was the former Boy Scouts of America Monterey Bay Area Council Order of the Arrow Esselen Lodge #531.

<text>The KATV tower was a -tall television mast (or antenna tower) built in 1965, which was located in Barraque Township, Arkansas, off of Arkansas Highway 365 (at ). At the time of its completion, it was the third-tallest human-made structure and second-tallest broadcast tower in the world (behind the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota), and the tallest structure in Arkansas. , the tower was tied with 15 other 2000-foot masts, all built after it, as the fifth-tallest structure in the world (sixth, counting the submerged Petronius oil platform).

In addition to the analog and digital transmitters of its namesake, Little Rock ABC affiliate KATV (channel 7), it also hosted the analog transmitter of KETS (channel 2), the Little Rock flagship station of Arkansas PBS.

==History==
In June 1964, KATV Inc. received approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a broadcast tower at a site west-southwest of Redfield. The location of the tower was chosen as a compromise between the station and Pine Bluff&#x27;s city government and chamber of commerce, amid a dispute over an earlier proposal filed with the FCC in 1962 to move KATV&#x27;s transmitter facilities from its existing tower near Jefferson to a new tower atop Shinall Mountain, near Little Rock&#x27;s Chenal Valley neighborhood (approximately northwest of the existing transmitter site), which the FCC denied in January 1964. KATV—which was originally assigned to Pine Bluff, where it began operations in December 1954—had been operating a secondary studio in Little Rock (in addition to its original Pine Bluff studio) since 1955 and changed its city of license to Little Rock in 1958; in proposing to relocate its transmitter to neighboring Pulaski County, Pine Bluff city officials had accused KATV management of not complying with a 1961 agreement with the city that conditioned continued service to Pine Bluff (including maintaining transmitter facilities in Jefferson County, referencing the city in station IDs, and continuing public service efforts in the city).

The tower was activated on September 12, 1965. KATV agreed to lease space on the tower to the Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC) for a nominal annual fee to house the transmitter of educational station KETS (channel 2). KETS began transmitting from the tower when it signed on in April 1966, initially transmitting using equipment borrowed from the former Jefferson tower. The tower was considered as a prominent local landmark and served as the approximate halfway marker for travelers driving between Little Rock and Pine Bluff.

===Collapse===
On January 11, 2008, at 12:46 p.m. Central Time (1846 UTC), the tower collapsed. Although the exact cause of the collapse remains unknown, at the time, in an effort to improve its structural condition, engineering crews with McLean, Virginia-based Structural Systems Technology, Inc. (SST) were replacing older guy wire cables on the eighth and ninth levels of the tower. Engineers with the firm claimed that as they were loosening one of the large cables that kept the structure in place on the ninth level, the tower suddenly began to shake and then collapsed; the structure broke into three segments as it came crashing down, which was what it was designed to do. No serious injuries occurred, although a maintenance worker on-scene sustained minor injuries.

The collapse destroyed the analog transmitters of KATV and KETS, and the digital transmitter of KATV. Both stations remained available on Comcast&#x27;s Little Rock-area systems and, in the case of KETS, Conway Corporation&#x27;s cable system via direct feeds from their respective studio facilities. Comcast relayed the direct feed of KATV&#x27;s high definition signal, which was initially interrupted, to other Central Arkansas cable systems, DirecTV and Dish Network, which had lost access to the station&#x27;s off-air signal; some area cable providers that received the KETS analog feed were able to switch to its digital signal, although some smaller cable systems within its viewing area lost access to PBS programming from the Arkansas Educational Television Network (AETN) completely until KETS resumed analog broadcasts. KATV subsequently restored broadcast service later that week with the assistance of Little Rock-based Equity Media Holdings, which agreed to relay its digital signal on the third subchannel of MyNetworkTV affiliate KWBF-TV (channel 42, now KARZ-TV). KATV restored its analog signal on January 21 from an auxiliary tower on Shinall Mountain, which CBS affiliate KTHV (channel 11) loaned to KATV to set up a temporary analog transmitter. Despite the logistical and economical difficulties of restoring analog broadcasts with about one year until the original digital television transition deadline, on January 14, the AETC announced it would set up temporary analog facilities for KETS on an auxiliary antenna of the adjacent Clear Channel Broadcasting Tower, where the station&#x27;s digital signal transmitted since it signed on in 2004; KETS resumed analog broadcasts on the Clear Channel tower—which also housed the analog and digital transmitters of Pine Bluff-licensed CW affiliate KASN (channel 38)—on June 13.

KATV chose not to rebuild at Redfield and instead built a new tower on Shinall Mountain (at ), where the majority of Little Rock&#x27;s other major-network affiliates (including KTHV, KARZ, KARK-TV and KLRT-TV) were already located, along with KATV&#x27;s temporary analog transmitter (on KTHV&#x27;s backup tower) and digital signal (via the KARZ subchannel). Though the Shinall Mountain tower—which was completed in February 2009—is shorter (as KATV management suggested that tower heights comparable to the former KATV mast were thought to be obsolete, even though communications towers at or above that height had been constructed over the previous decade), the mountain&#x27;s higher elevation raises KATV&#x27;s antenna to a similar overall height.

On December 22, 2008, then-Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel (filing on behalf of KATV and AETN) and the tower&#x27;s insurer, Boston-based OneBeacon America Insurance Co.—which paid KATV and then-owner Allbritton Communications $4 million in liabilities for the tower damage—each filed lawsuits against Structural Systems Technology with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas for unspecified damages and litigation costs. The suit alleged multiple complaints of negligence, breach of contract and fraud, stating that SST failed to provide oversight of its engineers and safely supervise its workers during the guy cable replacement.

<text>China International Trust and Investment (CITIC) Plaza () is an 80-storey, office skyscraper in the Tianhe District of Guangzhou, Guangdong, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its structural height includes two antenna-like spires on the top. Completed in June 1997, it was the tallest concrete building in the world until the completion of the Trump Tower Chicago, and the tallest in China. As of March 2025, it ranks as the 23rd-tallest building in China, 30th-tallest in Asia, and 45th-tallest worldwide.

Located in the growing and expanding Tianhe District, it is part of a complex of the same name which also consists of two 38-storey residential buildings. Its proximity includes a new train station which serves the extremely busy Guangzhou-Shenzhen and Guangzhou-Hong Kong railways. A new metro station, and the Tianhe Sports Center, where the 6th National Games and parts of the 2010 Asian Games were held. It is on the same Axis as two new building developments in Guangzhou, the first being the East and West Towers in Zhujiang New City and the Pearl Observation tower. It is surrounded by other tall buildings and is a symbol of Guangzhou&#x27;s growing wealth and importance.

<doc id="589348" wikidata="Q2253484" url="?curid=589348" title="Homosexual panic">
<text>&quot;Homosexual panic&quot; is a term coined by American psychiatrist Edward J. Kempf in 1920 for a condition of &quot;panic due to the pressure of uncontrollable perverse sexual cravings&quot;. Kempf classified this condition as an acute dissociative disorder, meaning that it involved a disruption in typical perception and memory functions of an individual. In the psychiatrist&#x27;s honour, the condition has come to also be known as &quot;Kempf&#x27;s disease&quot;. Although homosexuality itself was removed from the APA&#x27;s DSM in 1973, some form of homosexual panic was retained in the manual until the release of DSM-V in 2013.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In his case studies, Kempf recorded a variety of symptoms that his patients presented with. Psychotic symptoms included hallucinations and delusions, especially those of persecution. Kempf cites Case PD-14, who insisted he had been framed for his behavior and accused his shipmates of conspiring to harm or kill him. Somatic symptoms were also common, including dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In 1959, author Burton Glick documented mood-related symptoms, such as self-punishment, suicidal ideation, social withdrawal, and feelings of helplessness. Glick noted that patients appeared passive, and demonstrated an &quot;inability to be aggressive&quot;. Ultimately, patients became &quot;unable to function at all&quot;. Both Glick and Kempf emphasize their patients&#x27; lack of aggression towards homosexual individuals.
In a study of college-aged men, Henry Harper Hall found that men who exhibited symptoms in line with homosexual panic never acted out towards homosexual individuals; instead, they blamed themselves for their own cravings. Kempf noted that the difference between patients who fared well after their diagnoses and those who did not was the patient&#x27;s successful &quot;transference&quot; of such homosexual cravings. If a patient was able to transfer these impulses towards another, more socially appropriate target, the patient would begin to feel less inferior and would thus recover.

== Cause ==
Spending copious amounts of time with members of the same sex in a confined or limited atmosphere was cited by Kempf as a possible reason for the onset of the disease. Environments where this might occur included but were not limited to army camps, ships, monasteries, schools, asylums, and prisons. Kempf asserted that individuals in these environments who had recently or were currently undergoing stress (due to fatigue, sickness, loss of a love interest, etc.) were more likely to have weak egos. According to the Freudian theory of psychoanalysis, the ego is the part of an individual&#x27;s mind that mediates between the primitive unconscious and reality. When in such a position, affected individuals would become &quot;eccentric and irritable&quot;, tending to feel inferior and weak amongst their companions.

It is important to note that the onset of this condition was not attributed to unwanted homosexual advances. Rather, Kempf stated that it was caused by the individual&#x27;s own &quot;aroused homosexual cravings&quot;. The individual&#x27;s homosexual feelings as a cause of their symptoms was what differentiated this diagnosis from any other stress-related disorder.

== Diagnosis ==
=== Differential diagnosis ===
Homosexual panic disorder is a separate diagnosis from acute aggression panic disorder. Glick notes that the difference is explained by differing instinctual drives that motivate each disorder. Patients whose primary motivation is a sexual one are experiencing homosexual panic, whereas patients whose motivation is primarily aggression are experiencing acute aggression panic disorder. As stated above, both Glick and Kempf noted in their accounts of patients that those with homosexual panic disorder were not aggressive toward others. Also in concordance with this, Hart&#x27;s study concluded that those individuals with homosexual panic who chose to satisfy homosexual urges experienced relief from their symptoms.

== History ==
Kempf identified the condition after completing 19 case studies during and after World War I at St. Elizabeths Hospital, a government mental institution in Washington, D.C. The case studies lasted months in some cases, and consisted of extensive unstructured patient interviews. Kempf would, over the course of multiple sessions, investigate the personal history of the patient and the events that led up to hospitalization in order to diagnose them with homosexual panic. Among the cases described by Kempf is a &quot;physician ... who later became a brilliant philologist&quot;, born in Ceylon in 1834 to missionary parents, and graduating from Yale Medical School before serving as an army surgeon—an apparent reference to William Chester Minor.

The disorder was included in Appendix C of the DSM-I as a supplementary term, which are terms that may be added on to an existing diagnosis to further explain the patient&#x27;s condition. In order for mental health professionals to apply a diagnosis to a patient, the diagnosis must appear in the current edition of the DSM. The disorder has not appeared in any subsequent editions of the DSM, and thus is not considered a diagnosable condition.

Although homosexuality was removed from the DSM in 1973, the retaining of &quot;sexual orientation disturbance&quot; as a mental disorder lead to legal protection of discrimination. The New York Times, for example, made a psychological exam a requirement for employment - requiring applicants on penalty of perjury to disclose their sexuality. In one case, editor Abe Rosenthal claimed to want to hire a gay journalist, but the newspaper&#x27;s staff doctor came into his office stating: &quot;you can&#x27;t hire this man. He&#x27;s a homosexual.&quot; Rosenthal replied that he already knew, to which the doctor responded, &quot;But don&#x27;t you know that homosexuals are susceptible to homosexual rage?&quot; Thus, it was through psychiatry homosexuals continued to be banned from employment.

== Legal defense ==
Homosexual panic as a mental health disorder is distinct from the victim blaming homosexual panic defense (HPD) (also known as the gay panic defense) within the legal system. Whereas homosexual panic disorder was at one point considered a diagnosable medical condition, the HPD implies only a temporary loss of self-control. The HPD is used to reduce the sentence against the perpetrator of assault or murder of a homosexual individual. In the US trial for the murder of Larry King, the HPD was used by defendant Brandon McInerny, who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

Between 2003 and 2017, both Australia (except South Australia) and New Zealand removed the defense. In September 2014, California became the first state to abolish the HPD in the USA.

== Attitudes about homosexuality ==
The absence of homosexual panic from the DSM-5 reflects changing societal attitudes toward homosexuality. Homosexuality as a mental disorder was removed from the DSM in 1973, a significant event in LGBT history. In 2013, 60% of Americans agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society: an increase from 49% of Americans in 2007. Changing attitudes toward homosexuality have been influenced by LGBT movements in the United States.

<text>Shun Hing Square (), also known as &quot;Di Wang Tower&quot; () is a -tall skyscraper in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China. Upon its completion in 1996, it became the tallest building in China, until being surpassed by CITIC Plaza in the next year.

==Background==
The building was built at a pace of four floors in nine days. The main tower contains office space, a car park and a 5-story shopping arcade complex with four sets of escalators, five passenger elevators and two service elevators, and a floor area ranging from 3450 m2 to 4900 m2. On the top floor (69th floor) is the &quot;Meridian View Center,&quot; an observation deck.
Its common nickname, &quot;Diwang Building&quot; derives from the auction price for the piece of land it stands being the most expensive in Shenzhen at the time. 24,500 tonnes of steel were used in construction.

==Records held==
As of April 2023, the building is 
* The fifth tallest in Shenzhen
* 25th tallest building in mainland China
* 49th tallest in the world
* The tallest building in the world with fewer than 70 floors 
* The tallest all-steel building in China. 
* The tallest building in China from 1996 to the completion of CITIC Plaza in Guangzhou in 1997.
* The first skyscraper in China to be one of the ten tallest in the world (Bank of China Tower and Central Plaza, of Hong Kong, were constructed and topped out while Hong Kong was still under British sovereignty). 
* The first in China to reach .
* Tallest building constructed in Shenzhen in the 1990s.
* Tallest building in Shenzhen from 1996 to September 2011 until surpassed by the nearby Kingkey 100.

<text>Robert Grant Aitken (December 31, 1864 – October 29, 1951) was an American astronomer.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Grant Aitken was born in Jackson, California, to Scottish immigrant Robert Aitken and Wilhelmina Depinau. Aitken attended Williams College in Massachusetts and graduated with an undergraduate degree in 1887.

== Career ==
From 1887–1891, he worked as a mathematics instructor at Livermore, California, then received his M.A. from Williams College in 1892. He became a professor of mathematics at the College of the Pacific, another liberal arts school. He was offered an assistant astronomer position at Lick Observatory in California in 1895.

He began a systematically study of double stars, measuring their positions and calculating their orbits around one another. From 1899, in collaboration with W. J. Hussey, he methodically created a very large catalog of such stars. This ongoing work was published in Lick Observatory bulletins. In 1905, Hussey left and Aitken pressed on with the survey alone, and by 1915, he had discovered roughly 3,100 new binary stars, in addition to the 1,300 discovered by Hussey. The results were published in 1932 and entitled &quot;New General Catalogue of Double Stars Within 120° of the North Pole&quot;, with the orbit information enabling astronomers to calculate stellar mass statistics for a large number of stars. For his work in cataloguing binary stars, he was awarded the prestigious Bruce Medal in 1926.

During his career, Aitken measured positions and computed orbits for comets and natural satellites of planets. In 1908 he joined an eclipse expedition to Flint Island in the central Pacific Ocean. His book &quot;Binary Stars&quot; was published in 1918, with a second edition published in 1935.

After joining the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1894, Aitken was elected to serve as president in 1899 and 1915 of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. From 1898 to 1942, Aitken was an editor of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. In 1932, he delivered the Darwin Lecture before the Royal Astronomical Society, where he was an associate member. From 1918 to 1928, he was chair of the double star committee for the International Astronomical Union.

== Personal life ==
Aitken was partly deaf and used a hearing aid. He married Jessie Thomas around 1888; they had three sons and one daughter. Jessie died in 1943. Their son Robert Thomas Aitken was an anthropologist who studied Pacific island cultures. Their grandson, Robert Baker Aitken, was a widely known Zen Buddhist teacher and author. Their granddaughter Marjorie J. Vold was a noted chemist specializing in colloids.

<text>Sir David Gill (12 June 1843 – 24 January 1914) was a Scottish astronomer who is known for measuring astronomical distances, for astrophotography and geodesy. He spent much of his career in South Africa.

== Life and work ==

David Gill was born at 48 Skene Terrace in Aberdeen the son of David Gill, watchmaker and his wife Margaret Mitchell. He was educated first at Bellevue Academy in Aberdeen then at Dollar Academy. He spent two years at Aberdeen University, where he was taught by James Clerk Maxwell, and then joined his father&#x27;s clock-making business. His most important influence at university was probably from Prof David Thomson. In 1863 they jointly repaired the university clock and both set up a new mechanical telescope at the Cromwell Tower Observatory. This was his introduction to astronomy.

It would seem that Gill&#x27;s interests lay elsewhere since after a few years he sold the business, and then spent time equipping Lord Lindsay&#x27;s private observatory at Dun Echt, Aberdeenshire. In 1874, Gill joined the expedition to Mauritius to observe the transit of Venus. Three years later he went to Ascension Island to observe a near approach of Mars and to calculate its distance. While carrying out these laborious calculations, he was notified of his appointment to the Cape Observatory, which, over the following 27 years he was to refurbish completely, turning it into a first-rate institution. Gill was a meticulous observer and had a flair for getting the best out of his instruments. His solar parallax observations with a heliometer and his calculations of distances to the nearer stars, are testimony to his outstanding work. He recruited Robert Innes to the Cape Observatory.

Gill used the parallax of Mars to determine the distance to the Sun, and also measured distances to the stars. He perfected the use of the heliometer. He was Her Majesty&#x27;s Astronomer at the Royal Observatory at Cape of Good Hope from 1879 to 1906. He was a pioneer in the use of astrophotography, making the first photograph of the Great Comet of 1882, and one of the early proponents of the &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project.

The invention of dry plate photography by Richard Leach Maddox made Gill realise that the process could be used to create images of the stars and to more easily determine their relative positions and brightness. This led to a massive project in collaboration with the Dutch astronomer J.C. Kapteyn, and the compiling of an index of brightness and position for some half a million southern stars. The work was published as &quot;Cape Photographic Durchmusterung&quot; in 3 volumes between 1896 and 1900. Gill also played a leading role in the organising of the &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot;, an ambitious international venture aimed at mapping the entire sky. He initiated the idea of a geodetic survey along the 30th meridian east stretching from South Africa to Norway, resulting in the longest meridian arc yet measured on Earth (see arc measurement).

His concern with measurement led to him becoming a member of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) from 1907 - 1914. As president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he gave a presidential address in 1907 in which he advocated definitions based on fundamental physical properties, rather than on arbitrary standards such as a rod of metal with lines ruled upon it to mark the yard or metre. 

Gill married Isobel Black in 1870, and she accompanied him to Ascension Island for his Mars observations. On Gill&#x27;s retirement in 1906, the couple moved to London, where Gill served for two years (1909–1911) as president of the Royal Astronomical Society before his death in 1914. 

He was buried with his wife, Isobel Sarah Gill, in the grounds of St Machar&#x27;s Cathedral, Aberdeen. The grave lies on the east outer wall of the church.

<doc id="589397" wikidata="Q7995149" url="?curid=589397" title="White Oak River">
<text>The White Oak River is a blackwater river, close to 48 mi (77 km) long, on the coastal plain of southeast North Carolina in the United States. It empties in the Atlantic Ocean.

==Course==
It rises in the White Oak Pocosin in northern Onslow County and southern Jones County approximately 15 mi (24 km) north of Jacksonville. It flows east, then SSE, along the border between Onslow, Jones and Carteret counties, and forming the western boundary of Croatan National Forest. The lower 10 mi (16 km) of the river is a tidal estuary, approximately 1.6 km wide. It enters the Atlantic at Bogue Sound, then passes between two barrier islands (Bogue Banks and Bear Island) through Bogue Inlet into the open Atlantic at Onslow Bay.

==Habitat==
The White Oak River runs through a variety of habitats including swamps, hardwood forests, and salt marsh flats. A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around the river and its smaller river feeders. These creeks provide safe havens for many small animals such as, fish, snakes, frogs and many more animal as well as plant life. Along the river, there are reports of bald cypress trees over one thousand years of age. Many alligators can be found along the river. 

In 2016, scientists from Uppsala University reported a new class of archaean microbes with rare chemosynthetic properties, &quot;Hadesarchaea&quot;, living in hot, low-oxygen environments near White Oak River. In the same year, a University of Texas-led team discovered a new archaen phylum, &quot;Thorarchaeota&quot;, from samples taken from the White Oak River estuary.

<doc id="589401" wikidata="Q1757893" url="?curid=589401" title="Bulbospongiosus muscle">
<text>The bulbospongiosus muscles (in older texts bulbocavernosus and, for female muscle, constrictor cunni) are a subgroup of the superficial muscles of the perineum. They have a slightly different origin, insertion and function in males and females. In males, these muscles cover the bulb of the penis, while in females, they cover the vestibular bulbs.

In both sexes, they are innervated by the deep or muscular branch of the perineal nerve, which is a branch of the pudendal nerve.

==Structure==
In males, the bulbospongiosus is located in the middle line of the perineum, in front of the anus. It consists of two symmetrical parts, united along the median line by a tendinous perineal raphe. It arises from the central tendinous point of the perineum and from the median perineal raphe in front.

In females, there is no union, nor a tendinous perineal raphe; the parts are disjoint primarily and arise from the same central tendinous point of the perineum, which is the tendon that is formed at the point where the bulbospongiosus muscle, superficial transverse perineal muscle, and external anal sphincter muscle converge to form this major supportive structure of vagina and other organs, and from the clitoris in front.

===Fibers===
Its fibers diverge; the most posterior form a thin layer, which is lost on the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm; the middle fibers encircle the bulb and adjacent parts, of the corpus cavernosum urethrae, and join with the fibers of the opposite side, on the upper part of the corpus cavernosum urethrae, in a strong aponeurosis; the anterior fibers, spread out over the side of the corpus cavernosum penis, to be inserted partly into that body, anterior to the ischiocavernosus, occasionally extending to the pubis, and partly ending in a tendinous expansion which covers the dorsal vessels of the penis.

The latter fibers are best seen by dividing the muscle longitudinally, and reflecting it from the surface of the corpus cavernosum urethra.

==Function==
In males, it contributes to erection, the contractions of orgasm and ejaculation. In females, it contributes to clitoral erection and the contractions of orgasm, and closes the vagina.

This muscle serves to empty the canal of the urethra, after the bladder has expelled its contents; during the greater part of the act of urination its fibers are relaxed, and it only comes into action at the end of the process.

The middle fibers are supposed by Krause to assist in the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compressing the erectile tissue of the bulb.

The anterior fibers also contribute to the erection of the penis by compressing the deep dorsal vein of the penis as they are inserted into, and continuous with, the fascia of the penis.

<text>The McGillicuddy Serious Party (McGSP) was a satirical political party or joke party in New Zealand in the late 20th century. Between 1984 and 1999, it stood candidates in elections - one purpose being to make the political process more entertaining. The party&#x27;s logo, the head of a medieval court jester, indicated the intention to critique current systems by poking fun at them.

The party stood candidates in the 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1999 general elections and the 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995 and 1998 Local Body elections; along with local-body and parliamentary by-elections and university student association elections.

It gained its highest number of votes in the last first-past-the-post (FPP) general election in 1993, when it stood candidates in 62 out of 99 electorates and received 11,714 votes, 0.61% of the vote.

== Origins ==
The party was formed in 1984 in Hamilton as the political arm of Clan McGillicuddy (established in 1978). Members of the Clan had stood as candidates in the 1983 local-body elections in the Waikato, and the party came together in time to contest the 1984 General Election. It had a strong Scottish theme, with the renaissance of a Jacobite monarchy being one of the party&#x27;s main policy planks. Candidates included street performers, students, artists and members of musical groups such as the Big Muffin Serious Band.

== Policies ==

The party selected its policies on the basis of their absurdity, but also how they tied into an over-arching grand plan. The features of this plan were: Funism (a doctrine of the most fun for the most people), The Great Leap Backwards (returning NZ to a medieval, subsistence, tribal economy) and replacing parliament with a McGillicuddy-style monarchy based on Jacobitism: a non-hereditary monarch would be appointed in a similar manner to that used to determine the Dalai Lama. The high number of NZers with (some) Scottish heritage was the reason given for creating a Jacobite renaissance in the south Pacific. As time went on some McGillicuddies were influenced by Situationism. Another McGSP guiding principle was to do &quot;Politics as Art and Art as Politics&quot;. MCGSP candidates, rallies and publicity stunts were characterised by the use of costume, hand-made props, live music and/or performance art.

Policies included:

*Free dung
*Sending out intelligence agents around the world to wipe New Zealand off published maps, thus ensuring that no-one could invade the country.
*Standing a dog for parliament in the Hobson seat in Northland. Her policies included the abolition of cars, and turning a meat-works into an organic flea-powder factory.
*The abolition of money, replacing it with chocolate fish or with sand.
*The demolition of The Beehive, parliament buildings, and all other buildings on a last-up, first-down basis.
*The diversion of aluminium production away from building US military aircraft and missiles to build giant space-mirrors to melt the polar icecaps and destroy all of the foolish greed-worshipping cities of man in one stroke, thereby returning man to the sea, which he should never have left in the first place (this the inspiration of the Admiral of the Highland Navy Aaron Franklin).
*Raising the school leaving-age to 65 (after Parliament raised the school leaving-age by one unambitious year)
*Full unemployment, or full employment through slavery
*Using beer as a National Defence strategy: leaving bottles of beer on all beaches, so that any invading army would abandon its attack and get drunk while the broken bottles would prevent the army advancing any further.
*Restricting the vote to minors: i.e., ONLY those under 18 years of age could vote (announced when Parliament lowered the voting age to 18 years). The party ran its 1993 electoral advertisements during children&#x27;s programming.
*Student loans for Plunket Society (or Kindergarten) attendance: prior to the 1984 election, David Lange&#x27;s Labour Party promised to maintain free tertiary education, but the Education Minister, Phil Goff, introduced student fees when elected. National Party education spokesman Lockwood Smith promised a return to free education if elected, but did not carry out this promise. Most party supporters, many of them students, felt displeased that both major political parties had deemed free tertiary education unsustainable, but had deliberately lied about their intentions to attract votes.
*Abandoning male suffrage: New Zealand, the first nation to achieve women&#x27;s suffrage (in 1893), made a big deal of the centenary of this at the time of the 1993 election.
*Votes for trees: New Zealanders have a reputation as environmentalists, and the University of Auckland&#x27;s ex-Marxist law lecturer Klaus Bosselmann seriously advocated giving trees (and other bits of the environment) some legal standing. The party could not decide on whether native trees should have the option to vote in Māori electorates, whether male trees as well as female trees should vote, and on the status of shrubs.
*The demolition of the Auckland CBD to create a giant sundial, using the Sky Tower as the gnomon; or to protect the Sky Tower by placing a condom over it.
*Replacing the Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps with Mounted Knights, claimed as more modern. The New Zealand Army&#x27;s outdated equipment became a constant source of quips and embarrassment in the 1990s—at the time Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Mounted Rifles operated FV101 Scorpions and M-113s.
*Building dreadnoughts in the Tamaki Estuary: a reference to the Royal New Zealand Navy&#x27;s controversial purchase of Anzac class frigates.
*An All Whites victory in the Football World Cup: both the Labour Party and the National Party used the All Blacks&#x27; victory in the 1987 Rugby World Cup in their 1990 campaigning—the All Whites stood about as much chance of winning the Football World Cup as Brazil have of winning the Rugby version.
*An indecent society: Jim Bolger&#x27;s National Party used the slogan &quot;A Decent Society&quot;.
*A potato famine: Jim Bolger&#x27;s somewhat pock-marked countenance bore an unfortunate resemblance to a potato. Much to his displeasure, he became widely known as &quot;Spud&quot;; the Royal New Zealand Air Force, with a typically Kiwi lack of reverence, christened his Boeing 727 &quot;Spud One&quot;.
*Limiting the speed of light to 100 km/h: 50 km/h in Mt Roskill, (Auckland&#x27;s Bible Belt), because folks there preferred to stay less enlightened.
*Linking the North Island and South Island by bulldozing the Southern Alps into Cook Strait.
*Post-natal abortion: making abortion illegal, but any mother could kill her child up to the age of 18, provided she did it with her own hands. The party designed this policy to offend all sides in the abortion debate. The fundamentalist Christian Heritage Party used abortion as a major policy.
*Mandatory homosexuality for 33% of the population—also devised to annoy the fundamentalists.
*Free castration
*Setting up a Frivolous Fraud Office to investigate any fraud deemed too silly for the Serious Fraud Office
*Air bags for the New Zealand Stock Exchange (following the 1987 stock market crash)
*Replacing the Queen&#x27;s chain with hemp: the Labour Party had a policy of protecting and extending the Queen&#x27;s chain (publicly accessible land bordering watercourses), forcing farmers and iwi to allow public access to waterways. Candidate Dominic Worthington proposed replacing the chain with more environmentally sound hemp; with the Queen, of course, replaced by Prince Geoffie the reluctant. Rather than limiting the chain to protecting water in aqueous form, the King&#x27;s hemp would also serve to hold together water in solid form, as in the ice in glaciers and in the Ross Dependency (in particular, the Ross Ice Shelf, alleviating environmentalists&#x27; concerns that the ice shelf might collapse and raise sea-levels). Ultimately, the policy envisaged that technology would regress far enough for it to become feasible to lasso water in gaseous form (i.e. clouds).
*Fixing accountants in concrete and using them as traffic barriers, occasionally accompanied by a pledge to steal some of the Monster Raving Loony Party&#x27;s other policies as well—possibly a reference to political parties accusing each other of stealing policies, or possibly just silliness.
*Good weather (but only if voters behaved).
*Full employment by carpeting the national highways: this would also save wear and tear on tyres
*Breaking its promises
Note: not all of the above were party-wide policies outlined in manifestoes - candidates had creative licence to come up with their own policies.

== Peak and Decline ==
The party attracted a surprising level of support, and became one of the larger parties outside parliament. On a number of occasions, particularly following the introduction of the mixed member proportional (MMP) electoral system, pundits predicted that the party might actually win parliamentary representation, but this never happened. When the major parties boycotted the Tauranga by-election 1993 in 1993, the party&#x27;s candidate Greg Pittams, who appeared in nationwide newspapers during this campaign wearing his &quot;emperor&#x27;s new kilt&quot; outfit, consisting of only a shirt and sporran, finished second to Winston Peters. Votes for the party presumably most often represented protest votes, something that the party encouraged with one of its slogans: &quot;If you want to waste your vote, vote for us.&quot;

In the 1996 general election, the party put up 65 list candidates; 45 candidates stood as an electorate candidate.

The introduction of MMP Mixed Member Proportional representation at the 1996 election changed the political landscape: there were more smaller parties to vote for with more of a chance of getting into Parliament. The McGSP percentage of the vote fell. The 1999 election campaign proved a disappointment. The party gained only 0.15% of the vote, a considerable drop. In addition to this, the increased reporting required from small parties under MMP changed the &#x27;work to fun ratio&#x27; of taking part in elections.

== Disbandment and deregistration ==
Shortly after the 1999 election, the party disbanded and the Electoral Commission officially deregistered it as a political party. Party leader Graeme Cairns marked the event and did penance for the loss by placing himself in stocks in Garden Place in Hamilton in December 1999 as disgruntled party members pelted him with rotten fruit.

== McGillicuddy candidates ==
A number of former members went on to stand as candidates for &quot;real&quot; parties. Former MP and co-leader of the Green party, Metiria Turei, formerly held party membership, and was number 27 on the party list for the 1999 General Election.

Other prominent candidates from this first generation of electioneering included founder and Party Leader Graeme Cairns, the &quot;Laird of Hamilton&quot;; Mark Servian; KT Julian, a long-time Party Deputy Leader; Adrian Holroyd; Cecil G. Murgatroyd (who subsequently stood against Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke under the Imperial British Conservative Party banner); Sam Buchanan; Steve Richards; Donna Demente; and Penni Bousfield.

== Younger pretenders ==
Some of the party&#x27;s members became upset at the cancellation of their lifetime membership. In July 2005 a &quot;McGillicuddy Serious Party&quot; put out a press-release announcing plans to participate in the 2005 election, one initial policy involving replacing MPs with harmless jargon-generators.

One candidate stood under the McGillicuddy Serious banner in the 2008 general election: Steve Richards contested the West Coast-Tasman electorate and received 259 votes.

== Current status ==
Despite the demise of the party, Clan McGillicuddy continued to hold regular public events for some time. A pacifist battle in Oamaru on 31 December 2007 saw McGillicuddy &quot;Martians&quot; take on Alf&#x27;s Imperial Army in an enactment of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. YouTube hosts a video of this battle. On 31 December 2013, there was a pacifist battle in Waitati in which the McGillicuddies defended Castle Almond (the castle-like home of one their members) against an &quot;attack&quot; by the local Waitati Militia.

<doc id="589422" wikidata="Q620462" url="?curid=589422" title="Thanatology">
<text>Thanatology is the scientific study of death and the losses brought about as a result. It investigates the mechanisms and forensic aspects of death, such as bodily changes that accompany death and the postmortem period, as well as wider psychological and social aspects related to death. It is primarily an interdisciplinary study offered as a course of study at numerous colleges and universities.

The word is derived from the Greek language. In Greek mythology, Thanatos (: &quot;death&quot;) is the personification of death. The English suffix &quot;-ology&quot; derives from the Greek suffix &quot;-logia&quot; (: &quot;speaking&quot;).

== History ==
Russian scientist Élie Metchnikoff pioneered the field of thanatology and was famous for his work in microbiology and the discovery of phagocytosis &quot;Phagocytosis is the process by which a celloften a phagocyte or protistengulfs a solid particle to form an internal compartment known as a phagosome.&quot; In 1903, he established a scientific discipline devoted to the study of death. He argued that those who were dying had few or no resources for the experience of dying and that an academic study would help those facing death to have a better understanding of the phenomenon and reduce their fear of it.

Metchnikoff based his ideas for an interdisciplinary study on the fact that while medical students had their obligatory encounters with cadavers through anatomical studies, there was almost no instruction on how to care for the dying, nor was there any research into death included in the curriculum. Because few scholars and educators agreed with Metchnikoff, the support he needed for the realization of his suggestion did not materialize for decades.

Metchnikoff chose to focus on two new areas of study, gerontology and thanatology. Contrary to gerontology, it took about 47 years for most people to accept thanatology as a science. Therefore, the science of thanatology is fairly new for the most part. The altered viewpoints people developed when it came to viewing and coping with death was one reason that thanatology became more accepted across societies.

Thanatology arose with the &#x27;Death with Dignity&#x27; movement of the early 1970s as an interdisciplinary category for the study of death. The Death with Dignity movement advocates for patients with a terminal illness to have a choice within a medical and legal framework to intentionally end their life.

Following World War II, the world was haunted with the memories of the many casualties. During this period of reflection, many existential philosophers began considering life-and-death issues. One in particular was Herman Feifel, an American psychologist who is considered the pioneer of the modern death movement. Feifel broke the taboo on discussions of death and dying with the publication of his book &quot;The Meaning of Death&quot;. In this book, Feifel dispelled myths held by scientists and practitioners about death and the denial of its importance for human behavior. It earned wide attention and became a classic in the new field, including as it did contributions from eminent thinkers such as psychiatrist Carl Jung, theologian Paul Tillich and philosopher Herbert Marcuse. Through &quot;The Meaning of Death&quot;, Feifel was able to lay the foundation for a field that would eventually be known as thanatology. The field was to improve death education and grief counseling by the use of valid death-related data, methodology, and theory.

However, this is only one of several important books in the field of thanatology. Other key texts include &quot;The Experience of Death&quot; by Paul-Louis Landsberg, the sections on temporality and death from Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Being and Time&quot;, as well as works of a fictional nature, such as Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; by William Faulkner.

== Goals ==
In most cases, thanatology is not specifically related to palliative care and end-of-life care, which aim to provide treatment for dying individuals and their families. According to the World Health Organization, &quot;palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, involving the &#x27;treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.&#x27;&quot;

Thanatology does not always &quot;directly&quot; explore the meaning of life and of death, though such questions are relevant to the psychological health of those involved in the dying process: individuals, families, communities, and cultures.

As a consequence of thanatology becoming so prominent, there has been an increase in university education surrounding death, including courses and degree programs in thanatology. A continuing goal of this science is to improve the communication between practice and research since that is something that has been lacking. Thanatology has come a long way and will keep evolving to better our understanding of death. Highly regarded certification programs are also available.

== Forensic medicine == 
Forensic medicine deals with, among many other things, sudden and unexpected deaths. According to one author: &quot;Forensic medicine is the application of medical knowledge for the scientific investigation of facts and causal relationships, as well as the analysis and interpretation thereof in the service of the law in its broadest sense; moreover, it addresses all legal aspects of the practice of medicine during teaching, medical training, and specialist training.&quot; The process of postmortem autopsy, which originated and is well established in modern Europe, has not been adopted universally, however. 

A large portion of a forensic physician&#x27;s duty is to assist in inquiries into sudden and suspicious deaths and to examine individuals in connections with allegations of sexual offenses. They also provide expert evidence in court, but the notion that they represent individuals in court proceedings reveals a misconception of their role. Legal representation is invariably the province of legally qualified advocates and, in many jurisdictions, the right of audience as an advocate is confined by law to those so qualified.

Physicians&#x27; rules for forensic science: Any natural scientist who wishes to practice forensic science must obviously acquire forensic knowledge. Not all forensic scientists, however, have medical licenses, nor do medical practitioners have a monopoly in forensic science.

There are a handful of forensic doctors who work closely with prisoners to provide them with clinical assessments. They also put together care plans moving forward with these prisoners. These plans can include prescribing and obtaining medicine and monitoring them from a physical and mental health perspective.

== Coping with death ==

=== Research and studies ===
Multiple scholarly journals dedicated specifically to thanatology regularly publish peer-reviewed studies and essays of interest in the field. These include &quot;Death Studies, Mortality, Omega:Journal of Death &amp; Dying, Journal of Loss &amp; Trauma&quot;, and &quot;Illness, Crisis, &amp; Loss&quot;. Though Elisabeth Kübler-Ross described Five Stages of Grief with terminal illness (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance), some thanatologists disagree about the actual existence of such stages. Some reject the notion as simplistic and empirically unsupported. Dr. Allan Kellerhear pointed out that Kübler-Ross&#x27; stage theory was openly discussed and outlined as a heuristic device. He also went on to point out that she put the &quot;stages&quot; in inverted commas to emphasize their tentative nature in the only diagrammatic representation of these ideas in her book, &quot;On Death &amp; Dying.&quot;

Studies show that if one&#x27;s self-esteem is already low, the death of one&#x27;s partner may well result in greater social and emotional loneliness (concepts defined specifically by the researchers). Aggravated social and emotional loneliness, as thus defined, may result in a feeling of having received less support. However, since an imperfect grasp of these findings may lead to a garbled attempt to describe them, it is desirable to read them fully in their original sources so as to master them as thoroughly as one assimilates Kübler-Ross&#x27; theories of responses to loss.

Mortality awareness may be thought essential to our overall well-being as we confront the aging of world societies, global health disparities, emerging biomedical technologies, and shifting understandings of good deaths and lives worth living. However, we must be clear about what we mean by &#x27;mortality awareness&#x27;. It is often said, and with some justification, that one phenomenon that distinguishes humans from other evolved beings is our acute awareness of our own mortality. If we mean no more than that we must know we must die in order to flourish, the assertion is facile since most humans are conscious of their mortality but we do not all rise equally well to existential or wider social challenges.

===Hospice care===

One way to cope with death is to utilize hospice care facilities. Hospice care of dying people is usually palliative rather than curative, and it may ease the suffering of the dying and those who care about them. The services provided in a hospice include: managing the dying individual&#x27;s pain and symptoms; providing needed drugs, medical supplies and equipment; assisting the individual with emotional, psychological and spiritual aspects of dying; rendering services such as speech and physiotherapy where needed; and coaching family and friends on how to care for the individual.

A common myth about hospice care is that someone must be in their last few days of life, be bedridden or be unable to communicate with others to receive hospice help. However, that is simply not the case. Hospice care is appropriate for those who have been given a prognosis that they are likely to die within around 12 months or less. A decision to use hospice care means the dying individual will ideally spend more quality time with the people they love and have time to look back on life during this peaceful, meaningful period.

Another common myth is that hospice care means giving up hope. Hospice involves coping with death and part of that means acknowledging that some diseases, illnesses and states of being in their advanced stages cannot be cured. The idea of hope varies from person to person and, in hospice care, patients and their loved ones will often seek any form of hope that they can.

In places where there is little or no publicly funded provision for hospice care, various private insurance plans such as Medicare, Medicaid, and HMO will cover the costs, reducing the direct expense to the individual&#x27;s family.

===Popular media===

Death and dying was the subject of the 2018 Academy Award-nominated Netflix short documentary, &quot;End Game&quot; about terminally ill patients in palliative care at a San Francisco hospital and subsequent Zen Hospice Project care. It featured palliative care physician, BJ Miller and was executive produced by palliative care activist Dr. Shoshana R. Ungerleider.

An episode of Quincy, M.E. titled &quot;Gentle into That Good Night&quot; (season 07 episode 07) featured a thanatologist by the name of Dr. Pendelton. During the episode Dr. Quincy explores the effect of death on people and his role in the grieving process.

In a 2016 open letter to singer David Bowie, palliative care doctor Professor Mark Tauber, M.D. talked about the importance of good end of life care, being able to express wishes about the last months of life, and good education about issues related to thanatology more generally. The letter went viral after being shared by Bowie&#x27;s son, Duncan Jones and was subsequently read aloud by actor Benedict Cumberbatch and singer Jarvis Cocker at several public events.

The 2005 video game Pathologic features fictional thanatologist Daniil Dankovsky as a playable character. His quest to understand and cure death itself is his sole motivation for travelling to the town where the game is set. Once there, he intends to meet with and perhaps learn the secrets of a man who has lived an unnaturally long life.

== Fields of study ==
As an interdisciplinary study, thanatology relies on collaboration with many different fields of study. Death is a universal human concern; it has been examined and re-examined in a wide variety of disciplines, dating back to pre-history. Some of these fields of study are academic in nature; others have evolved throughout history as cultural traditions. One of the oldest organizations in the field of thanatology is the U.S.-based Association for Death Education and Counseling

The humanities are, perhaps, the very oldest disciplines to explore death. Historically, the average human had a significantly lower standard of living and lifespan than they would today. Wars, famine, and disease always kept death close at hand. Artists, authors, and poets often employed the universality of death as a motif in their works; this trend continues today.

The social sciences are often involved on both the individual and the cultural level. The individual level is primarily covered by psychology, the study of individual minds. However, to overlook social psychology would be a serious omission. Avoiding (or, in some cases, seeking) death is an important human motive; the fear of death affects many individuals&#x27; actions. That fear can be either reinforced or assuaged by social culture.

Social science research has frequently encountered the issue of death. Sociology, for instance, extends to but is by no means confined to social rules, conventions and practices. Sub-disciplines within sociology, such as the sociology of death and sociology of disaster, focus more narrowly on such issues as how societies handle death under certain conditions. Likewise, cultural anthropology and archeology are concerned with how various current and past cultures have each dealt with death. Society and culture are related but dissimilar concepts, so the scope of each is different. Thus, a society is an interdependent community, while societal as distinct from individual culture is an &quot;attribute&quot; of a community, including the complex web of shifting patterns that links some individuals together. In any case, both cultures and societies must deal with death; and various cultural studies (many of which overlap with each other) examine this response taking a variety of approaches.

 Thanatology also draws from the biological study of death, which helps explain what happens, physically, to individuals in the moment of dying and during after-death bodily changes so that extraneous events at the time of death and thereafter can be clarified. In psychiatry and clinical psychology, the medical application of psychological principles and therapeutic drugs is also involved; many licensed psychiatrists are required to take courses on thanatology during training. Medical ethics is also an important area of study, especially on the issue of euthanasia (&#x27;merciful killing&#x27;) and assisted suicide. However, the degree to which any of these is an aspect of thanatology is a matter of opinion, depending primarily on how one defines thanatology itself.

There is also a branch of thanatology called music thanatology which focuses on the use of &quot;music vigils&quot; to help dying individuals, their families and friends. A vigil consists of one or a team of music thanatologists who visit the dying person. They play the harp most often but may play any gentle instrument like the guitar and sing based on changes that they observe in that person&#x27;s physiology as well as in interpersonal family dynamics. The music tends toward the meditative and can be very helpful to the dying person and others present. Often, after a vigil, the dying person is more relaxed, less agitated, and in less pain. However, given the circumstances, reviews of the service by recipients (appreciative or otherwise) are few and far between. Some music thanatologists are certified by the Music Thanatology Association International, and they use the initials &quot;CM-Th&quot; to designate certification by this professional organization. A number of hospitals and hospices now have professional music thanatologists on their staff.

<text>Hermann Carl Vogel (; ; 3 April 1841 – 13 August 1907) was a German astrophysicist. He was born in Leipzig, Kingdom of Saxony. From 1882 to 1907 he was director of the Astrophysical Observatory, Potsdam. He made extensive discoveries using spectral analysis of the stars.

== Life ==

Vogel was born in 1841 in Leipzig. His father was director of the united Bürgerschulen and founder of the Realschule in Leipzig. His siblings included Eduard Vogel (1829–1856), Africa explorer and astronomer; Elise Polko (1823–1899), poet and singer and Julie Dohmke (1827–1913), writer, publisher, translator. In 1862, Vogel began his studies at the Polytechnikum in Dresden and in 1863 went to University of Leipzig. In Leipzig he was assistant to Karl Christian Bruhns and took part in measurements of double stars carried out by Friedrich Wilhelm Rudolf Engelmann.

Vogel was awarded a doctorate in 1870 from Jena for work on nebulae and star clusters and went in the same year to the Sternwarte Bothkamp of Kammerherrn von Bülow, c. 20 km south of Kiel. Here he undertook his first spectral analyses on celestial bodies. Wilhelm Oswald Lohse became his assistant.

Vogel left the observatory in 1874, in order to work as an employee of the newly founded Astrophysical Observatory in Potsdam (AOP) dealing with the planning and the setting-up of the instruments of the institute. In this connection, he conducted a study trip to Britain in the summer of 1875.

From 1882 till 1907 Vogel was director of the AOP and developed it in this time to a world-leading institute of astrophysics. Hermann Carl Vogel died in Potsdam in 1907.

== Areas of work ==

Vogel pioneered the use of the spectroscope in astronomy. He applied this instrument to chemically analyze planetary atmospheres and in 1871 he was the first to establish Sun&#x27;s rotational period using the Doppler effect.

He is also considered the inventor of the photographic-spectroscopic radial velocity measurements of stars. He is possibly best known for discovering that the spectra of certain stars shifted slightly over time, moving toward the red and then later toward the blue. His interpretation of this result was that the star was moving toward and then away from the Earth, and that the accompanying spectral shifts were the result of the Doppler effect. These stars appeared to be orbiting around a hidden center of mass, and thus they were double-star systems. However, in each case the companion star could not be resolved using a telescope, and so these double-star systems were designated spectroscopic binaries. For instance, by obtaining periodic Doppler shifts in the components of Algol, Vogel proved, in 1889, that it was a binary star; thus, Algol was one of the first known spectroscopic binaries (and it is also known to be an eclipsing binary with a third star now known to rotate around the binary system). In 1892 Vogel produced radial velocity data for 51 stars. Vogel&#x27;s technique was adopted by the Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz who announced the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting 51 Pegasi. Mayor and Queloz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for their discovery.

Vogel had also made use of the Doppler effect on Earth. In 1875, he demonstrated the effect in the acoustic area with a whistle of a German Borsig-Lokomotive. In 1895 Hermann Carl Vogel was awarded the Pour le mérite für Wissenschaft und Künste and was, among others, a member of the following learned societies:

<text>Penutian is a proposed grouping of language families that includes many Native American languages of western North America, predominantly spoken at one time in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The existence of a Penutian stock or phylum has been the subject of debate among specialists. Even the unity of some of its component families has been disputed. Some of the problems in the comparative study of languages within the phylum are the result of their early extinction and limited documentation.

Some of the more recently proposed subgroupings of Penutian have been convincingly demonstrated. The Miwokan and the Costanoan languages have been grouped into a Utian language family by Catherine Callaghan. Callaghan has more recently provided evidence supporting a grouping of Utian and Yokutsan into a Yok-Utian family. There also seems to be convincing evidence for the Plateau Penutian grouping (originally named &quot;Shahapwailutan&quot; by J. N. B. Hewitt and John Wesley Powell in 1894) which would consist of Klamath–Modoc, Molala, and the Sahaptian languages (Nez Percé and Sahaptin).

==History of the hypothesis==
===Etymology and pronunciation===
The name &quot;Penutian&quot; is based on the words meaning &quot;two&quot; in the Wintuan, Maiduan, and Yokutsan languages (where it is pronounced something like ) and the Utian languages (where it is pronounced something like ).

Although perhaps originally intended to be pronounced , which is indicated in some dictionaries, the term is pronounced by most if not all linguists.

===Initial concept of five core families===
The original Penutian hypothesis, offered in 1913 by Roland B. Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber, was based on similarities observed between five California language families:
* Maiduan languages
* Miwok
* Costanoan languages
* Wintuan languages
* Yokutsan languages

That original proposal has since been called alternately &quot;Core Penutian&quot;, &quot;California Penutian&quot;, or the &quot;Penutian Kernel&quot;. In 1919 the same two authors published their linguistic evidence for the proposal. The grouping, like many of Dixon &amp; Kroeber&#x27;s other phylum proposals, was based mostly on shared typological characteristics and not the standard methods used to determine genetic relationships. Starting from this early date, the Penutian hypothesis was controversial.

Prior to the 1913 Penutian proposal of Dixon and Kroeber, Albert S. Gatschet had grouped Miwokan and Costanoan into a &quot;Mutsun&quot; group (1877). That grouping, now termed Utian, was later conclusively demonstrated by Catherine Callaghan. In 1903 Dixon &amp; Kroeber noted a &quot;positive relationship&quot; among Costanoan, Maidu, Wintun, and Yokuts within a &quot;Central or Maidu Type&quot;, from which they excluded Miwokan (their Moquelumnan). In 1910 Kroeber finally recognized the close relationship between the Miwokan and Costanoan languages.

===Sapir&#x27;s expansion===
In 1916 Edward Sapir expanded Dixon and Kroeber&#x27;s California Penutian family with a sister stock, Oregon Penutian, which included the Coosan languages and also the isolates Siuslaw and Takelma:
* Oregon Penutian
** Coosan languages
** Siuslaw
** Takelma
Later Sapir and Leo Frachtenberg added the Kalapuyan and the Chinookan languages and then later the Alsean and Tsimshianic families, culminating in Sapir&#x27;s four-branch classification (Sapir 1921a:60):
** California Penutian grouping
*** Maiduan   
*** Utian   
*** Wintuan   
*** Yokutsan   
** Oregon Penutian grouping
*** Coosan   
*** Siuslaw
*** Takelma
*** Kalapuyan   
*** Alsean   
** Chinookan family   
** Tsimshianic family   
By the time Sapir&#x27;s 1929 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article was published, he had added two more branches:
** Plateau Penutian family
*** Klamath–Modoc   
*** Waiilatpuan
**** Cayuse
**** Molala
*** Sahaptian   
** Mexican Penutian grouping
*** Mixe–Zoque, a non-Mayan language spoken in populations in Oaxaca, Chiapas, Tabasco and Veracruz
*** Huave, a language isolate spoken in four villages on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
resulting in a six-branch family:
* Penutian
** California Penutian
** Oregon Penutian
** Chinookan
** Tsimshianic
** Plateau Penutian
** Mexican Penutian


===Further expansions===
Other linguists have suggested other languages be included within the Penutian grouping:
* Macro-Penutian hypothesis (Benjamin Whorf)

Or have produced hypotheses of relationships between Penutian and other large-scale families:
* Amerind hypothesis (Joseph Greenberg)

Note: Some linguists have proposed a relationship between Penutian and the Zuni language. This link, proposed by Stanley Newman, is now generally rejected, and may have even been intended as a hoax by Newman.

===Mid-twentieth century doubts===
Scholars in the mid-twentieth century became concerned that similarities among the proposed Penutian language families may be the result of borrowing that occurred among neighboring peoples, not of a shared proto-language in the distant past. Mary Haas states the following regarding this borrowing:
Even where genetic relationship is clearly indicated ... the evidence of diffusion of traits from neighboring tribes, related or not, is seen on every hand. This makes the task of determining the validity of the various alleged Hokan languages and the various alleged Penutian languages all the more difficult ... [and] point[s] up once again that diffusional studies are just as important for prehistory as genetic studies and what is even more in need of emphasis, it points up the desirability of pursuing diffusional studies along with genetic studies. This is nowhere more necessary than in the case of the Hokan and Penutian languages wherever they may be found, but particularly in California where they may very well have existed side by side for many millennia.(Haas 1976:359)

Despite the concern of Haas and others, the Consensus Classification produced at a 1964 conference in Bloomington, Indiana, retained all of Sapir&#x27;s groups for North America north of Mexico within the Penutian Phylum. The opposite approach was taken following a 1976 conference at Oswego, New York, when Campbell and Mithun dismissed the Penutian phylum as undemonstrated in their resulting classification of North American language families.

===Recent hypotheses===
Consensus was reached at a 1994 workshop on Comparative Penutian at the University of Oregon that the families within the proposed phylum&#x27;s California, Oregon, Plateau, and Chinookan clusters would eventually be shown to be genetically related. Subsequently, Marie-Lucie Tarpent reassessed Tsimshianic, a geographically isolated family in northern British Columbia, and concluded that its affiliation within Penutian is also probable.

 Earlier groupings, such as California Penutian and Takelma–Kalapuyan (&quot;Takelman&quot;) are no longer accepted as valid nodes by many Penutian researchers. However, Plateau Penutian, Coast Oregon Penutian, and Yok-Utian (comprising the Utian and Yokutsan languages) are increasingly supported. Scott DeLancey suggests the following relationships within and among language families typically assigned to the Penutian phylum:
* Penutian
** Maritime Penutian
*** Tsimshian
*** Chinook
*** Coast Oregon Penutian
**** Alsea
**** Siuslaw
**** Coos
** Inland Penutian
*** Yok-Utian (from the Great Basin)
**** Utian
**** Yokuts
*** Maidu (from the Great Basin or Oregon)
*** Plateau Penutian
**** Sahaptian
**** Molala
**** Klamath
The Wintuan languages, Takelma, and Kalapuya, absent from this list, continue to be considered Penutian languages by most scholars familiar with the subject, often in an Oregonian branch, though Takelma and Kalapuya are no longer considered to define a branch of Penutian.

A lexicostatistical classification and list of probable Penutian cognates has also been proposed by Zhivlov (2014).

==Evidence for the Penutian hypothesis==
Perhaps because many Penutian languages have apophony, vowels are difficult to reconstruct. However, consonant correspondences are common. For example, the proto-Yokuts (Inland Penutian) retroflexes correspond to Klamath (Plateau Penutian) , whereas the Proto-Yokuts dental correspond to Klamath alveolar . Kalapuya, Takelma, and Wintu do not show such obvious connections.

Below are some Penutian sound correspondence proposed by William Shipley, cited in Campbell (1997).

<doc id="589433" wikidata="Q3513390" url="?curid=589433" title="Wintu">
<text>The Wintu (also Northern Wintun) are Native Americans who live in what is now Northern California. They are part of a loose association of peoples known collectively as the Wintun (or Wintuan). There are three major groups that make up the Wintu speaking people: the Wintu (Northern Wintun), Nomlaki (Central Wintun), and Patwin (Southern Wintun). The Wintu language is part of the Penutian language family. 

Historically, the Wintu lived primarily on the western side of the northern part of the Sacramento Valley, from the Sacramento River to the Coast Range. The range of the Northern Wintu also included the southern portions of the Upper Sacramento River (south of the Salt Creek drainage), the southern portion of the McCloud River, and the upper Trinity River. Today, many Northern Wintu still reside on or near their traditional homelands in Trinity and Shasta counties.

==History==
The first recorded encounter between Wintu and Euro-Americans dates from the 1826 expedition of Jedediah Smith, followed by an 1827 expedition led by Peter Skene Ogden. Between 1830 and 1833, many Wintu died from a malaria epidemic that killed an estimated 75% of the indigenous population in the upper and central Sacramento Valley.

Settlers hoped to come to an agreement with the Wintu tribes over land. They tried to take over Wintu land and relocate them west of Clear Creek in exchange for peace, money and citizenship. Instead there was disagreement, slavery, and war. In 1846, John C. Frémont and Kit Carson accompanied by local white settlers killed several hundred Wintu in the Sacramento River massacre. At a &quot;friendship feast&quot; in 1850, settlers served poisoned food to local natives, from which 100 &quot;Nomsuu&quot; and 45 Wenemem Wintu died. More deaths of Wintu and destruction of their land followed in 1851 and 1852, in incidents such as the Bridge Gulch Massacre. The increasing population of settlers moving west, as for the California Gold Rush, put pressure on the settlers to relocate Native Americans like the Wintu.

==Culture==

The number of bands within the Northern Wintu is sometimes contested among both tribal members as well as anthropologists, but they are generally seen to be 8 to 11, those bands being: Daupom/Stillwater, El pom/Kewsick, Nomtipom/Upper Sacramento River, Winnemem/McCloud River, Nomsus/Upper Trinity River, Klabalpom/French Gulch, Daumuq/Cottonwood Creek, Norelmuq/Hayfork, Puimem/Lower Pit River, Daunom/Bald Hills, and Waymuq/Mt. Shasta. The last group, the Waymuq, are recorded to be a transitional unit in both culture, language, and society between the Wintu-speaking peoples and the Shastan-speakers. The Waymuq are also seen to be the same group that have been recorded under the name Okwanuchu (meaning &quot;Distant people&quot; in the Shasta language) by some anthropologists and linguists. They are said to have occupied the region north of Salt and Nosoni Creek and extending northwards to the southern base of Mt. Shasta, with some major villages situated in Dunsmuir, Sisson (now known as Mt. Shasta City), and Sulanharas Creek. One anthropologist, C. Hart Merriam, also recorded a group of Northern Wintu people who lived along the South Fork of the Trinity River under the Athabaskan name &quot;Ni-i-che&quot;. They were said to have been close to the Norelmuq in terms of both language and culture, but it is unclear whether they were one of the same with the aforementioned band.

The Wintu tribes had close ties to the natural resources in the region they occupied. More specifically, The Winnemem Wintu tribe translates to &quot;Middle Water people&quot; in their language. They believed they were born from water, &quot;are&quot; the water, and fight to protect the water. As a whole, hunting, fishing, and gathering plants are all part of their culture and cultural use. They use unique customs, traditional art, and independent spiritual beliefs within their way of life. When villages had extra food, they would sometimes invite neighboring tribes to feast, dance, and play games. Dance had many purposes in the Wintu culture and was not only used for entertainment. The &quot;suneh,&quot; or begging dance was done when one person would transfer property to another.

The Wintu people used to live in small semi-permanent homes that could be found along waterways. More specifically, River and Hill Patwin homes were dome-like. River Patwins used sticks, straw, and other earthly resources to build their homes. Hill Patwins&#x27; homes had a similar structure but used conical bark. Larger communities had an earth lodge, which had two main purposes. The structure&#x27;s first purpose was to be used as a sweat lodge for spiritual renewal, purification, and connection to nature. The other use for the sweat lodge in Wintu culture is a place to sleep for unmarried men without families.

The Wintu people are known for fishing. They also rely heavily on wild foods to trade and use within their economy. Their primary food source was salmon fished from the McCloud and Sacramento rivers. Sometimes they would fish for Steelhead trout in the upper Trinity River. Men often hunted either individually or in hunting groups. Groups would use traps for all types of animals. Women gathered plants and other resources to use for food or implements like baskets. Basket weaving was a large part of their culture and community. They used baskets for cooking, storing, sifting, and carrying. Basket weaving was also incorporated into fashion by weaving hats, which many women wore.

==Population==

Scholars have disagreed about the historic population of the tribes before European-American contact. Due to competition for resources, forced labor, disease, and other factors the Wintu tribes&#x27; population decreased. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the combined 1770 population of the Wintu, Nomlaki, and Patwin as 12,000. Sherburne F. Cook initially put the population of the Wintu proper as 2,950, but later nearly doubled his estimate to 5,300. Frank R. LaPena estimated a total of 14,250 in his work of the 1970s.

Kroeber estimated the population of the Wintu, Nomlaki, and Patwin in 1910 as about 1,000. Today the population has recovered somewhat and there are about 2,500 Wintun, many of whom live on the Round Valley Reservation, and on the Colusa, Cortina, Grindstone Creek, Redding, and Rumsey rancherias. The estimated total of Wintu people is averaged at 2,500.
== Present day Wintu ==
The Wintu tribe had to modernize their way of life while keeping their culture and history with them. They explain that their mission is to preserve, promote and protect the culture of the tribe, creating long-term economic prosperity and self-reliance. Current tribal council members consist of Gary and Theresa Rickard, Vincent Cervantes, Gene Malone, Cindy Hogue, Bill Hunt, and Les Begly. They have a Museum and Cultural Resource Center that was built after they lost their recognition status by the federal government.

In 1941, congress passed the Central Valley Project Indian Lands Acquisition Act. This led to the Wintu tribe losing access to the Upper Sacramento River, McCloud River, and Lower Pit River. To the Wintu people, these parts of land are sacred. By losing the river they also lost their prime source of food, salmon. In 2023 the Wintu were able to buy back the land where the rivers lie. They told reporters and writers that they plan to restore the winter-run Chinook salmon population.

<doc id="589437" wikidata="Q1448870" url="?curid=589437" title="Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo">
<text>The Sanctuary of Saint Michael the Archangel () is a Roman Catholic shrine on Mount Gargano, Italy, part of the commune of Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo, in the province of Foggia, northern Apulia. It has the dignity of a minor basilica.

It is the oldest shrine in Western Europe dedicated to the Archangel Michael and has been an important site of pilgrimage since the early Middle Ages. The historic site and its environs are protected by the Parco Nazionale del Gargano.

In 2011, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as Longobards in Italy: Places of Power (568-774 A.D.).

==Legendary history==
The earliest account of the foundation of the Sanctuary is a composite Latin hagiographical text known as &quot;Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis in Monte Gargano&quot; (&quot;Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina&quot; 5948).

There are three sections to the legend, recording three apparitions of Michael: the first and third sections appear to be part of the same narrative, while the second is possibly the account of a battle half a century later. According to the first and last parts of the legend, around the year 490 the Archangel Michael appeared several times to the Bishop of Sipontum near a cave in the mountains, instructing that the cave be dedicated to Christian worship and promising protection of the nearby town of Sipontum from pagan invaders. These apparitions are also the first appearances of Saint Michael in western Europe.

The second section of the text describes Michael&#x27;s intercession on behalf of the Sipontans and the Beneventans against invading pagan Neapolitans. On the eve of the battle, Michael appeared with flaming sword atop the mountain; the Sipontans and Beneventans were victorious. Giorgio Otranto identifies this battle as the one recorded in Book 4 of Paul the Deacon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Lombards&quot;, which describes the defense of Mount Gargano against unidentified &#x27;Greeks&#x27; – possibly Byzantine Greeks – by the Lombard Duke of Benevento, Grimoald I, on 8 May 663.

In commemoration of this victory, the church of Sipontum instituted a special feast on May 8 honoring the Archangel, which then spread throughout the Western Christendom during the 9th century. Since the time of Pius V it has been formalized as &quot;Apparitio Sancti Michaelis&quot;, although it originally did not commemorate the apparition but the victory of the Lombards over invading Greeks.

Pope Gelasius I (reigned 492–496) directed that a basilica should be erected enclosing the space. The Basilica di San Giovanni in Tumba is the final resting-place of the Lombard King Rothari (died 652); the designation &quot;tumba&quot; is now applied to the cupola on squinches.

==History==

The place has been venerated since 490, the year in which, according to tradition, the first apparition of the archangel Michael took place on the Gargano at San Lorenzo Maiorano. A first sanctuary was built in 493 on the cave where the apparition took place and from the 7th century the garganica area in which the sanctuary stood, became part of the Lombards domains as it was included in the territories of the Duchy of Benevento.

The work of conversion of the Lombards from Arian Christianity to Catholic Christianity, already begun in 589 by Queen Theodelinda, was completed under the reign of Cunipert. The cult of St. Michael thus developed within a context of archaic religiosity. Over time, various religious buildings were dedicated to St. Michael, in particular in the territory of the Duchy of Benevento, where the first epicenter of the cult of Michael among the Lombards was the Sanctuary of St. Michael the Archangel and from which it spread throughout the Lombard Kingdom until it was soon considered the patron saint of the entire people.

The Sanctuary of St. Michael the Archangel thus became the main center of veneration of the archangel in the entire West, a typological model for all the others. It was the object of monumental patronage of both the dukes of Benevento and the kings of Pavia, who promoted numerous renovations to facilitate access to the cave of the first apparition and to accommodate pilgrims. The Sanctuary of St. Michael the Archangel thus became one of the main pilgrimage destinations of Christianity, a stop on that variant of the Via Francigena now called &quot;Via Sacra Langobardorum&quot; that led to Holy Land. In fact, the sanctuary is one of the three major European places of worship named after St. Michael, together with the sacra di San Michele in Val di Susa, and the Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey in Normandy.
The alignment of these three geographical sites on a straight line, separated by the same distance. Other further Michael sites would seem to be found extending this line to the northwest and southeast, fueling the legend of the so-called &quot;sacred line of St. Michael the Archangel&quot;, which would have it produced by the sword blow inflicted by the Archangel on Satan to send him back to hell as narrated in the Book of Revelation. Physicist Luca Amendola has observed that the deviation of these sites from the rhumb line (although it would be more correct to speak of orthodromic line) that would connect them varies between 14-42 km. It is therefore possible that the alignment is a coincidence, favored by the high density of religious buildings that Europe presents and the importance of St. Michael in Christianity.

The sanctuary is connected with the city of Lucca for some important facts, such as the presence of the bishop of Lucca Alfonso Puccinelli, who also witnessed the apparition of St. Michael in 1656. In Lucca, in the church of San Michele in Foro, there is also a statue very similar to the one in the sanctuary of San Michele, donated by Bishop Puccinelli to the Republic of Lucca as a symbol of thanksgiving to the city of origin, after the apparition of 1656.

After the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in 774 the sanctuary retained its important function within the Langobardia Minor, still within the Duchy of Benevento which in that same year was raised, on the initiative of Arechi II, to the rank of principality. When Benevento also fell during the 11th century, the sanctuary of St. Michael the Archangel was taken care of first by the Normans, then by the Swabians and the Angevins, who in turn linked themselves to the cult of Michael and further intervened on the structure of the sanctuary itself, modifying its upper part and enriching it with new decorative apparatus.

==Architecture==

The complex of buildings consists of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Tumba, damaged in 1942, and the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The baptistery presents a rectangular storey on which rests an octagon supporting an elliptical section and a high drum that supports the cupola. The church erected in the eleventh century by Archbishop Leone stands upon the remains of an ancient necropolis. A few remnants attest to its once-rich fresco decoration.

The Castello was enlarged by the Normans upon an episcopal residence of Orso, Bishop of Benevento, to provide a suitable seat for the &quot;Honor Montis Sancti Angeli&quot;, further modified by Frederick II. The massive, octagonal campanile was built in the late 13th century by Frederick II as a watchtower. It was turned into a bell tower by Charles I of Anjou.

Behind a forecourt the sanctuary presents a portico of two Gothic arches, the right one of 1395 by the local architect Simone, the left one a reconstruction of 1865. From the portico steps lead down to the low arched nave. The cavern can be accessed from a Romanesque portal, called the &quot;Portale del Toro&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Bull&quot;): the doors, in bronze, were made in Constantinople in 1076, the donation of an Amalfitan noble. They are divided into 24 panels portraying episodes of angels from the Old and New Testaments.

The archaic cavern opening to the left, with its holy well, is full of votive offerings, especially the 12th century marble bishop&#x27;s throne supported on crouching lions. Among the &quot;ex voto&quot; objects is a statue of the Archangel by Andrea Sansovino.

==Pilgrimages==
Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo was a popular pilgrimage site on the way to Jerusalem; pilgrims travelled from as far as Ireland to visit the “Celestial Basilica”. Among the pilgrims who visited the Saint Michael Archangel Sanctuary were many popes (Gelasius I, Leo IX, Urban II, Alexander III, Gregory X, Celestine V, John XXIII as Cardinal, John Paul II), saints (Bridget of Sweden, Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas), emperors, kings, and princes (Louis II of Italy, Otto III, Henry II, Matilda of Tuscany, Charles I of Naples, Ferdinand II of Aragon).

Francis of Assisi also visited the Sanctuary, but, feeling unworthy to enter the grotto, stopped in prayer and meditation at the entrance, kissed a stone, and carved on it the sign of the cross in the form “T” (tau).

==The guardians==
Since 13 July 1996, the pastoral care of Saint Michael Archangel Sanctuary has been given to the Congregation of Saint Michael the Archangel.

<text>The Wintun are members of several related Native American peoples of Northern California, including the Wintu (northern), Nomlaki (central), and Patwin (southern). Their range is from approximately present-day Lake Shasta to San Francisco Bay, along the western side of the Sacramento River to the Coast Range. Each of these tribes speak one of the Wintuan languages. Linguistic and archaeological evidence suggests that the Wintun people probably entered the California area around 500 AD from what is now southern Oregon, introducing bow and arrow technology to the region (Golla 2011: 205). There has been carbon dating of several artifacts by UC Berkeley that dates back to around 10,000 years, and several of these artifacts have now been repatriated. Despite being a major influence on the region&#x27;s history, there is still very little history on the Wintu due to centuries of genocide and displacement that still occur today along with continued destruction of sacred ceremonial and religious sites, often due to companies that ignore legal or ethical considerations.

<text>Rudolph Minkowski (born Rudolf Leo Bernhard Minkowski ; ; May 28, 1895 – January 4, 1976) was a German-American astronomer.

==Biography==

Minkowski was the son of Marie Johanna Siegel and physiologist Oskar Minkowski. His uncle was Hermann Minkowski, a mathematician and one of Einstein&#x27;s teachers in Zürich. Rudolph studied supernovae and, together with Walter Baade, divided them into two classes (Type I and Type II) based on their spectral characteristics. He and Baade also found optical counterparts to various radio sources.

He headed the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, a photographic atlas of the entire northern sky (and south to declination -22°) down to an apparent magnitude of 22.

Together with Albert George Wilson, he co-discovered the near-Earth Apollo asteroid 1620 Geographos in 1951, and he also discovered Planetary Nebula M2-9. He additionally discovered a correlation between the luminosity of early-type galaxies and their velocity dispersion, which was later quantified by Faber and Jackson. He won the Bruce Medal in 1961. The lunar crater &quot;Minkowski&quot; is named after him and his uncle.
In the 1940&#x27;s he created a catalog of nearly 200 planetary nebulae, including Minkowski 2-9, and a dwarf galaxy near NGC 541, known as &quot;Minkowski&#x27;s object&quot;, is named after him.

<text>Sanford Berman (born October 6, 1933) is a librarian (specifically, a cataloger). He is known for radicalism, promoting alternative viewpoints in librarianship, and acting as a proactive information conduit to other librarians around the world. His vehicles of influence include public speaking, voluminous correspondence, and unsolicited &quot;care packages&quot; delivered via the U.S. Postal Service. Will Manley, columnist for the American Library Association (ALA) publication, &quot;American Libraries,&quot; has praised Berman: &quot;He makes you proud to be a librarian.&quot;

==Biography==
Berman was born in Chicago, Illinois. He attended University of California at Los Angeles, where he earned a BA in Political Science with minors in Sociology, Anthropology, and English, and where he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After acquiring an MS in Library Science from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., Berman began work as a librarian. He worked for the U.S. Army Special Services Libraries, West Germany (1962–1966), where he helped edit an underground press GI magazine titled, &quot;Yin/Yang&quot;; Schiller College, Kleiningersheim, West Germany (1966–1967); University of California at Los Angeles Research Library (1967–1968), where he rescued back runs of &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from the trash bin; University of Zambia Library, Lusaka, Zambia (1968–1970); Makerere Institute of Social Research, Makerere University Library, Kampala, Uganda (1971–1972); and Hennepin County Library, Minnesota (1973–1999).

==Library activism==

=== Alternative subject headings ===
Berman has been a leading critic of biased headings in the Library of Congress Subject Headings. His 1971 publication, &quot;Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People&quot;, sparked a movement to correct biased subject headings. Berman listed 225 headings with proposed alterations, additions, or deletions and cross-references to &quot;more accurately reflect the language used in addressing these topics, to rectify errors of bias, and to better guide librarians and readers to material of interest.&quot; Berman stated, &quot;The fact that a number of meanings may be assigned to a given word explains why messages are subject to misinterpretation and why our communication is open to misunderstandings.&quot; He asserted that messages and therefore subject headings must convey an idea in a fashion free from prejudice. Berman realized the continued use of biased subject headings would significantly limit the ability of a patron to access materials in the collection. Berman also thought the use of language in headings should be clear and concise, and should reflect the current use of everyday people rather than only scientific or technical terms. Overall, the use of common language in subject headings would enable prompt retrieval of materials by the end user.

Berman also openly criticized centrally performed cataloging and standard cataloging tools that supported bias in subject headings. He stated, &quot;[O]ur national cataloging products and services can&#x27;t be completely trusted and should not be accepted automatically nor uncritically by anyone who genuinely believes that cataloging should make material &quot;more&quot; rather than &quot;less&quot; accessible and retrievable.&quot; Cataloging that was outrightly erroneous or inadequate rendered material inaccessible even though it was in the collection. Berman thought poor cataloging was a serious form of censorship. Libraries were supposed to oppose censorship and provide the widest possible spectrum of cultural, social, economic, political, religious, and sexual information. With this in mind, Berman indicated local libraries should make a conscious effort to describe accurately all materials in the catalog for a patron. A considerable amount of conscious effort meant including &quot;public notes&quot; to clarify unfamiliar concepts for patrons. The public notes would let a patron know whether an item would suit the information needs. Furthermore, Berman opposed the practice of not cataloging all important aspects of works. Patrons cannot access materials when they have not been fully catalogued.

The spark of Berman&#x27;s cataloging revolution was the inclusion in Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) of the term &quot;kaffir&quot;, which he came across while working in Zambia, where the term is considered a racial slur. This motivated him to systematically address subject heading bias in his work at Hennepin County Library and in writing &quot;Prejudices and Antipathies: a Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People&quot;. The work, published in two editions, examines racism, sexism, a Christian-centric worldview, and other biases inherent in the LCSH. Berman also is known for his role in encouraging the Library of Congress to drop such archaic headings as &quot;Water Closet&quot; in favor of contemporary terminology.

During the last six months of 2005, working with the assistance of Steve Fesenmaier, Berman convinced the Library of Congress to create many new subject headings, including &quot;American Dream,&quot; &quot;Plutocracy,&quot; &quot;West Virginia Mine Wars, 1897-1921,&quot; &quot;The Battle of Blair Mountain, 1921,&quot; and several others. 

With librarian James P. Danky, Berman was the editor of &quot;Alternative Library Literature&quot;, (1982–2001) a biennial compilation of alternative essays on librarianship from a wide variety of other sources. Berman&#x27;s other titles include &quot;The Joy of Cataloging&quot; and &quot;Worth Noting&quot;. He is the original radical librarian; his followers refer to themselves as &quot;Sandynistas&quot; or guerrilla cataloguers. He was a founding member of a group known as the &quot;Revolting Librarians,&quot; which published a manifesto about library-related issues.

=== American Library Association ===
Berman co-authored the 1990 ALA Policy on Library Services to Poor People, and founded the American Library Association&#x27;s Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty Task Force, a division of the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT). In 1989 he was honored with the American Library Association Equality Award.

In June 2005, he gave the Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture at the annual ALA conference, dedicated to the founder of OLOS.

Also in the early 1990s, Berman participated in the SRRT Action Council in advocating ALA to address Censorship in Israel with a Task Force on Israeli Censorship and Palestinian Libraries. He would later attempt to move organizing outside of ALA following backlash and conflicts with taskforce chair David Williams.

With other Minnesota librarians, as well as those nationally and internationally, Berman is known for promoting activist librarianship in which social justice is part and parcel of professional work. Thanks to this advocacy, the American Library Association&#x27;s official policy recognizes the key role of librarians in addressing social ills.

Berman was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership in 2004.

=== Post-retirement ===
Having retired in 1999, Berman continues to solicit the Library of Congress for additions and modifications to the LCSH system. Since 2005, he has led an effort to honor American labor leaders Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones and Eugene Debs with commemorative postage stamps. In 2013, McFarland &amp; Company published a collection of his &quot;Unabashed Librarian&quot; columns as a book called &quot;Not in My Library&quot;. In December 2019, the Edina Human Rights and Relations Commission recognized Berman&#x27;s commitment to social justice with the Tom Oye Award.

The Sanford Berman papers are part of the American Library Association (ALA) Archives held by the University of Illinois Library. The data files of the Hennepin County Library catalog are included in this collection.

<text>The Wappo (endonym: Micewal) are an Indigenous people of northern California. Their traditional homelands are in Napa Valley, the south shore of Clear Lake, Alexander Valley, and Russian River valley. They are distantly related to the Yuki people, from which they seem to have diverged at least 500 years ago. Their language, Wappo, has been influenced by the neighboring Pomo, who use the term &quot;A&#x27;shochamai&quot; or &quot;A&#x27;shotenchawi&quot; (transcribed as &quot;Ashochimi&quot; by some authors), meaning &quot;northerners&quot;, to refer to the Wappo.
==Culture==
Prior to European colonization, the Wappo lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small groups without centralized political authority, in homes built from branches, leaves and mud. Their woven baskets were so well-crafted that they were able to hold water. 
==History==
When Mexicans arrived to colonize California, Wappo villages existed near the present-day towns of Yountville, St. Helena and Calistoga. Those on the south shore of Clear Lake were completely absorbed and dispersed to the Spanish missions in California. The mission accounted for at least 550 Wappo baptisms.

The name Wappo is an Americanization of the Spanish term &quot;guapo&quot;, which means, among other things, &quot;brave.&quot; They were known as brave for their stubborn resistance to Mexican domination, particularly their resistance to all military attempts from General Vallejo and his enlisted allies. In 1836 the warring parties signed a peace treaty.

==Population==

Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Wappo at 1,000. Sherburne F. Cook (1976:174) raised this estimate to 1,650.

By the early 1850s, the surviving Wappo were reported to number between 188 and 800. However population dropped by 1880 to 50, and the 1910 Census returned only 73.

==Language==
The Wappo language is an extinct member of the Yukian language family. A Wappo grammar has been written.

<text>Zachary Scott (February 21, 1914 – October 3, 1965) was an American actor who was known for his roles as villains and &quot;mystery men&quot;.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Austin, Texas, the son of Sallie Lee (Masterson) and Zachary Thomson Scott, a doctor.

Scott intended to follow his father into medicine, but after attending the University of Texas at Austin, he dropped out at age 19 and worked as a seaman on an England-bound freighter. There he appeared in almost two dozen repertory theatre productions in 18 months. When he returned to Texas, he began to act in local theater productions.

==Career==
===Broadway===
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne met Scott and his wife Elaine Anderson in Austin, Texas, where Scott was again attending the University of Texas, and then wrote to Lawrence Langer about summer jobs for both at the Westport Playhouse in Connecticut, which led to Scott&#x27;s engagements in New York. He left the university without completing his degree and made his debut in a 1941 revival of &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; with a small role as a bartender. He was also in &quot;The Damask Cheek&quot; (1942), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1943), and &quot;Those Endearing Young Charms&quot; (1943).

===Warner Bros.===
Jack L. Warner saw Scott perform in &quot;Those Endearing Young Charms&quot; and signed him to his first film contract, which led to his screen debut in &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; (1944).

Scott was one of the many Warners stars who had small roles in &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944). He was loaned to United Artists to play the lead in &quot;The Southerner&quot; (1945) directed by Jean Renoir.

Back at Warners, Scott was cast in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) and received much acclaim for his performance as the duplicitous lover of both Joan Crawford and her daughter, and his mysterious murder forms the basis of the plot and frames the film&#x27;s opening and closing. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that Scott &quot;makes the most of his character&quot; in &quot;a talented performance.&quot;

Scott co-starred with Faye Emerson in &quot;Danger Signal&quot; (1945) and was with Janis Paige and Dane Clark in &quot;Her Kind of Man&quot; (1946). In 1946, exhibitors voted Scott the third most promising &quot;star of tomorrow&quot;.

Scott supported Ann Sheridan in &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1947) and Ronald Reagan and Alexis Smith in &quot;Stallion Road&quot; (1947). MGM borrowed him to support Lana Turner and Spencer Tracy in &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot; (1947).

He had the lead in a noir for Eagle-Lion Films, &quot;Ruthless&quot; (1948), then returned to Warners for &quot;Whiplash&quot; (1948) with Clark. He supported Virginia Mayo in &quot;Flaxy Martin&quot; (1949) and Joel McCrea in the independent &quot;South of St. Louis&quot; (1949). He was reunited with Crawford in &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949).

Warners tried Scott in &quot;One Last Fling&quot; (1949), a comedy with Alexis Smith. He starred in some films outside the studio: &quot;Guilty Bystander&quot; (1950) and &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; (1950). At Warners, he supported Randolph Scott in &quot;Colt .45&quot; (1950). He did &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; (1950) for Nicholas Ray and &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1950) for Warners.

After being dropped by Warners, Scott appeared on a variety of television series such as &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; (1950) and &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; (1951). He did &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; (1951) for King Vidor and &quot;The Secret of Convict Lake&quot; (1951).

===Leaving Warners===
Scott&#x27;s first film after he left Warners was &quot;Stronghold&quot; (1951) with Veronica Lake. He followed it with &quot;Let&#x27;s Make It Legal&quot; (1951). He was on TV in &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; (1951) and &quot;Betty Crocker Star Matinee&quot; (1952) and went to England to make &quot;Wings of Danger&quot; (1952).

In Hollywood, he was in &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (1953), and &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot; (1953) on TV, and &quot;Appointment in Honduras&quot; (1953), directed by Jacques Tourneur. He was in &quot;The Revlon Mirror Theater&quot; (1953), &quot;Chevron Theatre&quot; (1953), &quot;Suspense&quot; (1954), &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (1954), &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot; (1954), &quot;Campbell Summer Soundstage&quot; (1954), &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; (1954), &quot;Omnibus&quot; (1954), &quot;Climax!&quot; (1955), &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; (1955), &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; (1956, playing Philip Marlowe in a version of &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;), &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot; (1955), &quot;The Star and the Story&quot; (1956), &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot; (1956), &quot;Theatre Night&quot; (1957) and &quot;Pursuit&quot; (1958).

He made the occasional film such as &quot;Treasure of Ruby Hills&quot; (1955), &quot;Shotgun&quot; (1955), &quot;Flame of the Islands&quot; (1956), &quot;The Counterfeit Plan&quot; (1957), and &quot;Man in the Shadow&quot; (1957); the last two were shot in Britain.

Scott returned to Broadway with &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; (1959).

===Later roles===
Scott was in &quot;The Young One&quot; (1960) directed by Luis Buñuel. He guest starred on &quot;The Chevy Mystery Show&quot; (1960), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1960) and &quot;&quot; (1960). In 1961, he portrayed White Eyes, a Native American Chief, in the &quot;Rawhide&quot; episode &quot;Incident Before Black Pass&quot;.

He was in the film &quot;Natchez Trace&quot; (1960) and had roles in &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot; (1961), &quot;Play of the Week&quot; (1961), &quot;The New Breed&quot; (1961), &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1961) and &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; (1962).

Scott&#x27;s last roles included &quot;It&#x27;s Only Money&quot; (1962) with Jerry Lewis, the TV movie &quot;The Expendables&quot; (1962), and episodes of &quot;The Doctors and the Nurses&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Rogues&quot; (1965). He returned to Broadway for &quot;A Rainy Day in Newark &quot;(1963) by Howard Teichmann. He then moved back to Austin.

==Personal life==

During his time at Warner&#x27;s, Scott and his first wife Elaine socialized regularly with Angela Lansbury and her husband Richard Cromwell. Elaine Scott had met Zachary Scott in Austin and she made a name for herself behind the scenes on Broadway as stage manager for the original production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. 

The Scotts had one child together.

In 1950, Scott was involved in a rafting accident. Also during that year, he and Elaine divorced; she later married writer John Steinbeck. Possibly as a result of these developments or due to a box-office slump, Scott succumbed to depression, which affected his acting for Warners.

Scott married his second wife, actress Ruth Ford, in 1952. Scott adopted her daughter from Ford&#x27;s previous marriage to Peter van Eyck.

==Death==
Scott died on October 3, 1965, from a malignant brain tumor at the home of his mother in Austin, Texas at the age of 51.

==Legacy==
Scott has a star at 6349 Hollywood Boulevard in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.

In 1968, Austin renamed its civic center Zachary Scott Theatre Center in memory of the city&#x27;s native son. Two streets in the Austin area are named in his memory: at the old airport Mueller Redevelopment and in unincorporated southeast Travis County.

Scott&#x27;s family endowed two chairs at the University of Texas&#x27;s theatre department in his name.

<text>Tadamichi Kuribayashi was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, diplomat, and commanding officer of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. He is best known for having been the commander of the Japanese garrison at the battle of Iwo Jima.

Even before the battle, General Kuribayashi insisted upon sharing the hardships of his men. He also refused to permit banzai charges, which he regarded as an unnecessary waste of his men&#x27;s lives. The United States Marine Corps had expected to capture Iwo Jima in five days, but Kuribayashi and his men held out for 36 days. It is believed that Kuribayashi was killed in action while leading his soldiers in a night-attack on American troops, but his body was never identified by the United States military. U.S. Marine Corps General Holland Smith said of Kuribayashi that &quot;Of all our adversaries in the Pacific, Kuribayashi was the most redoubtable.&quot;

Kuribayashi was born in Matsushiro, Nagano, to an established samurai family dating to the Sengoku period. The Kuribayashi family began as land-owning nobles under the Sanada clan, then were members of the Matsushiro Domain during the Edo period. They launched business ventures in silk and banking in the Meiji period but both failed owing to their aristocratic status. By Kuribayashi&#x27;s birth in 1891, his family were working to rebuild their estate after fires destroyed their property in 1868 and 1881. Kuribayashi&#x27;s father, Tsurujiro, held jobs in lumber and civil engineering while his mother, Moto, maintained the family farm.

At Matsushiro Higher Elementary School and then Nagano Middle School (now Nagano High School), Kuribayashi excelled academically with a specialty in the English language. He initially sought to become a foreign correspondent; while stationed on Iwo Jima during World War II, he told a reporter that he had explored the possibility of becoming a journalist. Vice Admiral Shigeji Kaneko, a classmate of Kuribayashi at Nagoya, recalled that &quot;he once organized a strike against the school authorities. He just escaped expulsion by a hair. In those days, he was already good in poetry-writing, composition and speech-making. He was a young literary enthusiast.&quot;

As a student, Kuribayashi passed examinations for admission to Tōa Dōbun Shoin, a prestigious Japanese college in Shanghai, and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, ultimately choosing to enroll in the latter. He matriculated at the military academy as a member of its 26th class. After being commissioned as a first lieutenant in cavalry, he then attended the Army War College in Minato, Tokyo, for training in advanced command, graduating second in his class in 1923. As a result of their high academic rank, accomplished students of the college were presented with a &quot;guntō&quot; by the emperor and earned a unique privilege to study abroad. Kuribayashi chose to study alone in the United States as a military attaché with the 1st Cavalry Division in contrast to most students, who opted for places like Germany or France. He left Japan in March 1928 as a 36-year-old cavalry captain and lodged with a regular family in Buffalo, New York. 

Kuribayashi&#x27;s experience in the United States would distinguish him from other generals in the Imperial Japanese Army. He enrolled in Harvard University and became an involved student there, taking and completing courses in English, American history, and American politics. He also audited courses at the University of Michigan in similar subjects. Throughout his time in the country, Kuribayashi would travel extensively, living in Washington, D.C.; Boston, Massachusetts; Fort Bliss, Texas; and Fort Riley, Kansas, while also making visits to New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. He purchased a Chevrolet automobile, which he used to journey across the country, and was taught by an American officer how to drive. During his time training with the U.S. army at Fort Riley, Kuribayashi befriended Brigadier General George Van Horn Moseley.

Kuribayashi later recalled, 
&quot;I was in the United States for three years when I was a captain. I was taught how to drive by some American officers, and I bought a car. I went around the States, and I knew the close connections between the military and industry. I saw the plant area of Detroit, too. By one button push, all the industries will be mobilized for military business.&quot;

According to his son, Taro Kuribayashi, &quot;From 1928 to 1930, my father stayed in the United States as an exchange officer. In those days, he often gave me, a grammar school boy, printed letters. He always composed easy letters in order to let me read them without any help from others. He used to enclose some sketches with the letters. I have made a book of these picture letters. In the letters are so many scenes – while visiting Boston, he was lying sprawled on the gardens of Harvard University watching a clock tower, in another he is taking a walk in Buffalo, in another, playing with some American children and being invited to the house of Medical Doctor Furukohchi, etc. Throughout his letters, it is clear that my father used to drive in many directions in the United States, studied very hard late at night, and tried to be a gentleman. Also, he used to have many friends in foreign countries.&quot;

After returning to Tokyo, Kuribayashi was promoted to the rank of major and appointed as the first Japanese military attaché to Canada. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1933.

During his services in the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo from 1933 to 1937, he wrote lyrics for several martial songs. In 1940 Kuribayashi was promoted to major general.

During the lead up to the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Kuribayashi is known to have repeatedly told his family, &quot;America is the last country in the world Japan should fight.&quot;

==Pacific War==

In December 1941, Kuribayashi was ordered into the field as the Chief of Staff of the Japanese 23rd Army, commanded by Takashi Sakai, in the Invasion of Hong Kong. The 23rd Army&#x27;s occupation caused horrible massacres in Hong Kong. After the war, the 23rd Army&#x27;s commander Takashi Sakai was accused of war crimes at the Chinese War Crimes Military Tribunal, found guilty and executed by firing squad on 30 September 1946. According to a former subordinate, General Kuribayashi regularly visited wounded enlisted men in the hospital, which was virtually unheard of for an officer of the General Staff.

In 1943, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and reassigned to be commander of the 2nd Imperial Guards Division, which was primarily a reserve and training division. On 27 May 1944, he became commander of the IJA 109th Division.

Just two weeks later, on 8 June 1944, he received orders signed by Prime Minister Hideki Tojo to defend the strategically located island of Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands chain. According to Yoshii Kuribayashi, her husband said upon receiving the orders that it was unlikely even for his ashes to return from Iwo Jima.

According to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, it is possible that Kuribayashi was deliberately selected for what was known to be a suicide mission. General Kuribayashi was known for having expressed the belief that Japan&#x27;s war against the United States was a no win situation and needed to be ended via a negotiated peace. In the eyes of the ultra-nationalists in the General Staff and in Tojo&#x27;s cabinet, this had allegedly caused Kuribayashi to be seen as a defeatist.

He was accorded the honor of a personal audience with Emperor Hirohito on the eve of his departure. In a subsequent letter to Yoshii and their children, the General made no mention of meeting the Emperor. He instead expressed regret for failing to fix the draft in the kitchen of their home. He included a detailed diagram so that his son, Taro Kuribayashi would be able to complete the repair and prevent the family from catching cold.

===Planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima===


On 19 June 1944, General Kuribayashi stepped off a plane on Iwo Jima&#x27;s Chidori airstrip. Meanwhile, the island&#x27;s garrison was busy digging trenches on the beach. Kuribayashi made a careful survey of the island and ordered his men to construct defenses further inland. Deciding not to seriously contest the projected beach landings, Kuribayashi decreed that the defense of Iwo Jima would be fought almost entirely from underground. His men honeycombed the island with more than of tunnels, 5,000 caves, and pillboxes. According to his former Chief of Staff, Kuribayashi often told him, &quot;America&#x27;s productive powers are beyond our imagination. Japan has started a war with a formidable enemy and we must brace ourselves accordingly.&quot;

Kuribayashi recognized that he would not be able to hold Iwo Jima against the overwhelming military forces of the United States. He knew, however, that the loss of Iwo Jima would place all of Japan within range of American strategic bombers. Therefore, he planned a campaign of attrition, by which he hoped to delay the bombing of Japanese civilians and to force the United States Government to reconsider the possible invasion of Japanese home islands.

According to historian James Bradley, &quot;Americans have always taken casualties very seriously. When the number of casualties is too high, public opinion will boil up and condemn an operation as a failure, even if we get the upper hand militarily. Kuribayashi had lived in America. He knew our national character. That&#x27;s why he deliberately chose to fight in a way that would relentlessly drive up the number of casualties. I think he hoped American public opinion would shift toward wanting to bring the war with Japan to a rapid end.&quot;

Long before the Americans landed, however, Gen. Kuribayashi fully expected to die on Iwo Jima. On 5 September 1944, he wrote to his wife, &quot;It must be destiny that we as a family must face this. Please accept this and stand tall with the children at your side. I will be with you always.&quot;

The Japanese defenders include Private Takeo Abe, who survived the battle and spent the remainder of his life repatriating the remains of his comrades. Private Abe later recalled, &quot;By the end of 1944, we were forced to spare rations for battle and we foraged around for edible weeds. Suffering from chronic diarrhea, empty stomachs, and lack of water, we dug bunkers in the sand under a merciless sun and constructed underground shelters that were steamy with heat. We used salt water, lukewarm from a well on the beach, for cooking, and saved what little rainwater we could for drinking. But one water-bottle a day was the most we ever had to drink.&quot;

On 25 June 1944, Kuribayashi wrote to his family, &quot;There is no springwater here, so we must do with rainwater. I long for a glass of cold water, but nothing can be done. The number of flies and mosquitoes is appalling. There are no newspapers, no radios, and no shops. There are a few local farms, but no shelters suitable for anything other than livestock. Our soldiers pitch tents or crawl into caves. The caves are stuffy and the heat and humidity are intolerable. I, of course, endure similar living conditions... It is a living hell and I have never experienced anything remotely like it in my entire life.&quot;

In order to prepare his soldiers for an unconventional style of fighting, Kuribayashi composed six &quot;Courageous Battle Vows&quot; which were widely reproduced and distributed among his men. They read:
Kuribayashi also composed a set of instructions to the soldiers of the &quot;Courage Division.&quot; They read as follows:
===Battle of Iwo Jima===

On 19 February 1945, the United States Marine Corps landed its first men on the southern shore of the island. In a radically different approach, American officers and men were first allowed to land unmolested and then shelled and machine gunned from underground bunkers. As night fell, Marine Corps General Holland Smith studied reports aboard the command ship . He was especially stunned that Kuribayashi&#x27;s men had never attempted a banzai charge. Addressing a group of war correspondents, he quipped, &quot;I don&#x27;t know who he is, but the Japanese General running this show is one smart bastard.&quot;

According to military historian Shigetoki Hosoki, &quot;This writer was stunned to find the following comments in the &#x27;Iwo Jima Report,&#x27; a collection of memoirs by Iwo Jima survivors. &#x27;The men we saw weighed no more than thirty kilos and did not look human. Nonetheless, these emaciated soldiers who looked like they came from Mars faced the enemy with a force that could not be believed. I sensed a high morale.&#x27; Even under such circumstances, the underground shelters that the Japanese built proved advantageous for a while. Enemy mortar and bombing could not reach them ten meters under the ground. It was then that the Americans began to dig holes and poured yellow phosphorus gas into the ground. Their infantry was also burning its way through passages, slowly but surely, at the rate of ten meters per hour. A telegram has been preserved which says, &#x27;This is like killing cockroaches.&#x27; American troops made daily advances to the north. On the evening of 16 March, they reported that they had completely occupied the island of Iwo Jima.&quot;

Meanwhile, General Kuribayashi had herded the remnants of the Iwo Jima garrisons into a heavily fortified ravine which the Marine Corps dubbed, &quot;The Gorge.&quot; Major Yoshitaka Hori, who commanded the Chichi Jima radio station, later recalled, &quot;General Kuribayashi commanded his battle under candle light without a single rest or sleep, day after day. Radio broadcasts, newspapers, and magazines from Japan encouraged him thoroughly, especially when the old and young men, boys and girls of his native place prayed to God for his victory.&quot;

Marine Corps General Graves Erskine sent Japanese American Marines and captured Japanese soldiers to try to persuade Kuribayashi and his men to surrender. Meanwhile, Kuribayashi radioed to Major Hori, &quot;I have 400 men under my command. The enemy besieged us by firing and flame from their tanks. In particular, they are trying to approach the entrance of our cave with explosives. My men and officers are still fighting. The enemy&#x27;s front lines are 300 meters from us, and they are attacking by tank firing. They advised us to surrender by loudspeaker, but we only laughed at this childish trick, and we did not set ourselves against them.&quot;

On the evening of 23 March 1945, Kuribayashi radioed a last message to Major Hori, &quot;All officers and men of Chichi Jima – goodbye from Iwo.&quot; Major Hori later recalled, &quot;I tried to communicate with them for three days after that, but in the end I received no answer.&quot;

On 17 March 1945, the General had sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional death poems in &quot;waka&quot; form. All were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, &quot;a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.&quot;

General Kuribayashi had written, &quot;The battle is entering its final chapter. Since the enemy&#x27;s landing, the gallant fighting of the men under my command has been such that even the gods would weep. In particular, I humbly rejoice in the fact that they have continued to fight bravely though utterly empty-handed and ill-equipped against a land, sea, and air attack of a material superiority such as surpasses the imagination. One after another they are falling in the ceaseless and ferocious attacks of the enemy. For this reason, the situation has arisen whereby I must disappoint your expectations and yield this important place to the hands of the enemy. With humility and sincerity, I offer my repeated apologies. Our ammunition is gone and our water dried up. Now is the time for us to make the final counterattack and fight gallantly, conscious of the Emperor&#x27;s favor, not begrudging our efforts though they turn our bones to powder and pulverize our bodies. I believe that until the island is recaptured, the Emperor&#x27;s domain will be eternally insecure. I therefore swear that even when I have become a ghost I shall look forward to turning the defeat of the Imperial Army to victory. I stand now at the beginning of the end. At the same time as revealing my inmost feelings, I pray earnestly for the unfailing victory and security of the Empire. Farewell for all eternity.&quot;

He closed the message with three &quot;waka&quot; poems as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
:Unable to complete this heavy task for our country
Arrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.

:But unless I smite the enemy,
My body cannot rot in the field.
Yea, I shall be born again seven times
And grasp the sword in my hand.

:When ugly weeds cover this island,
My sole thought shall be the Imperial Land.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Death===

The exact circumstances of Kuribayashi&#x27;s death remain a mystery. It is most likely that he was killed in action in the early morning of 26 March 1945, while leading his surviving soldiers in a three-pronged assault against sleeping Marines and Air Force ground crews. Kuribayashi and his men silently slashed tents, bayoneted sleeping men, and lobbed hand grenades. According to the official &quot;United States Marine Corps History&quot;, &quot;The Japanese attack on the early morning of 26 March was not a banzai charge, but an excellent plan aiming to cause maximum confusion and destruction.&quot; The assault climaxed in a hand-to-hand battle to the death between the men of both armies. The General&#x27;s body could not be identified afterwards for he had removed all officer&#x27;s insignia in order to fight as a regular soldier.

According to less credible theories, Kuribayashi is alleged to have committed seppuku at his headquarters in the Gorge.

The General&#x27;s son, Taro Kuribayashi, interviewed several survivors of the Japanese garrison after the war. As a result, he believes that his father was killed in an artillery barrage during the final assault.

According to Taro Kuribayashi, &quot;My father had believed it shameful to have his body discovered by the enemy even after death, so he had previously asked his two soldiers to come along with him, one in front and the other behind, with a shovel in hand. In case of his death, he had wanted them to bury his body there and then. It seems that my father and the soldiers were killed by shells, and he was buried at the foot of a tree in Chidori village, along the beach near Osaka mountain. Afterwards, General Smith spent a whole day looking for his body to pay respect accordingly and to perform a burial, but in vain.&quot;

==Legacy==

The US declared Iwo Jima secure on 26 March 1945, after suffering 26,039 casualties. Only 1,083 of the 22,786 Japanese defenders survived to be captured. A small number of holdouts continued to remain at large, leaving their fortified caves at night in order to steal food from the American garrison. The last two holdouts, Naval machine gunners Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, surrendered on 6 January 1949.

Yoshii Kuribayashi was only 40 years old when her husband died on Iwo Jima, and she subsequently worked hard to bring up their children without a father. According to their daughter Takako Kuribayashi, &quot;My mother had been brought up as a lady, and even after getting married she had been taken care of by my father. She had never worked in her life before, but she still managed to raise us during the terrible years after the war by doing things like selling cuttlefish out on the street. And more than that, she sent not just my elder brother, but me, a girl, to university.&quot;

In 1970 during the lead up to a reunion of Japanese and American veterans of the battle to be held on Iwo Jima Yoshii Kuribayashi represented Japanese families of war dead at a luncheon in Tokyo with American veterans. In a speech she thanked them for their expressions of friendship and received a standing ovation. She would later attend both the 1985 and 1995 Reunions of Honor hosted on the island. 

According to Derrick Wright, &quot;The name of Gen. Kuribayashi has been accorded a place of honor in postwar Japanese history, alongside that other outstanding commander Adm. Yamamoto. In his autobiography, &quot;Coral and Brass&quot;, Lt.-Gen. Holland &#x27;Howling Mad&#x27; Smith paid him one of his highest tributes: &#x27;Of all our adversaries in the Pacific, Kuribayashi was the most redoubtable.&#x27;&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kuribayashi married Yoshii Kuribayashi (1904–2003) on 8 December 1923. Together they had a son and two daughters (Taro, Yoko and Takako).

==In popular culture==
Kuribayashi became known to an international audience after being portrayed onscreen in the film &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;. According to screenwriter Iris Yamashita, &quot;Ultimately, I felt that the many nuances of Tadamichi Kuribayashi came to life onscreen under Clint Eastwood&#x27;s masterful direction and actor Ken Watanabe&#x27;s deft portrayal, expressing the perfect sense of the balance of the gentleness and warmth of the family man, combined with the strength, practicality and regality of the commanding officer.&quot;

<doc id="589464" wikidata="Q266270" url="?curid=589464" title="Yaphet Kotto">
<text>Yaphet Frederick Kotto (November 15, 1939 – March 15, 2021) was an American actor for film and television. His films include the science-fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), the neo-noir action thriller &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; (1972), the science-fiction action film &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) in which he portrayed the main villain Dr. Kananga, and the action comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988). He also starred in the NBC television series &quot;&quot; (1993–1999) as Lieutenant Al Giardello.

==Early life==
Kotto was born in New York City. His mother, Gladys Marie, was an American nurse and U.S. Army officer of Panamanian and West Indian descent. His father, Avraham Kotto (who was, according to his son, originally named Njoki Manga Bell), was a businessman from Cameroon who emigrated to the United States in the 1920s. Kotto&#x27;s father was raised Jewish and his mother converted to Judaism. The couple separated when Kotto was a child, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents.

By the age of 16, Kotto was studying acting at the Actors Mobile Theater Studio.

==Career==
At age 19, Yaphet Kotto made his professional acting debut in &quot;Othello&quot;. He was a member of the Actors Studio in New York. Kotto got his start in acting on Broadway, where he appeared in &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;, among other productions.

His film debut was in 1963, aged 23, in an uncredited role in &quot;4 for Texas&quot;. He performed in Michael Roemer&#x27;s &quot;Nothing but a Man&quot; (1964) and played a supporting role in the caper film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968). He played John Auston, a confused Marine Lance Corporal, in the 1968 episode &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, on the first season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

In 1967, he released a single, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Blues&quot; / &quot;Have You Dug His Scene&quot; (Chisa Records, CH006).

In 1973, he landed the role of the James Bond villain Mr. Big in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, as well as roles in &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; and &quot;Truck Turner&quot;. He played a police officer, Richard &quot;Crunch&quot; Blackstone, in the 1975 film &quot;Report to the Commissioner&quot;. Kotto portrayed Idi Amin in the 1977 television film &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot;. He starred as an auto worker in the 1978 film &quot;Blue Collar&quot;. The following year he played Parker in the sci-fi–horror film &quot;Alien&quot;. He followed with a supporting role in the 1980 prison drama &quot;Brubaker&quot;. In 1983, he guest-starred as mobster Charlie &quot;East Side Charlie&quot; Struthers in &quot;The A-Team&quot; episode &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;. In 1987, he appeared in the futuristic sci-fi movie &quot;The Running Man&quot;, and in 1988, in the action-comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, in which he portrayed Alonzo Moseley, an FBI agent. A memo from Paramount indicates that Kotto was among those being considered for Jean-Luc Picard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, a role which eventually went to Patrick Stewart.
Kotto was cast as a religious man living in the southwestern desert country in the 1967 episode &quot;A Man Called Abraham&quot; on the syndicated anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Abraham convinces a killer named Cassidy (Rayford Barnes) that Cassidy can change his heart despite past crimes. When Cassidy is sent to the gallows, Abraham provides spiritual solace. Bing Russell also appeared in this segment.

Kotto retired from film acting in the mid-1990s, though he had one final film role in &quot;Witless Protection&quot; (2008). However, he continued to take on television roles. Kotto portrayed Lieutenant Al Giardello in the long-running television series &quot;&quot;. As a black Sicilian proud of his Italian ancestry, the character was a breakout for television. He has written the book &quot;Royalty&quot; and also wrote scripts for &quot;Homicide&quot;. In 2014, he voiced Parker for the video game &quot;&quot;, reprising the role he played in the movie &quot;Alien&quot; in 1979.

==Personal life==
Kotto&#x27;s first marriage was to a German immigrant, Rita Ingrid Dittman, whom he married in 1959. They had three children together before divorcing in 1976. Later, Kotto married Toni Pettyjohn, and they also had three children together, before divorcing in 1989. Kotto married his third wife, Tessie Sinahon, who is from the Philippines, in 1998.

Kotto was versed in the Hebrew liturgy and incorporated Jewish prayers at turning points throughout his life. He said his father &quot;instilled Judaism&quot; in him.

Kotto supported Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. He also expressed support for Black Lives Matter and shared content adjacent to the beliefs of QAnon.

In 2000, he was living in Marmora, Ontario, Canada.

===Death===
Kotto died at the age of 81 on March 15, 2021, near Manila, Philippines. His wife announced the news on Facebook.

<doc id="589465" wikidata="Q1348618" url="?curid=589465" title="Lamon Brewster">
<text>Lamon Tajuan Brewster (born June 5, 1973) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2010. He held the World Boxing Organization (WBO) heavyweight title from 2004 to 2006, and is best known for scoring an upset knockout victory over Wladimir Klitschko to win the vacant title. Brewster was ranked by BoxRec as the world&#x27;s eighth best active heavyweight at the conclusion of 2004.

As an amateur, he won the U.S. national championships in 1995, and a silver medal at that year&#x27;s Pan American Games, both in the heavyweight division. Following his retirement from the sport in 2011, Brewster became an entrepreneur and founded a consulting business.

==Amateur career==
Brewster won the 1995 U.S. national amateur championship as a heavyweight. Additional highlights include:

* 1995 2nd place at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Results were:
**Defeated Moises Rolon (Puerto Rico) PTS
**Lost to Félix Savón (Cuba) RSCH-2
*Brewster failed to qualify for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics after he lost to Nate Jones and DaVarryl Williamson in the trials.

==Professional career==

=== 1996–2003: Prospect to contender===

Brewster turned professional in 1996 and was undefeated for his first three years as a pro until losing decisions to Clifford Etienne and Charles Shufford in 2000.

===2004–2005: WBO heavyweight champion and title defenses===

On April 10, 2004, Brewster faced Wladimir Klitschko in a fight for the vacant World Boxing Organization championship that had been vacated by Corrie Sanders, who had upset Klitschko by knocking him out in the second round of their fight in 2003, when he decided to challenge Vitali Klitschko for the World Boxing Council title vacated when Lennox Lewis retired.

Brewster was dominated in the early going, knocked down once in the fourth round. In the fifth round, Brewster hurt Klitschko with a left hook that forced the Ukrainian fighter to use the ropes to hold himself up, which resulted in a knockdown. As the round ended, Brewster hit Klitschko with a combination of punches that caused him to go down after the bell sounded. Seeing Klitschko struggle to return to his feet, referee Robert Byrd stopped the fight and awarded a technical knockout victory to Brewster. Klitschko claimed foul play resulted in his defeat but an investigation found nothing.

For eleven years, Brewster remained the last boxer to defeat Klitschko in the ring, until Tyson Fury defeated Klitschko in a 2015 heavyweight fight. Brewster remains the second last boxer to knock Klitschko out in a bout, preceding Anthony Joshua, who won by TKO on the 11th round defeating Wladimir Klitschko on 30 April 2017.

===2006–2007: Brewster vs. Liakhovich and Klitschko II===

Brewster lost his WBO title by unanimous decision on April 1, 2006 to Sergei Liakhovich from Belarus in an action-packed fight. In an interview following the fight, Brewster said that he could not see with his left eye after the first round. It was later confirmed that he had suffered a detached retina in his left eye and he had to undergo surgery.

Lamon Brewster returned to the ring on July 7, 2007, losing his rematch against Wladimir Klitschko after trainer Buddy McGirt stopped the fight after the sixth round. The fight took place in Köln (Cologne), Germany, for the IBF &amp; IBO heavyweight title.

===2008–2010: Tail end of career===
After two tune-up bouts, he was upset by Gbenga Oloukun by an eight-round points decision. The following year he was stopped by rising contender Robert Helenius.
At one point in his career, Brewster was managed by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; co-creator, professional poker player and philanthropist, Sam Simon. Later Brewster left Simon and signed with manager Al Haymon.

===Retirement===
On January 9, 2011, Lamon Brewster officially announced his retirement as a professional boxer. Brewster cited an eye injury from his last fight with Helenius as the reason for this retirement. Further, he indicated that he believes that Helenius tampered with his gloves which caused the resulting injury to Brewster. He underwent four unsuccessful surgeries to restore sight in his left eye. After further surgery, his vision began to improve.

==Personal life==
In 1995 he was divorced from actress Tichina Arnold (of &quot;Martin&quot; and &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; fame). 

Brewster also has one older daughter from a previous relationship.
Brewster married his current wife &quot;Juana&quot; Brewster in October 2000, and together they have two daughters and a son. 

He is also the cousin of former IBF and WBO heavyweight champion Chris Byrd. Brewster has made several television appearances as well as public service announcements through his career.

===Entrepreneurship===
Brewster founded &quot;Fighting Connection Consulting&quot; in July 2011 providing expertise to professional fighters on training methods, psychology, nutrition, conditioning, team building, and publicity.
